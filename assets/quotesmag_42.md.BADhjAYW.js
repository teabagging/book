But he was not a Christian, who have always believed Jesus was literally the Son of God. For honest scholars who seek the truth,I suggest The Complete Works of Josephus, the works of Flavius Josephus,(c. a.d.37-100) author of at least 27 books of history. Translated by William Whiston (1667-1752)who was a mathmatician and church historian, and who succeeded Sir Isaac Newton as Lucasian professor of mathmatics at the University of Cambridge.All who read Josephus will learn more about the subject of Jesus than Gibran could have written in a dozen lives."},{"Title":"Jesus the Son of man: His words and His deeds as told and recorded by those who knew Him","review":"This book was incredible. I am getting it for gifts for family. I find it amazing that he wrote this in the time period he did. It's very prophetic, it seems to be in line with a more modern understanding of Jesus that readers of The Course in Miracles and Marianne Williamson are a large part of vocalizing. But even fundamentalists would enjoy this book, if they were not so threatened by opposing opinions which this book is, being how it is written from the opinion of @80 different points of view, many of which do proclaim him the Son of God. Ultimately, any view can be thoughtfully stimulating because the people of any opinion have personalities and background given that support why they view Jesus with their perspective. The overall impression I received from this beautiful prose is the beauty and message of Jesus, the devotion, admiration, gratitude and love inspired by him, and the grace which he exuded with confident compassion. And whether he was God, man, a combination of both that we all are potentially, or a combination we can only idolize with an envious self-debasing distorted form of humility, this book shows him to be nothing less than relevant to our comprehension."},{"Title":"Jesus the Son of man: His words and His deeds as told and recorded by those who knew Him","review":"Through his book, Gibran suceeds in providing a truly unique and totally believable perspective of Jesus &quot;the man&quot;, through the eyes and emotions of those who knew, loved and betrayed him during his ministry on earth. Like the broadway play &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot;, this perspective is at times divergent from the more traditional Biblical personna of Jesus. But therein lies the charm and intrigue of this book.The story consists of a series of short chapters, each offering a vision of this man-God by individuals who would have observed him conducting various aspects of his public and private life. Each story is a gem in and of itself that leaves the reader pondering their own relationship with &quot;The Son of Man&quot; and the impact his short life on earth must have had for those who lived within the region of Jesus's ministry.This is a book that should be on the shelf of every introspective seeker of truth and inner peace, regardless of one's particular religion."},{"Title":"Jesus the Son of man: His words and His deeds as told and recorded by those who knew Him","review":"Gibran has masterfully rendered, through vignettes, the impact Christ had on the many people he touched during his life on earth.

It would be best to only read this book if you have already read the New Testament. In this way you will know what Jesus actually said and what Kahlil Gibran made up in a poetic fashion. I did enjoy this book as it made Jesus even seem more beautiful to me. Kahlil Gibran really does capture the essence of Jesus' teachings. He also really had a gift for telling the reader what they wanted to hear. Most of the accounts in this book are positive but a few are negative. Some of the people discussed really lived and interacted with Jesus and others seem born of fantasy. Some of the details are a little incorrect like Jesus was actually born in Bethlehem not Nazareth. I think you will enjoy this book because it is very poetic and it leaves you comforted and in a state of peace and joy.~The Rebecca Review"},{"Title":"Jesus the Son of man: His words and His deeds as told and recorded by those who knew Him","review":"This quote is from Wikipedia - Thompson reported Gibran later saying that all the way through writing \\"Jesus, the Son of Man\\", he thought of \`Abdu'l-Bah&aacute;.

Anderson, you were wrong. Majorly, majorly wrong.Force Heretic III is a book without purpose, plot, or character.The Solo-Skywalker clan is still split up, with Luke, Mara, and Jacen out in the Unknown Regions, searching for a planet that they believe can end the war with the Yuuzhan Vong- though they have no clue how. Suffice to say that Vergere, the Old Republic Jedi teacher of the irritating and insufferable Jacen, told him about it.Leia, Han, Jaina, and Jag (along with Twin Suns Squadron) are still on their pointless journey through...comm black-spots? The Force Heretic series is such that by the third book, I'm really not quite sure what any of them are supposed to be doing by now.Tahiri, the Jeedai-who-was-shaped, is still struggling with her Yuuzhan Vong alter ego, Riina Kwaad. WHY exactly Riina has just now shown up is explained, albeit weakly. Riina/Tahiri's new peace with herself (which occurs after many pointless mental arguments) is over-exaggerated, with the reader being reminded constantly of it throughout the book after it finally occurs. Another point to me that seems confusing is that after her new \\"mental-melding\\" Tahir keeps the name, \\"Tahiri.\\" I find it rather hard to believe that a Yuuzhan Vong like Riina would allow her name to be so easily cast aside in favor of the infidel Jeedai's.Of course, all of Tahiri's, and Jaina's(who is constantly fainting and being wounded), and Jag's and Leia's and Han's exploits are like the work of Zahn when compared to the Barbara Hambly-like stupidity of Jacen and co. on Zonama Sekot.Personally, I feel that Zonama Sekot should NOT have taken up three whole book of the series, especially as we still have NO CLUE of what the heck its purpose is (if it has one at all). And the constant praising of Jacen Solo (whom I hate), of how smart he is, and how moral, and Danni throwing herself all over him has not helped one bit. Luke as a Jedi Master is esentially ignored in favor of this hermit-wannabe and Mara is made out to be nothing more than a grumpy red-head lacking the brains to make sense of the \\"brilliant\\" plans Jacen comes up with. Which, when you think about it, to NOT be able to figure out Jacen's plans doesn't indicate a lack of a brain so much as the existence of one.I'm rambling, I know, but this book was so impotently infuriating in its sheer idiocy and pointlessness that I'm really at a loss for sensible words. All in all, a stupid book, one you really don't need to waste your time on, especially if you're a fan of Luke and Mara as I am, since they are so grossly IGNORED in this book. Simply know that Zonama Sekot is found, Leia and company are called back to Mon Cal, and Jag has not yet proposed to Jaina, and move onto the next book in the series, The Final Prophecy by Greg Keyes, who, despite the vomit-inducing cover of the book, is a GREAT author. He wrote Ben's birth and Anakin and Tahiri's Yuuzhan Vong exploits, didn't he?"},{"Title":"Reunion.

That to me was the most annoying part.And I personally didn't care for the authors syle of writing. I prefere chapers as opposed to lenthly sections. And I have never been so frustrated in a book as this one. About half way through the book, he (the author) would write a few paragraphs of what is going on with these people get it all good and then jump to a totally different story line with different people. I don't mind that so much if you space it out some, but &quot;blah blah JUMP!, blah JUMP, blah JUMP, bl__ JUMP! I was going nuts. You have to read the first few maby one inbetween and last few pages out of 40 or so to find out what happend to anybody. Heaven forbid you do a entire story about what happend to this person at this time and then go on to another person/story. Very frustratingLike I said in my title, thank goodness this series is over; worst 3 books in NJO."},{"Title":"Reunion. Sean Williams and Shane Dix (Star Wars New Jedi Order) (v. 3)","review":"This is the 17th Book in the The New Jedi Order saga, or 19th if you count the 2 e-book only stories. Only two more books to go.The third and last book in this story by Sean Williams and Shane Dix, is the more entertaining of the three books, but that's not too hard to achieve. And don't get me wrong, there's plenty, I mean, lots of cinematic action around... but most of it makes little sense.The book continues with the 3 stories of the last two books: the search for the living-planet Zonama Sekot by Luke and Mara Jade Skywalker, Jacen Solo, Saba Sebatyne, Tekli, Danni Quee and the group of the Imperial Remnant helping them.Guess what? They finally found it. I have to repeat my recommendation to read another SW book, not part of the New Jedi Order: &quot;Star Wars: Rogue Planet&quot; by Greg Bear ... It's not very good, but you can understand the importance of Zonama Sekot, the interaction with the Jedi Vergere and Anakin Skywalker role in the history of this planet. If you think this idea of a sentient planet, I'll have to refer you to Marvel Comics, where &quot;Ego, The Living Planet&quot; has been around for some decades. Crazy, I know. I'm sure there must be a prior work in the SciFi literature somewhere.The best part of this story (and maybe the book) must be the narration of Zonama's flora and fauna. You can get to imagine this wonderful world, full of life and the Force. The problem with this part is all the secondary story, this rebel group in Zonama, and the decisions of Jacen Solo. It's really exasperating. It's almost as if Jacen is returned to his pre-Vergere thinking. And it's not fully explained (or at least satisfactory) the decision Luke makes. Finally, the story ends very weak, you can see Zenoama Sekot endured a lot of problems when it was travelling around the galaxy, but now the Ferroans have some technology which will prevent that of happening again, if there's going to be another &quot;tour&quot;. Yeah, right. And then there's this news bulletin Luke gives to his sister in an insecure comm channel, when just some lines before Leia was making that evident to another person. You would think you'd like to be sure there are no information leaks.Another storyline is the one with Nom Anor and his rebellion among the Shamed Ones, which leads to nowhere. We continue to see Shimrra, and the Yuuzhan Vong finally appeared, but as another reviewer said, the Yuuzhan Vong are being dumbed down, they are not that formidable force we have seen in the first 14 books. And it's not that they have changed for the worst, it's only part of the storyline plan, I guess. There's no way the editor(s) could allow this very different (bad?) representation.The other storyline is about the party from the Galactic Federation of Free-Alliances formed by Han and Leia Organa Solo, Jaina, Jag Fel, etc. There's a lot of action here, but also, many holes in the story, or not fully explained things, or things handled with a degree of levity. There's one part of the story where you see both warring parts are expecting something to happen in the surface below, and you can't see clearly why one side of it want's so badly to be there. &quot;Don't worry&quot;, it's &quot;explained&quot; at the beginning of the epilogue. It doesn't make much sense, really.Now, this is the book from the three-part &quot;Force Heretic&quot; that I read quicker and maybe I enjoyed most, but it must be beacause I already invested in the previous two books.This is the weakest books of all the New Jedi Order series, and it's a shame they dedicated three books to it. The last two books must be a great deal better than these last three to leave a good taste to the entire series. I really hope so."},{"Title":"Reunion. Sean Williams and Shane Dix (Star Wars New Jedi Order) (v. 3)","review":"As we wind our way towards the end of the New Jedi order there seem to be few surprises as to how we are going to wrap it up. The end has been well telegraphed, it is only a question of the mechanics.Just as this trilogy ends, no mystery, no danger, no surprises in this book. It isn't a bad book, but I think the first two were better. The Tahiri solution was obviously coming and well foreshadowed so I'm sure everyone knew it. Zonoma Sekot turned out to be rather, well, dull and Han &amp; Leia win another space battle. I love space battles, I loved the X-Wing series, here though the battles are becoming routine. Like the war torn galaxy and the decimated Vong the series is running out of steam.The mechanics of the book are fairly well done, the various threads, The Zonoma Sekot search, Nom Anor's heresy, Tahiri's struggle and the Empire/New Republic alliance battling together are woven together well. Perhaps a bit too much jumping between threads at the start but all together fairly well done. Not much character development takes place other than Tahiri, everyone seems to have matured into their final forms as we round the last turn and head into the final straight-away.If you're a Star Wars fan, pick it up, it isn't bad, it's just &quot;Another New Jedi Order Book&quot; ANJOB."},{"Title":"Reunion. Sean Williams and Shane Dix (Star Wars New Jedi Order) (v. 3)","review":"Well, having forced myself through the atrocities that were the first two books in this trilogy, I had to keep up to date with the storyline for the following New Jedi Order books. This book alone should have been the output for these two authors, as it was the only one worth reading, and was not great to begin with.First, the Nom Anor storyline basically went nowhere. There is nothing achieved, nothing resolved, and it ends basically where it began. The entire plot should have been omitted from this set of three books. It would have been better to have a single book focused on that, like the Jacen story of Traitor. Not this mish-mash jump-around format.Second, the Han-Leia-Jaina-Jag-Tahiri plot also went about nowhere. Tahiri has the only growth among them, with the others essentially unchanged from their molds before these two had their go at Star Wars. Again, the writing was very youth-oriented, in my opinion, seeming to rely upon those things that kids would interpret as romantic or symbolic of great love, when in fact they are not. The resolution of the Tahiri story also could have been achieved in about ten pages, instead of taking three books. At least Pellaeon and the Empire do some good. There should be more focus on good characters like him, as there is a great deal of exploration that could be done regarding the Imperial contribution to the war effort.Third, at least Luke, Mara, Jacen, Saba, et al., managed to accomplish something. They located the Rogue Planet, and there is some action on that planet. You can definitely tell that the same guys wrote these three books, since the conflicts in them are all the same formula: Land on planet, get attacked for no reason by people you do not know, reason with them instead of taking them down, find out they were not responsible for their actions, hug. It is insulting.And the book's end was so touchy-feely that I was revolted. While I can say that they wrapped everything up, I also have to say that nothing really changed! Thus nothing needed to be packaged at the end! I really hope that the next SW:NJO book is plotted and written better (and edited, too, for while this one was less populated with typoes and grammar errors than the first two, it still had WAY too many for my money -- hire a proofreader, dangit!), else I am done with this shared universe."},{"Title":"Reunion. Sean Williams and Shane Dix (Star Wars New Jedi Order) (v. 3)","review":"This is a very mediocre novel, that finally wraps up the disappointing Force Heretic trilogy of the NJO. If anything, now that it is FINALLY over, I have an additional complaint, this one about the totally misleading name. \\"Force Heretic\\" really implied a storyline about Jacen Solo, exploring Vergere's controversial claims about the dark side or expanding his understanding to include the Vong. As it stands, it would appear that the title is probably referring to Nom Anor's herecy - \\"probably\\" because this was such a very minor facet of this story, I am still not sure.Back to this particular book: Like the two before it, it contains mostly filler, no surpises, a very predictable storyline and a large number of errors/misrepresentations/inconsistencies.There are three storylines:a) The Luke/Mara/Zonama-Sekot one, the only one of any realrelevence to anything, simply reaches its predictable happy ending. No real twists, no new characters, not even some reasonably heroic actionsb) The Han/Leia/Jaina/Tahiri one is just filler, and badly written filler at that. The battles with the Vong are the worst, making very little sense, violating the laws of both physics and the Star Wars universe, as well as basic military principles.c) The Nom Anor storyline, which really held the most promise in the begining goes absolutely nowhere.If you simply read the summary on the back of any of the three books, or the one on Amazon, you will not need to actually read these novels. After more than 1,000 pages, we met no new characters, developed a secondary character (Tahiri) a very little bit and failed to surprise the reader once. Two stars is probably too much for this one."},{"Title":"Reunion.

Incomplete thoughts and jumping from sub plot to subplot while failing to engage the reader this inept writing team continues bore us and take us in circles enticing us with the promise of adventure, strong characters and distant worlds yet we only receive a round trip to nowhere."},{"Title":"Reunion. Sean Williams and Shane Dix (Star Wars New Jedi Order) (v. 3)","review":"I hate to say it but I'm glad this long storyline is coming to an end. Unless something earthshattering and shocking happens in the last two books I wont be sorry to see this series finish. I use to think the opposite especially after reading books 1,2,3,5,9,10,11,12, 13,14, and 16 but this latest entry has really soured my enthusiasm. It started out great the storyline really pulling me in but as it progressed it bogged down into more Jedi sudo-philosophy and other such tiresome nonsense. i thought book 6 and 13 had dealt with all that but as soon as the heroes landed on Sekot all action died down. Yes there was action later on with the battle at the communications outpost but I wasn't holding my breath for any surprises to happen; turned out I was right. I mean, how predictable. Then we got this talking planet of all things. Biotechnology is one thing, a living breathing entire planet is another. This is not Lord of the Rings or some fantasy series. Of course a devoted fan like myself can see how the series will eventually end though like I said before that I hope at the very least there will be a great battle with losses on both sides. Another problem is Jason Solo. I thought he had resolved his personal dilemmas in books 6, 13, and 14. Apparently now he's back to being a pathetic pacifist. By the way, what gives some teen age yahoo Jedi the right to make such momentous decisions? Sorry, its too unbelievable and I hope to the dark side he is snuffed out in the last two books. He is a character i can't stand. Then there is Tahiri; it took 10 books for her little plot to finally come to and end. I mean after all, she got shaped by the Vong in book 7; Give me a break! Is it because she is a female Jedi that we can't kill her off? I would have rather seen her betray the Galactic Alliance then the Vong. Speaking of which the last two books could kill of over half the new characters introduced in this series and I am sure the fans wouldn't mind. In addition this book was just too one sided. The folks who created this excellent series I guess decided to start dumbing the enemy to death so he can easily be killed off by book 19. An overused and well worn out device in the SW books. It would have been best to seriously study the X-Wing series to see how one can cleverly defeat an enemy without dumbing him or her to death. Thus there would not be the need to rely on talking planets and other such malarkey. Finally, what's up with this need to pair off everybody? Must SW books constantly portray that there is only one proper lifestyle to lead? Can't we have a few single Jedi; or even a gay one? People who read these books come from a variety of backgrounds and family situations; lets give other folk some time as well. Maybe that's a bit too radical but I can't help but see a trend in these books. So certainly not one of the best entries but exciting overall. Its SW after all. As a quick revision I rated this trilogy thus,Book 1, 4 stars, book 2 5 stars and book 3 3 stars. Lets see if my enthusiasm will be restored with book 18, The Final Prophecy. the title sounds good at any rate."},{"Title":"Reunion. Sean Williams and Shane Dix (Star Wars New Jedi Order) (v. 3)","review":"Let me preface this by saying I'm a huge SW fan. I've read all the books, and played the games.This last Triology, to me, emphasizes all the things that are going wrong with the SW paperbacks. The stories are degrading into a chain of chance encounters, conveniant rendevous, and bumbling badguys.Worse, the books are getting longer, and the stories they tell are getting more boring, mundane, and pointless. I expected something *SPOILER ALERT* to come out of the whole Zonama Sekot search. Maybe a battle or an explanation of how at least the planet will help the new alliance. No, rather, a whole triology on a boring search with nothing to show for it except, &quot;Hey look, we found the planet, cool.&quot; It's like the authors are taking very scant ideas, stretching them out as far as they can go, and then handing them off to the next author or triology to deliver the climax. Problem is, the last 6 or so books in the VV wars have delivered nothing in the way of excitement. This Triology was one of the worst.It's getting so bad, they could knock off Han, or Leia or (hopefully) Tahiri, and no one, at least not me, would care much.It's sad when you love a universe for 25 years and it comes to this, not caring what happens to the main characters anymore.If you want a series where the characters truly get to you, and you tear up when they die, try Weber's Honor Harrington series.

Sean Williams and Shane Dix (Star Wars New Jedi Order) (v. 3)","review":"And so the utterly unnecessary Force Heretic trilogy comes to a close. Reunion, which also serves as the 17th installment in the massive New Jedi Order series, brings this little detour from the larger Yuuzhan Vong conflict to a close. Writers Shane Dix and Sean Williams accomplish in three books what should have taken a single volume - namely the unification of the two personalities in Tahiri's head, and the decision by the living planet Zonama Sekot to join the struggle against the Yuuzhan Vong invaders.I hate to badmouth the authors, but this series just didn't seem necessary to the larger New Jedi Order saga. Yes, the Zonama Sekot storyline was important, but after three books we still haven't been told just what it is that the planet is bringing to the equation. The Tahiri reconciliation was a long overdue development, but to be fair we are talking about a supporting character here. She's not exactly Jaina Solo. And speaking of the Solos, I found it amusing that the authors would have the Galactic Alliance Chief of State realize at the end of Reunion what most readers should have known from the beginning - restoring communications with backwater planets is not the job for a former Chief of State (Leia), a former General (Han), a Jedi/fighter squadron commander (Jaina), and a hotshot pilot (Jag Fel). Talk about overkill!We're nearing the end of the New Jedi Order series, and this little \\"series within a series\\" just felt like they were dragging it out. As I mentioned earlier, the major developments of the Force Heretic trilogy could easily have been condensed into a single, and far less frustrating, single volume."},{"Title":"Reunion. Sean Williams and Shane Dix (Star Wars New Jedi Order) (v. 3)","review":"I love the NJO series. But this trilogy was really one of the weakest parts of the entire series. In it's defense, Reunion would actually rate much higher with me if it wasn't for the first two Force Heretic books. I was extremely satisfied with this book especially after a disappointing beginning to the trilogy.The interactions between Luke and Jacen with Sekot are the highlight of the book along with Tahiri's merging of her two personalities. And Nom Anor is great as always. Plus, the retun of Droma teaming up with Han again was good to see. It just took too long to get to the good stuff of the 3rd novel. This should have been done as one novel with all the filler crap made more brief.This is a great series so you have to read all three books. It could have been better, though."},{"Title":"Reunion. Sean Williams and Shane Dix (Star Wars New Jedi Order) (v. 3)","review":"Overall this series has been a bit of a dissappointment. After beginning so strongly with Force Heretic I, the next two books failed to live up to my expectations. Force Heretic III does rebound from the rather predictable middle volume in this trilogy. As with the other two books, this book reads very quickly, the action is fast paced and exciting. Yet the story is too predictable. The biggest downside was the discovery of Sekot, and mythical planet that seemed to have been found with a minimum amount of work by Luke and his crew. The seens with Sekot also failed to live up to expectations. In contrast, the scenes with Han, Leia and Jaina more than made up for the deficiencies of the Sekot crew. Their portion of the story was fast paced and very enjoyable and it is from this part of the story that I give this book a 4 star rating. The NJO writers also need to decided what they are going to do with Danni Quee, she just seems to float around without any development or point to her existance. The Tahiri problem seems to have been solved and I am really looking forward to the next book in the series, for it deals with her. One question I do have is this: Who was the Force Heretic? Nothing any of the Jedi did seemed all that out of the ordinary for Jedi. The title of the series really did not make sense. Overall this series gets a 3.5 across the board. The excellence of the first book almost makes up for the problems of the next two. Really this book deserves 2.5 stars but as that is not allowed I'll give it 3."},{"Title":"Reunion. Sean Williams and Shane Dix (Star Wars New Jedi Order) (v. 3)","review":"I liked this book especially the scenes where Tahiri and Riina connect with each other, which I felt could of been explained better. But my major problem with this book was that Jacen's charater was more like his charater in BALENCE POINT then his charater in TRAITOR. I mean his personality was really developed in TRAITOR into a character you could really respect and admire as a Jedi who was willing to use violence to protect the ones he loves. In this book, however, it was as though he will sacrifice everything he could to avoid violence of any form no matter the cost. This doesn't stand with what we know of his charater growth. It just doesn't make sense! All in all, I felt it was a step backwards for his charater, and it would not have affected the overall feel of the book if his charater was the other way. Plus, I thought that his romance with Danni could have been more realized than it was. On a happier note, I liked how Jag and Jaina's romance is shaping. That was another one of my favorite aspects of this book. It was a good book but not the best STAR WARS book I've ever read. My advice to anyone who likes STAR WARS books is to read this book even though they might not quite like it because the STAR WARS info. in this book is important to later books. All info. in filler books are! Really!!"},{"Title":"Reunion. Sean Williams and Shane Dix (Star Wars New Jedi Order) (v. 3)","review":"After the disappointment of the last book, &quot;Reunion&quot; is a good, if predictable, end to the Force Heretic Trilogy. Once again, three story lines run together. Luke, Mara, Jacen and the rest of their crew reach Zonama Sekot and spend most of the novel not doing much. There's a kidnapping that finally leads to a conversation with the planet and its decision wheather or not to come back. It's not that exciting but it serves its purpose and sets up for the conclusion to the NJO series.All of the action takes place with Han, Leia, and Jaina as they stumble upon a Vong attack on a communications station by the same force that attacked the Empire. Not supriseingly, Palleon is already there and this is the first time the Galactic Alliance and the Empire officially work together, which makes for some interesting conversations. It also marks the return of Dorma, the best new character in the NJO series. Sure, it's obvious he's a replacement for Chewie, but the interaction between him and Han make for the funniest parts in the entire series. During this time we see the conclusion of Tahiri's story, and the new character that is created is integral to the conclusion of the novel.Finally we have the Nom Anor story, which was never that interesting for me and this time it's way too predictable when one of his co-conspirators is unmasked. Still, I feel it is the feelings Nom Anor is stirring up that will ultimetly lead to the downfall of the Vong. It is in these feelings Jacen will find the peaceful solution he is looking for to defeat the Vong.Overall, the book was a vast improvement over &quot;Refugee&quot;, even though the action was a bit lagging. It gets a little disconcerting jumping between all the characters in all the storylines but it makes for a fast pace that overcomes the slow parts. The main problem is with the summary on the back, which does not describe what the book is about. Whoever wrote it should be fired. There is no &quot;definat message&quot;, at least not from the planet. There's no &quot;full-scale attack&quot; launched, just the Vong taking advantage of attacking an undefended base. And Han and Leia aren't &quot;sent&quot;, they just show up during the attack. The entire summary gives the wrong impression and I wondered how the editors could let something so important be so incorrect. But no harm done and with the series coming to a conclusion in November, it's going to seem like a very long wait."},{"Title":"Reunion. Sean Williams and Shane Dix (Star Wars New Jedi Order) (v. 3)","review":"Reuinion overall was a very enertaining book that moved the New Jedi Order storyline in many new directions. The action on the ground on Esfandia was great. It was awesome to see speeder bikes be a major part of the story. The scenes with Jaina, Tahiri, Jag, and Droma were pretty awesome. It seems that Jaina is the action star of the series as of late, with the absence of Anakin Solo. While it was pretty much a good book, it lacked some things and was disappointing in places. First of all, Zonama Sekot is not what I thought it would be. Well, I knew it would be green and have lots of plants but, it didn't seem all that powerful and I think it could have been described better. Secondly, the lack of romance upset me. Yes, Jag does reveal his feelings for Jaina, but they don't even kiss once throughout the novel. Also I was hoping for a romantic scene between Jacen and Danni. I would always grow hopeful in the scenes with these two but then something would happen and Jacen would have to run off. There wasn't really even romance between the older couples either. Han and Leia seemed to bicker the whole time and Luke and Mara seemed to always be around Dr. Hegerty. Another bad thing is that a lot of characters were underused. Leia for one. Her big scene is trying to cut through a door with a lightsaber. Danni, one of my favorites, was unconsious half the time. And then there is R2-D2 and Tekli! Why the hell were they brought on the mission if Luke is going to make them stay in the Jade Shadow the whole time! I think those two could have been used much better. My final complaint is Jacen Solo refusing to fight! What is up with that! We know that Jacen has his morals and stuff but, I want action! Put him into a scene that he has to use that lightsaber of his. I was starting to like him in Traitor when he had to hack down Yuuzhan Vong but now he is as boring as ever. There are good things about Reunion. Tahiri's character is taking a nice turn. She seems like a killing machine now. Nom Anor's plot took on a lot of unexpected twists, which was nice. I do think that Shimmra could be more evil though. Reuinion is a very good book though, and I couldn't put it down. I highly recommend it for any fan of the NJO!"},{"Title":"Reunion.

As usual for Sean great job of character development and creative story development"},{"Title":"Reunion. Sean Williams and Shane Dix (Star Wars New Jedi Order) (v. 3)","review":"Finally, the Force Heretic trilogy reaches the point, the characters actually get somewhere, and we can move on to more plot impacting, final novels of the New Jedi Order. As with many reviews, this one does contain spoilers.Like the previous two books, Force Heretic: Reunion, follows three story lines: Luke, Mara, Jacen, Danni, Saba, Tekli, Captain Yage, and the crew of the Widowmaker searching for Zonama Sekot, the living planet that is supposed to play a key part in the war; Leia, Han, Jaina, Jag, Tahiri, Twin Suns Squadron, Captain Mayn, and the crew of the Pride of Selonia continuing their quest to reestablish communications in various regions or the galaxy; and Nom Anor taking up the role of Prophet in a Jeedai heresy uprising on Yuuzhan'tar.The Skywalker story line, the whole point of the trilogy, finally reaches its destination. After pushing through several hundred pages of filler and off-topic events tied only together by leads to the Rogue Planet, the reader gets to the event they've been waiting for; the finding of Zonama Sekot.I have few complaints with the handling of Zonama Sekot itself, aside from how long it took to get there. Seriously, did we really need three books to get to one planet? Other than that, I think Williams and Dix did a fine job with portraying Zonama and Sekot (the planet and the mind respectively). I especially enjoyed the scene where Sekot compared (for Jacen's benefit) speaking with the beings that inhabited Zonama to a person conversing with a dust mite that crawls across their skin. I'm not sure why I enjoyed that line so much, but I did.However, we still don't really know what role Zonama Sekot will play in the Yuuzhan Vong War, which makes me wonder why this trilogy was even written. I mean, why write three unnecessarily long books about finding a planet and then not give any indication of the planet's use? We were told in Destiny's Way that Zonama Sekot would play a key role in helping the newly created Galactic Alliance win the war. As a reader and devoted Star Wars fan, I expected to find out why this one planet is so crucial in the book following Destiny's Way. Instead, I read through a long trilogy only to discover that the planet has agreed to help the Galactic Alliance...but its reason for importance is still unknown. So, while I was pleased with Luke and friends finally finding the planet and convincing it to return to the galaxy with them, I was a bit disappointed to not know more about Zonama Sekot's importance three books after the idea was introduced. Still, the Skywalker team accomplished their goal well enough to satisfy me as a reader and allow me to move on from that particular plot line on a good note.The Solo story line also reached its ultimate goal. As an earlier reviewer pointed out, Cal Omas states at the end of the novel what most of us thought at the beginning of the Force Heretic trilogy: Han and Leia are too important to be sent on a menial task like reestablishing communications when there are many other, more essential things they could be doing to aide the Galactic Alliance in winning the war.As has been stated before (both by me and by others), the whole point of including the Solo plot seemed to be setting up and executing the conflict with Tahiri. I think Williams and Dix really shone here, with their resolution of Tahiri's inner conflict. I was leery of bringing Tahiri back into the spotlight at first, seeing it as a way to just drag the NJO out longer. But, I think that what Williams and Dix have done will play a significant role in the outcome of the war (not to say that I want a minor character to win this long, galaxy wide conflict...that would be a bit of a let down). The joining of Tahiri and Riina was the strongest part of the Force Heretic trilogy, the coming together of two previously conflicting cultures into one personality. I am eager to see where future authors take this.As for the Nom Anor story...I can't help but wonder why it was even included. Yes, it set up the Jeedai heresy that I'm sure will play a role in ending the war. And yes, it gave Nom Anor a few character-building moments. But, other than that, what did it really accomplish? Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the snippets of Yuuzhan Vong culture and I feel that portraying the Yuuzhan Vong is one of the authors' strong points. However, it just doesn't seem that this particular plot line went anywhere. We now know for sure that the Yuuzhan Vong political structure is corrupt and unsound...but we knew that before. We also know that Nom Anor is up to something...when isn't he? All in all, this story went no where and accomplished very little aside from setting up the heresy conflict that I'm sure will come into play later. So, as much as it pains me to say this about a Yuuzhan Vong story, what was the point of this?I have few complaints about the authors' writing style itself. The lack of chapters can get really bothersome and makes finding a stopping point extremely difficult. Also, the authors have a rather annoying tendency to jump from one story line to another just when the previous story line was getting interesting. There is also a great reliance on coincidence (for example, Luke and friends just happen to arrive at Zonama Sekot as it is being attacked by the Yuuzhan Vong). Otherwise, they obviously know the Star Wars universe and have done their research (and it's nice to see references to past books). Their writing style, while not the best, is hardly painful to read and is easy enough to understand.Do I wish I hadn't read this trilogy? No. However, it took three books to accomplish four simple things: an alliance with the Imperial Remnant, the finding of Zonama Sekot, the set up of the Jeedai heresy, and the joining of Tahiri and Riina. Some serious editing should have taken place. The trilogy could have easily been cut down to one or maybe two (at most) books without losing any of the plot. I recommend that any Star Wars and NJO fan at least read Reunion (as it contains the most significant information). I am eager to move on from this now and see how some of the more established authors of the Star Wars universe end the New Jedi Order."},{"Title":"Reunion. Sean Williams and Shane Dix (Star Wars New Jedi Order) (v. 3)","review":"'Force Heretic III: Reunion' by Sean Willams and Shane Dix finally brings to a close the Force Heretic trilogy. The trilogy has had its ups and downs and has finally moved the New Jedi Order story arc into a position to come to an end as well.There are two main story lines with multiple sub-plots. First, Luke Skywalker, Mara Jade Skywalker, Jacen Solo, along with some other Jedi and Imperial escorts conclude their search for the living planet of Zenoma Sekot. Now they have to try and persuade Sekot to assist them in the conflict with the Yuuzhan Vong, and how, if at all, that assistance should come.Second, Han Solo, Princess Leia, Jaina Solo, and others attempt to re-establish a communications array on a distant world. The world has drifted out of a solar system and an indigenous species of sentient plant life wanders the surface. The Yuuzhan Vong quickly enter the fray, and then the Empire arrives to assist in the battle.This book plods along for most of the novel. The last 150 pages are really the meat of the story. It could have used some serious editing. However, the battle to restore the array was well done, and worthy of most Star Wars action sequences.As for the characters, Tahiri was the most interesting. She finally confronts her inner demons and allows her two personalities to reach a solution. The character that emerges at the end of this novel is far better than most of the secondary characters that have been featured in the trilogy.One of my biggest complaints about this novel, trilogy, and the New Jedi Story Arc has been the inclusion of Zenoma Sekot. Half way through reading this novel, it finally occurred to me what really bothered me about this sentient planet. Its too much like 'Star Trek' and not enough like 'Star Wars.' Mind you, I have nothing against Star Trek, but this is not suppose to be a Star Trek novel. Rather than rely on this sentient planet, I wish those steering the series would have encouraged more adventure and less philosophy from the authors.This novel does has its moments, and it is by no means awful. I really enjoyed the battle around setting up the relay station. It had Jedi weilding light sabers, speeder bikes, Han in action, and a space battle to match the ground action. It was well done, and I wish the rest of the novel could have been on an even par.I'd recommend this to Star Wars fans. I suggest reading the rest of the New Jedi Order series first. I have begun reading the next novel in the New Jedi Order series, The Final Prophecy, and I'm enjoying it immensely. However, it'd be helpful to have read this first, as some of the events of that novel spring directly from this one."},{"Title":"Reunion. Sean Williams and Shane Dix (Star Wars New Jedi Order) (v. 3)","review":"Why would you do this to the Star Wars series Williams and Dix? Why would you write those load of crap novels before this one to spew out more crap. Their styles in each book are different. The first one was just another Star Wars book, the second one was written like a James Bond story, and this one seems like they've tried to create a suspense novel. Well, they failed in each way possible. The biggest problem is that they were given important information to write with. And after reading three books you'd think that you'd learn something that you didn't already know. Everything turns out like you'd expect it to and yet nothing we didn't know.And why were the novels so long? The other authors didn't have a problem with making shorter novels than usual for this series and frankly the ones that were longer tended to be good, but not as enjoyable as the others."},{"Title":"Reunion.

These are some of the weakest books of the series, and found them just barely enjoyable and then only because I enjoy the Star Wars milieu so much. The basic problem is that they make very little sense. After reading the whole series I still have no idea who the &quot;force heretic&quot; the title refers to is. And I have only the foggiest idea why the characters think the quest for Zonama Sekot is important. While we're on the subject, the characters are poorly drawn and their actions make little sense. The whole thing is so weak that the books just aren't a lot of fun. Nevertheless, Reunion is the best of the three."},{"Title":"Reunion. Sean Williams and Shane Dix (Star Wars New Jedi Order) (v. 3)","review":"The 'Force Heretic' story arc concludes with this third installment (or book 17) of the New Jedi Order series which has spanned the last few years, and thank God.Heretic I &amp; II seemed like complete filler material to me, doing little to advance the overall grand storyline that the New Jedi Order had set in motion. They did introduce a few marginally interesting points, but due to teh fact they were so drawn out, verbose, with little payoff it was a struggle to read through those. However, Heretic III was far superior to its prequels.We finally see the resolution of Tahiri, the young Jedi girl who was saved by Anakin (who she was smitten with) from horrible experiments the Vong had dealt to her when she was in captivity. Finally, her bipolar personality story point comes to a head.We also witness the 1st major campaign with the allied New Galactic Alliance (formerly The New Republic) and the Imperial Remnant. This makes for an exciting dynamic, and the ensuing space battle is one of the best to be read after many books.Luke, Mara, Jacen, Danni, Saba finally see their quest for the search of the living planet, Sekot, also come to a head. Here the authors really make up for a campy and wild story regarding Sekot to the point where it actually can be read as plausible. Sekot hold some deep secrets regarding the Jedi, the Vong, and itself and its place in the galaxy. While some questions are answered, others are introduced in a exciting way which really helps make up for the previous two books attempts for the reader to care about finding Sekot.And within the pages concerning the Vong, as always, Nom Anor's character shines. Nom's character makes the whole trilogy bright spot as his scheming and malicious ways make for great reads. Especially the attempt on his life from one of his own, and the revealing of one of his spies to Shmirra. More Nom, less filler.After reading all three books, I am convinced that the story could have been much tighter and acceptable if completed in two. Unfortunately, the epilogue only hints at what is to come and the reader must decide if reading the three novels really accomplished anything on a 'grand galactic' scale."},{"Title":"Reunion. Sean Williams and Shane Dix (Star Wars New Jedi Order) (v. 3)","review":"Well, after finally finishing the Force Heretic trilogy, I must say that I was sorely disappointed. It seems like the entire trilogy was just put there to bide time until the Final Prophecy comes out, which, after reading the Heretic trilogy, I'm not holding my breath to be any good. The NJO has had it's ups and downs, but these three books mark a definite all-time low. The first 9 books, as far as I'm concerned, were the NJO glory days, with a few books afterward being up to par, such Traitor and Destiny's Way. All of those books were an enjoyment to read, and I always looked forward to picking the book up and reading about an exciting space battle or a harrowing Jedi/Yuuzhan Vong duel. But I had to force myself to read all three of the books in the trilogy, because it wasn't something I looked forward to. I must say, after reading the Force Heretic trilogy, I'm on the verge of becoming NJO heretic."},{"Title":"Reunion.

The characters all act like themselves, events happen and characters act for a reason, space battles and combat are well described, and the plot moves fluidly. I esp. liked the changing viewpoints, particularly where Sekot is asking Jacen and Luke the same question and you get to see their same-meaning-yet-different answers. That was cool. I highly recommend this book to anyone who has read part of the NJO before now; you won't be dissappointed."},{"Title":"Reunion. Sean Williams and Shane Dix (Star Wars New Jedi Order) (v. 3)","review":"This book is a continuation of the three book Force Heretic series and the seventeenth book of the NJO series. This was a 300-page story made into a 390-page book. You could take at least ninety pages out and loose little in the story. However, I enjoyed the continuation of the three main threads in this part of the story. One is the discovery by Luke's party of Zanoma Sekot and the surprises the find there, including dissention by the locals, known as Ferroans. The second is Leia's mission to reconnect the galaxy, and finds the Yuuzhan Vong and Imperials at the same place, a vital communications nexus with the Unknown Regions. Third is Nom Anor's latest reincarnation in the story, this as the \\"prophet\\" of the cult of the Jeedi.I most enjoyed the struggle faced by Tahiri with the personality imposed on her while she was held captive by the Yuuzhan Vong some time before. It had been surpressed, but she has been dealing with it in this book. I am not sure I am satisfied with the result, but even as I read the next book in the series, it is still an evolving issue in the storyline.Of course, there is success along the way, but there are surprising discoveries made both by Luke and Leia. The open question is: how will these discoveries made both by the Galactic Alliance and the Yuuzhan Vong affect the fate of both in the galaxy.Despite the way the book drags on in places, if you are a fan of the Star Wars universe, you should read this. Not reading this will put you behind the eight ball on following the next book in the epic saga, \\"The Final Prophesy.\\""},{"Title":"Reunion.

The end result is simply unsatisfying.All three of these \\"Force Heritic\\" books could have been been made as one single book - or even left out entirely!

Sean Williams and Shane Dix (Star Wars New Jedi Order) (v. 3)","review":"No, really. I've watched the NJO novels go from good to great to...this. &quot;Reunion&quot; is not the worst novel in the NJO series--that distinction belongs to &quot;Refugee,&quot; the preceding novel--but it comes really close. It's taken three books--three long, exhaustive, mind-numbing books--for Luke and the rest to finally make it to Zonama Sekot. But before they can form any sort of alliance with the planet, it orchestrates the kidnapping of Danni and the alleged appearance of a coralskipper in the strange region of space Zonama Sekot is sheltered in.And then you have the Han, Leia, Jaina, Jag, and Imperial Fleet plot in which they encounter strange life forms and battle with Tahiri's current state of unconsciousness; the one saving grace is that the shoeless Jedi spends most of her time in the novel trapped in her own mind, so we really don't have to listen to her mutterings. Just internal monologues and Riina/Tahiri battling it out. The symbolism of unity between Vong and Jedi is so obvious it's ineffective.And the Nom Anor plot is so cookie cutter it's laughable; all it does is give us insight into Shimmra's arrogance, deteriorating mind, and venemous hatred for all things heretical (am I the only one who thinks Onimi is the true power behind the throne and the grotesque appearance is only a masquer?).I stand firm by saying the strongest entry into NJO was &quot;Star by Star;&quot; the rest has been lukewarm at best, &quot;Reunion&quot; at worst.After this mess, there are only two books left, so I suppose that's good news; I'll be glad to see the resolution. Hopefully, we'll have another &quot;shocking&quot; death to close out the series; perhaps Mara or Han or Jaina will join Chewbacca, Anakin Solo, Borsk Fey'lya, and the other cannon fodder in the Star Wars literary trash heap; it couldn't be worse than what is sure to follow the bizarre NJO arc."},{"Title":"Reunion. Sean Williams and Shane Dix (Star Wars New Jedi Order) (v. 3)","review":"The Force Heritic Trilogy was really smashing. The first book was a battle between the Empire and the Yuuzhan Vong. The second was a battle between the Ssi-ruuk and the Bakura/Galactic Allance forces. The third was a battle between The Yuuzhan Vong and the Gallactic Allance/Empire.Interwoven into all this is the serch for the living planet Zonama Sekot, which could prove critical in continuing war effort. All the battles are won and, dispite what the summery on the third book said, Zonama Sekot sends no &quot;defiant message&quot; and agrees to help the good guys (after some initail trouble). I liked the action on the speeder bikes in the third book, which, so many books after the speeder bide scenes in Return of the Jedi, FINALLY become an important part of a story. The natives of Esfandia in the same book were also a good idea. The resolution of Tahiri's case of Vong-induced multiple personality symdrome is great, though it could have taken less page space. As for complaints about no character development with Jag, Jania, and company, I like them the way they are. And the battle scenes mentioned earlier were handled great.As for why I rated it for Stars instead of five, the battle scene in the third book seemed to focus on one ship and ignore the other seventeen ememy vessels. And finaly, Jacen and Danni Quee (why so many fans hate her I don't know) are suposed to be having a romance, but you could hardly tell that. Why not some kissing scenes in the last two NJO books. And the picture on the cover? All I can say is that they should have gotten someone who went to college and PASSED Art 101. Overall a great trilogy in a great series."},{"Title":"Reunion.

Sean Williams and Shane Dix (Star Wars New Jedi Order) (v. 3)","review":"This book was terrific, the whole sears is amazing. Ive read the other reviews and others have complained about the faact that its compleatly predictable and that you would know how it ended. But they missesed the true jem of actually reading the inbetween and feeling the emotion the authors wrote into it. I could not put this book down, at one point I was literally reading it by carlight on a bumpy dirt road where I couldnt get mroe than two or three sentances in before having to stop and gatehr my focus again. I belive everyone knew how it would end, but the excietment on was how they got there, the adventure, the whole drama unfolded as they always do. The epologe at the end was grand too, I could feel the loss Luke was feeling when he thought about his family being scattered all over the galaxy. When they were all gathering by the ship and talking It made me think back to the ending of Return of The Jedi and I kinda pictured them like that all grouped up taking that perfect group shot before the film went to the credits. This book cant be appreciated by itself, the whole serires is a masterpeice, rivaling the origional triligy itself. If I could ask Lucas for one last trilligy it would be of this series. Since the first battle, Chewbaccas death and funeral (I was shocked at his death, even angry at salvador for writing it, I cried trying to get through his funeral) To the Terrivying voxin, a book that literally tore me up, I almost wanted to stop reading but I had to keep going, I wanted to see the ending. To this, the winding down of the war, and the enevitable end. The Star Wars books of any triligy including this one, is not ment for those who saw the movie once or twice and thought the books would be a good somthing to read along with it. These books are for the fans, the true ones. Ive spent many days wishing I could be in those stories, to be a Jedi, a protector, healer and warrior. To fly spaceships against creatures that would destroy everything and everyone of these books have brought me a little closer to it, I cannot wait for the next book and the final after that, it is simply too long and each day without them drives crazy."},{"Title":"Reunion.

I guess finding the planet, but by the time it happened, I didn't care anymore. I am a huge fan of SW and I always loved Luke Skywalker, but I just wanted to skim the pages that featured him, or Jacen for that matter. I am so tired of his back and forth (talk it out, take action, no wait talk it out.) I am ready for him to just do something already.Three books to get to Zonama Sekot and you still have no idea what it's significance is. And who is the force heretic? I still don't know.The only real worthwhile storyline was Tahiri. I have just started The Final Prophesy and had forgotten what it was like to get excited about reading these books again. Thankfully there is no Jacen yet."},{"Title":"Reunion. Sean Williams and Shane Dix (Star Wars New Jedi Order) (v. 3)","review":"If you are a fan of the NJO series then this book is a must read. Luke, Mara Jade and Jacen succeed in their quest to find Zonoma Sekot (oh come on you knew that they would). This part of the trilogy also provides a very interesting back story about Anakin Skywalker/Darth Vader for Luke. That's the good stuff, but the other story line involving Leia and Han's mission appears to be warmed over filler. Yes our heroes are caught in a desperate situation, one that you know they are going to over come - helped along by Vorrik the Vong command who is nothing more than a predictable stumbling-bumbling idiot whose questionable leadership skills make it hard to believe that he would be put in charge of a latrine let along a Vong battle group. Now you might think that I am trashing the book - far from it, as I said at the start of this review if you are a fan of the NJO series you do not want to miss this book. Sandwiched in between the two main plots are several subplot lines that are interesting.Saba's sorrw over the loss of her people is handled well - it is good to see her character on the road to recovery. Saba's visit to Zonoma Sekot proves to be a healing of sorts for her.Jag and Jaina grow closer and Jag expresses his true feelings for her.Han is reunited with Droma a character from an earlier book in the NJO series. His appearance provides a surprising twist to the story.Admiral Pellaeon and the Imperial Remnant return in time to illustrate that although the Alliance and Remnant can work together for their mutual interest, they still have a ways to go before either can really trust the each other.Tahiri's dilemma is resolved in a predictable fashion - one that is welcomed since it would have been tedium beyond belief to see her continue to grapple with her dual personalities. What emerges is a new Tahiri, a character who has the combined strengths of a Jedi Knight and a Vong warrior - one can only assume that she will play a pivotal role when the series reaches endgame.Finally we have the continued scheming of Nom Anor as he manipulates everyone around him in his quest to return to power. We witness the demise of one of his key followers along with the predictable discovery and destruction of a new ally. The story leaves this character shaken but not deterred - he has no other alternative and you just know that he too will probably play a pivotal roll in resolving the series when it reaches its conclusion.Overall it was a good end to the trilogy and we look forward to the next two books that will conclude the NJO series."},{"Title":"Reunion.

Sean Williams and Shane Dix (Star Wars New Jedi Order) (v. 3)","review":"All I can say is at least the \\"Reunion's\\" plot wasn't stagnant. It has direction, some loose ends are tied up. More is left for the rest of the series.Luke, Mara, Jacen and Danni find Sonama Sekot. Hegerty is there and at least participates a little. It's about time. Up until now, she was too weak to keep up, lost in a coma, and too traumatized to go out on missions. What is her purpose again?Sonama Sekot is a huge disappointment. It's a little too far out there, more sci-fi than fantasy. I just couldn't bring myself to accept this living planet that presents its form as spirits of dead or living beings, has the power of the Force, can move itself from place to place. It even tries to be profound but fails miserably. Sekot is no Vergere.Han, Leia, Jag, Jaina and Tahiri are on Esfandia, trying to defend the communications center from the Yuuzhan Vong. Without Esfandia, the Chiss territory is cut off from the rest of the galaxy.While on Esfandia, they meet the Brrbrlp, also known as the \\"Cold Ones,\\" another set of beings I relegate to the category of \\"unbelievable.\\" They are sentient creatures who float through the air and are extremely fragile. They don't play much of a role, except to give Han and Leia another alien to worry about protecting.Tahiri must literally battle her inner demon. I have never been a fan of Tahiri's. Her struggles with her inner self was fine, but the battle and the result of it all was ridiculous. Not to mention that it caused both Tahiri and Jaina to be in a coma, which was happening at the same time as Danni was in a coma. What kind of story happens when three of the characters are in a coma?\\"Reunion\\" feels so much more like \\"Star Trek\\" than \\"Star Wars.\\" I'm glad the trilogy is over, but Sekot is bound to be in the next book.

Sean Williams and Shane Dix (Star Wars New Jedi Order) (v. 3)","review":"Sean Williams and Shane Dix's Reunion concludes the Force Heretic story arc, the only trilogy in the nineteen book New Jedi Order. As I expressed in my reviews of the first two books, I'm not clear why this story was chosen to be given a more in-depth treatment than any other in this particular saga, which is otherwise populated by duologies and standalones. Force Heretic slows the pace of the New Jedi Order significantly, as roughly 1200 pages are devoted to story elements which really don't advance the overall plot very far. This deliberate slowdown makes these novels a tough read at a point where readers may already be somewhat weary of the Yuuzhan Vong (thanks to the fourteen prior books).Reunion continues the three-way split of the first two books: one storyline follows Luke Skywalker's team as they locate and interact with living planet Zonama Sekot, a second continues the gallivanting-around-the-galaxy adventures of the Solos, and the third slightly advances Nom Anor's efforts on terraformed Coruscant to remold himself as The Prophet and gain power. Something that stood out in this book was the peculiar pacing: beyond the trilogy having no chapter breaks, it seems that each storyline was just rotated in and out every few pages. At times there will be an exciting action scene taking place, but it was constantly interrupted by casual conversation or exploration in another storyline. The plots didn't feel like they were organically woven together to bring the overall story events to a head, but rather just somewhat arbitrarily given occasional attention.It's a relief to finally get to Zonama Sekot after spending two books with Luke's team researching its location. There are some nice callbacks to the events of Greg Bear's Rogue Planet, including some intriguing information newly revealed to Luke about his father's use of the Force. While a great deal of time is spent with Luke and Jacen talking to the planet, there's not a strong sense that their actions really matter. Zonama Sekot positions itself as an infinitely higher being and it appears to have determined its own course regardless of what the Jedi suggest or request.The Solo's unit aids in the defense of Esfandia, a remote planet host to a New Republic communications relay. It's exciting in places and there is a memorable species introduced in the Brrbrlpp, which are considerably more alien than the standard residents of the galaxy far, far away. In the end, when the Solos succeed in restoring communications on this planet, I again marvelled that the guiding lights of the New Jedi Order chose to devote so much time to these storylines. They just don't seem very significant at this point in the game. Accompanying the Solos, Tahiri does gain some progression as a character as Reunion resolves the conflicting two personalities contained within her.I've found the Nom Anor storyline to be the most interesting of the three in many ways, as it is unclear where it is going and there is some genuine tension as he schemes and plots in the underworld. Mitigating this is the fact that he hasn't changed at all as a character, so he's not even an anti-hero, but rather continues in his antagonist role from before. The difference is that Force Heretic lets us spend significant time in his head, and being privy to his thoughts lends him the tiniest bit of sympathy as a character.Mr. Williams and Mr. Dix show an impressive familiarity (or an impressive ability to research, but either way, the results are the same) with the Star Wars Expanded Universe throughout the Force Heretic trilogy, resurrecting old characters, locales, and plotlines and weaving them into the New Jedi Order tapestry. I would be curious to see what this trilogy would have looked like condensed into a duology or even a standalone story. On its own, the curious pacing would have been less problematic, but taken as the fifteenth through the seventeenth stories of a saga that shows some worrying symptoms of bloat as a whole, it's hard to recommend these."},{"Title":"Reunion.

Tahiri still fights against her inner battle.NOTE: Based on audiobook and novel.*YAWN*Uh, sorry, you woke me up. I just finished listening to \\"Reunion\\" on audiobook, and, boy, was I bored. The last two books (specfically \\"Refugee\\") made me varying degrees of p!ssed off, which at least made the listening entertaining. This book...pah, it barely registered.After two books of poking around the galaxy, Luke finds Zonoma Sekot. Apparently, all Mara had to do was use her super Force Navigator ability to find the damn planet. Nice to know. And why couldn't she do this back in \\"Remnant\\", thus saving us a lot of wasted time? Then our characters prowl around on Zonoma Sekot, meet up with grumpy Ferreoans (sp?), and generally have to beg, plead, and cajole Sekot into joining the cause against the Yuuzhan Vong. There is something about the magistrar being kidnapped, along with worthless Danni Quee, and of course, Jacen reverts back to his pre-Vergere \\"I don't know what to do with my life, I'm a pacifist, don't fight, all aggression is equal\\" crap. Kid, you've had plenty of time to \\"figure it out\\". You \\"figured it out\\" in \\"Traitor\\". Quit changing your frakkin' mind! But really, the resolution of this trilogy spanning story is boring, and really is nothing more \\"We found Zonoma Sekot, what do we do with it?\\"Back to Han, Leia, and all them. They do their trivial mission, Tahiri gets locked in her mind and must bind her two selves. This part is great, well done, very good, and definitely the highlight and only reason to drudge through all three books (though I would NOT recommend it, even for that reason). Dragging Jaina into Tahiri's mind only to get stuck there and comatose? Not so much. Let her be a pilot, quit making her a damsel in distress. Then, oh, nos! The Yuuzhan Vong are attacking the ONLY COMMUNICATION STATION to the Unknown Region where Luke and Mara are, and GOD FORBID we lose contact with them ever, so we'd better travel across the galaxy and to hell with the people who are DYING, Luke and Mara are more important! But don't worry, it's just another relatively boring, Bantam era mission (though I must admit, the aliens were pretty cool) where Han and Leia save the day with a wriggle of her nose and quick moves with the Falcon (with the help of Paelleon, who decided to hop on by for tea??? What is with this?). *YAWN*Droma returns with his Invincible All-Knowing Ryn Network, because isn't that so cool? No, I didn't find him cool in \\"Hero's Trial\\", I didn't find the Ryn Network \\"cool\\" in \\"Remnant\\", and having BOTH in this book make me have heartburn. Please, Droma, go back into your corner of the galaxy and just die.Given what actually happens in these books, I still am puzzled that THIS was the story that had to take place over a trilogy. Why? Why couldn't we have one book where Zonoma Sekot is found and the Imperials brought into the Galactic Alliance? It would have been easy, and the other two books could have been written by someone that can write, like Greg Keyes, Matthew Stover, or almost anyone other than Shane Dix and Sean Williams (who, for some odd reason, is STILL writing Star Wars fanfic--I MEAN!!).

Force Heretic III: Reunion however pushes this set down to the bottom of the series. This is the planet in which the heros find Zonoma Sekot, and instead of a catharsis the book seems anticlimactic. Part of the problem is that the authors switch scenes frequently. The chapters are long, but the narrative only stays with a particular group of characters for 3-4 pages, then switches. Thus, there's not a lot of time to build up the excitement or tension in any one scene. It would have been a lot better if the authors had taken a \\"Two Towers\\" approach and focused the first half of the book on Han & Leia's journey, and the second on the quest of Zonoma Sekot.

Aside from The Dark Elf series, this is book 2 in Salvatore's best series. Forget about those Demonwars and that Crimson Shadow (both series are highly trite and uninteresting). Pick this up instead - but DO start with The Woods Out Back and avoid those initial hints of confusion I suffered.I think one of the reasons this series makes it where so many other Salvatore ventures have failed is because he embraces its wackiness and all its cliches (like Elven archers and Dwarven craftsmen, gentle Giants and wicked witches), and he does so in a comic yet adventurous fashion.

R.A. Salvatore finds this niche with his mix of serious fantasy and humor. While the series is not a parody, ala Split Heirs, it does not take itself too seriously. While author's like Glenn Cook and Steven Erikson have mastered the darker, more serious side of fantastic fiction, Salvatore shows a similar master of the light, fun, and humorous. The second book in this series The Dragon's Dagger gives the reader his first taste of the difference in the flow of time between the real world and Fairie. This is a technique often seen in stories of the Fae, and Salvatore demonstrates a strong understanding of it.Overall: 8.5/10The Dragon's Dagger brings with it the same humorous take on cliche that made The Woods Out Back such a wonderful book. While much of Salvatore's more serious work falls victim to overly cliched storylines, or immortal characters (Drizzt!), this series uses those cliches to its advantage. Salvatore masterfully works in elven archers, dwarven craftsman, and evil kings, all with a rampaging dragon running rampant across the land. The familiar characters, combined with a truly fresh story, make this book a little bit better than its predecessor. While you loved meeting Gary, Kelsey, Mickey, and Geno in the first book, now you will feel like you are coming home to famliar friends.Writing: 8.0/10Salvatore's writing doesn't change much between the two books. He still writes great actions scenes, and still provides a lot of wit and clever use of cliches and tropes.Characters: 10/10Like I said, Gary, Kelsey, Mickey, and Geno were great to meet. In The Woods Out Back we watch these standard fantasy cliches grow into real, vibrant people. In The Dragon's Dagger you will feel like you are coming home to a roomful of good friends. The characters continue to grow and change, especially Gary, but there is a comfortable familiarity in them that allows the reader to relax into the book, instead of feeling constantly on edge, as is the case with some of Salvatore's other work. There are good things to be said for both of these styles, but a relaxing book is a wonderful thing now and again.World: 7.0/10The Dragon's Dagger provides us with more details about the realm of Fairie. While the story revisits many of the same locations as the last book, most of them are given more detail and background. While the humor and freshness of The Woods Out Back was enough to distract the reader from the lack of detail, The Dragon's Dagger retains the same level of humor, without needing to provide a distraction. While many questions about the world are left unanswered, enough world detail is given to satisfy most readers.Plot: 9.5/10What can I say, an evil king sits on the throne; a wicked, angry dragon has been released to terrorize the land; and Ceridwyn is trapped on her island. Like The Woods Out Back this book takes a load of cliches and turns them into a fun, fascinating, meaningful story. This shows Salvatore's mastery of the style.Pacing: 10/10The story has a pleasant back and forth flow that keeps the action going at a reasonable speed. There are some parts that are faster than others, but nowhere does the book become slow or boring.Commentary: 4.5/10While there is some commentary in The Dragon's Dagger it focuses more on entertainment. However, one major theme that I thoroughly enjoyed is the nature of friendship. Similar to Tolkien's characters in The Lord of the Rings, Salvatore explores the dynamic of friendship in the face of racial tensions.Conclusion:This is a great book, a must read if you are looking for something light and fun. If you liked The Woods Out Back then don't miss The Dragon's Dagger."},{"Title":"The Dragon's Dagger","review":"R. A. Salvatore continues the tale of Gary Leger by once again yanking him from his world and putting him on another trail to adventure. Gary's life has improved since we've last seen him. He has a better car, a better job, and a girlfriend, Diane. But even with life on the upswing for him, he's still stuck in the corporate rat race.When Gary last saw the world of Faerie, the witch had been defeated, Robert the Dragon had re-forged the spear, and all was right with the world. But not for long. Robert has left his hole and is now wreaking havoc on the world.So Gary, Kelsey, Geno, Mickey, and Gerbil the Gnome (a new character) all set out to defeat Robert. Along the way we see how much Gary has grown emotionally and physically.Salvatore has done a wonderful job in bringing another Gary Leger story to print. If you have read any of his works, this series is the best. Start with The Woods Out Back, continue with this novel, then finish with The Dragonslayer's Return. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Dragon's Dagger","review":"I would like to start by saying that Salvatore is a genius. With this trilogy, he not only keeps your interest, but gives you a genuine feeling of really being in the Land of Faerie. He brings in someone from our time and place, puts them in faerie, and then the true magic begins. The Dragon's Dagger is a wonderful story of honor, excitement, and brilliant battle scenes along with some good wit and humor. It's funny, yet it keeps you holding your breath. Definately a can't-put-it-down book."},{"Title":"The Dragon's Dagger","review":"\\"The Dragon's Dagger\\" continues Drizzt Do'Urden creator R.A. Salvatore's fantasy saga began in \\"The Woods Out Back.\\" Like the previous novel, it is clearly a labor of love for its creator, as the main character, Gary, is named after none other than Salvatore's brother, while Gary's wife, Diane, is named after the author's own wife, and so on and so forth. Given Salvatore's connection to this tale, it's certainly difficult not to find the work a little endearing, but at the same time it lacks the punch and pacing of his far superior Drizzt Do'Urden stories (the early ones, and not some of his dawdling later efforts).The premise is certainly a good one, and carries on that which began in the previous tome. Gary Leger, resident of the mundane Real-earth (or our world) is summoned to return to the magical realm of Faerie (think Middle-earth but less compelling) to slay Robert the Wretched, an evil dragon wreaking havoc in the land. Salvatore keeps things colorful and generally amusing in a somewhat light-hearted fashion, but manages to keep a whole lot from happening during the course of the novel. It has always seemed that all three books in the Spearweilder series could have been condensed into one excellent read, but were instead expanded into a trilogy, very much at the cost of pace.Again Salvatore's tone is also a little unnerving. One moment Gary is lamenting killing his first human being, while the next he feels like he's taking a vacation from the grim realities of Real-earth. To top of it off, Gary's slaying of this human foe, and his guilt, play no real role in the events of the story, and make one wonder why they were ever included in the first place, since it seems so out of touch with the rest of the novel's good cheer. Salvatore also makes the mistake of becoming a little heavy-handed at times when he expresses his own viewpoints through the main character. It's a little preachy, to be sure.In the end, though, \\"The Dragon's Dagger\\" is a lightweight read (only 300 or so pages) full of interesting characters and a decent helping of adventure that, like its predecessor, is worth checking out."},{"Title":"The Dragon's Dagger","review":"mr. salvatore if you read this i would like to saythank you for many hours of reading pleasure. i think that this book is one of your best ever andi have been reading your books for 8 years i am upto date so far with all of your releases that i can get in my area.thankswilliam d melton"},{"Title":"National High School Football Record Book","review":"As the editor of West Virginia's premier high school sports website, I have gotten to know author Doug Huff through the years.In our state, high school football is truly king. I had a chance to talk to Huff about this book.When Student Sports Inc. of Torrance, California wanted to put together a national football record book recently, they turned to Huff. \\"Of course I jumped at it,\\" he said. \\"And it's much more than a list of numbers.\\"The book that has just been published has Nitro (WV) grad J.R. House pictured on the cover along with three other players and three coaches.When you pick up the just released National High School Football Record Book, you're going to see some big names and some mind-blowing facts.What high school has a record 35 state titles with a record ten in a row? What school has won a record 113 games in a row (and still counting)? Check page 6.And you can read about and see photos of stars such as Tim Couch, Billy Sims and Dan Marino.But the new publication has a very distinctive West Virginia flavor too.For starters, Huff is the editor of the book. Huff may have retired from his beat at the Wheeling (WV) Intelligencer, but he didn't exactly find the ol' rocking chair. In fact, the NHSFRB is as ambitious of a project that any one would (or wouldn't) want to take on.Some of the books features are individual records, year-by-year season stat leaders, All-time best teams and All-Time All-Americans. There's the Top 50 Programs of All-time and the State vs. State All-Star Games.National rankings and regional rankings are listed. You can check out top players, coaches and teams. Compare season and career stats.The book is a must-have for any big high school football fan nationwide. But West Virginia gridiron fanatics will see many familiar names as well.Did you know that Gatha Hoffman, a punter from Fairmont (WV)Senior HS is credited with a punt covering 105 yards in 1929? Or that Carlton Clark of Pennsboro (WV) HS has the record for blocked punts in a season with 16, also in 1929. Pineville's Curt Warner led in nation in points scored in 1978.And check out the All-Time All-American Player Rankings! For wide receivers, everybody above Rand (WV)'s Randy Moss is already an NFL Hall of Famer, except for Vikings teammate Chris Carter - and he'll be one. And you should see the names ahead of (and behind) Warner, who makes the running backs list. Talk about respect, Farmington (WV)'s Sam Huff gets some too at the linebacker position.And for pure stats Nitro quarterback J.R. House is all over the book, along with his favorite receivers Chris Martin, Zack Collins and Jeff Clark.The 1999 MoHawk Bowl even gets a mention. You'll see Ceredo Kenova's Carl Ward's 10 titles. You'll also find Capital HS, Brooke HS, Nitro HS, Weir HS, North Marion HS, John Marshall HS, South Charleston HS, DuPont HS and East Bank HS in the NHSFRB pages with yearly rankings. The 2000 State Football Champs from each state are honored, so you'll see Morgantown HS, Wheeling Central HS and Bridgeport HS in there.Morgantown (WV)'s Mark Wigal is a 2000 Student Sports Senior All-American, and there's tons more.\\"It's been a passion of mine, and I'm tickled any time I see a West Virginian in there,\\" said Huff.The same will hold true for fans in any state -- this is a comprehensive book!But who is the National High School Player of the Century?

Who would have thought that Yankees great Roger Maris still holds a national football record? As the book is current through the 2000 season, I was surprised at how many records have been broken this past year... like David Koral and his 764 yards passing in a game... the book explained that no NFL quarterback has ever passed for more than 557 (Ty Detmer) and I thought that was interesting too. I would recommend the book to coaches, parents and players or just fans of high school football... it's really a must have!!"},{"Title":"Object-Process Methodology","review":"You will find this book very useful when you approach a new design and/or development of information systems. The structured and systematic manner of defining objects and processes is so much better than what we all know from old school's DFDs, ORDs and even the UML. The OPM approach takes you one step ahead in the thinking process, making sure that all the participating entities are well thought and with no loose ends. Try it out and you might save 50% of your development cycles."},{"Title":"Object-Process Methodology","review":"I have used many methodologies over my career. Most of them are based around the object-oriented and structured design paradigms. I found out about OPM quite by accident about a year ago. I've been using it ever since. I have used it to model both hardware and software systems, as well as for business process modeling. It is an excellent methodology and I recommend it for anyone developing any kind of system.One of the nice things about OPM is that it is easy: I was able to get a team \\"up-and-running\\" with the methodology in less than an hour of teaching them some basic concepts (try doing that with UML). Another feature is that you can use this for any type of project; you are not locked into a structured or object-oriented mindset like structured analysis or UML. OPM can handle both types of concepts with ease.Finally, this methodology is fast. It is just easier and more intuitive to model in an OPM fashion. I've also found that others can comprehend the OPM models better than other methodologies too.I used to be a UML advocate until I found OPM. I have found concepts that are difficult to model in UML are quite easy to model in OPM. It is just more flexible.The book is really good by the way. It is very complete and gives plenty of good exammples. I congratulate Dov Dori and his team for providing something that all engineering disciplines can use to design their systems."},{"Title":"Object-Process Methodology","review":"OPM is a methodology for modeling systems, technical as well as any other system. In the techical world it compares with UML. OPM is designed with consistant and simple notations, uses simple rules that when combined can be used to model any system (real or informational) to any level of complexity that is desired by the system architect. Also, it integrates object modeling and process modeling in one diagram (although you can still keep them separate if you wanted).UML uses complex rules to model complex systems, something that is very difficult to make happen, therefore it is very difficult to learn and use. OPM uses simple rules and consistant notations to model complex systems. After simple introductions to the methology, we have been able to start using it in our organization. More powerful and far simpler then UML. The way UML should have been done long time ago."},{"Title":"Object-Process Methodology","review":"There is an eternal debate between system designersand architects of software, products and large systems:Is it ever possible to show structure (the arrangementof objects) and system behavior (over time) in the samerepresentation? Dov Dori's book shows convincingly that it canbe done. Particularly powerful is the duality betweengraphical system representation and natural language.Also, the CD-ROM with OPCAT software allows one to followthe examples in the book and apply OPM directly to a project.The book is clearly written and will appeal to engineers,computer scientists and software developers. A refreshingcontrast to the traditional way of looking a object-centeredsystems architecting. This begs for more ... in terms ofconnecting OPM to other tools such as Design Structure Matrices,but also for representing highly complex systems over &gt;2 levelsof decomposition."},{"Title":"Object-Process Methodology","review":"I have been fascinated by the simplicity and usefulness of theObject-Process Methodology paradigm and approach expressed in the book. As aresearcher in Science Education I have been grappling with how to representcomplex, technology-enhanced educational systems that involve humans,processes and educational artifacts. OPM and the OPCAT software enclosedwere very instrumental in enabling me to model and represent the &quot;bigpicture&quot; of educational systems I developed. With OPM I was then able togradually refine portions of the system to any desired level of detail.The applicability of OPM to IT-intensive educational systems is a testimonyto the generic nature of the methodology and to the fact that it is usefulin so many domains. The combination of a single simple graphical model thatgenerates natural language on the fly is really unique and valuable. Iwholeheartedly recommend the book to anyone interested in modeling complexsystems, be they of technological, economical, or social nature. The methodis straightforward, easy to learn even for non IT-professionals, and mostrewarding in terms of the quality and clarity of the resulting graphical andtextual model."},{"Title":"Object-Process Methodology","review":"This is a rare book and sorely needed book about system modeling that addresses modeling language from an architect's viewpoint, instead of a domain engineer's viewpoint. Most other modeling languages and books are mostly concerned about the utility of a language in a specific domain. In contrast, OPM intends to address multiple sources of concerns, in a coherent and concise symbol set. For example, UML is heavily geared toward software development, and Petri-Net is intended to describe and diagnose interactive processes and real-time systems. These tools certainly serve the purpose for their respective domain, however, they inherently only reveal a narrowed view of the whole system.As the title of the book entails, Object-Process Methodology: a holistic systems paradigm, is a language designed to address the emergent properties of system modeling. OPM's semantics enables modelers to realize the explicit relationships between Objects and Process. Without enforcing this concern during modeling and model reading, many system-level intent might be lost. Forcing a system to be described with only objects (OO-design methods/languages) or only processes (procedural-design methods/languages) usually also force modelers to create language-specific artifacts, that could become sources of imprecise model.The main thesis in this book is that Object and Process must coexist in a single model. The combination of these two types of things could more accurately reflect the ontological structures of human minds. Therefore, it could more readily and effectively help humans to transcribe models into a formal representation. A number of innovative formal language concepts are also mentioned and explained in this book. Some modeling tool implementations are also included in the CD. For example, the automated translation between Object-Process Diagram and Object-Process Language is another invention that would significantly improve the cognitive efficiency for modelers to verify and validate the model semantics. These foundamental features of modeling languages and their cognitive effects on modelers have not been successfully in representing complex systems. This book and this methodology directly tackle this knowledge representation issue at the core of language design.As a piece of extensive scholarly work on modeling langauges, this summarized and critiqued many aspects of system modeling issues and relevant modeling methods. It discusses and explains a number of language features that are particularly important in graphical modeling languages. For example, the concept of complexity scaling, probablistic processes, and agent representation. The author clearly thought through the needs of a system architect, who needs to be concerned of not just the mechanics of modeling, but also the expressiveness and impact of the system model as an artifact of system building.Breakthroughs in modeling languages are essential instruments for major breakthroughs in technoIogical development. The development of hardware description language pioneered by Carver Mead triggered a major revolution in the semiconductor industry. For improving the maturity of complex system integration and creation, I believe that this book will present an important foundation from the perspective of language design and system representation. I highly recommend this book to people who are interested in system modeling, language design, and knowledge management."},{"Title":"Object-Process Methodology","review":"OPM is a methodology designed to facilitate the formal and rigorous description and analysis of systems, be they information systems or physical systems. The striking feature about OPM is that it recognises as peers the notion of Process and Object. This enables OPM to provide true unified modelling of the structural as well as dynamic aspects of a system. This is in contrast to traditional Object Oriented analysis, such as UML, which uses a variety of different modelling formats andsymbols to accomplish the same end. For this reason, I have been using OPM in a professional setting to perform requirements elicitation, systems analysis and the development of precise domain specific ontologies.Another striking feature of OPM is that it combines a graphics based model, termed Object Process Diagram or OPD, with structured formal declarative statements that complement each interaction depicted on the diagram. These declarative statements are termed Object Process Language or OPL paragraphs. The added value of having both views, graphic and semantic, is that it facilitates non-specialist understanding of theresultant analysis.I have used OPM, as outlined by Dr. Dori in this book, to develop an axiomized ontology that describes my company's unique set of Product Configuration Management concepts, which resulted in the generation of hundreds of Object-Process Diagrams and thousands of Object-Process Language statements. Doing this analysis using the constructs provided by traditional UML would have been inconceivable!"},{"Title":"Object-Process Methodology","review":"For a long time, I have been looking for a visual programming language to describe my algorithms and program procedures in an elegant way. There are indeed quite a few diagramming tools available for modeling system behaviors, however, none of them is suitable to my demand before I encountered OPD, which is a graphic language of OPM. I&iexcl;ve been using it to depict many algorithms in my work since I learned it. I&iexcl;ve also taught my students to use it and they indeed like it. What is more interesting is that the tools accompanying the book can convert OPDs into a real programming language, like Java.In OPDs, objects and processes exist together to depict both structural and dynamic natures of the system in one diagram, which provides a holistic view of the system. It is natural to use and understand. One of its impressive features is its scaling ability to show different levels of details to handle the complexity issues. Hence, it is also convenient for system modeling, clear for communication among team members, even among technical staff, executives and customers.In summary, this is a very easy and useful tool. All stakeholders, including technical staff, management executives, professors and students, can have a try. You will like it also."},{"Title":"Object-Process Methodology","review":"You will find this book very useful when you approach a new design and/or development of information systems.

As systems have become more complex, a prevalent problem in systems development has been the number of accruing errors. These errors can cause catastrophic failure in the worst-case in addition to intolerable schedule delays and cost overruns. Introducing errors as well as difficulty finding and successfully correcting them occurs because of the lack of proper analysis and design tools for complex system specifications. OPM has the attributes to mitigate against the possibility of system failure, providing comprehensive visibility for better schedule and cost control in product development. It enhances reuse of system modules, processes and software routines in different contexts, while reducing the chance of errors. OPM automatically generates intent specifications that are readily understood by both customers and product team members and are translatable to machine control subsystems. OPM is a holistic systems paradigm that extends the Object-Oriented (OO) paradigm and overcomes its major shortcomings by integrating system structure and behavior in a single integrated graphic and natural language model. OPM successfully tackles the task of development and lifecycle management of systems, products and projects. OPM is a significant extension of and a major departure from the OO approach. It incorporates the system static-structural and dynamic-procedural aspects into a single, unified model. Presented as a concise visual formalism by a set of Object-Process Diagrams (OPD set), it is automatically translated into a set of Object-Process Language (OPL) script, a subset of natural English. At the basis of the OPM philosophy is the observation that to faithfully and naturally analyze and design systems in any domain, processes, like objects, should be considered as stand-alone \\"things\\" (entities) that are not necessarily encapsulated within objects. This detachment and de-coupling of processes from objects emphasizes the duality and complementarity of objects and processes, and opens the door for structure-behavior unification. At any point in time, objects exist with some structure and state. This is the static aspect of the system. Processes affect objects by changing their states. This is the dynamic aspect of the system. System complexity is managed through a number of graphical scaling options: zooming into and out of processes, unfolding and folding objects, and expressing or suppressing object states. These mechanisms provide for selectively detailing a subset of things while still maintaining the high-level context of the details.OPM provides a new framework for specifying design intents and capturing the complexity of hardware and software interaction. Through OPL, it is possible to translate the process into a machine executable code. In addition, OPM can capture the dynamic behavior of the hardware attributes and software states in a single integrated graphical and textual language that is understandable by domain experts who have no programming experience. These traits of OPM ease the development effort for evaluating the system reliability during the design stages. Simulation and testing protocols can be automatically generated though future extensions of OPM to reduce lengthy system verification efforts.The main benefit of OPM is its ability to identify system objects, processes, and the relationships among them in a structured way. The resulting OPD set becomes an excellent framework for identifying how to implement structural and procedural improvements. The resulting OPL script provides a well-defined set of existing and future specifications for the system. The ability to freely switch from text to graphics and back is of great value to understanding the system as a whole with a single graphic and textual model, without the need to consult various models and carry out mental transformation among these various models.Based on my personal experience, the following points highlight the benefits OPM can bring to the particular projects described in this paper.1. OPM is an excellent way to represent daily activities, products, processes and other complex things2. OPM has allowed representing the complete system with its various aspects in a single model. The model specifies the systems function, structure and behavior aspects without sacrificing clarity.3. OPM can be used as a common language to exchange design among members of a team.4. Since OPM design is visual and textual at the same time, it is easy to explain the design.5. OPL is very easy to generate from OPD6. OPM will be a good tool for documenting the existing processes and as ISO documentation."},{"Title":"Object-Process Methodology","review":"Read this for the entertaining and intellectual experience.

I highly recommend this book to all parents, caregivers, teachers and other professionals who work with children who have disabliities similar to Down Syndrome, because the experiences of these boys could cover a broad spectrum of disabilities, not only Down Syndrome.

She has Down Syndrome. This book has helped me gain perspective on what her future holds. I guess the authors did what they set out to do. They taught someone (me) about their disability and what it is like to have it. Thanks for writing the book. And, they had a great editor. You could hear their disability in their writting without taking away from the flow of the book."},{"Title":"Count Us in: Growing Up With Down Syndrome","review":"I purchased this book for a class i am taking on educating students with special needs. The book is an interesting read because it provides a different insight into their lives. It is hard to imagine what it would be like growing up with down's syndrome and this book provides a glimpse (although inherently confusing) into that aspect. This book is a great read for anyone thinking about becoming a special education teacher."},{"Title":"Count Us in: Growing Up With Down Syndrome","review":"I read this when my son was a baby and the book was new. I couldn't relate to ANYTHING about these boys lives. As a woman, I just couldn't relate to their male view of the world. We did not share any interests either. This book might be more appreciated by an adult male relative, professional, or family friend, but I wouldn't recommend it for a teen. It is nice that these two boys with DS are so capable, but their book would be more interesting for someone that shared their viewpoint and/or interests. If you are a woman, read something more uplifting."},{"Title":"African Genesis","review":"For those dissatisfied with the ludicrous baggage of the world's gods and religions in seeking answers to questions on the origin of mankind and the source of human behaviour, Robert Ardrey is a good place to start. Though some of his conclusions are now outdated by modern research, no one has written with more poetry and skill on this topic than Ardrey. Throughout his quartet of books on human origins and behaviour [African Genesis is the first of the four] Ardrey shows how mankind is less of a fallen angel and more of a risen ape; and that man truly is still only a halfway house between the ape and the human being.After a Broadway flop American playwright Robert Ardrey [author of the play Thunder Rock and the script for the film Khartoum among others] toured East and Southern Africa in the early 1960s. This was a time when astonishing fossil discoveries were being made in the Olduvai Gorge by the Leakey family and by others showing that humanoids had originated in Africa some 2 million years ago. Ardrey talked to the fossil-hunters, the palaeontologists and the anthropologists and learned all he could of the new discoveries and their implications for human origins and behaviour.Ardrey's main thesis is that mankind was born in Africa over 2 million years ago, and for most of that two million years the species' success has been largely dependant on its ability to kill. Without that underlying hard edge the species would have vanished aeons ago along with all the others that failed to survive. And only if we take that unpalatable truth about ourselves into account can modern mankind be truly understood.In this book Ardrey's hero is Australian-born palaeontologist Raymond Dart who discovered and named the first Australopithecus Africanus skull in the 1930s, and who correctly identified Africa as the first home of the human species and A. Africanus as a human ancestor in the face of ridicule and rejection by the scientific establishment for 30 years. The book is moving and beautifully written. If you want to understand human nature, and the possibilities for both the past and the future of the species, there is no better place to start than African Genesis."},{"Title":"African Genesis","review":"African Genesis is a book that deals with experiments, scientific facts, and evolutionary developments. Even though its old you still have to respect all of the different information in this book. Ardrey's first explanation's are the importance of territory. He used two studies done by other Anthropologists. One with ants the other with birds. The red ant experiment was done by Eugene Maris, it was simply a little bridge that the ants wouldn't cross to leave their territory, but would cross when coming back. Eugene Maris's other works are explained in great detail in this book. His other experiments were more interesting. The bird experiment, done by Eliot Howard, explained the importance of a male establishing its territory before anything else; with birds and apes. It explains an error in Darwin's teachings of man, claiming that sexual tendencies are the first priority. Howard, in all his long career, never knew of a male bird, with territory, to lose a mate; nor a male bird without territory to gain one. Ardrey shows some of these same examples later in the book with gorillas.Its stuff like this that makes me believe evolution over creation. Reading though the chapters the relationships of us to Australopithecus africanus or erectus is amazing. According to this book A africanus was a carnivorous smaller type of gorilla, erectus was a vegetarian and was bigger than africanus. Ardrey's Romantic fallacy deals with many animals that had true emotions and showed some examples. You see its all evolution. The last chapter is a laudatory approach to free speech. Ardrey is humble about agreeing with him or not, but not to ignore natural sciences brought to us. We are an unfinished revolution he says. He continues and then relates back to Africa's origin of man. The next book I will look for is where this one left off; for this left off at our stage. I would have liked him to continue and explain how all the different races formed if we came from Africa. But that may be too much for this book. What matters is after you read this book you have a clear understanding of Darwin's decent of man. You know that evolution is a long process and has many debates (like Ardrey's 24 paragraph debate of evidence that the use of weapons is a human legacy from the animal world). Anybody that is interested in the evolution of man and African anthropology, you'll want to start with this book."},{"Title":"African Genesis","review":"For those dissatisfied with the ludicrous baggage of the world's gods and religions as the origin of mankind and the source of human behaviour, Robert Ardrey is a good place to start.

He ceaselessly anthropomorphosizes his animal characters far past where it's proper. This tends to detract from his overall arguments in today's more savvy readership.Still, Ardrey had a point to make. And it's a good one. The struggle for survival in the natural world is the game our ancestors played as well, and we're here because we were good at it - better than our ancestors competing for the same niche. That's why we're here and they're not.This book is also a starting point from which popular anthropology has its base. It was very shortly after this point in time that the Leakeys came into the public arena in a big way. So it's interesting to see where the forefront of the public view was at this point in time. There's a fairly decent summary of the work done up to that point as well. Fellows like Dart, who pioneered the field of modern physical anthropology, tend to get forgotten in the frenzy of activity that followed in the 60's and beyond. For these reasons, the book is worth getting.Finding Ardrey's &quot;African Genesis&quot; may be a chore. But the Amazon book search worked for me, ..."},{"Title":"African Genesis","review":"Robert Ardrey's book on human origins is remarkably well-written. That is both a feature and a possible disadvantage. He writes so well that error--if such there be--might be invisible. It is a fascinating book to read, if only for the writing.His thesis, that man was born to kill, and to kill with weapons made by his own hand--more or less--is hard to dispute, given history.The book came out during a time when the prevailing ethos required, and delivered, the peaceful, noble savage.Jane Goodall, among others, helped the ethos mightily with her first book about the Gombe chimps.Ashley Montague wrote a book implicitly challenging Ardrey's point.The ethos needed the peaceful, noble savage in order to have him, or his descendants, which is to say, us, corrupted by capitalism, male-oriented religions instead of the Goddess, republicans, Americans, or some other evil-of-the-day, without which everything would be so much better. If we had been then as we are now, who would we blame, and for what?I can recall one, if not more, novels about prehistoric man in which the Neanderthals stood in for the flower children while the oncoming Cro Magnons for the Marines and paratroopers fighting in Viet Nam. Not explicitly, of course, but the point was clear. We, Homo Sap, Cro Magnon, white, were evil.I was on campus at the time and got more than a couple of ears full of this.Ardrey is refreshing. He deals in facts. Some of them are no longer quite as certain as he thought. The sequence of pre-human ancestors and the association of tools, or not, upon which he depended for his thesis, have been changed. Whether that makes much difference to his point or not is hard to say, since we don't know much about the newcomers, including how they related to the pre-humans Ardrey used. And, in fact, we don't know that the currently-accepted view of the sequence is correct. And it is further possible that somebody other than, say, australopithecus, both used weapons and fathered the human race. In which case, Ardrey would be correct.He is fascinating in a number of ways, but some of the facts he presents are astonishing. For example, the types of bones of various prey found in a South African cave are grossly disproportionate to their presence in the prey themselves. Why lower jaws of small antelopes, and not the rest of the head? Why straight horns and not curved horns? The matched double dents in the heads of baboons, whose wounds fit the distal end of a medium antelope foreleg--grossly overrepresented in the bone pile--seem quite positive. The hyena skull choking on one of the bones shoved down its throat exhausts all possibilities other than that an angry australopithecus killed it.This idea attracts opposition still.Various television documentaries of our ancestors, either actors with terrific makeup, or superb animation, show the kind of pre-humans Ardrey discusses as unarmed victims of practically any other animal.Ardrey refers to a paleontologist calling fangs in a hominid skull, \\"tools for intra-specific aggression\\" instead of the dread \\"w\\" word, \\"weapon\\".Keeley and others are discussing war before history, or prehistoric violence, but considering only Homo Sap and only the last several tens of thousands of years. Even they are finding resistance, some transparently faulty reasoning.In some cases, the violence in primitive societies is laid at the feet of white interlopers, without whose baleful presence, all was peaceful and orderly.All in all, Ardrey makes a solid case that man is born to make, hold, and wield weapons. Whether subsequent research discredits his sequences or not, the case is well made and definitely worth reading carefully.This book is quite old. I'd be interested in a comment about why you were looking at a review of it.

A lot of hack writers have done war stories, adventure stories, and sea stories like these, but in L'Amour's case you know that he has actually been there, actually done that. I've read much of this author's work over the years, but this is probably my favorite of his books.Here is a working man that has actually travelled to the rough and wild places in these stories (and when they were much rougher and much wilder.) He has done the hard labor and endured the harder conditions. This is refreshing in a period when it seems that all working people are automatically assumed to be ignorant, if not stupid. Louis L'Amour was a working man that not only loved books the whole time he was working, wandering, and fighting, but he went on to become one of the best-selling authors of the 20th century.It is funny, back when I first read this book, before I had done most of my own &quot;yondering&quot;, I read them with a sense of awe, envy, and a grain of salt. Now, when I read them it is with a sense of recognition and validation. Yup, I recognise that situation, I recognise that character. He got it exactly right.

If you want to learn how to program, and I mean REALLY program, not just fooling around with little useless &quot;hello world&quot; type programs, then do yourself a favor, buy this book! This is the most complete treatment of programming that I have ever seen. It goes from the beginning, assuming no prior knowledge of programming, and by the middle of the book, you will be writting your own virtual computer, as well as a computer language and a compiler for it! The first 14 chapters are on C and focuses on structured programming. This is the most comprehensive treatment I have ever seen on the subject. It shows you how to 'design' software, and how to emplement and design useful algorithms to solve programming problems. Also the book is filled with highlighted tips on how to increase the performance of your programs, how to avoid common errors, software engineering tips, and how to write pretty looking code. Most books never even mention any of these things, and only contain useless snippits of code to show you the syntax. Unfortunatly, knowing the syntax of a language does not make you a programmer. The next ten or so chapters of the book introduce object oriented programming with C++. An intense treatment of the subject, while staying easy to comprehend and follow. And the last ten to 15 chapter cover gui programming with Java. You will learn how to write real multimedia applications! To make a long story short, this book is great in every way. All of its sections tie in nicely with each other and it flows well and easily. Also, the numerous examples tips, and excersises are great. Where most books make you do silly and useless excercises, here is one of the excersises from this book for example, in chapter 30 excercise 20 you have to write a complete gui drawing application. This just shows you how indepth this book goes. This book will teach you how to program. And the stuff you learn in this book can be applied to any other programming language. This book doesnt aim at just teaching you C, it aims at teaching you how to program, using C, c++ and Java as a tool. There is a big difference.

I would recommend this to anyone looking to get a handle on C and then move into the other languages."},{"Title":"C How to Program (3rd Edition)","review":"Most programmers come to C only after programming in other languages. If you fall into this category, this book is definitely not for you. For those of you who are unfamiliar with Deitel and Deitel, they publish books on a wide variety of programming languages and their treatment, right down to the examples and exercises, is identical in all. All their books are written to teach program design as well as the language in question. This is a waste of time for anyone who already knows how to program in at least one language. Buy this book only if you are absolutely new to programming in general and, for some reason, have chosen to learn C as your first language. Otherwise, you are much better off with Kernighan and Ritchie, Harbison and Steele, or Kenneth Reek's excellent book &quot;Pointers on C.&quot;"},{"Title":"C How to Program (3rd Edition)","review":"This book is used to teach the intro to C programming classes at my university.

I got this book for an extension class at UCLA, and for the most part it explains things fairly well. As other reviewers have mentioned, it provides lots of longer examples. It seems to be geared towards beginners, so it tries hard to be easy to understand.It does have some issues, however. The examples are so simple that they sometimes don't explain more complex issues. The file and string I/O information is seriously lacking. For example, there's no discussion of the problems with using gets for string input or fscanf for file input.In my opinion, this book works for learning the basics, but it's not all that helpful as a reference once you want to start writing real programs and need to get into the nitty-gritty."},{"Title":"C How to Program (3rd Edition)","review":"I am a student at a university, studying computer science.

At the end of each chapter there are lots of questions to get you to try out what you have just learned. Only half of these give answers, encouraging you to work it out for yourself. This helps improve self-study techniques and keeps the reader interested.The most important aspect of this book, though, is how it explains 'Top-down, step-wise' program design. This is one of the most important aspects of structured programming, however, many other books don't even mention this.It is obvious this book was written by programming teachers, not just programmers, because so much emphisis is placed on learning proper programming techniques."},{"Title":"C How to Program (3rd Edition)","review":"The book should be about C programming language.

There are many programming books I wouldn't recommend at any price! As with my review of the Deitel C++: How To Program, third edition, even more so if you're just learning C, I strongly recommend getting &quot;The C Programming Language, 2nd edition,&quot; by Kernighan/Ritchie. I had programmed extensively with Pascal in the &quot;real world&quot; (It's come a long, long way), and that both made learning C, as well as differences and similarities, vastly much more simple. If you're taking a C course, this book is an excellent reference. If this is the text used, there is no better text book for C. If you're teaching yourself, This should be your primary C programming book with at least the aforementioned Kernighan/Richie book. REGARDLESS OF HOW YOU'RE LEARNING THE C PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE, THE DEITELS ARE ACCESSIBLE TO THOSE OF US WHO USE THEIR BOOKS, ARE VERY RESPONSIVE AND QUICK TO REPLY TO QUESTIONS, COMMENTS, ETC. WHO CARES IF THEY'RE SUCCESSFUL? THIS AND OTHER OF THEIR MATERIALS ARE FANTASTIC, AND THEY CARE ABOUT PEOPLE--STUDENTS, PHDs, INDUSTRY PROFESSIONALS. I can recommend trash C and other books, but I'll pan them where they're listed. This book also contains a couple of brief chapters that provide C++ and Java concepts.

Programmers say its easy to learn Visual Basic, but its easy to learn any rogramming language as long as it is &quot;Deiteled&quot;.One, this book is three in one, that is it covers three programming languages in one book and in a fashion that a beginner/professional will find it very easy to read and understand. The book introduces you to C language it then detail the language with full examples and it will finish by showing you how C++ join in to this journey, it will detail again using examples that make you quickly grasp the language, finally Java will join and again the book shows you how you use what you have or dont have to Java your world.Two, in any of the covered languages it takes you to a point where you can link/connect those languages, so if you want just know about C++ and never touched C the book has a bridge already you will end up knowing both, the same for any combination of the three languages. If you just glance on chapters 3, 15 and 25 you will get an ideal of what are those bridges am I talking about.I personally liked the book because it explained clearly the foundation one needs to know to use any of the three languages, when you finish C or C++ or Java in this book and make your own program using say Java, its no gonna be a surprised to you to be able to make the same program using any of the three languages but a BIG surprise for someone who never used this book but just one day saw you reading a chapter about Java on this book.The book has made learning programming much easier and faster.I found examples are carefully designed to also be used as a good studying tool, you can also start from these examples (together with the explanations in the book) to build big professional programs.Finally I dont see the reason why the book should not be used as a reference since it has all the syntax explanations, keywords in all those three languages, quick examples showing how to use programming statements, advantages and disadvante of some operators etc."},{"Title":"C How to Program (3rd Edition)","review":"I cannot stress more forcefully how utterly terrible all Deitel/Deitel books are, both for beginner programmers and especially for experienced programmers. My first Deitel book was &quot;C How to Program&quot;, which unfortunately was the recommended text for a university programming course that was my first intro to C. What a horrible book that was. I didn't realize just how little substance there was in that book and what a poor job it did of explaining C until my first co-op job, when it dawned on me that even though I THOUGHT I had mastered C, based on that silly Deitel book, I was sadly mistaken. I had to learn C the hard way though my job, and when I looked at other C texts later on, I realized how bad the Deitel book really was. This book does not help you harness the true power of C - it seems more like a book on structured programming languages with the C language syntax. That is fine if you want to simply learn how to program for the first time and want to learn some basic C - it is NOT fine for those who want to really learn C and see what makes C a lot more powerful than other languages.All of the Deitel/Deitel &quot;How to Program&quot; books are very similar. I made the grave error of purchasing &quot;Java How to Program&quot; by Deitel/Deitel for another university course before I realized how bad Deitel books were, and I found the same silly recycled examples that they had used in &quot;C How to Program&quot; back in &quot;Java how to program&quot;. There is so much content that is re-used in &quot;Java how to Program&quot;. The Deitels are NOT interested in helping you understand the material well -they are only interested in making a quick buck. They wanted to bring their books quickly to the market, so rather than writing good examples and taking the time to teach each language the best possible way for that particular language, they simply reuse most of the content of previous texts they have written with some little alterations here and there.If their examples were actually good and helped teach you the language, I wouldn't care if they recycled them, but these examples are bad. They DO NOT demontrate the substance of the languages. The examples and long and drawn out, but that doesn't mean they are actually substantial. The examples are simply repetitious, long, and detailed WITHOUT substance. I enjoy details - usually, detailed examples help give an in-depth understanding of the subject. Unfortunately, in this case, detail is simply pointless and just lengthens an example that could easily be shortened. Why should you struggle with unnecessary long examples that require you to keep flipping pages back, and useless line-by-line explanations of code that do not explain WHY, but simply state things, when the examples can easily be shortened and simplified? The examples don't really help you grasp the subject material.The fact that they charge so much for their crappy books just adds insult to injury. If you want to waste your money and not learn much at all, go ahead and purchase Deitel books.Also note that &quot;C How to Program&quot; is definitely NOT for people who already know programming. It contains a couple of chapters (repeated, sometimes verbatim, in their other books, of course) of material suitable for people who have never ever programmed anything in their life. I found that highly irritating. For, most people, C will not, and should not, be their first programming language. I was forced to wade through chapters of endless minutia and on basic programming to make sure I didn't miss anything. These chapters would have been better spent concentrating on the actual C language.So to conclude, never buy any Deitel books. When I was in university, it seemed their books were the recommended texts for courses, which is how I fell into the trap of purchasing them, thinking that if they were recommended, surely that meant they were good books. How wrong I was. I will never understand why Deitel books are so popular with universities. This just goes to show you how out of step univerities (in Canada) are with the real working world. Save your money and look elsewhere."},{"Title":"C How to Program (3rd Edition)","review":"When i read the title, i thought the introduction for c++ and java would be one or 2 chapters at the most, i didn't know that this introduction would take a little more than half of the textbook. i was very dissappointed. i thought that all the book was covering C in more detail than others, and probably advanced topics on c. if i wanted c++ or java, there's alot of books that cover that, but i really wanted a whole 1000+ pages on c alone. oh well, i guess i have to go back to C primer plus. that' book is fully deticated to learn the c programming language.don't get me wrong, this a really good book, but don't by it and expect it to fully cover c."},{"Title":"C How to Program (3rd Edition)","review":"I think your book on programming is great! I have used it over and over again to answer questions as I move into learning Visual C++ and Java.

There are more better..."},{"Title":"C How to Program (3rd Edition)","review":"I should start off by saying that this book walked me through learning programming during my first years of university, and has been very useful to me. However, after I read the book several times, solved the majority of the exercises and went past the beginner stage, I came to realise that I still did not master the C language. My opinion is that this book is good only if you have to learn C AS A FIRST LANGUAGE, which was the case with me. I don't find this book to be adequate for a person who's already familiar with programming and wants to learn C, or they'll be interested in only a small portion of the entire book.A very big part of the book focuses on things that are largely not specific or relevant at all to C, such as of course the massive chapters on Java and C++, as well as numerous algorithmics and programming fundamentals. There are long chapters on programming basics such as control structures and conditional statements, things that in my opinion are generalities with no place in a C book. Sometimes the examples are quite misleading, with a lot of emphasis on general algorithmics rather than C per se. A typical example of this would be the bubble sort example which is used to demonstrate the application of C arrays and vectors; the focus is shifted from C to some random sorting algorithm, about which the reader could probably not care any less. And of course, as other reviewers point out, the introductions on Java and C++ have no place in a C book; it really gives the impression of a \\"value for money\\" and \\"all you can eat\\" type of thing. The last downside of this book is that it doesn't include the solutions to the exercises at the end of every chapter.The strong point of this book is its step-by-step approach to programming, which like I can mentioned earlier can be very useful to someone who has never programmed before. It can be a great programming reference for students as well as a guide for teachers. I would really give it 5 stars if the title had been different, e.g. 'Introduction to programming with C, C++ and Java', or something that would not mislead the buyer into thinking that they're actually getting a C book."},{"Title":"C How to Program (3rd Edition)","review":"Arrived on time and in the expected condition.

Better organization could have been implimented. There are too many &quot;Good Programming Practicees&quot; and &quot;Common Programming Error&quot; boxes to clutter up the pages. Perhaps some Chicago style referencing and a section at the end of the chapter would help clean up the regular text. --- Also some of the subjects used for the codeing examples, and some of the coding examples themselves should be simpler. In other words the code examples tended to be difficult to follow at times.Overall the book is keeper.

Beginning with the inside covers the book is rich in pictoral description. The endpapers are beautiful color reproductions of Diego Rivera's &quot;The Great City of Tenochtitlan&quot;, a lavish tribute mural of Aztec life that adorns the Palacio Nacional in Mexico City. The color is magnificent throughout the book and includes many artifacts left from the ancient Aztecs. The book also includes a great little glossary that includes a pronunciation guide to Nahuatl terms. The glossary serves as a fine introduction to the Nahuatl Language and it's phonetics. Although the authors and contributors are scholars, the book is easy to read for the average person interested in archaeology and Pre-Columbian life in Mexico. The color plates are some of the finest and include rare glimpses into Codex's that are housed in museums. A magnificent book to use as reference. The book is also a great source of information for further research as it includes a selected bibliography. An excellent view of Aztec life, it compliments any personal library.

For Sunny is now being held captive by Count Olaf and his troupe of villains, as Violet and Klaus are headed for their death off of a snowy peak. However, thanks to Violet's inventine skills, the two siblings are saved, and find that they must now make it up the slippery slope on foot. But when they meet a surprise person along their journey through snow gnats, a group of annoying Snow Scouts, who like to recite a drawn-out alphabet of the Snow Scout Pledge at any moment, and a snowy peak, the Baudelaires, along with their newfound friend, must rescue poor Sunny from Count Olaf's evil clutches, and solve the mystery of V.F.D. before it is too late. After all, one of their parents could still very well be alive. 5 stars.BOOK 11: THE GRIM GROTTO - When your last name is Baudelaire, it is a known fact that you will somehow stumble upon trouble, no matter how hard you may try and avoid it. When you're last name is Baudelaire and you're an orphan, stumbling upon trouble increases tenfold. Which is why the Baudelaire orphans (Violet, Klaus, and Sunny) know instantly after they begin floating along the Stricken Stream that trouble is lurking around some vicious corner. However, as they are not dolphins, seals, or fish, they did not expect their next bout of trouble to take place underwater. But, alas, that is exactly where they find themselves on their next dreadful adventure. Having come across a submarine that is filled with three crew members (Captain Widdershins, his step-daughter Fiona, and, lo-and-behold the Baudelaire Orphans old pal, Phil), the Baudelaire's enter the underwater vehicle, and begin their next journey. Within a short while, the three orphans learn that Captain Widdershins is a member of V.F.D., and they quickly realize that he is on their side, willing to help them discover the truth about the fire that took their beloved parents lives. However, when the orphans, along with Fiona (a young mycologist), prepare for a bit of deep-sea diving, they soon find that young Sunny has been infected with Medusoid Mycelium (a deadly fungi). Now, the siblings are searching for a way to save their baby sister from a very certain death, without many supplies. As if that weren't difficult enough for the Baudelaire's to endure, they have just discovered that Count Olaf is now trailing them under the sea, and plans on capturing them, and (you guessed it) claiming their fortune as his own. 5 stars.BOOK 12: THE PENULTIMATE PERIL - When we first met the three Baudelaire Orphans, they were splashing in tide pools along Briny Beach. That is, before their lives took a turn for the worst. Now, as we meet up with them once again in this twelfth volume, we again see them upon Briny Beach. However, this time things seem as if they are looking up, for they are in the hands of good - Kit Snicket. With the pregnant Kit in tow, the three Baudelaires are brought to the Denouement Hotel. A place kept in order by the Dewey Decimal System. The Hotel Denouement is the last safe place, and within a few days, each and every volunteer will meet up with one another, where they will celebrate the claiming of the sugar bowl over the hands of evil. However, with Sunny, Klaus, and Violet disguised as concierges, they soon learn - by using their \\"flaneur\\" skills - that many of the people lurking around the hallways of the Hotel Denouement are anything but good. In fact, it is while wrapped up in their clever disguises that the three orphans run into various terrible people from their past - from the unescapable Count Olaf, to the treacherous Vice Principal Nero; and the oft-times brainless Justice Strauss, to the carnival freaks known as Kevin, Colette, and Hugo. With a bit more detective work, and a little help from identical triplets Dewey, Frank, and Ernest, the orphans soon realize that while the upcoming gathering of volunteers is supposed to showcase how good triumphs over evil; the hotel is overrun by unkind masterminds who plan on wrecking the celebration. Now it is up to Violet, Klaus, and Sunny to make a very important decision...call off the volunteer gathering, or think up a way to triumph over the evil that has surrounded them ever since the day Mr. Poe informed them of their parents deaths. 5 stars.This may be quite an unfortunate series. However, it is with my great displeasure to announce that these last three installments, leading up to the end of the Baudelaire Orphans woes, are possibly the best in the series, setting the reader up for an end all to be all thirteenth tale that will hopefully leave the Baudelaires in safe hands once more. In THE GLOOM LOOMS, we see the Baudelaires search for and attempt to rescue their youngest sister, Sunny, from the evil clutches of Count Olaf and his troupe of freaks; we see Count Olaf's soft side as he giggles - in an unnatural, somewhat annoying way - in an under-the-sea submarine; and we watch as Violet, Klaus, and Sunny impersonate a trio of concierges in the confusing Hotel Denouement, where each floor is set up according to the Dewey Decimal System. It is in these three disgraceful installments that we delve deeper into the mysteries of the Baudelaires, the intrepid V.F.D., and Lemony Snicket himself, as he attempts to \\"Snicket-ize\\" each and every reader. As would be expected, THE PENULTIMATE PERIL sets the scene for the upcoming grand finale, and makes it quite clear that the end is near.Erika Sorocco"},{"Title":"The Gloom Looms: A Box of Unfortunate Events, Books 10-12 (The Slippery Slope; The Grim Grotto; The Penultimate Peril)","review":"Fast shipment, books arrived in new condition as promised.

Book 8 and 9 were exciting but less enjoyable to me simply because they have an odd feel to them, especially the carnivorous carneval.Book 1-4 were good, but for me the excitement begins with book five which really starts to unfold the mysteries of the baudelaires; the best parts of the SoUE are books 6,7, 10, 11 and 12.In 6 and 7, the characters begin to develop more, and the plot becomes more complicated and intertwined and more lively, characters such as Esme and Jerome Squalor, as well as the reappearance of characters from earlier books, make the story particularly enjoyable; and books 10 and 11 are the highlight of the series, with huge suspense and brilliant storyline, and even some genuinely happy moments. Perhaps one reason I like them better is because of the Baudelaires' growing independence from book 8 onwards, which makes allows for the story to become more adventurous.Book 12 holds the suspense and creates even more unanswered questions, but at the same time, with most of the characters from the books gathered at the same location, it feels like a kind of \\"resting place\\" before the finale in book 13. The end of 12, however, makes the reader really anticipate The End.Book 13 is good, but I believe has to be viewed in a different light from the rest of the series.

He hasn't worked in more than two years, is living in a garage apartment, neck-high in debt, and with an ulcer that just won't quit. So when producer, Herman Weintraub calls, he's eager to &quot;take a lunch&quot;, and hopeful that this might be the first step on his way back up the movie industry ladder. But, Weintraub has other plans. He's gotten himself into a big jam. It seems Arnold Fischbein, Weintraub Production's comptroller, who also happens to be Herman's ex-brother in-law has gone missing, along with forty million dollars of company money, and he wants Phil to play detective and find him before the &quot;suits&quot; do. Phil protests that he's no detective, writing about detectives isn't the same a being a real one, but Herman will hear none of it. He's desperate, and he'll pay big-time. Being a soft touch, Phil says he'll do his best, and with the little information Weintraub's given him, sets off on what turns out to be the misadventure of a lifetime..... Aptly titled, Richard Wolf's latest novel is about to take you on One Wild Ride. This is a comical, manic thriller, full of twists, turns, and more than a few surprises that will set you on the edge of your seat, and leave you there until you finish the last page. His intense and compelling story line is filled with vivid and entertaining scenes, and his characters are well drawn and engaging. But it's Mr Wolf's crisp and witty writing, and clever, irreverent dialogue that really makes this novel stand out, and once you start reading, be prepared to finish in one sitting. You just won't be able to put this book down! With a stunning conclusion and satisfying ending to tie up all the loose ends, One Wild Ride is a great read and a mystery/thriller that shouldn't be missed.

If you're already a fan, his latest opus doesn't disappoint."},{"Title":"One Wild Ride","review":"This is one great read! From the get-go you're in Phil Paget's corner rooting for him. Here's this decent, well-meaning out-of-work screenwriter who can't pay the second half of last month's rent. When a stereotypical, Hollywood producer summons him to lunch, Phil is dreaming of solvency. Instead, he is cast into the dark side of Hollywood, international intrigue, and momentary love/lust. All he wants is a way out, but a cadre of magnificently drawn characters move him from one subplot of life-threatening peril to another. Who they are and what they are after will keep you turning the pages. The characters crackle off the page and the suspense and fast pace keep you from putting the book down. That's one wild ride in itself. Additionally, Wolf's tongue-in-cheek treatment gives this story a totally different spin. It's a unique reading experience.

I think she does an excellent job of reminding us that people who move from project to project and company to company can be real assets in today's workplace. This is especially good news for Renaissance Souls: people who prefer variety and combination to concentrating on just one thing. Why? Because, as McGovern shows so well, the life of free agents is very different from that of workers sitting in one cubicle specializing in one thing for most of their working life. Free agents have to know their material, of course, but they also have to enjoy applying what they know to a variety of different situations. In addition, free agents need to be comfortable wearing several different hats. Who is going to spread the word about what they have to offer if they don't? Who is going to be sure that the finances are in order if they don't? Even if they hire accountants and make good use of the virtual free agent supports available on the Internet, they still are the one, and only one, making the final decisions and being sure what needs doing has actually been done. As a coach specializing in life design for people with too many passions to pick just one (read Renaissance Souls,) I have already been recommending Dr. Barbara Reinhold's book, FREE TO SUCCEED: Designing the Life You Want In the New Free Agent Economy and Daniel Pinks FREE AGENT ECONOMY. Now I will add McGovern's new contribution as well."},{"Title":"A New Brand of Expertise, How Independent Consultants, Free Agents, and Interim Managers are Transforming the World of Work","review":"I found this to be an invaluable resource for individuals who are practicing as independent consultants or just getting started.

If you read it with the television characters of Hawkeye, Trapper, BJ, Colonel Blake and Radar in mind, then you will find it dull. However, if you read it with the knowledge that this is a semi-accurate rendition of some of the absurdity and danger of having a surgical hospital only a few miles from the front, then it is very interesting.The jokes are still here but delivered by what seem to be disembodied voices, the reader is required to fill in the visual details. As a longtime fan of the series, I found myself visualizing Alan Alda and Mclean Stevenson delivering the lines. With that as a crutch, it is an easy task to bridge the difference between this book and the early years of the television series. When that is done, this book is a very good read as Hooker is generally translating his experience as a MASH surgeon in the Korean War to the printed page."},{"Title":"Mash","review":"I, having been a huge m.a.s.h. fan for years, absolutely loved the book \\"Mash: A Novel about three Army Doctors. The storys were funny and well written. The connection...the \\"Oh, that's why they did that\\" sort of moments abou the show were wonderful.The author was consistent in his stories. The characters were all well developed. The story could easily have been longer and the characters developed even more. All in all a great book. It expanded my view of the tv show."},{"Title":"Mash","review":"This is what started the movie and later the TV series. It is a bit different than the movie and TV series. Some of the characters were merged into one for the TV show and the movie, but if you want to see where it all started, its a great quick read at 180 pages! Also, it's not nearly as politically correct as the TV show was."},{"Title":"Mash","review":"This book is a great compliment to the movie. It goes into some of the detail for those who have unanswered questions about parts of the movie. Read the whole book in one sitting."},{"Title":"Mash","review":"The book differs greatly from the movie and even moreso from the televison serires that followed it. Even so it is a very worthwhile read."},{"Title":"Mash","review":"In 1970, the movie M*A*S*H was released and became a legend. But before the movie was Richard Hooker's crazy take on \\"Catch-22\\", entitled \\"MASH\\". Funny, sad and outrageous, Hooker explores the Korean War through the eyes of Capt. \\"Hawkeye\\" Pierce, Capt. \\"Duke\\" Forrest, and Capt. \\"Trapper John\\" McIntyre. MASH almost snags a *****, but an un-necessary ending takes it down; overall, it comes out as one book you won't wanna MASH to pieces."},{"Title":"Mash","review":"In my opinion, this was one of my favorite books to read. Maybe I liked it so much because I had already been an admirer of the television series before I ever even picked up a copy of the book, but not without giving credit to the brilliant writing and style of Mr. Hooker. It was a truly well-written story, which in my opinion was creative, truthful, and entertaining. Although it was about war, it did not focus totally on the war aspect, yet it did not completely deny the war component. Both parts of the story were what made it so unique and interesting to read. The characters were a mix of ordinary people, like you or me, drafted into the middle of no where. Their comical situations and heroic attitudes turned them into war heroes and idols. A lack of experience prior to the war, made each character vulnerable to \\"sticky situations\\" and by the end of the book, they would be prepared for anything. Throughout the story, a bunch of young \\"boys\\", turned into men."},{"Title":"Mash","review":"What can anyone say about this excellently written book? It transports one to Korea, as well as Japan, and often convinced me to go into medicine. Thank God sick people have been saved from that possible disaster: I am a singer, not a doctor. However, music was certainly played by Hawkeye and Trapper John's scapels, to say nothing of added seasoning with Duke and Spearchucker!I strongly recommend reading this one-of-a-kind book, but then spread your wings and read other MASH books; the best, in my opinion after the original, is MASH Goes To Maine, where all four surgeons from Korea are reunited to play more hijinks."},{"Title":"Mash","review":"This black-comedy of a crazy medical unit during the Korean War is an exceptional antiwar book that was made into an extraordinary antiwar film.

I found it very dry and not nearly as funny as I was expecting. Perhaps if I hadn't ever seen the TV show I would feel differently. If, on the other hand, you are more a fan of the M*A*S*H movie then you might be pleasantly surprised."},{"Title":"Mash","review":"If you were a fan of the television series M*A*S*H, then you would love this book. This book takes you to the beginning. It introduces the characters that we all know and love, and through third person perspective, the author depics the crazy antics of the characters. Revolving around Duke and Hawkeye, the book takes you through the routine of the crew of the Mobil Army Surgical Hospital , better known as the MASH 4077th. In my opinion, this book is a winner. Through the author's skills, you will become attached to the characters, and in the end, you will have a bittersweet feeling of the characters' departures in the end. The author spices the book up generously with the humor that is unique to the television series."},{"Title":"Mash","review":"As long ago as this book came out and with all the different iterations of MASH it was only recently that I picked up a copy of the book that started it all.Knowing the movie was based on the book I found myself surprised by how much the movie differed from the book. However many of the differences were perhaps necessary as the book had too many characters to track in a movie and some of the story lines were altered. For example, the Major Burns of the movie and TV show was a composite of several characters in the book. The part where the dentist contemplated suicide had a slightly different and cleaner plot line in the book than in the movie. The book jumped around alot and for that reason I had trouble giving it five stars.Interestingly enough, although he made money off the TV series, I understand Richard Hooker was not a fan of the show. His book was a spoof of the military and the strange ways the military did things during the Korean War (and since the Korean War for that matter). Mr. Hooker supported our effort in Korea and felt the war -- however terrible -- was justified. The series -- especially the last few years -- degenerated into a pacifist anti-war message.If I were to rate the different iterations of MASH I would rate it in the following order: 1. The movie was great; 2. The first four or five years of the TV series before it decided to preach pacifism; 3. The original book; 4. The last several years of the show when personally I could not wait for it to end."},{"Title":"Mash","review":"Former Korean war surgeon Hooker spent 11 years writing then trying to sell this book before he struck gold. He's clearly a first-time writer but this montage of characters and episodes he met in the war worked well enough to inspire a successful movie and long-running TV show, and is good, readable fun. Warning, don't expect Alan Alda or NPR here. The novel's Hawkeye Pierce and Trapper John are boozers and womanizers, though not misogynists or racists as some have suggested. The book takes absolutely no stance on this or any other war, just shows the dedication of men and women working hard to save lives under harsh conditions and play hard the rest of the time.Guarantee: the chapter that ends with Henry Blake stammering, \\"No, thanks, sir\\", will leave you laughing for hours."},{"Title":"Mash","review":"I read M.A.S.H. years ago and still pull it off the shelf for a good laugh.

In turns funny, poignant, crass, and sweet. Recomended reading."},{"Title":"Mash","review":"I thought that this book did a good job of mixing factual information about war situations like the Korean War with humor. The characters in the novel were both life-like and hilarious. I enjoyed it much more than the TV series."},{"Title":"Mash","review":"Richard Hooker's M*A*S*H is quite a diverse book. It is part dramatic documentary on Korean War combat surgery and the remarkable achievements of the surgeons in spite of their lack of field training, the indequate medical facilities with which they had to work, and the sub-human conditions under which they had to perform miracles.It is also an extremely broad farce. The human sacrifice of Shakin' Sammy and the Jesus Christ personal appearance tour (actually a beer-swilling, half-naked, bearded Trapper John lashed to a crucifix) are a couple of examples of the exaggerated comic stylings.This interspersing of drama and comedy makes this an interesting if somewhat unsual read and also makes it a perfect subject for dramatization. When it is in comedy zone, it is way out there. When it is in drama zone, it is quite serious. According to Hooker's forward, the surgeons in a MASH were exposed to many extremes. With his writing style, Hooker has exposed us to extremes as well.It is one of my favorite books and I highly recommend it to fans of either the movie or the TV series. The film captures more of the book's bawdy, ribald spirit. The TV show captures more of the sentiment.I also recommend &quot;MASH: An Army Surgeon In Korea&quot; by Otto F. Apel if you want the real story of what life in a MASH was. If you are a fan of the film/book/series and think you have an understanding of how rough it was back then, read this. It was a lot worse. An excellent read.Add both of these books to your collection and then thank your lucky stars this isn't 1951 and you are draft eligible."},{"Title":"Mash","review":"Like the characters within the covers, Richard Hooker's &quot;MASH&quot;, is not so much a work of art, but a piece of work and as dear Hawkeye is so fond of saying,&quot;the finest kind&quot;. This book proves the theory that &quot;the book is better than the movie&quot;, despite the fact that both the film and tv show were, perhaps, the best in their respective mediums. Put away your images from both and let Mr.Hooker take you to Korea. His prose is not the mystical, lyrical verse of some writers, but it is indeed a story, told masterfully. The characters are full of life, with enough kick to jump start your car, yet their wit is dry as the Sahara, just like the martinis served by the main characters, and prefered by the author himself. An easy read, if not an enjoyable one, that will make you laugh out loud and then, with a simple sentence, fill your mind's eye with the violence and destruction of war on the often forgotten participants. You will never regret the time spent reading this novel, nor will youever forget what it is about."},{"Title":"Mash","review":"Richard Hooker's story about three army doctors who deal with the stresses of meatball surgery in Korea is a great book. Never mind that it served as the basis for a movie and one of the most popular TV shows ever; if you think you know the story, you probably don't.The movie and the TV show loom so large in popular culture that it is almost impossible to write a review without some mention of the video version's of Hooker's work. What we find of the familiar names is that the doctors in the book are neither the anarchists of the movie nor the peaceniks of the series, but simply a few Type A personalities who don't have a lot of respect for authority and are stuck in a tough job without much to occupy their spare time. This is really a study in the difficulty of life performing meatball surgery mere miles from the front line, and the methods men use to cope with the stress of dealing with life and death situations on an hourly basis.I think the most compelling part of this book is the daily wait for the six o'clock helicopter. I won't disclose the plot details, but this little portion of the story breaks the life of the MASH down into its most basic elements.I have to say I enjoyed this book immensely. As is almost always the case with the book form of a story, the characters are so much fuller than they can be on screen. Hooker has a dry, witty sense of humor that is on display throughout the story, but he never fully allows the reader to forget the stress and the pall of death and destruction that hangs over the camp. Hooker establishes a fine line between humor and horror, and writes about three doctors who couldn't survive the latter without the former."},{"Title":"Mash","review":"Having seen the movie by Altman and the TV show by Alda, et al, I thought that MASH the book would just be a refresher course. I was not only incorrect but also surprised at the difference between the mediums. The book contains some pretty funny scenes that weren't included in the movie, of course (Where can you find a hooker with epilepsy?). And the telling of the football game was still hilarious. Overall, the material is still fresh after all of these years and incarnations."},{"Title":"Mash","review":"If you're a fan of the film or the TV show, MASH, you'll enjoy reading the original novel.I thought the movie was brilliant (I actually think it's better than the book) and I liked the TV show at first, until cast members started bailing out and were replaced by whining, \\"enlightened\\" characters who enabled Alan Alda to whine about the US Army and \\"War is Hell.\\" It would be akin to the Delta House from ANIMAL HOUSE organizing a peace rally or marching for civil rights. You get the idea.You'll see just how far off track the final seasons of the show went by watching the film and reading the original novel. MASH isn't as well written or satirical as CATCH-22 (good book, disastrous film), but it stays funny and interesting and doesn't overstay its welcome.Actually, the more buffoonish (Henry Blake) and clownish (Frank Burns, \\"Hot Lips\\" Houlihan) characters come off as more real in the novel. I know the film and definitely the show tried to avoid references to the Korean War (because they wanted the war to represent any war, like Vietnam at the time of the film), but I appreciated the short references to the Korean battles and such in the novel.If you're a fan, check it out."},{"Title":"Mash","review":"Richard Hooker's primary aim in writing MASH was to vividly capture the essence of what being a MASH surgeon was really all about. The book provides a lot of information about how these guys came to be MASH doctors, how the ARMY supported them-and how the ARMY failed to support them, and what the experience was like from the doctors perspective as a surgeon as well as a man, not part of the \\"regular army\\" but [pushed] into it involuntarily.Is this an antiwar book? Yes, in a way.It is an antiwar book to the extent that, through it's depictions of the results of modern warfare, it conveys true disgust with both war in general and the way the military handles its troops and soldiers. The antiwar message is more subtle than explicit.Is it a mad-cap comedy? Yes, in a way.The fact is that hooker uses comedy as one of many tools to convey the extreme conditions-of climate, of workload, of inexperience, of loneliness, of sheer terror-that affected the MASH surgeons experience during the Korean War as well as their responses to those conditions. Thrust, usually against their will, into situations often beyond their ken, in an organizational structure they neither respect or truly understand, the behavior of many was, at best, aberrant as opposed to their true natures. This perforce leads to inherently comic situations. Add that to the normal Army SNAFU culture (Situation Normal-All Fouled UP), and the recipe for comedy is auspicious...The book remains a very viable stand alone experience.If you are a fan of either or both the movie and TV series, I seriously recommend reading the book, It elevates the whole MASH experience to a new and more holistically satisfying level."},{"Title":"Mash","review":"The 1968 novel MASH was eleven years in the writing and promoting to a string of publishers all but one of whom rejected it. Novel's author H. Richard Hornberger, M.D. (1924 - 1997) gave himself the nom de plume of Richard Hooker. He had been a surgeon in a Mobile Army Surgical Hospital (MASH) during the Korean War (1950 - 1953). In his Foreword to MASH, author Hornberger/Hooker explained what the novel was trying to do:\\"The surgeons in the MASH hospitals were exposed to extremes of hard work, leisure, tension, boredom, heat, cold, satisfaction and frustration that most of them had never faced before. Their reaction ... was to cope with situation and get the job done. ... A few flipped their lids, but most of them just raised hell, in a variety of ways and degrees. This is a story of some of the ways and degrees. It's also a story of some of the work.\\"To be fair, the author delivers what he promised. He focuses on the lives of three MASH surgeons, all drafted U.S. Army captains who spend 18 months in country 1951 - 1953, two of them, Captains \\"Hawkeye\\" Pierce and \\"Duke\\" Forrest, putting in 15 months close to front lines 45 miles north of Seoul in the 4077th MASH. When they return to civilian life in 1953, they leave behind a third tent mate Captain \\"Trapper John\\" McIntyre, a chest surgeon. Trapper John has another six months to serve. Without his two soul-mates, he will probably have a gloomy time of it.The three friends, called Swampmen after \\"the Swamp,\\" the name for their bachelor officers' tent, preserve their sanity (sort of) under horrible working conditions, but their self-preserving eccentric, zany often anti-social behavior was apparently not typical of most of the suprisingly abundant medical personnnel attached to the 4077th MASH.The novel is a string of short stories and episodes of Swampmen pranks, usually humorous, interspersed among didactic descriptions of treatment of a variety of battlefield wounds usually caused by pieces of exploded enemy metal distributed in every imaginable part of the human anatomy.Characters are two dimensional at best. Arguably the worst feature of MASH are pedestrian conversations among the surgeons and other medical staff. Here is an early, typical, sample:\\"'My name's Duke Forrest. Who are y'all?''Hawkeye Pierce.''Hawkeye Pierce?' Captain Forrest said. 'What the hell kind of a name is that?''The only book my old man ever read was THE LAST OF THE MOHICANS, Captain Pierce explained.''Oh,' Captain Forrest said.'\\" (Ch. 1)Had MASH the novel not begotten a better 1970 film (directed by legendary Robert Altman) and an enduring eleven season (1972 - 1983) television series, it might be forgotten by now. Its writing rarely rises above average. Its depiction of character struggles to reach the second of two human dimensions.-OOO-"},{"Title":"Mash","review":"...and the early tv episodes with Rogers as Trapper captured the true chemistry as originally designed by Hooker. In fact, the Altman movie follows the 1st MASH novel quite well, down to the addition of the Spearchuker as a ringer in the football game and &quot;Suicide is Painless&quot;. If you are a true MASH fan, go back and read this. You will love it. If you are not much of a MASH fan, find it and read it anyway. It will make you a convert...."},{"Title":"Mash","review":"Richard Hooker's novel, MASH, was a wonderfully entertaining and simple read. I found it very hard to put this great book down. It was very funny in many parts, but also very serious and heavy in other parts. The chapters in this book are very similar to single television episodes. Each chapter deals with a separate mini-story, and they are all wonderful. Unlike the T.V. show, there is a third major character, Captain Duke Forrest. I wish that the T.V. show had included this great character, he was very important in the book. Frank Burns is only in one chapter, unlike the television show. It can be considered a good ting that this book is not exactly like the show, because then it would not be so original and special.For parents, I would not recomend this book to children, like the movie and T.V show, it has some rather vulgar scenes, but nothing to severe. The writing style is very simple. There are few great descriptions or epic dialogues. However, because of the simple writing, this book is very easy to read and enjoy. All fans of MASH should read this wonderful book. You will never regretting discovering this wonderful addition to the 4077th. If you do not know much about MASH, this can still be a very enjoyable book. It is a simple and wonderfully entertaining read that any one will enjoy."},{"Title":"Mash","review":"The novel is strikingly different in many ways from the film and the TV series which followed it. Some of the charcters are entirely different from the way they were portrayed in the move and Tv series. For instance, Colonel Blake and Father mulchahey are both much tougher characters than they are portrayed as being in the later vehicles. Major Houlihan doesn't play nearly such an important role in the book as she does in the film or series. Trapper and Hawkeye are like and yet not like their later versions. The book is very funny however and is well worth reading, and it is very interesting to compare it with the later and quite different versions. I don't know how Richard Hooker felt about the changes made to his characters in the later versions, but certainly this, the original book that started it all, should be read by any fan of the other versions."},{"Title":"Mash","review":"First book I've read where the movie was better than the original book. Don't get me wrong, there were some extremely funny scenes. However, Hooker just isn't that good of a writer. It shows, as the book gets better as it goes along.Hooker employs that basics of black comedies about war: ironic repitition of monikers, and presentation of absurdities with a stark descriptive style that highlights the absurd. That's all very nice, but there is no real common plot thread throughout the book. Characters appear and then disappear for sixty pages, so the gags at their expense aren't as funny; since we lose a sense of how uptight they are.Buy the movie with Donald Sutherland, and read Joseph Heller if you want a great black comedy about war."},{"Title":"Mash","review":"I remember sitting on the can one summer after my Freshmen year in High School and reading Richard Hooker's great novel about doctors in the Korean War and I remember laughing my buttocks off into the poopy.If you liked the movie (and the show, I guess) you will love this book. It's just like an extension of the movie and is a joyous read, like Jack Kerouac's On the Road-Wonderful reads.I don't really remember much about this great book, unfortunately, since I read it about 2 years ago, but I know it is DEFINATELY WORTH YOUR WHILE! READ IT! (you will most likely love it)."},{"Title":"Mash","review":"One of the few times I'd recommend skipping the book and just watching the movie. The book is so poorly written that it takes having watched the movie or the television show to fill in the gaping holes in the plot and character development.

I really enjoyed this, and breezed through it very quickly which is not the norm for me. Having seen the movie several times I found that I knew almost all the stories already, but that did not lessen the enjoyment of reading it.

This will be perfect for the Mash lover on my gift list."},{"Title":"Mash","review":"As a novelist with my first book in its initial release, I am fascinated by Richard Hooker's version of MASH. It is well known that Hooker had a most difficult time finding a publisher for the original book. The manuscript went through numerous revisions, found a home in a publishing house, and became a key part of American folklore. This book provides the original version of Hawkeye, Trapper John, Hot Lips, Radar, and most of the rest of the gang. There is more of Maine in these characters here than there is of Hollywood or Manhattan. Hooker's version is less political than the movie and far less socially correct than the latter years of the television series. While I personally prefer those golden latter years of the TV series, I still find this novel extremely enjoyable. Without this book, the great film and historic series would have never existed. American popular culture would much poorer if that were so."},{"Title":"Mash","review":"My knowledge of the characters and personalities greatly enhanced my appreciation for the movie and the series!

The narrative style is dry and lacks real engagement with the characters, like an amusing story being read by a dull narrator.The behaviour of the major characters is redolent of that of fighter pilots, i.e. all action one minute then time to burn the next, with that letting off of steam that is characteristic of the stressed out men. Whilst their circumstances I'm sure were horrific, I would have preferred however to have been serving a tour in the 4077th than tabbing a Bergen around the boonies, being shot at and shelled and the like! You can perhaps also imagine the freedom such circumstances could give to a young surgeon, as well, with the ability to try field expedient techniques to save lives that they might have been too cautious to try in more normal circumstances.It is perhaps unfortunate that in most peoples eyes, the series and the film takes up more room, but its good to read the novel and to gain some further insight into the characters as their author imagined them. I still picture the Series' cast when I am reading it though!"},{"Title":"Mash","review":"This book was a big hit and was turned into a hugely popular movie and even more popular TV show. So clearly, in its time, this book touched a nerve in a positive way.However, reading this book in 2012 is not such a transformational experience. Frankly, the book is deeply dated, politically incorrect (in a bad way, not a funny way), and just plain boring at times. The dialogue is occasionally mildly funny, and some of the incidents have the madcap sensibility that drove the TV show. But much of it is laborious and dripping with an arrogance of \\"boys will be boys\\" superiority. The heroes are not only nearly-perfect surgeons, but they can drink anyone under the table, gamble flawlessly, charm all the women, and excel in sports (they were all star football players at their colleges).But the truth is that you wouldn't like Hawkeye, Trapper, etc. They would be arrogant and would tease you all the time --- perhaps adopting you as a mascot. They surely wouldn't adopt you as a friend, unless you could drink a quart of hard liquor a day.I cringed over and over in the book with the men's casual sexism, racism, and cruelty towards anyone they perceived of as \\"regular army.\\" Though the book is trying to do a \\"Catch-22\\" version of showing the absurdity of war, it does it in a sophomoric manner. Unimaginable levels of drinking, following immediately (literally immediately) by 12-14 hours of surgery. Not very likely.In short, watch the movie, which maintains the hijinks but adds a genuine layer of pathos, or watch the TV show. Don't read the book."},{"Title":"Mash","review":"Richard Hooker was actually Joseph Hornbaugh who died several years ago-he was a highly entertaining writer and I enjoyed the original MASH but if you can find a copy of \\"Mash Goes to Maine-he was trained at the East Orange, NJ Va Hospital by my father who died in 2007. The author died a few years later. In the MASH goes to Maine-the author was transplanted to Maine and in the book refers to that \\"SOB Chief of Cardiothoracic Surgery at East Orange VA Hospital\\"-he was referring to my father who just reveled in it. In some of the other books the major part of the writing was done by guest writers. I have seen several books in the orders section that I have never seen before-was wondering if anyone heard of a contract for others to ghost write these newer books-I have not seen what year they were written. I loved the fast paced need to pay attention scripts-it requires really paying attention and not the juvenile writing we see much of now. If you can find it, \\"Mash Goes to Maine\\" is right up there with the original MASH book."},{"Title":"Mash","review":"This delightful book is just as good, if not better then the TV show which is based on it. A must read for fans of the televison show. Hooker makes you feel as though you are there laughing, and crying rightalong with the unforgetable characters of the 4077th Mobile Army Surgical Hospital."},{"Title":"Mash","review":"This book was unbelievable: satirical and humorous yet showing the horrors of war through the bloody operating room scenes. For example: Trapper John and Hawkeye leave for Tokyo to operate on a Congressman's son and play a little golf in ridiculous costumes; finding out if Hot Lips' hair is naturally blonde; and catching mermaids. There are also briefly shown characters who just add to the melee of escapades: Major Houlihan, Roger the Dodger, and Frank Burns. This book should be read by every person who calls themself a &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; fan. Judy :-)"},{"Title":"Mash","review":"Not a great book. Not a bad book. It seems to be trying to be as clever as \\"Catch 22\\" (the comparison is inevitable), but doesn't quite get there.I recommend it for fans of the movie and TV series because it's interesting to see the source material, but both the movie and TV series improved on the book."},{"Title":"Mash","review":"The type of humor: people with sense having expense at those who don't. Subtle puns. The \\"wait, what?\\" effect - i.e., situations that are funny because they don't entirely make sense.This is not an anti-war book. So someone reading it to find a criticism of war in general, or Korean War politics in particular, should look elsewhere (Catch 22? Any Vonnegut?). Nor is it plot driven - it has minimal continuity.But it is a series of hilarious episodes that at the same time swear off stupidity in all its forms: arbitrary rules, silly military customs, racial questions (a bit), charlatans, hacks, and most of all people who take themselves too seriously.One of my favorite books, which I reread middle-end-beginning-middle any time I should pick it up."},{"Title":"Mash","review":"This is an absolutely awesome buy! Whether you're a M*A*S*H fan or not, this book will have you chuckling for hours. Very well written with each chapter, in a sense, serving as its own short story (kind of like the episodes in the TV show). I'd recommend this book to all M*A*S*H fans and anyone, really, who likes sarcastic humour, over-the-top pranks, and even those who have an interest in medicine/surgery.The book itself is soft-cover with medium-large print and is probably a fairly quick read for even an average reader. (^_^)"},{"Title":"Mash","review":"Richard Hooker's M*A*S*H should well go down as a classic. It's even funnier than the movie or the series, yet it can also be touching. As hilarious as it is, there is always the constant reminder that a horrific war is going on. The reader soon realizes that the antics of Hawkeye and Trapper are not just for their amusment, but are mechanisms to retain their sanity in a world gone mad. A must read for all interested in life, war, or humour."},{"Title":"Mash","review":"This is the book that gave birth to the everlasting TV show and classic movie. Looking down at my shabby, 3rd or even 4th hand paperback copy, it's hard to believe that THIS IS IT. But, it is, and it is also so much more. If you are looking for laughs, you'll find them here. Hawkeye, Duke, Trapper, Hotlips and Radar do not disappoint in the humor department. But, look beyond that and you'll find a raw, poignant story of men and women doing an almost superhuman job in conditions that make our nightmares look weak and inadequate by comparison. Warning, this book will make you want to cry as often as it is sidesplittingly funny. Underneath the running patter of boredom fighting pranks and verbal sparring is a souldeep look at the doctors, nurses, support crew, and patients who fought so hard to keep death and insanity from winning. And, MASH is a winning book about this fight. Highest recommendation..."},{"Title":"Mash","review":"This book instilled all of my emotions, from humour when Hawkeye and Trapper go to Seoul or when they fix the football game, to sadness when they leave to go home. I highly recommend this book for everyone who's ever read anything."},{"Title":"Mash","review":"I'm guessing, like most people these days, I read the book after seeing the series and movie. This brings us to the question...how do you review something that appears to be a reflection but is in actually an original? If we strip away the TV show and movie, what we have left is a series of memories about very young doctors trying to cope with the red tape and red blood that war always brings. The book reads like a series of old war stories with Richard Hooker as our M.C., harking back to his salad days as a M.A.S.H surgeon. The stories are loosely strung together giving the appearance of a plot, but the book is really nothing more than the often funny, sometimes sad, but mostly true tales of doctors on the front line in Korea.Compared to the movie, M.A.S.H., the book is almost identical in tone and content. All the characters are the same and the majority of stories in the book end up in the movie. The one big difference is that the movie took an anti-Vietnam tone. The book shies away from this, aside from showing that war isn't as stupid as the people running it.Compared to the TV show, the book comes off rather weak. What the book did well, the TV show excelled at.What the book does better than the TV show and movie did is that it explains better the arrogance and spontaneity of the doctors. Arrogance and spontaneity not brought on by confidence and experience, but rather by youth and inexperience. These were slightly older kids operating on slightly younger kids. And the result is one dark but funny memoir."},{"Title":"Mash","review":"For anyone who has seen the tv show MASH this book is not like the show. The movie is just like the book. I expected more from the book but it does cover Hawkeye's deployment from the time he arrives to be stationed with the MASH unit until the time he returns to the air port to go home."},{"Title":"Mash","review":"Like several others, I too read this book after having seen the movie and gotten hooked on the TV series.Like one reviewer, there came a time when I noticed the difference in tone between the book and movie on one hand, and the series on the other hand.Unlike other reviewers I don't see anything in the movie that is anti-Viet Nam War. I know that Robert Altman has said that he made it as an anti-war movie, and realize now that they did go out of their way - for the most part - to avoid specific references to Korea (but there were still one or two).However, I do not see the movie as anti-war anymore than the novel was anti-war. Moreover, we can put it more strongly than that, for Richard Hooker has described himself as supporting US involvement in the Korean conflict. It was not the war that he lampooned; it was the Army and its rigidity. The Army expected its MASH outfits to be models of military discipline (as beautifully expressed by Sally Kellerman's Hot Lips 0'Houlihan in the movie), and Hooker's main characters literally attacked that notion with their game-plan going in, well rehearsed by Hawkeye and Duke as they drove to their new assignment: to outclass all other surgical talent in the area, and use that as a license to raise hell whenever they felt like it. In their own way, they were way ahead of their time. The only way to make a MASH unit work the way it was meant to in the O.R. was to keep the authoritarian Army dictatorship at bay the rest of the time. The fact that these surgeons could essentially blackmail the brass into letting them get away with murder was actually a good thing, Hooker argues. War is a messy business in more ways than one, and if the Army expected the MASH to support the war effort, it was going to have to stay out of its way and let it run itself.I found the movie to be quite faithful to this \\"message\\". I found the TV series to be quite unfaithful to it, especially in later years, when it became a soapbox to speak against war itself. Now, there's nothing wrong with being anti-war, but it was a perversion of the original in this case, as Hooker let it be known around the time \\"Goodbye, Farewell, and Amen\\" was broadcast.MASH was intended to be anti-Army bureacracy, not anti-war. If Alan Alda wanted to make an anti-war TV series, he should have started with different material."},{"Title":"Mash","review":"I read the novel after having seen the series and film. I read it when I was 19. It made a bigger impression on me than the movie or series. The basic message being: if you're great at a particular skill, you can use your clout to manipulate the system, and enjoy it's frills.I've used this strategy in a number of ways in my life. It's been a great help. The only part that irked me was the fact that, while in Korea, all the \\"heroes\\" of the series and movie (those featured) cheated on their wives and drank like horses. All returned home to loving families who never guessed anything out of the ordinary had happened. It's a sub text I figure few have examined.I was also intrigued that my copy of the book listed at least ten other MASH book by Richard Heller. I've always wondered what the content and quality of the other titles was."},{"Title":"Mash","review":"This book was entertaining because it is different from the movie and the show. It may seem a little boring at first, because there's no real plot, but the humor is funny. It's also fun to compare the book's characters with those from the movie and TV show. The humor takes a little thinking to get, but then it's hilarious. It also spawned 14 novel sequels. This sets the stage for the unforgettable franchise. (Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because there are some parts where you don't know where it's going. Don't let that discourage you, though. This book is a treat.)(...)"},{"Title":"Transylvania Red","review":"Bert Quint's Transylvania Red is a nicely crafted international thriller set in post-communist Romania. As a tourist boom flourished about the lands that birthed the legend of Dracula, a very human evil wreaks a bloody trail of murder compelled along with an unholy lust for money, in a dark and twisted saga of crime in the name of capitalism. Transylvania Red is a highly recommended and original novel that is a compelling read from first page to last!"},{"Title":"Transylvania Red","review":"Whether he was riding in a tank or ducking bullets, Sam Sloan was a tough foreign correspondent that could handle any challenge to consistently bring home the story. Unfortunately, he has become a dinosaur in a competitive age when newsmakers produce the news in minute-forty bites packaged for the masses. Now New York producers have relegated Sloan to a Polish exile. Even that position proves inconvenient, however, to New York producers intent on presenting an entertaining story when a Dracula theme park plans to open in Transylvania. So Sloan and cameraman Camden must accept Peter Stark, a young, vibrant, attractive news clone that makes a pretty presentation for the camera. Peter, however, is ill equipped for the secrets that come his way.Zoe Paranduru a translator provided by the National Organization of Tourism, and her mysterious boss Nicolae Balaur join the news team. Soon the news team learns of the ancient stories of Vlad Tepes, or Dracula, who bears a startling resemblance to a modern counterpart. Dracula mercilessly reduced the population dependent upon welfare in his day. In the modern era, during the communist reign, such dependents, as well as dissidents, and children, were relegated to government control. Over the years, without paperwork or records, they have been largely forgotten. But with the fall of communism and the advent of capitalism, they have fallen victim to a diabolical money making scheme.Author Bert Quint creates a stunning cross genre novel that will keep readers glued to the edge of their chairs in TRANSYLVANIA RED. This masterfully woven tale includes a dash of romance, a hint of paranormal, and heavy doses of intrigue and suspense to keep tension high. Each strand of the plot reveals hidden motivation and a backdrop steeped in history and the supernatural to create a chilling tapestry of cruelty and evil. Yet the deft touches of black humor and highly believable characters give the novel unexpectedly amusing moments, odd juxtapositions, and stunning realism. TRANSYLVANIA RED comes very highly recommended."},{"Title":"Crescendo: Welcome Home, Death Awaits","review":"The moment Ms. Wood correctly used 'blood spatter' to describe what most laymen mistakenly refer to as 'blood splatter,' I knew she had done her homework.

Even before he finds revealing documents in the old family home, he is a ticking time bomb ready to explode and we learn that he has fallen victim to a generational curse that haunts his father's bloodline.Or has he?This man's vivid nightmares drive him to the brink of madness and at times, James is hard-pressed to separate his dreams from reality.

When James' friend Pete senses his mental fragility, he sees the perfect opportunity to exact revenge for James' affair with his wife in the months before her death.Crescendo is a masterpiece, an exciting, wide-eyed look into the psyche of a killer. As someone who has studied psychology and psychopathology as it relates to crime, I found Ms. Wood's story riveting, intriguing and very well-written. It was a thought-provoking read that, for me, renewed the age-old argument of heredity vs. environment and whether or not our destinies are predetermined.

James is about to receive empirical proof of this maxim in lurid detail.L. Marie's Wood's first novel entitled \\"Crescendo\\" is a compelling love bite upon the imagination whose swiftly-paced storytelling and visceral atmosphere will leave you thirsting for the story to continue. \`Crescendo\\" is the best kind of fiction; that rooted in universal themes and subjects that often are often unnerving, sometimes ugly, but always easily related to by the reader. Its tale burns all the hotter for the perfect plausibility of it all, since readers will find themselves thinking, as I did on so many occasions throughout my read, This could happen.Wood has fashioned a horror tale born of an expertly interwoven m&eacute;lange of subtexts and underplots that challenges the very nature of trust, fidelity, and madness, and brings the reader nose-to-nose with smart characters who are never so human as when they are acting-and in many cases, reacting-inhumanly to one another. \\"Crescendo\\" leaves no relationship untested, be they friendship, marital, or familial in basis, and readers will empathize with these characters, many of whom embody the shaking anger and duplicity and impassioned resentment that every reader has known at one time or another. Here at last is a novel that doesn't let us turn away from the mirror just because the image it reflects is dirty.

When on the outside things seem normal enough, your typical suburban lifestyle by all appearances; however, on the inside, darkness is brewing a nasty treat. If you really want the answer, I invite you to look into the mind of James Adams in the novel Crescendo.In her debut novel, author L. Marie Wood allows her readers a close look at the struggles to stay in control of reality while his nightmares begin to take such a grip on him that he can hardly tell the real from unreal.

It is when he starts to get close to those answers that Ms. Wood takes hold of the reader with such vivid details and drags them down further into the pit of horrors that has become Adams' life. His only grip on the real world is his wife Andrea, but even that bond is threatened due to both his past actions and her growing concern for the sanity of her husband.

Marie! Crescendo is a horror lovers dream. Unlike most horror novels, Crescendo does not rely on gore (although there are gory moments) to grasp and hold the readers interest. This novel transfers the reader into a deep, dark psychological realm. You actually share in the horror that the James (the main character) experiences.

I LITERALLY had to force myself to finish this book. The characters were one dimensional (did any of them even have day jobs?) archetypes (long suffering wife, betrayed best friend, unfaithful murdered wife of best friend - *yawn*) writ large, and I found I really didn't care one way or the other what happened to any of them. The amount of detail used in describing places and objects was overkill and really took away from the flow of the story - such as it was. What she wrote in 350 pages could've been summed up in less than 200 by a more masterful writer.

I have been utilizing this book in my corporation for the past 8 years. It has proven to be of incredible value. It has facilitated team building, as well as great productivity among our teams. It also has provided an important resource for resolving problems in our corporate culture. All of the 4 skills are very important. Although, I posted a chart of Skill # 3 in my office: and this pie chart with the various qualities has proven to be very helpful at any given moment. There have been times (just in passing) where our Vice President and our President walked into my office, and were looking for an idea on how to effectively approach our current challenges. This pie chart (for skill three) has always had at least one (or more) recommended behaviors that became the perfect remedy to our challenging situation. Cultural Competency is what makes one internationally valuable in the global markets. This book has strengthened Cultural Competency in my teams in many, many different ways. This book will help anyone who truly puts it into practice with a good spirit. One of the many values of this book is in putting it into practice (daily). I especially like Dr. Hogan's common sense, her realism, as well as how she illustrates the need to practice Cultural Competency. This is a practical book that is more than theory, it gives one the \\"HOW TO\\", when it comes to being culturally competent.

It is ideal for anyone interested in the subject matter, health classes and anyone from their teenage years up who should know about the king of illegal drugs in circulation and their effects. This book is incredibly informative and very professional. While it is not geared toward entertainment, this book contains many interesting facts and certainly provides very factual, and arguably, need to know information for today's society. This book covers everything about all kinds of drugs from cocaine to marijuana to alcohol and morning glory seeds. It includes information about where these drugs are grown and processed, where they are traded, their uses, legality of the drugs, the drugs effects and what is being done, if anything, to stop their circulation.Some of the information contained in this book is fairly basic, but it also contains information regarding the chemical nature of the drug, the species from which it originates and other specific facts. For example, this book explains that a BAC level of over .5% can be lethal and that Heroin is a semi-synthetic drug that was made from Opium with the intention of being a non-addictive form of morphine. One of the most interesting things that I learned was that in the United States, Marijuana is the second largest cash crop and is often grown in the woods surrounded by booby traps to keep people out. In an effort to stop this illegal pot growing, the U.S. decided to spray a type of weed killer called Parquet over land which is lethal to humans. This practice was eventually stopped because of its dangerous nature.This book also contains many pictures which make the reading go faster and add realism to the text. The picture captains are often direct quotes form the text which, while not necessary eye-catching, emphasizes points and connects the pictures to the information being presented. The book even has pictures of drug raids, drug cultivation and people using the drugs.In this book you will find a pretty unbiased account about the facts about psychoactive drugs. Even though the author, Alan Theodore, does not seem to be persuading you no to take drugs, the facts in this book seem very clear.

Donnelly says to let your caring and concern show, be available, say you're sorry about what happened, allow them to express their grief, encourage them to be patient with themselves, allow them to talk about the child, give special attention to bewildered siblings, reassure them that they did all they could, and talk about the endearing qualities of the child.Don't point out that the parents have other children (no child can take the place of another). Don't say they should be grateful. Don't avoid mentioning the child's name.

I gained much new understanding when I read &quot;Method&quot;. What is wonderful about this book is that a person never having read ONE book about the guru-disciple dynamic can pick up this book and get a crystal clear description of what REALLY goes on in this mysterious relationship. Master Adi Da details in such everyday yet precise language, the nature of the Guru and explains WHAT is so unique about that nature and how and why it serves the spiritual aspirant. Have you ever wondered why people seemingly turn over their lives, their volition etc. to someone who appears to be a mere charismatic leader? This book clarifies for ANYONE what exactly is given over to a true Spiritual master and what is received by the true devotee. In one section, Master Adi Da describes the guru functioning like a light moving over a dark well (the devotee's subconscious) and stirring up all of the heretofor hidden impulses, thought processes and emotional patterns that charecterize each devotee. I can attest to the validity of this phenomena...as can many spiritual practitioners throughout the ages. One of the things I appreciate about this book is that it illuminated for me just what has been going on in this age-old relationship of Master-disciple from Krishna to Jesus to various Buddhas and finally Adi Da himself. He even describes his own gurus' work with him in terms that are immediate and grab the reader in a vital way. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is even remotely interested in the subject of Spirituality and its processes. By the way, this book also contains passages that are very funny!"},{"Title":"The Method of the Siddhas: Talks on the Spiritual Technique of the Saviors of Mankind","review":"This powerful little massmarket paperback came out in the mid-1990s, and is now out of print, although used and remaindered copies are still out there. Officially, it has been replaced by Book Five of the 17 Companions of the True Dawn Horse: \\"The Divine Siddha-Method Of The Ruchira Avatar\\". Sadly, that book has not yet been published, even though some of the other volumes in the Companions series came out as early as the late 1990s.Some of the essays in this book have been revised and have been published in other \\"Source Text\\" books. For example, \\"Money, Food and Sex\\" appears in \\"He-and-She Is Me.\\" Others are available only in this massmarket paperback. And a very powerful little book this is: the entire history of mankind and the universe are covered clearly and simply in a little more than 500 pages. It is probably still one of the best single-volume introductions to the Adi Da's work, especially if you're a left-brained linear-thinking type of person.For five bucks or so, you can take advantage of an infinite amount of wisdom. This is one of the greatest bargains of all time.Some of the Marketplace copies listed here are actually the 1973 or 1992 trade paperback editions. The earlier one came out very early in the Adi Da's teaching period, so obviously it's missing a significant amount of newer material.

What it accuses as narcissistic to those that rebel can be the very lens to see those that obey. And so the Eastern thoughts of inward relative diversity are framed under fundamental unity which does not tolerate autonomy.According to Adi Da, anyone who is not in satsang with him is practicing Narcissism. That is the higher paradigm here. Adi Da is a divine incarnation of the god Da and only where all conceptual inquires, all seeking, all efforts at spiritual development are meaningless unless they are in satsang with \\"me\\" and thus the only and absolute alternative is by living within the communal relationship with Adi Da and his devotees. And so this really is a Cult with the control that does not tolerate the two cardinal rules, to first, think for oneself and second, to question authority. And almost all cults have good points to offer within their paradigms.And the paradox here is that the trees inside this controlling and limited forest bring out some profound points. Some of these include the idea of community relationship with Adi Da in simply a moving, playful, spontaneous relationship in the present moment as opposed to simply intellectual analysis of spiritual growth and that the idea of seeking is part of the problem itself. Here it is letting go of the seeking, which is based on suffering from a moving thought created mind, into now a nonconceptual movement within ordinary life, not some spectacular satori or nirvana but the ordinary life here and now perceived in its now enlightened awareness and paradoxically in this world of the mundane. Also the idea that we are sleeping in a dream and waking up is not seeking for solutions, as solutions are merely those inside the dream, where as to wake up is simply an awareness, again, only in satsang with \\"me.\\"And while there are these and many other rather insightful and profound points, they are to the objective reader, contaminated with the control of satsang with what appears to be only a man, a man who both claims to be a god-man and is worshipped as one by many followers who have separated themselves from those not part of the satsang community with Adi Da. Now I am only an ignorant human and Adi Da may just be the incarnate of a divinity, so one can not judge or know any more as an ignorant human being reading this book, for it does not put one in Satsang with Adi Da, as this comes only with personal and direct communication.In this paradigm there is negative views on solitude and nature mysticism, labeling all as narcissism, while Adi Da is claiming both divinity and absolute devotion for anyone to obtain the \\"truth,\\" only in satsang with \\"me.\\" And so, to look at the trees, there are many moist and ripe, insightful in meanings, and then there is the forest, the forest which unites without individuality to a controlled environment, a life that lacks autonomy and condemns unity from diversity."},{"Title":"The Method of the Siddhas: Talks on the Spiritual Technique of the Saviors of Mankind","review":"This is indeed a wonderful book about the Guru-devotee relationship, but it is out of print.If you are interested in talks from the early years of Adi Da Samraj's teaching I found:&quot;Understanding&quot; [CD], and &quot;Garbage and the Goddess&quot; [CD] great listening.

Once I started reading it, every moment spent away from it was a trial! All I wanted to do was get back to it and find out what happened next! While this may not be a book that ends &quot;happily ever after&quot;, it does make us painfully aware of the poignant and tenuous nature of life and how unspeakably sad it can sometimes be. We identify with Martin at the same time that we abhor his sometimes thoughtlessly cruel behavior towards Missy. Etti's limited intelligence, and the fact that she is aware of it, makes us feel protective towards her and we are also moved by Pierce's love for his brother and for Etti. But finally it is Missy who moves us unbearably - we are left with an image of this totally helpless being, dependent on the whims of whoever deigns to look after her, however imperfectly. We may well ask the question, &quot;Why was she born?&quot; This story is a real tragedy, complete with catharsis. As for the writing, Anne Haverty is a wonder - her descriptions of nature are marvellous and the wry Celtic humor to be found in the story makes us smile but it is, above all, her ability to move us that makes her stand out from the crowd. The only writer I can compare her with is Patrick McGinley, a favorite of mine whose books are, unfortunately, mostly out of print these days. The reader who asks what the title means must have missed the quotation at the beginning of the book."},{"Title":"One day as a tiger","review":"Okay, I just don't get it.

Giving up his fast track career in the history department, Marty returns home to the family farm in Fasha, County Tipperary, run by his brother, Pierce, and sister-in-law, Etti. Marty's desire for a simple rural life puts him at a loss on how to fill his days besides occasional farm chores and the weekly night out at the local pub. Pinning for his sister-in-law, Etti, and a good-natured rivalry with Young Delaney, a boyhood friend, seems to be the only things keeping him going until he comes in possession of a genetically altered sheep he names Missy.This was a most unusual book and very enjoyable. The author gives us a wonderful portrayal of rural Ireland and its vanishing breed of small farmers. We are treated to an assortment of characters in the village of Fansha, from the sister-in-law from the wrong side of the tracks and almost too perfect brother, to the hard working Young Delaney, who is the envy of the countryside for his skill with livestock. Other families seem less industrious than Pierce, settling for modern homes and satellite dishes, in lieu of the traditional country values.Marty's emotional decline is sad and pathetic, risking everything for a chance with his sister-in-law. A delightful story of obsession and the consequences, but perhaps most memorable for the wonderful portrayal of a tiny corner of modern Ireland, which still retains the rural charm that we think of, and a whole array of unforgettable characters."},{"Title":"One day as a tiger","review":"A sheep? The novel is about a sheep? If someone had told me this novel is by an Irish writer and it features a sheep, I probably would have dismissed the book. I think myself relatively free of prejudice, yet \\"Irish writer\\" says to me folk story, featuring salt-of-the-earth characters and a warm, triumphant ending. How wrong I would have been to suspect Haverty of writing such a book, and how glad I am that I did not take the time to discover her heritage before buying and reading this amazing book.The novel follows Marty Hawkins as he leaves his promising career at Trinity College in Dublin to go home to the country, to live for a time with his brother Pierce, who tends the family acres with an understanding and closeness to the land that Marty knows he will never have. Marty is perhaps driven to this desperate move away from intellectual pursuits by a kind of rivalry with this brother, or by the death of his parents, or, by his own admission, because he missed the look of the land. It was never quite clear to me why he left Trinity, except that he felt something was wrong. And in the end it doesn't particularly matter. We all do things that we cannot fully explain. I like that about this book.Followed everywhere by the specter of this larger-than-life relative, the brother who can do no wrong, Marty seeks peace by doing nothing. He makes himself a home in an abandoned house on the land, makes half-hearted efforts at helping Pierce, finally accepts his hermit-like existence. But he has an obsession with Pierce's wife Etti. And an equal fascination with a sheep.Marty finds the sheep when accompanying his progressive farmer brother to a sale of genetically-engineered livestock. The sheep carry human genes. The sheep Marty picks out has a kind of human frailty that calls out to him, that he cannot resist. Pierce humors his non-farmer brother by acquiring the sheep for him for half-price.And so Missy enters Marty's life. And changes it forever. Missy seems to represent the unformed, unclear direction of Marty's life, its demands on him and his inadequacy at satisfying his own needs, or even defining them. Marty struggles with keeping her alive, with alternately loving and hating her, as he seems to do with his own soul. He expresses - and sometimes fights - the too-human traits of envy, lust, and desire, and is ultimately undone by his need to have what he wants on his own terms. The novel is too real to be put down easily, too human to dismiss."},{"Title":"One day as a tiger","review":"What makes this book at all interesting is the way the author uses Missy, the genetically engineered lamb, who functions essentially as another character; despite that, the story is pretty conventional. The plot is straightforward, and Ms Haverty deals with themes we've all seen before.

Christiansen does a very nice job assimilating the archaelogical and historical evidence, and then explaining it and telling a good &quot;story&quot; in a very readable fashion. This is a very complex area, and Christiansen has to deal with the collision of four different linguistic groups and cultural traditions: 1. The Christian West Germanic and North Germanic peoples, i.e., Saxons, Danes, Swedes, etc. 2. The pagan Baltic peoples such as the Latvians and Lithuanians. 3. The pagan Finnic peoples, including the Finns and Estonians, but also many tribes whose language and culture barely survives today, such as the Livonians, Ingrians, Karelians, etc. 4. The partially Christianized Slavic tribes.There is very little published in English about this time and place in history. I would strongly recommend this book to anyone with an interest in the subject, or in the Baltic region in general, especially someone interested in a good overview as a start. As I've indicated, in spite of the complexity of the subject, it does read well."},{"Title":"The Northern Crusades: Second Edition","review":"This is a very readable account of a subject largely inaccessible to the general reader. It covers the conquest and conversion of the pagan tribes of the Southern and Eastern Baltic Coasts from the thirteenth to the fifteenth century, the extension of German civilisation north-eastwards and the collision, and ultimate uneasy equilibrium between Latin and Orthodox Christianity in the area. The surprise of the book, for this reader at least, is the fact that the Dark Ages endured in this corner of Europe well into Medieval times, and that Paganism was still a vibrant force there almost until the period of the Renaissance. A significant strength of the book is the introductory section, which provides a fascinating overview of the peoples and cultures of the area at the opening of the period covered, and this is built upon in greater detail, when necessary in more detailed accounts of specific campaigns. The linkage to the overall Crusading ideal is well handled and though the transformation of the Teutonic Knights from a warrior order in Frankish Palestine to a frontier force skilled in forest, river and marshland warfare is a dominant theme, the roles of the Danes, Swedes and Russians, not to mention a host of Baltic tribes, receive equal attention. The mechanics of the warfare of the period, including the particular constraints imposed by climate and terrain, are well handled. In summary - a splendidly informative work that cast light on an obscure period that bred baleful myths with dire consequences in more recent times."},{"Title":"The Northern Crusades: Second Edition","review":"The Crusades are back in the news again (they were out-of-fashion for awhile), but don't believe everything you read in the newspapers or hear on tv, take time to read a few good books on the subject. Begin with JJ Norwich and Bernard Lewis to get a handle on the Crusaders and Byzantium and the Holy Land, then go onto Cathars and the 'Reconquesta' of Spain. Perhaps you will come to the conclusion that I have--the European Crusaders spent more time outside the Levant than in it, although Lewis suggests Europeans probably acquired the idea of mounting religious jihads from the Arabs who were quite good at it.Christiansen has written an excellent and well-researched book on the NORTHERN CRUSADES. His writing is very readable and unbiased, and he has availed himself of many original documents. I particularly appreciated the material he included that covered the internal church debates on &quot;what constitutes a 'just war'&quot; or when can Christians fight in the name of Christ?The perspective of some clergy during the High Middle Ages was that good reasons existed for a Crusade or a 'Just War' with the Muslims because they had seized formerly Christian lands in the Levant, North Africa, Spain, France, Italy, Greece, and Eastern Europe. However, these same clergy argued there was no basis for a 'Just War' with the Byzantine Greeks, the Orthodox Russians, or non-Christian pagans who wanted to become Christian without fighting. Unfortunately, clear thinking did not always prevail.Christiansen suggests the Crusades were waged for the purpose of Christianizing the tribes who lived at the Eastern end of the Baltic Sea. In the end they were Christianized and mostly Latinized, although Russia chose the Greek Orthodox side. People who lived in what is today Lithuania, Poland, and Russia were invaded by Germans, Swedes, and Danes. Christiansen's book highlights a period when German warrior monks known as the Teutonic knights seized much of the land.Like the Templars and other warrior-monk orders in Western Europe that formed in response to the loss of the Holy Land, the Teutonic Knights were motivated by a desire to infuse Christianity in &quot;heathern&quot; peoples. Christiansen says that although some individuals undoutedly grew wealthy, &quot;the profit motive is not a convincing argument&quot; for the behaviour of the monks. &quot;To present these wars as false -- either as matters of interest disquised as matters of conscience, or simply as misnamed events -- is too easy. This type of judgment is itself fraudulent.&quot;The Crusades were bloody and cruel, and as is usually the case, folks at the low end of the ladder suffered the most. But Christiansen poses a question -- were these people who led relatively &quot;free&quot; lives at subsistence levels better or worse off when they became Latinized, Christian serfs and/or peasants? Christiansen provides plenty of material to fuel both sides of the argument.Apparently, the Lithuanians and Polish did not think the Germans made good masters, and in the end they prevailed in defeating the Teutonic Knights. Although the Polish and Lithuanian people Christianized, they never accepted German rule -- a fact not lost on the Nazis. This stance continued long after Germany became mostly Protestant in the 16th Century and Lithuania and Poland remained staunchly Roman Catholic."},{"Title":"The Northern Crusades: Second Edition","review":"_The Northern Crusades_ by Eric Christiansen is an attempt to shed light on a relatively poorly known aspect of European medieval and early modern history, that of the Northern Crusades. Less well known than the Spanish Crusade and certainly less known to the average non-specialist reader than the Crusades in the Middle East, the Northern Crusades of the Baltic Sea region can essentially be summed up as the struggles of Scandinavian rulers - chiefly those of Denmark and Sweden - and German military monks (the Teutonic Knights) to conquer and settle non-Christian Finland, Estonia, and Prussia before coming into conflict with the considerably more powerful and organized eastern empires of Orthodox Novgorod and pagan Lithuania (and later Catholic Poland). The period lasted roughly from 1147 (the launch of the First Northern Crusade, against the Baltic Slavs) to at least as far as the book is concerned 1562 (the partition and secularization of Livonia, ending the rule of the Teutonic Knights there, their last outpost).Though less celebrated than the other crusades, the Northern Crusades were far more successful. Initially many areas were only thinly Christian after their conquest, as for centuries in many regions for instance Teutonic outposts existed like \\"knots in a net,\\" a net that was full of holes and encompassed areas where \\"alien subjects lived unredeemed lives within sight of the steeple\\" and castle, thin scraps of Christian settlement squeezed between the coast and primeval forest, though in the end vast areas became and remain Christian to this day. In stark contrast to the efforts of the Crusaders in the Middle East, the Order and the Scandinavians were able to establish lasting settlements in formerly very hostile areas in the wilderness, lands with difficult terrain, fearsome winter weather, impassable roads (if they existed), and unwelcoming natives. The Order for example established over ninety towns and a thousand villages in Prussia and Livonia. Sweden was able in the course of two centuries to transform Finland from a mainly non-Christian, illiterate, and ungoverned world into a society recognizable as European and Catholic. Even though these outside powers lost the lands that they colonized, they still held them much longer than the Crusaders held the lands of the Middle East (Denmark held on in Estonia for more than a century, the Teutonic Order kept Prussia and Livonia for nearly 300 years, and Sweden remained in Finland for nearly 600 years).In this book Christiansen sought to show what the world of north-east Europe was like before the Crusades, chronicle the history of the Crusades themselves, detail a little about the personalities involved, detail in particular the history, role, goals, and organization of the Teutonic Knights, the reasons for the Crusades, and the theological debates and political struggles associated with the Northern Crusades as well as the concept of crusade in and of itself. I found the book interesting and fairly well written though a bit dry and sometimes difficult going in parts. I was hindered a little by the many very unfamiliar place names and had to reference many times one or more of the six maps at the beginning of the book, though by the end of the book several places I had once never heard of were quite familiar.Particularly striking to me in the book was though that particularly in the early centuries the religious aspect of the Northern Crusade was important, in the end the wars were basically examples of imperialism and fought for temporal reasons, for resources and for geopolitical considerations. Though Christiansen cautioned in his concluding chapter that one should not view the wars as fought for \\"matters of interest disguised as matters of conscience,\\" and indeed until close to the end the religious pull of the Northern Crusade drew in outside forces, whole retinues of warriors or individual knights, absolutely vital to the survival of in particular the Teutonic Knights, it is obvious that religious considerations were but one of many for those who fought. Often political control could only be established by changing the religious affiliation of the inhabitants, owing to the general lack of any other shared cultural identity between ruler and ruled; what type of Christianity prevailed in a region (Latin or Greek) was a way of staking political claims (important in the continuing struggle in later centuries between the Latin Crusade lands and Orthodox Novgorod). In Sweden new lands gained in Finland meant more people paying the tithe (good for the Swedish church and for the Pope in Rome to fund his various goals in Italy) and more fiefs and offices for the more adventurous of the lesser nobility. The Danes went to war in the 1100s as much or more to stop Slavic piracy and slave raids than anything else. The rich fur, feather, wax, amber, fish, whale, and seal resources of the Baltic Sea region were highly sought after by many in northern Europe; the \\"fur-clad, pickled-herring eaters lolling on the feather-beds\\" of Western Europe (mainly those of the Hanseatic League) were one of the chief beneficiaries of the Northern Crusades. The Teutonic Knights towards the end of their existence in Prussia were often more concerned with ruling than with crusading and many were hardly monastic, with new ordinances forbidding them to hoard money, keep packs of hounds, to use private seals, to wear fine clothing, and otherwise act as traditional feudal lords appear to have often been ignored.A very interesting aspect of the book was as noted the discussion of the nature and organization of the Teutonic Order. Christiansen described its existence as both a military organization and a monastic order. From the Order's beginning to near its end there was a continual debate about whether or not one could be a monk and a warrior, if Christianity could be spread at the point of a sword, what the nature of a just war is, and if even the original papal orders establishing the Order were legally or spiritually correct."},{"Title":"The Northern Crusades: Second Edition","review":"A fascinating, well written account of the north-eastern part of European history that is often missing in most books.While this is a book filled with historic facts and dates, it is written in such a manner that it is easy for even the non student to read and understand.Once started, the book was hard to put down.

Most of the scholarly literature on this topic is in German or Slavic languages and not accessible to English language readers. Christiansen provides concise narrative of events from about 1100 to the mid-16th century. The book opens with a description of the Baltic region in 1100 stressing the patchwork of socities in the region and the emerging commerce between the Baltic and more developed regions. The western parts of the Baltic and its littoral were dominated by Latin-Catholic feudal societies in western Scandinavia and western Germany. To the east were a melange of different language and ethnic non-Christian groups with generally lower levels of cultivation and political organization. The following narrative chapters describe the fitful spread of Latin-Catholic institutions across the Baltic. This is a story of conquest, colonization, and competition for trade routes and natural resources. Partly because of the limitation of sources, most of the focus in on the conquerers-colonizers. These are a mixture of monarchs-powerful feudal lords, merchants, and in particular, the crusading religious orders that led some of the conquests of the eastern Baltic. Christiansen focuses on the famous Teutonic Knights and their predecessors, with a considerable amount of anlaysis of the complicated role played by the Church and religious motivations in the conquest of the Baltic region.To a large extent, this is a story of the extension of feudalism, the Church, towns, and increasing trade networks from the Latin-Catholic heartland across the Baltic. Christiansen shows nicely how messy this process was, involving not only the difficulties of conquering non-Christian societies in hostile environments, but fierce and violent competition among all the major (and many minor) Latin-Christian actors. An important theme that emerges from the narrative is what might be anachronistically called the international nature of the Christianization of the Baltic littoral. The Teutonic Knights, for example, had fiefs across Europe and in the Latin Middle East. The specific focus of the Knights on the northeast Baltic was a product of the loss of the Latin Middle East. The Knights could call on reinforcements and volunteers from across Europe. The Christianization of the Baltic was embedded in the complex of politics of Catholic Europe, involving the conflicts between the Holy Roman Emperors and the Papacy, and many other conflicts with an international context. Christiansen also has an interesting discussion of the formation of the Lithuanian Commonwealth, which apparently emerged under pressure from Catholic expansion and the emerging Russian Orthodox city-states.Overall, quite informative about how Catholic Europe developed up to the Reformation. There is a good annotated bibliography."},{"Title":"The Northern Crusades: Second Edition","review":"The Northern Crusades by Eric Christiansen presents a detailed account of the events of the crusades in the Baltic. In the Introduction Christiansen states, \\"This book is an attempt to describe the struggles waged round the Baltic from the twelfth to the sixteenth centuries in the name of Christianity, and to explain the part they played in the transformation of northern societies which took place at the same time.\\" He expands upon this purpose throughout the book, and draws the events back to the theme. He began the book with a look at the geography and native tribes of the Baltic area before the crusaders invaded. Several maps were included which assist the reader in understanding the frontier regions.Christiansen embraces a broad definition of crusades; he doesn't seem to consider a vow as a necessary part. His writing is very British, dry ironic humour in a narrative style. He didn't have an overt thesis but he did state that the Northern Crusades are important for study because they brought about lasting permanent changes to the Baltic region. They helped Latinize the areas where crusaders and colonists lived. The first official crusade bull for North East Europe was issued by Pope Eugenius III in 1147. The strongest military order during the centuries of the Northern Crusades was the Teutonic Knights. They were founded in 1190, and became a powerful political and military force in Prussia, Lithuania, Estonia, and Livonia.The Danes, Swedes, Russians, and Knights all were interested in expanding their territorial borders and in controlling trade rights in the Baltic region, which happened to coincide with the Church's desire to converting the pagan natives. The political and military struggles for supremacy in the Baltic lasted for three hundred years, as Grand Masters, kings, nobles, and princes all tried to outmaneuver each other and dominate the region. Christiansen seems to have no problem with admitting that much of the so called crusader activity in the region was really much more economically driven. Sure, the Teutonic Knights said they were there to convert the heathen, but they really didn't seem to mind if they all stayed pagan. It gave them a reason to exist, and a justified reason to fight. The crusading mindset lasted so long through a combination of local enthusiasm, occasional appeals to Rome for help, and by the grant of perpetual warfare given to the Teutonic Knights.The Northern Crusades provides a very readable overview of the crusades in the Baltic. The political and religious complexities of the region are clearly described and the reader comes away with a very good understanding of the key events. Many kingdoms wanted to rule the frontier lands and they all provided themselves with justifications for conquest. The crusading mindset provided the justification for the formation of the Teutonic Knights. Their actions were important to the dynamics of the Baltic region and they had a hand in the events that occurred. Christiansen shows the Knights as a central piece of the Northern Crusades.The Teutonic Knights came under criticism from Poland. They had stolen land, and were currently fighting fellow Christians, since most of the Baltic area had been nominally converted. They were also pretty keen on fighting Russians, since they were schismatics, but that didn't seem to qualify as a crusade. When the Northern Crusades came to an end and the Teutonic Knights were secularized the Baltic region was a changed place. \\"The Baltic was still a Catholic lake in 1500, and the Baltic states were thoroughly integrated members of the Catholic family, two generations after the crusades had ended.\\""},{"Title":"The Northern Crusades: Second Edition","review":"The crusades against northeastern Europe are far less known than the parallell Palestinian ones, although perhaps of far more historical importance. Between the 11th and 15th century the entire Baltic region grew from an unexplored semi-wilderness into a area of organized, settled states, a growth partly caused by the influx of Western crusaders and partly by the subsequent reaction against this.Eric Christiansen tells the story of these important centuries without the bias towards one side or another which is typical for other works, particularly when descibing the Teutonic Knights, their conquest of Prussia and subsequent wars with Poland and the Novgorod Russiansand, and has succeeded in writing a book that is both informative and entertaining."},{"Title":"The Northern Crusades: Second Edition","review":"This was the only book I ever read on Crusades along the Baltic states and after reading this book, I realized that I really don't have to read too much more.

Since it covered a subject matter not well known in the United States, we can considered it as a blessing that there is such a book like this to enlightened us. For any military historians out there, this is a &quot;must have&quot; book for your library."},{"Title":"The Northern Crusades: Second Edition","review":"Since this book was first published, it has become one of the main references, if not THE reference on Northern Crusades, at least in English. Given that there has already been a large numbers of reviews, I will merely limit myself to listing the numerous reasons underpinning the five star rating which this book richly deserves.1) This is one of the first books in English on the Northern Crusades. There are a host of others, especially in German, but also in Polish or Swedish for instance.2) It is also one of the only books which makes a conscious effort at looking at the whole period (mid 12th to the mid 16th century) and focuses on the Crusades in the North, as opposed to the military Orders (and the Teutonic Knights, in particular) which were only one of its components, even if one of the most important ones3) Another merit of this book, and perhaps the main one in my view, is the author's efforts to remain objective and steer clear from all of the very sensitive and nationalistic issues that arose as a result of the Northern Crusades, and the domination of the German military Orders (and the Teutonic Order in particular). The latter are neither painted as \\"evil\\" nor as \\"paragons of virtue\\". Instead, the Crusader Ideology and the advantages of relying on what the author terms \\"the Monastic War-Machine\\" in the 13th century are carefully explained and laid out, with strong parallels - but also differences - being drawn with the situation in the Holy Lands.4) A fourth merit of this book is to show that \\"the Baltic provinces\\" was seen by a powerful body of Catholic opinion \\"as a Christican frontier held by armies of the true faith against a hostile outer world of heathendom and schism\\", at least until the early 14th century (and beyond, but to a lesser extent) but also (and just as much) as wars being fought for the same reasons as all other ways: the capture of trade routes, the winning of \\"new\\" lands (wich typically meant subjugating or drivig away whoever might have occupied them prior to the newcomers), increasing revenues and reputations for princes and prelates or simply loot.5) Another strongpoint is the book's ability to analyze both what made these conquests possible and successful and the reasons for what the author terms the \\"withering of the Crusade\\" from 1409 to 1525, and the decadence and extinction of the Teutonic Order in Prussia (in 1525, when the last grand-master turned protestant and secularized the Order's remaining possessions, and in Livonia where Ivan the Terrible put an end to the Livonian Knights in 1562 (which the Master becoming Duke of Courland and a vassal). One of the pillars of success was the steady influx of reinforcements, whether colonists or recuits for the Order, that came from Germany up to the 15th century. Another was the ability of the Order to rely on and use the burghers of the towns that it had created and settled and use as auxiliaries some of the local non-German populations (Prussians in particular).6) Yet another strongpoint is to show that, while a considerable military disaster, the battle of Tannenberg (1410)was not necessarily the shattering event that it is portrayed to be. War continued. The Provinces held and the victors did not manage to conquer the Order's main fortresses. The author even shows that the Order had suffered military disasters at least five times period, had come close to extinction, but had managed to hold on and survive because of the reinforcements coming from the West, both financial and in manpower for the Order directly, or as Crusaders and colonists. It did not happen on the same scale after Tanenberg while the Order's ennemies were stronger than before and could not be divided (the alliance between the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania). So, as Christiansen shows so well, the Teutonic Order was both weakened and outmanoeuvered strategically and ideologically by this alliance. In Livonia, the Order was increasingly unable to stand its own under the increasingly powerfull Russians.7) The last quality that this book has - or at least the last that I can think of - is its structure. It uses a simple chronological structure but also manages to insert specific chapters when the Northern Crusades, the Orders, the military efficiency of the Order and the government of the \\"Crusading States of Northern Europe\\" as the author terms them, are subject to careful analysis.Finally, the author insists of what was the main ideological aim of the Northern Crusades - the bringing together of the inhabitants around the Baltic into \\"a common catholic civilization\\". This was achieved to the extent that \\"the Baltic was still a Catholic lake by 1500\\".Highly recommended reading for anyting interested in either the Northern Crusades or the Teutonic Order."},{"Title":"The Northern Crusades: Second Edition","review":"Studies on the different Crusades to the Baltic focus on the specifics of each campaign- the conquest of the Prussians, the early encounters between native Balts and settling Germans, and so on. What Christiansen provides here is a consolidated account of the whole of the conflicts, from first encounters to the historical after-effects of the Baltic Crusades. It is an excellent English-speaking survey and reference book of this very broad subject. Current scholarly attention pays interest to translating materials from the Crusades to the Holy Land; but Christiansen's addition with this book should serve to promote translations of the many materials left over of the Baltic Crusades. Highly readable, specific and yet general, Christiansen proves himself as both author and historian of the first rate. I recommend."},{"Title":"The Northern Crusades: Second Edition","review":"Eric Christiansen's 'The Northern Crusades,' is much more than just a global over-view of a particular time and place. With mind-numbing erudition and almost painful attention to detail, Mr. Christiansen has single-handedly resurrected an extremely important chapter in the European story, that of the Baltic 'Crusades.' Not only does he give the reader fact upon fact, but more importantly, he has laid out the ideological background as to why thousands of Europe's noble sons sought glory and salvation in the crusade for the North.The work's strongest part is its beginning. Christiansen put downs the base: where did these 'crusades' take place and against who. He meticulously outlines Baltic geography and ethnography, although the latter runs a little thin. Then, the story travels eastwards, starting from the very first crusades which the Danes took against their Wendish neighbors. What was later to become a defined struggle of the 'faith' against the 'heathen,' was not so at the beginning. Christiansen points out that the Danes were more interested in securing their coastline from Wendish pirate attacks than converting the pagan to the Roman church. Soon though, as the Wendish coastline was secured, land-hungry German nobility sought to expand eastwards. This drang nach osten soon acquired a singularly religous flavor. Meeting the strong and vibrant pagan cultures of Prussia and Lithuania, the German knights realized that they couldn't defeat such stalwarts on their own. A fanatical ideology was needed to feed the war machine. Christiansen details how a monastic war-machine was built up to combat the heathen. These German knights needed to know that what they were fighting was a 'holy war' and who they were fighting against were abominations in the eyes of the true faith. Thus was born that most foul of medieval brotherhoods, the Teutonic Knights. Armed monks dedicated to the spreading of the Roman church, they followed a crusading creed not unlike their 20th century descendants, the Waffen SS. They blindly believed in their own cultural and spiritual superiority over the non-Christian peoples of Prussia, Lithuania, Livonia (present-day Latvia) and Estonia and thus had no qualms about slaughtering, pillaging and raping, all in the name of the Cross. Christansen states that the knights (and their mercenary friends from all across Europe) were motivated to participate in such atrocities by the promise of absolution of sins. The Papacy had longed preached the gospel of atonement through action even if that meant singularly un-Christian action.Ironically though the Teutonic Knights heavy-handed tactics eventually backfired. While eventually subduing the Letts to some degree, and all but completely exterminating the ancient Prussians, the Lithuanians remained firm and independent. When they eventually took up the cross for political reasons (the last European people to 'convert' to Christianity), they did so only superficially, their indigenous culture and language remaining strong to the present day. If the Teutonic Knights had truly practiced what they claimed to believe, Christianity might have taken a much stronger hold in this region than it did.With the prickly question of the moral merits of these crusades, Christiansen strives to remain unbiased, presenting both sides without preference, warts and all. The chapter on the most significant crusade---the Lithuanian---is comprehensive and the gives the facts, but a more in-depth examination of Lithuanian paganism would have been a helpful addition. Moreover, the extremely important battle of Grunwald/Tannenberg in 1410 which effectively castrated the Teutonic Order, is given only cursory discussion. Despite the his objective tone, Christiansen attempts somewhat to rehabilitate the Order. He attempts to insinuate that despite the barbarity of the Order, it did bring 'civilization' (read here Catholic Christianity) to the Baltic. This 'we helped the savages by offering them baptism or the sword' argument is specious indeed, not to mention, anything but humane. Christiansen implies that the pagan cultures were even more barbaric than that of the knights, thus forced conversion and cultural annihilation was, in a way, the right thing to do.Christiansen ends 'The Northern Crusades' with an interesting aside about the crusade's ominous and unsuccessful clash with Orthodox Russia. Here, Western Europe's crusade lost its ideological raison d'etre. How could the Christian knight fight against his fellow (albeit very different) Christian brother? The Northern Crusade failed to provide an answer to that very prickly question which has continued to dog Europe up to the present time: Does Russia belong to the idea of Europe?Another fascinating element of Christiansen's work is his examination of the ideological and theological wars which waged within Western Christendom over the idea of 'crusade.' At the Council of Constance, Western theologians supported the idea of force against the non-Christian. The heathen must be violently stripped from his/her idolatrous surroundings (on pain of death even) before true proselytizing can begin. First, the sword, then the Gospel. Christiansen mentions that Polish lawyer, Paul Wlodkowic, posed a heady challenge: Is the true Christian ever justified in using force to spread the Good News? As apt a question then as now, as the West once again seeks conversion (this time to 'democracy') at the point of a gun.Despite its shallow patches, 'The Northern Crusades' is a must-have for those interested in the history of this forgotten corner of Europe. What makes it stand apart from others written about this topic is Christiansen's colorful and sophisticated language. While you'll flaunder sometimes in the sheer mass (oft-times morass!) of detail, the language always pulls you through to the next page. Always erudite, Christiansen does go over the top in places. 'Bureaucracies have their jargons, and the eloquent Italian lawyers who formulated papal policy in the thirteenth century were presumably able to sleep the sounder for knowing that the chancery clerks would convey instructions in this rhythmical flow of officalese.' Ouch! But luckily, the good outnumbers the bad. About the Teutonic Sword Brothers in Latvia, 'They were dumb dogs, but at least they were able to bite.''The Northern Crusades' is anything but a dumb dog and more than that, one full of unexpected bites.

The book not only informed me, but also whet my appetite to learn more about this important group in Baltic history.I am trying to read everything I can about Latvian and Baltic German history, not the spread of Christianity, per se. That being said, this is an essential book to read if one wants to further their knowledge of Latvia and, for that matter, Lithuania, Estonia, old Prussia, and Poland. For example, after reading this book, I had learned that there was ongoing conflict (sometimes leading to war) between the Catholic bishops (ironically), the German merchants and the Teutonic knights. This isn't something that I had expected. I thought it would be, understandably I think, mostly about the Crusaders and their fight with pagans and orthodox Christians. Some who might know more about this group might be surprised at my expectation, but this is not my area of specialty. A second interesting example I will mention from the book describes in some surprising detail, given the time that had passed, a series of meetings with Papal authorities in which the knights argue their right to exist and act in a certain manner, with those of another view who challenge, among other things, the notion of \\"crusading\\" being a just cause.Importantly, the book ends with a bibliography that a reader can peruse to learn more about the specific topic of the book as well as those that are related in some tangible way. The author organizes these based upon which area and aspect of Baltic history the reader might be most interested. For example, given my aforementioned interest in Latvia and Baltic Germans, you can imagine how pleased I might have been when I discovered two more books that dealt with Latvia in this era that I hadn't ever seen before.Overall, the book is an important contribution to my library of books that focus on the Baltic Germans and Latvia, in general. The only reason I gave the book 4/5 stars and not 5/5 stars is because of the focus of my interest, not any errors on behalf of the book. The book certainly should be 5/5 stars for someone who is very interested not merely in the eastern Baltic, but also very interested in Christian history and the introduction of Christianity to said region. Remember, according to amazon.com, 4/5 stars means \\"I like it\\", while 5/5 stars mean \\"I love it\\".

(and it showed up on time too!)"},{"Title":"The Northern Crusades: Second Edition","review":"\\"Northern\\" and \\"Crusades\\" might not be words that would seem to fit together naturally. Most of us, when we hear the term \\"the Crusades,\\" would think of the endless fighting over the Holy Land, of Saladin and King Richard the Lionhearted. We might see in our minds images from Ridley Scott's film \\"Kingdom of Heaven\\" (2005), with its thematic emphasis on the idea that enemies can fight honorably and, when war has ended, can make peace honorably. But we probably wouldn't think of Crusades in association with places like Finland, or Latvia, or the area once known as East Prussia. But crusades occurred in the Baltic region nonetheless, as Eric Christiansen makes clear in his book \\"The Northern Crusades.\\"Christiansen, of Oxford University, begins by describing the pre-Christian societies of the Baltic region, and then proceeds to set forth how the crusading impulse first took shape in late-11th-century Europe. As Christiansen begins to chronicle the manner in which orders of \\"armed monks\\" carried out the crusades in the Baltic lands, you may find yourself referring frequently to the six maps that appear at the beginning of the book; the events of the Northern crusades, both military and political, are sometimes quite Byzantine in their intricacy. Yet Christiansen always maintains a strong narrative line, and makes clear how events as far away as Acre could affect the waging of a war in Novgorod. There is a sense of inevitability to the way that crusades that began with the conquest of massive territories of Northern land eventually petered out, as described in a chapter aptly titled \\"The Withering of the Crusade.\\"The maps, as mentioned above, were helpful, but more illustrations might have helped further, especially in the context of a book that covers a period of over 400 years and introduces the reader to a sometimes bewildering array of historical personages. No doubt there are paintings, engravings, statues, and other works of art that might have provided a useful visual supplement to Christiansen's narrative.Nonetheless, the book works well not only at describing a period of Baltic history, but also at helping the reader look ahead to future events that the Baltic region would face. Before reading \\"The Northern Crusades,\\" I knew that East Prussia was a predominantly German region, separated from the rest of Germany by Polish territory, and that Hitler made much of that when whipping the German people into a pro-Nazi, pro-conquest frenzy during the years before World War II; but I didn't understand before reading this book how or why East Prussia originally emerged as a German cultural exclave. Now I understand. Someday I would like to travel in what was once East Prussia, and is now the Kaliningrad oblast of the Russian Federation, and see a land where the Northern Crusades were only the first of many, many tumultuous events that would overrun that region.\\"The Northern Crusades\\" resonated with me while I was traveling in Lithuania, and particularly when I went to Cathedral Square to see the \\"Stebuklas\\" tile. \\"Stebuklas\\" means \\"miracle\\" in Lithuanian, and the small, colorful tile with the word \\"Stebuklas\\" on it marks the southern end of a thousands-strong human chain formed in 1989 by citizens of the three Baltic States of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, to protest the Soviets' then-tottering rule of their countries. In the square, I remember being struck by seeing, right next to the largest cathedral of devoutly Catholic Lithuania, a heroic statue of the Grand Prince Gediminas, a resolutely pagan ruler. While his forces killed or captured thousands of Christians, and Christiansen reports that Gediminas himself responded to a papal request to convert to Christianity by saying, \\"May the devil baptize me!\\" (p. 153), Gediminas is still a hero in Lithuania, and his statue looks out upon a great cathedral of the religion he affected to despise. Such are the intricacies of Baltic history.For readers with an interest in the Baltic region, \\"The Northern Crusades\\" provides an interesting look back at an overlooked but important time in the history of Northern Europe."},{"Title":"The Northern Crusades: Second Edition","review":"This is undoubtedly a valuable piece of work, chronicling the history of christian and germanic expansion into the wild Baltic region of the middle ages.However, it is not an easy read.

He even challenges common evangelical theory about the place of \\"Abraham's bosom.\\" The occupants of heavens are described, both angels and glorified humans, with the distinction made between sanctification and glorification. Finally, MacArthur clarifies seemingly contradictory verses about the nature of the place of heaven, such as some that imply a temple in heaven and others that do not. MacArthur envisions an eternal heaven that transcends space and time rather than one that is just a different name for the New Earth.

I had recently read a \\"best seller\\" about Heaven and left the book feeling misinformed. This book grealy helped me with some questions I had about Heaven. I would recommend this book to all people."},{"Title":"Glory of Heaven: The Truth about Heaven, Angels and Eternal Life","review":"After recently reading Dinesh D'Souza's book titled Life After Death, a book chronicling a search for the afterlife using science and reason, I decided to follow that book with a study of what information is actually revealed in the Bible. To assist me in this, I chose the book The Glory of Heaven (The Truth About Heaven, Angels and Eternal Life) by John MacArthur.MacArthur chooses an unusual way of opening this study by first looking at one individual who claims to have had heavenly visions and two who claim they have actually been transported up into heaven (one claims he has also literally descended into hell) and, of course, have written books about their experiences; a couple have written several sequels on their alleged experiences. MacArthur goes into quite some detail with each individual (Betty Eadie, Richard Eby and Roberts Liardon) in his two-chapter comparison of these three and others who are, according to MacArthur, clueless as to what heaven and hell is really like. Sadly, according to MacArthur, these testimonies were well received by the public in general and by numerous Christians who gave their books rave reviews.Partway through chapter two, MacArthur balances these bizarre testimonies with a quick summary of the available biblical information on heaven, angels and eternal life. His study of the subjects really begin in chapter three, starting with \\"What Heaven Will Be Like.\\" It wasn't until I was about halfway through MacArthur's study that I realized why he spent so much time looking at the strange ways people view heaven. Once the reader reads all that God has revealed in scripture about heaven the opening three stories go from very unusual to unbelievable and just plain stupid.MacArthur pictures the glory of heaven by examining the following subjects. Within each chapter are numerous sub-subjects enhancing and enlarging the chapter title:Chapter 3: What Heaven Will Be Like?Chapter 4: New Jerusalem.Chapter 5: What Will We Be Like In Heaven?Chapter 6: The Heavenly Host.In Chapter 6, MacArthur spends an entire chapter talking about angels. He first notes how prevalent angels were in popular music, TV and in the print media a decade or two ago. And, as expected, how unscriptural they were depicted. The rest of the chapter is a detailed study on what scripture actually says about angels.The study, including the opening bizarre views of heaven, is only 163 pages long. But MacArthur has packed a tremendous amount of scriptural revelation in this relatively short study. The book closes with the following four Appendices:1. The Jewels in Our Heavenly Crown, by Puritan Richard Baxter.2. The Kingdom of Heaven, by Thomas Boston.3. The Sympathy of the Two Worlds: A Sermon by Charles H. Spurgeon.4. Home at Last! A Sermon by J.C. Ryle.As is typical with John MacArthur, there are also a Notes Section, and both Scripture and General Indexes at the back of the book. Throughout MacArthur's book, he also includes his own personal encouragement to the believer. Mostly to set our minds on things above, as we are admonished to in scripture, while we serve Christ here on earth. He also directs an invitation in several areas to the unbeliever and skeptics, challenging them to view what their future holds without Christ, admonishing them to run to Christ while there is still an opportunity. I found one admonition to Christians memorable and worth noting:\\"If you're worried about feeling out of place in heaven, don't. Heaven will seem more like home than the dearest spot on earth to you. It is uniquely designed by a tender, loving Savior to be the place where we will live together for all eternity and enjoy Him forever--in the fullness of our glorified humanity. Is it any wonder that the psalmist said, 'Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his saints.' (Psalm 116:15)?\\"MacArthur's study is scripturally sound, a straightforward presentation of the material and generally lacking in the unnecessary speculation and conjecture often found in other studies on this subject. The Appendices were also worthwhile reading, although some reviewers, evidently unacquainted and inexperienced with reading material from Christian authors of previous centuries, found some of the writings boring and unappealing. I'm not sure whether that is an indictment of the sermons or our own failure to read and appreciate more of the classic Christian writers. MacArthur's book is highly recommended."},{"Title":"Glory of Heaven: The Truth about Heaven, Angels and Eternal Life","review":"This is a good book about what the bible says about Heaven. There are only 6 chapters by MacArthur. The rest of the book contains four sermons or messages from other people (Richard Baxter, Thomas Boston, Charles Spurgeon, and J.C. Ryle).The first two chapters look at the modern culture's (incorrect) view of heaven. The other four chapters describe what the bible actually says about heaven.Overall, I thought MacArthur did an excellent job with the biblical description of heaven. In particular he did a great job describing not only what heaven will be like, but what we will be like in heaven.While I am sure the four sermons at the end of the book were excellent, I didn't get much from them simply due to the wordiness of the writing (these writings go back several hundred years).If you are interested in the biblical description of heaven I would recommend getting this book and at least read chapters 3-6."},{"Title":"Glory of Heaven: The Truth about Heaven, Angels and Eternal Life","review":"After a family tragedy, I wanted to know everything I could know about Heaven. I've got dozens and dozens of books on Heaven. This is one of the best. We still won't know the answers to all of our questions until we get there, of course. That doesn't keep us from seeking the answers while we're here though.There are different levels of focus that a person can handle at different times during the grief process. Immediately after a crisis or tragedy, one is not able to focus on much. We just need God to reach out and comfort us, and sometimes He does that through a book that just reads like a good friend in conversation with us. This book is a step beyond that for a time when there are specific questions that require a different approach. Both are necessary.I recommend this book highly. The author never disappoints me."},{"Title":"Glory of Heaven: The Truth about Heaven, Angels and Eternal Life","review":"Another great book by Dr Macarthur. This book provides the biblical answers to that questions that many Christians, including myself have about heaven and angels. It really fills you with amazement of what is to come."},{"Title":"Glory of Heaven: The Truth about Heaven, Angels and Eternal Life","review":"I bought this book because I was curious to read John's take on what happens immediately after a believer dies. He mentioned this book on his radio station, Grace To You.The actual book is only 163 pages. The rest of the book consists of 4 Appendices, all of which are very boring, and dry, save C.H. Spurgeons sermon, \\"The Sympothy of The Two Worlds.\\" Spurgeon preaches from the text of Luke 15:10 - \\"There is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner that repenteth.\\" An excerpt;\\"Now, why do they not save their joy until that sinner dies and goes to heaven? Why do they rejoice over him when he repents?My Arminian friend, I think, ought to go to heaven to set them right upon this matter. According to his theory, it must be very wrong of them because they rejoice prematurely. According to the Arminian doctrine, a man may repent, and yet he may be lost; he may have grace to repent and believe, an yet he may fall from grace and be a castaway. Now, angels, don't be too fast. Perhaps you may have to repent of this one day if the Arminian doctrine is true; I would advise you to save your song for greater joys. Why, angels, perhaps the men that you are singing over today you will have to mourn over tomorrow.I am quite sure that Arminius never taught his doctrine in heaven. I do not know whether he is there - I hope he is, but he is no longer an Arminian. But if he ever taught his doctrine there, he would be put out. The reason why angels rejoice is because they know that when a sinner repents, he is absolutely saved - or else they would rejoice prematurely and would have good cause for retracting their merriment on some future occasion. But the angels know what Christ meant when He said, 'I give unto them eternal life, and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand' (John 10:28); therefore they rejoice over repenting sinners because they know they are saved.\\"C.H. Spurgeon, one of my favorite teachers, never fails to deliver.Back to the book. John had some interesting things to say about Heaven, and I highly recommend the book for his take on what the scriptures teach. He also debunked those Heaven-Hell jumpers with their false notions, and delusional dreams they write about, in claims of having experienced God's true heavenly kingdom.But when it comes to the Appendices, especially that of Thomas Boston, if you are like me, you will notice the redundancies of his thought, and will surely become weary of reading this book. I had to force myself to finish. And I think they should've ended the book with C.H. Spurgeons sermon, but I know why they ended with Ryle's sermon; it was more of an evangelization method, which is also a good way to end a book.Also, I saw a person review this book, and say that John \\"Utterly demolishes\\" the doctrines of soul sleep, and purgatory. Well, I wouldn't go as far as to say, he \\"Utterly demolishes\\" those doctrines, but he did provide ample scripture support from the New Testament, to support his views. I am also an advocate of, \\"Absent from the body, present with the Lord,\\" but John did not address the scriptures from the Old Testament that seem to teach that when we die, we go into \\"Soul Sleep.\\"This is actually another reason why I bought the book, I hate that evil doctrine of \\"Soul Sleep,\\" and I wanted to see if John, really \\"Utterly Demolished\\" it.William Hendriksen wrote a book, entitled, \\"The Bible On The Life Hereafter,\\" in which he clearly explains what such passages as Ecclesiastes 9:5,10 actually mean.All in all, this book was OK, and if you are trying to find out what is inside the gates of heaven, you will be at a loss of that information, until you die (and only if you're elect, of course).This book, explains from a scriptural standpoint, what God has revealed to us, about heaven. It's not a fairy tale about someone who thinks they have been, and are returning with a message from God, that has nothing to do with what the bible says. I don't know why people waste their time listening to such people, but I do know one thing;Jesus is God."},{"Title":"Glory of Heaven: The Truth about Heaven, Angels and Eternal Life","review":"I think the book was biblically sound.

It is one of my father's old text books. Many times I had considered tossing it. I fell short after paging through the scenes inside, too remote to be included in a current text but no less significant. Did this book supplement the college's Great Books curriculum I thought?

It's difficult to attribute which book works the best, but so far this one seem the most useless although it does have some merit. As other readers suggested, the problems are either very easy or hard. The math is simplistic and the reading comprehension passages are over a page long. The format is outdated and doesn't consider the new CAT format or e-grader. Some of the questions have no answer because they misprinted the question. This is frustrating, but at the very least it is practice, which never hurts. In the end I'm glad I have this, but if you're looking to only get a few books, I suggest the ETS's book (a MUST!) and Powerprep software (highly recommended). These don't give you any hints, but they are the real deal and I've heard that these practice questions are still in use. Arco, Kaplan and Princeton Review are nice for tips, but they make up the questions themselves and have no way of determining their validity by ETS standards. Still, get at least one of the two, preferably both, and with the CD. The difference between Kaplan and PR is that Kaplan is more methodical and PR is more short-cut focused. Choose one based on which works best for you. I don't know what to say about Arco, but I'm here buying it now because I want more practice questions, even if they aren't official. I'm also getting the PR Verbal Workout and GMAT for Dummies because I heard these are both great references for the verbal section (in which I need the most help).Some advice if you do decide to buy this: don't buy this with the CD attached. The practice problems and text are EXACTLY the same as in the book with no additional information.Some more advice: if you are taking the GMAT, practice on something....anything, perferably on the computer. This has helped me tremendously and even though I'm spending upwards of $150-200 on all these books, it's worth it to not have to take the $165 test again because I didn't have the stamina to finish the test or the practice. Just keep in mind that the questions are not hard. They're tricky. The tricks are easier to spot when you've been practicing.

Then the book gives you a pretest to let you know where you stand, and then it begins to give you some review sections.The review sections are pretty good, but they are not helpful if you are someone that needs to brush up on a subject. In fact, they do tell you they are no substitute to real knowledge. So you might want to keep that in mind.The next sections of the book are a series of practice tests that are good exercises to go through, but some people claim some of the answers are wrong, and I did find a few typos in the book. So it is a little frustrating to work through.The computer software disk, is worthless. Other books such as the Princeston review's disk has LOTS of questions.

The practice tests that are included on the CD look and feel NOTHING like the actual GMAT CAT. Finally, I couldn't stand the way they presented the material. They give you instrucions on math, but give you no indication as to where or how to use it during the test. The most useful information was foundin the first 40 pages of the book, but that is info which is probably included in all other GMAT prep books.

The math part of the book does not resemble in any way the ETS questions.Sentence correction provides good exercise if you are a nonnative speaker.The most disappointing part of the book is the reading comp. passages.They are extremely long in some cases and the questions seem to be prepared without attention and with haste.I had one test completely correct and had 7 wrong answers in the next one both in the same sample exam.Most of the time, the author wants you to consider only a single fact in the passage while answering the question.Critical reasoning questions are awful because the author has put his own judgement into the questions.Especially, some of the questions look like as if one needs some set of knowledge outside the passage to answer the questions.(esp. those related with business,economics).Some of the answers are &quot;wrong&quot; in my opinion, because the author cannot make his point decently.This book is NOT essential,Kaplan provides better questions at the same level of difficulty and their questions have nearly the same form as real GMAT questions.But if you really need any exercise it may be worth to get Barron's."},{"Title":"Barron's Gmat: How to Prepare for the Graduate Management Admission Test (Barrons How to Prepare for the Graduate Management Admission Test (Gmat), 11 ed)","review":"I used an earlier edition to review before I entered the Ph.D. program and I found it a good tune-up for the actual exam and the test process.I can't speak to whether it does a good job of teaching how to take exams or how it does preparing for the computer-administered tests, because that's not what I needed."},{"Title":"Barron's Gmat: How to Prepare for the Graduate Management Admission Test (Barrons How to Prepare for the Graduate Management Admission Test (Gmat), 11 ed)","review":"The software is nothing like a real thing.

Authorship is attributed to a highly evolved Avatar identifying himself simply as \\"Elder Brother\\", apparently that same personage known historically as Jesus of Nazareth. Originally called the \\"Great Speakings\\" , these ethereal communications were channeled by William D. Pelley during the 1930s. Two-thirds were first published in 1941 in a 844-page volume known as the Golden Scripts while the remaining messages appeared in various Soulcraft periodicals or were considered too personal for general dissemination.Each exalted script flowed through William Pelley exactly as received in the idiom of Shakespearian England. Some readers find this archaic prose difficult to understand initially but with perseverance fall in love with the unparalleled beauty and wisdom. Mr. Pelley offers an explanation for this unusual literary style in the following article from Valor magazine, Vol.1, no.15, August, 1951]One dear reader on the West Coast doesn't like the Golden Scripts. It is not because of the doctrine. He believes the doctrine. It's the style of the Golden Scripts he doesn't like. He can't see why the Elder Brother should talk in the stilted and formal speech of John Wycliffe's England, the era when the King James Version of the Bible was translated. It shocks him, he says, to have the language of the Biblical Psalms turn up such modern words as inertia, and galvanism, and atoms, and enigmas. Why can't the Golden Scripts be written in the modern style of Road into Sunrise? [novel written by Pelley] What was the idea in transcribing such an anachronism? Couldn't the Elder Brother have talked as we talk today?The answer to it is, the Recorder [Pelley] had nothing to do with it. He took what was dictated, and lacked the temerity and audacity to alter one syllable, excepting where he became aware of errors in transcription making for bad grammar, or where repetitious lines or phrases could be foreshortened in the interests of sensible editing. But the meaning and phraseology was carefully preserved intact.The whole constitutes what is known and recognized in literature as the \\"Sacred Form\\". True, it stems out of the style of language of the 14th Century in England. But throughout the past five hundred years, by conscientiously adhering to the Wycliffe text, the style has acquired a distinction, as a style, that identifies supernal authorship. Using a pertinent analogy, no one could expect an attorney to draw up a legal document in the phraseology of a sports commentator describing a prize fight. When a document has been presented in \\"legal language\\", we know that a qualified attorney has authored it. Such \\"forms\\", conveying the nature of the authorship by the manner in which a given work is written, are features of cultural intelligence in themselves. Savages and illiterates use only one style of expression chiefly because their vocabularies aren't extensive enough to do otherwise.When the Elder Brother was on earth, the English language hadn't evolved. He spoke and taught in Aramaic -- what we might call the polyglot \\"Yiddish\\" of His period, or Hebrew mixed with the tongues of the prevailing peoples. His use of the Sacred Form for the English of today identifies who is speaking.If the Golden Scripts were presented in the phrase and idiom of the Reader's Digest, no one would have the means of knowing who was talking! Using Wycliffe's 14th Century English is the hallmark of the authorship.Anyhow, He used that form of expression for reasons that seemed adequate to Him. This subconscious notion prevailing in some quarters that the Recorder must have had arbitrary jurisdiction over what came through is largely an indication that readers have only \\"gotten\\" the erudition academically.The fact that the form of the Golden Scripts startles such critics actually indicates how successfully the style has scored.Golden Scripts"},{"Title":"The golden scripts","review":"I believe this is the only book I have read more than once.

My first read, at age 13, was difficult. I did not like the King James style, it seemed pretentious to me. Reading it again years later it seemed better every time. I could actually easily understand passages which were previously a mystery to me. Each time was more enlightening.This is not the only book of spiritual ideology for me. I have read from most every religion and science. The Golden Scripts is a great book. I know there is some controversy about the author possibly having been a fascist.

Unfortunately, it can't help but suffer in comparison with &quot;Wet Grave.&quot; Several things in the book struck me as being underdeveloped, and I think the main fault was the characterization. Too much information about the characters is given in expository chunks; rather than letting us discover who these people are through their actions and their conversation, we're simply told what their attitudes and personalities are. The story would have been much more effective if they'd been allowed to reveal themselves. The premise itself is fascinating and seldom-seen, but the presentation of the author's ideas would have benefitted from some more subtlety."},{"Title":"Dead March","review":"A fascinating view into the Richmond of the Civil War, with lots of authentic details. I especially like the two well-drawn strong women, a young white widow and a free black herbalist and conjurer. Especially interesting is the dissension over slavery, even in the South, and the dialogue of both high society Richmond and the freed slaves. I'm looking forward to Ann McMillan's next book."},{"Title":"Dead March","review":"With Dead March, Ann McMillan has achieved little more than changing the setting of an old story. The theme of the \\"resurrection man\\" has been around since the middle of the 19th century when Burke and O'Hare ran their ring in Edinburgh, Scotland. Dead March does contain snippets of period detail, but the characters, including protagonist Narcissa Powers, a salt-of-the-earth wise woman, and a charming but corrupt Southern doctor, are formulaic. As for plot, it's all too predictable - proving that certain medical school officials are sanctioning murder in order to acquire cadavers for teaching. Unless this book will serve as your introduction to this topic, there is no mystery, no suspense, no surprises. Ho hum."},{"Title":"Dead March","review":"I liked a number of things about this book. It is well presented in terms of time and place. The history is accurate. Using a young widow as the heroine gives an interesting point of view. On the other hand, the characters, especially the heroine, are underdeveloped. I found I did not greatly care what happened to Narcissa, which is a problem. The supporting characters were more interesting, although they could use some development also. One character changed from a potential villain to a potentional love interest in one or two pages with very little explanation. I am interested enough to want to read the later books in the series and there is potential. However, this book is two or three revisions away from being a really good book."},{"Title":"Dead March","review":"This is a reasonably entertaining book, but there is something slight about it, and the &quot;mystery&quot; hinges on something that is either inaccurate or not properly explained. The basic idea is that doctors of the time, not knowing what germs were, transferred infections from one patient to the next. This is a well-known fact, but McMillan makes it sounds as though the doctors are somehow permanently tainted &quot;Gangrene Mary&quot;s. Of course, in reality, infection could only be passed on if the doctor's hands, bandages, etc. were tainted at the time they were used. Having said that, McMillan uses the concept pretty well to put her characters in an emotionally dramatic situation. I wish that she had included more historical detail -- I never feel that I get a real sense for the setting, as I do for the New Orleans of Hambly's 19th century mysteries. The war and military hospital scenes are reasonably well done but I wanted, again, more detail. Overall, this is readable and has some good ideas but suffers from an overall lack of intensity."},{"Title":"Dead March","review":"After stumbling upon Ann McMillan's wonderful Civil War mystery with Chickahominy Fever, I decided to go back and start this series from the beginning. Dead March is just as good and also, a good change in this mystery genre.Dead March opens in March of 1861. The Civil War is about to open and Virginia is getting ready to secede. A young widow, Narcissa Powers, lives with her brother in rural Virginia. She receives a letter asking her to quickly come to Richmond. Another brother, Charley, is a student at the Medical College of Virginia and he has contracted a fatal infection. He is being cared for in the house of one of his professors. One of the servants in the house slips a disturbing letter into Narcissa's Bible. The letter was written by Charley and intended for his sister. In it, he asks her help in a serious matter.At the medical school, Charley discovered that one of the cadavers used for teaching purposes was actually a murder victim. But the question remains--are the grave robbers, or \\"resurrection men\\" responsible for this, or was the murder caused by one of the doctors? Narcissa decides to volunteer at Chimborazo Hospital as a way to discover the truth. Powers is aided by several characters who will become regulars including Mirrie Powers (her sister-in-law and an abolitionist), Judah Daniel (a free black herbalist), Brit Wallace (an English journalist) and Cameron Archer (doctor at the medical college and Chimborazo Hospital).McMillan really picks up on the giddy excitement in Richmond as Virginia moves toward secession. Parties, parades, and celebrations are planned throughout the city, but not everyone is in a joyous mood. Professor Powers (Narcissa's father-in-law) states \\"it does seem an occasion for relection and prayer rather than bonfires and marching bands.\\" As for Confederate General Robert E. Lee, \\"Among Richmonders, feeling is divided as to whether Lee more closely resembles God the Father or God the Son.\\" The author really gives us a feeling of living in Richmond on the brink of war.I will definitely make a point of reading all of the books in this series. Unfortunately, I think that there are only four of them at present. What a shame for readers looking for good mysteries."},{"Title":"Dead March","review":"I enjoyed this book,found it inventive and engaging. However, I feel the author allowed her 1998 sensibilities to get in the way of a clear and powerful portrait of this era. Once again the realities of the antebellam south have been glossed and &quot;genteeled down&quot;. The parlor room 'slavery issue' conversations were far more polite than would have been possible if there were truly abolishonist types present. The motivation for the 'resurrection', central to the story, would much more logically have been racism.Removing the darky from the white cemetary for the honor of the family buried there would have made much more sense than the meekly offered excuse given. Surely someone in the capital of the confederacy was a champion for slavery...besides the 'bad' guy. These were complex and contridicted people, I'd love to see more of that in the sequel. But,then what could be left of this story to tell?"},{"Title":"Dead March","review":"Although the cover states that this is a Civil War Mystery, the details contained about the war itself are pretty slim. Instead, we're given a lot of other details, such as medical information for example. The mystery itself doesn't really get explored before the first 150 pages. It loses a star for it, but overall, and enough interesting read that I'm looking forward the second installement of the life of Narcissa Powers."},{"Title":"Dead March","review":"Im 10 years old and i read this book. i thought it was really good. very creepy too. &Uuml; hee hee"},{"Title":"Dead March","review":"Dead March is a Civil War mystery that is right on target. Ann McMillan combines deadly accurate historical and medical research with excellent plotting and characters with real depth. Main character Narcissa Powers is both a woman of her century and a person today's readers can identify with. Virginians may particularly like the references to Richmond, Chesterfield, Hampden-Sydney College and the Medical College of Virginia in the 1860s, but this is far more than a local book, drawing on national, medical and social issues of the times - not to mention a page-turning mystery plot. If you're looking for a Christmas gift, for a friend or yourself, this is it. I can't wait for the sequel."},{"Title":"Dead March","review":"When Narcissa Powers, a young widow, is called to the deathbed of her brother (a young medical student in Richmond at the outbreak of the Civil War) she expects to find tragedy, but not information that points to illegal activities and possibly murder. The charred remains of a letter from her brother persuade Narcissa that there is more to his death than meets the eye. Through the story we are introduced to the &quot;resurrection men&quot; of Richmond who procure corpses for the medical school, a black conjure woman named Judah, and the character of ante-bellum Richmond society on the eve of war.As with most historical mysteries, the plot is not completely surprising (one major exception here is the Margaret Lawrence mysteries set in Revolutionary Maine which leave you gasping) but does have interesting twists and turns. For most historical mystery buffs, the characterizations are the thing and this novel introduces us to some fascinating and complex figures. As for the historical detail all mysteries leave a lot to be desired in this department--but most US readers know more about the American Civil War than they do about 19th-century London or Medieval England, so perhaps the author's flights of fancy are more glaring. Still, McMillan is accurate about 97% of the time, which is more than most!"},{"Title":"Dead March","review":"DEAD MARCH gives historical mystery readers everything they need to beg for more: Ann McMillan has created likable characters whom we want to know better. Civil War sentiments are explored just enough, and historical scientific facts are combined with interesting protagonists in a highly readable way.Especially when young white widow Narcissa Powers interacts with Judah Daniel, an intriguing freed slave and &quot;conjure&quot; woman, future prospects for sequels come to mind.Although there is the beginning of love interest (choices, yet) for Narcissa, I hope Judah too gets her just share. A conjure woman will manage that, surely.If Anne Perry's ancestors had moved to the states, she would have written like McMillan. If Agatha Christie had any historical interest, she could have also."},{"Title":"Dead March","review":"I was enjoying the historical accuracy and detail so much, the slam-bang, exciting conclusion took me by surprise. The author did an impeccable job. It's an excellent story, but no dainty hoopskirted romp, either. The scene in Richmond City at foggy, midnight where Cyrus holds the lantern and searches in the cavern under the slab for his father's body was not for the faint hearted. Patricia Cromwell grosses you out, Ms. McMillan gives you goose bumps.Perfect for me as it combines my two favorite things, i.e., civil war times and mysteries. I agree with previous reviewer who noted such even handed discussion of slavery was highly improbable. Looking forward to more books in this series."},{"Title":"Dead March","review":"Having written my senior thesis on Confederate Nursing, I was surprised to find a fictional story about womens role in Civil War Nursing. History has given us much on the role of Yankee women nurses, but Southern womens efforts are still to a large part neglected. In jumps Narcissa Powers. A believable Southern belle; too effeminate and simple at times, you wonder why she is the heroine and not Jubah? A most respectable woman. I don't agree with the war being entirely focused on slavery--the one inconsistency in the book I found. But her in depth information on hospital conditions and womens issues is great---I really enjoyed this book. Forget about the murder and mystery! I had fun enough exploring the characters and the medical and cultural body surrounding it. I recommend this story for women enthusiasts of the Civil War. Can't wait for the sequel to come out in paperback!"},{"Title":"Dead March","review":"In 1861, both sides expect to quickly and easily win the Civil War. However, the impact of battle has not been felt and deaths have not yet increased. White Virginian Narcissa Powers rushes to the side of her dying brother Charley Wilson, a medical student. She is shocked when he dies from a minor infection. However, before succumbing, he manages to whisper the dreaded word \\"resurrection\\". Later, she finds a burnt letter form Charley in which he explains his role as a grave digger, seeking corpses for medical research. He insists one such corpse was the victim of murder and not a disease.At about the same time, Cyrus Roper hires free blackwoman Judah Daniel to investigate the deaths of Charley and the cadaver that appeared to be a murder victim. Soon, Narcissa and Judah defy society's basic tenet of their segregated society and join forces to uncover the truth.DEAD MARCH is a lively retelling of the period between Fort Sumter and the first battle of Manassas, which begins the bloody and deadly stage of the Civil War. The story line is intriguing, fast-paced, and extremely authentic; while The mystery is first rate. The prime characters are all understandable and their motives fully developed. In this debut novel, relationships remain tenuous as they should be at this point. Fans of historical mysteries and the Civil War era must read Ann McMillan's fabulous story that hopefully will be followed with more period who-done-its.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Dead March","review":"I felt compelled to write a review about this book; most of these reviews rave about the period details. There are, certainly, many of those. But the reviews also made it sound as though a freed slave and white widow automatically become sleuth-buddies; this is not the case in the book, nor would it have been in antebellum Virginia. The plot does begin to thicken by page 200, and if you can stick it out, it is worth it. One review compares this to Cold Mountain. To anyone who loved that book, as I did, this is no Cold Mountain. It is an interesting mystery, but with some drawbacks. A definite buy, however, if you are from the Richmond, VA area."},{"Title":"Dead March","review":"Being a pediatric resident and having been a medical student here at the Medical College of Virginia, it's good to see a book about the place.

I'm waiting for the next one."},{"Title":"Dead March","review":"Some historical novels duck the difficult issues of the time, or distort those issues with modern interpretation. &quot;Dead March,&quot; on the other hand, is unflinching and clear-eyed as it deals with the wrenching issues that faced Richmond, and all America, in 1861. Narcissa, the young white widow, and Judah Daniel, the free black healer, have a prickly relationship that rings true. One reveiwer complains that previous reviews characterize them as buddies, which they aren't. That's a problem with mini-review shorthand, but it's one of the virtues of the book. The mystery is well told and deftly plotted. The characters are full of life. This book has appeal far beyond Richmond. If this is really the author's first novel, it's a stunner."},{"Title":"Saddam's Iraq: Face-Off in the Gulf","review":"The topic of Iraq is very touchy these days. It has caused a lot of debate in this country, most of which is highly uninformed. The reviews written about this book so far are a good example of this. First of all, the book doesn't speak negatively about Reagan, it speaks accurately about him...and doesn't \\"slam\\" Bush or his father. The authors point out some of the world's concerns about a war with Iraq, but that can hardly be twisted into attacks on Bush.As time has progressed, Iraq has become an increasingly embarassing subject for those who advocated war. No Al-Qaeda link and no WMD's pretty much destroy Bush's reasons for going to war. When talking about America's role in Iraq, this book goes easy on the U.S. This country's policy towards Iraq was directly linked to the deaths of millions inside the country, all for the sake of stability and achieving short term goals. I don't care how self-righteous some conservatives think they are, nothing can change the fact that we armed Saddam in the 80's then stood by and watched while he gassed his own people. The Reuters reporters provide a brief look at some of the main features of Iraq in a way that acknowledges America's shady role inside Iraq, but doesn't criticize it the way that it deserves."},{"Title":"Saddam's Iraq: Face-Off in the Gulf","review":"Unfortunately, I must respectfully agree with Mr. Hale's review of this book.

Anyone can walk to the bathroom at night because they have convinced themselves that no one is in the house. But the child who walks stiffly down the hallway when he is convinced that there is a robber in the house, he is the braver.I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I would have liked to see the ending changed to be more of a recognition of the true fortunes they possessed in their imagination and family. I laughed at parts, nearly cried at others."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF THE TREASURE SEEKERS","review":"I know that talk about updating classic books is taboo, but a rewrite of this would be wonderful. The language of the book is extreamly dated. Sayings and wordings are very hard for a child to understand, because there is not enough understanding of the time period in this day and age. Kids would realy enjoy this book if it was rewritten in more modern wording. I can clearly see why it was an acclaimed book for many years after it wes first published. There is a film made from the book and My kids did love that(which is why I wanted to read them the book)."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF THE TREASURE SEEKERS","review":"First of all...I love old books.

That accounts for some of the references being undecipherable. Also, she wrote about 100 years ago. That accounts for more of the references being undecipherable. And lastly, I know that it's almost impossible for any two people (say, Nesbit and me) to have read all the same books and have all the same cultural references in our heads. That accounts for some of the references being undecipherable.I was rereading this the other night and idly decided to make a note of every reference that I didn't understand. Through a 242-page book, I found 24 references. My husband is English, so I checked some of these with him on the off chance that some of them were still going concerns in the UK today...most of them weren't. Here are a few things we couldn't figure out. I'm paraphrasing because my notes are here but my book is not.\\"You know let dogs delight\\"\\"What happened to the guinea pig? Of course you know the answer to that.\\" (There was no reference to a guinea pig in the discussion under way.)\\"Tourbillon\\"\\"Boys of England\\" books\\"The red deer that Edward shot...we were Children of the New Forest...\\"\\"Gaboriau\\"\\"Going to Klondike\\"There are more, but that's kind of the gist of it. Anyway, despite all this, the book is still an OK read and the kids do some entertaining things a la typical Nesbit. That's why it got 3 stars instead of only 1."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF THE TREASURE SEEKERS","review":"A word about me--I am the mother of four children ages 7-17 and have always loved to read. My favorite books as a child are still a pleasure for me today, although I read them more critically now: the Narnia books (where I first read about the Bastables on the first page of &quot;The Magician's Nephew&quot;); &quot;A Little Princess,&quot; &quot;The Secret Garden,&quot; &quot;Little Lord Fauntleroy,&quot; and &quot;Toinette's Philip;&quot; &quot;Little Women,&quot; &quot;Ivanhoe,&quot; &quot;Tom Sawyer,&quot; &quot;Uncle Tom's Cabin,&quot; &quot;Hans Brinker,&quot; &quot;Tales of King Arthur,&quot; &quot;Scottish Chiefs,&quot; etc. After my children were born I discovered new classics: Edward Eager, &quot;The Phantom Tollbooth,&quot; Philip Pullman, Diana Wynne Jones, Lloyd Alexander, and of course Harry Potter.The Bastable books were written for literate children of 8-14 almost a hundred years ago, and may be a little difficult for the easy-reader child of today, who thinks Harry Potter is full of hard words! It also has an &quot;I&quot; narrator, which many children do not like. But E. Nesbit was one of the first great children's writers, and in my opinion this is the best of all her books.Although E. Nesbit is rightly well-known known for fantasies like &quot;The Phoenix and the Carpet,&quot; &quot;The Enchanted Castle,&quot; or &quot;Five Children and It,&quot; this book is not a fantasy. The Bastables are six lively children who live in a dreary London suburb in a row house. Their mother is dead, their discouraged, rather milquetoast father has lost all his money. The children are left to their own devices, since they can no longer afford to go to school (this is the turn of the 19th century). They decide to go about seeking their fortune, and do so in the most imaginative and amusing ways. They often get into trouble, bicker, pout, and basically act like real children; but their emphasis on old-fashioned honor and bravery is a welcome change from modern books. Many of the scenes are very funny, especially to older readers who can figure out what is really happening, versus what the children think is happening. It is also fascinating to see how creative the children have to be to entertain themselves-- which they are very good at! and to marvel at how much more freedom of movement children had in those days. No one is worrying about their safety as they travel around London alone all day long. The narration itself is clever, both because the narrator, who is one of the children, tries to write in a literary style (with funny results), and because the narrator is trying to fool the reader.The children accidentally bury alive a neighbor boy who &quot;doesn't know how to play,&quot; ruin a fishing contest, kill a pudding, play with a real princess, meet a famous politician and a poet, and set out to catch a burglar. They quarrel over lost balls, who should pay for treats, and who has to take care of the youngest brother, whom they have nicknamed after a cereal ad, and who always insists on tagging along. You find yourself laughing and realize that these could be children you know today. There is almost no Victorian/Edwardian sentimentality (some may have been required to be publishable in those days, just as political correctness is now), and only a few convenient happy endings.This book brings the past to life more vividly than almost any I have ever read. I find myself thinking of it whenever I read about that period of history. It's odd to think the boys would have been just the age to fight and perhaps die in the First World War. The Bastables are a children's classic."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF THE TREASURE SEEKERS","review":"Some of the cultural references in the book are obscure, but finding what they mean can be a lot of fun. Here is the context of \\"Let dogs delight...\\" It is from an old hymn to encourage children to get along with each other. Here is the text:Song 16. Against quarrelling and fighting. (8,6,8,6)Let dogs delight to bark and bite,For God has made them so:Let bears and lions growl and fight,For \`tis their nature, too.But, children, you should never letSuch angry passions rise:Your little hands were never madeTo tear each other's eyes.Let love through all your actions run,And all your words be mild:Live like the blessed Virgin's Son,That sweet and lovely child.His soul was gentle as a lamb;And as his stature grew,He grew in favour both with man,And God his Father, too.Now, Lord of all, he reigns above;And from his heavenly throneHe sees what children dwell in love,And marks them for his own."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF THE TREASURE SEEKERS","review":"I find it odd that a book should be faulted because a reader doesn't understand all the references. For me as a child, puzzling out what phrases like \\"Let dogs delight\\" meant was fun -- even when I never did figure it out, or didn't figure it out until years later when I came upon the source. That was fun, too: to be reading something else or traveling in England and suddenly get the reference -- and think \\"So THAT's what she meant!\\"But the references are a minor detail.This was one of my favorite books as a child and I now think it is one of the greatest books ever written for children: funny, insightful, well-written, inspiring -- and unexpectedly moving in places, too. I still laugh out loud when I read it, and I still admire the children enormously: for their imaginations, resourcefulness, kindness to each other, loyalty, and, perhaps most of all, for their very English courage -- the way they deal with what drearier people would complain about.Philosophically, I very much object to the idea that everything in a book should be easy to understand and known already to the readers. Surely one of the joys of reading is to be exposed to new ideas, people, places -- to learn?Another great writer for children, PL Travers, the author of MARY POPPINS, writes about the enormous pleasure and stimulation she (as a child) derived from trying to puzzle out the meanings of phrases in adults' conversation, such as \\"she lived on her capital.\\" (She phrases it better than I do here -- but she as a child imagined this aunt as a sort of ogress, nibbling on her own fingers and toes during an afternoon nap.)It's probably true that E.Nesbit's writing is not for everyone-- but what is? I for one think it's great that children still love her -- and despite all the efforts that have been made to dumb their books and everything else down,that they still enjoy puzzling out (or simply accept and move on from) what they don't understand at a first glance.Many authors -- Noel Streatfield and CS Lewis to name two more - have paid tribute to E.Nesbit. Noel Coward kept copies of her books by her bed. She still makes me laugh out loud, and very few authors from any era can do that."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF THE TREASURE SEEKERS","review":"The Treasure Seekers is written from the point of view of a young British boy trying along with his siblings to recover \\"the lost treasures of the house of Bastable.\\"The book is crammed with hilarity. To begin with, the speaker says that he will not give away who he is - \\"While the story is going on you may be trying to guess, only I bet you don't.\\" Throughout the book, he makes little digs about his siblings, and adds things like, \\"Oswald often thinks of very intersting things. And directly he thought of it he did not keep it to himself, as some boys would have, but he told the others.\\"His writing is very straightforward and honest (if biased), like a boy. And he does not try to be funny at all. Some ironies are obvious to the reader, making us chuckle while Oswald is very serious about them.On the whole, Oswald is very likeable and understandable and creative, as are Dora, Dicky, Alice, Noel, and H.O. They get into scrapes with their good intentions, but the ending (in Oswald's words) \\"is like what happens in Dickens's books; but I think it was much jollier to happen like a book.\\""},{"Title":"THE STORY OF THE TREASURE SEEKERS","review":"The Treasure SeekersThe six Bastable children are determined to restore their family fallen fortunes. They do not know exactly what it was that made their fortunes \\"fall\\" but it had something to do with mother dying, father being sick and his business partner running away. This depressing information is brought about casually and is merely the background for what is about to follow - a (very funny) treasure hunt practiced upon in different ways. Dora, Oswald, Dicky, Alice, Noel and H.O. all have different plans to get to their goal, ranging from helping an elderly gentlemen in distress (absence of apparent distress is a small obstacle) to answering a newspaper ad promising 2 pounds a week earned in your spare time - and are about to systematically try out all of them.The story is told by one of the Bastable children, one that does not wish to reveal his identity. It is a great wonder therefore that Oswald gets such a favorable description...\\"Oswald put lumps of coal on the fire with his fingers, so as not to make a noise. He is a very thoughtful boy, and he did not wipe his fingers on his trouser leg as perhaps Noel or H.O. would have done...\\"This is a lesser-known story of Edith Nesbit but is the first book published by her and a real masterpiece. This book is just as lovely as her more famous \\"Railway Children\\" and like that story works on both the adult and the child level. The book is full of detailed descriptions of conversations, food (very British), grave decisions and pretend play. The Bastable children do not feel miserable unless reminded and the book is a great, very amusing read. The language (which can sometimes be quite difficult for the modern reader) is, as Oswald explains, sometimes taken out of books and especially the \\"Jungle Book\\" (\\"Good Hunting\\" they wish each other). Contrary to other reviewers, I enjoyed the \\"air of another time\\" even if I did not always understand all the expressions.This is a story of children in another era, trying to entertain themselves when they cannot afford school and need to struggle alone without the presence and explanations of adults (their self made explanations to unclear expressions, such as \\"seven times removed from the queen\\" are hilarious). The story is very cosmopolite in the sense that these are really stories of human kindness and nobility in all its forms. This is something adults and children alike can share, each according to his perceptions. The story is so rich with a sense of a different time, adventure, humor and human sociology that anyone can find something to suit his heart."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF THE TREASURE SEEKERS","review":"The Treasure Seekers concerns a family of six children in turn-of-the-century England.

Oswald, the second-eldest sibling, narrates the tale without holding back on his opinions as to how a story should be told. (Example: &quot;There are some things I must tell before I begin to tell about the treasure-seeking, because I have read books myself, and I know how beastly it is when a story begins 'Alas! said Hildegarde with a deep sigh, 'we must look our last on this ancestral home' -- and then some one else says something -- and you don't know for pages and pages where the home is, or who Hildegarde is or anything about it.&quot;) I'm happy to find this book is in print in the US -- now I'm going to look for The Wouldbegoods..."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF THE TREASURE SEEKERS","review":"This is Nesbit's first and best novel for kids.

It's not one of her fantasy books, so don't expect phoenixes or amulets--just expect a lot of laughs, and a book you'll want to read over and over, and share with everyone you meet."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF THE TREASURE SEEKERS","review":"Oh, yes, I quite enjoyed Five Children and It and The Phoenix and the Carpet and so on when I was a child; they're magnificent children's books. But listening to the Librivox recording of The Story of the Treasure-Seekers makes it very, very clear that the magnificent Ms. Nesbit had very firmly in mind the parents who would be reading the books aloud at bedtime. One beautiful example is a scene in which an adult abruptly rises from his seat and walks away to stand at the window with his back to the children in his office. The narrator says he believes the man was trying to conceal his emotions. Which is very true; the emotions, however, were not what the narrator thought. But the narrator, and any child reading or listening who has utter faith that all is just as the narrator perceives it, may believe one thing; the beautiful layer of comedy in the moment is reserved for the grown-ups.Thank goodness we get something; in almost everything else the children are the fortunate ones.The Bastable children possess an innocence which I'm very much afraid is impossible for even a twelve-year-old today. I've seen comments out there amongst the reviews about \\"imperialist overtones\\" and casual racism. Thing is, though, this was first published in 1899, and like it or not the world was a very different place then, and as I read it even what could be considered racist has an innocence that keeps it from being offensive. The children are given to understand that a visitor is an Indian, and - fed on adventure novels - assume Amerind, and ask him about beavers. He's India Indian, though, and has no information on such creatures. I honestly don't see how the children's honest excitement about and sympathy for someone from far away who describes himself as a poor broken-down fellow (which they also take literally) can be translated as racist, especially in 1899, and the one extremely unfortunate exclamation that can be (the same as is found in L.M. Montgomery's A Tangled Web) was, sadly, a much more common epithet a hundred years ago.These are the sort of fictional children that make me despair over today's kids: imaginative, well-read, well-spoken, thoughtful under the childish self-centeredness, and self-sufficient; they make today's kids (American, at least) look like Neanderthals. They're not perfect little angels - E. Nesbit was never stupid. But they do set a ludicrously high standard.Dora, the eldest (at 13 or 14?), comes off as a bit of a prig (though this is dealt with in a later chapter in such a way that it made me cry), desperately trying to maintain some moral high ground in a horde of siblings who think it would be absolutely smashing if there were still highwaymen on the heath - or, even better, if they could be highwaymen on the heath. Her objection is that it's \\"wrong\\" - as in illegal and people hang for such things, not so much as in the victims of the highwaymen didn't think it was quite so smashing. The again-innocent bloodthirstiness of the kids is remarkable, and just fun.Oswald, the oldest boy at 12 and (you might guess, or you might not!) the narrator of the story, is very nearly as brave and honourable as he wants to appear, and very straightforward. It's rather lovely to see him reluctantly, realistically doing the right thing throughout the book, proceeding quietly and alone when practical - the older ones all do that, shouldering responsibility and striving to make things right when they go wrong. The fierce affection and loyalty among the siblings is, like their father's poverty and worries, never explicitly stated: it doesn't have to be. It is shown, not told.The four younger children - Noel and Alice and H.O. and Dickie, ranging down to I believe six years old - are every one expected by their elder siblings to be just as sharp and responsible and willing and able to contribute as Oswald and Dora. Some allowances are made for their extreme youth, but for the most part they are equal partners in the treasure-seeking, receiving an equal share in any profits - though sometimes excused by protective siblings from punishments.I don't remember E. Nesbit reducing me to tears in the past. This did. And, yes, I laughed out loud. I missed the magic element of some of the other books - but only at first. It didn't take long to realize that most of the magic of E. Nesbit's writing is actually in E. Nesbit's writing.To that point: \\"No book is really worth reading at the age of ten which is not equally - and often far more - worth reading at the age of fifty and beyond.\\" ~ C.S. Lewis. I look forward to reading E. Nesbit when I'm fifty, and beyond."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF THE TREASURE SEEKERS","review":"When I started to read this book for the first time, I thought it was somewhat depressing. I mean, their father had no more money and their mother had died? I was a bit surprised at this, since it wasn't exactly like what I had previously read from her.

In this volume, they analyze the capital ships of the Netherlands, Great Britain, France and the Soviet Union. Overall, they rate the units of France as the best in the 35,000 treaty class due the Richelieu's fine protection and speed coupled with excellent firepower. The authors analyze the loss of Prince of Wales to Japanese air attack and the loss of Hood to Bismarck in intricate detail.

It comes close to the experience of on the spot study of the design, construction and operational life of dreadnoughts of allied Navies, leading every naval buff to the very insight of the ship themselves. Each class is thoroughly illustrated, giving detailed information of ship's armament, protection systems, engineering and machinery. The best facet is the careful examination of operational career of each ship and the analysis of battle damage sustained by the ship according to testimonies, technical data and the most probable reconstruction of incoming shell trajectory. The damage studies are interesting since they are presented with extensive use of line drawings, further explaining the ships' innermost structural architecture. Another remarkable feature is the extensive chapter dedicated to Soviet wartime effort to build capital ships. It literally casts a light on the subject, providing many facts and photographs of this unknown page of II WW. Profiles, armor diagrams, shear,frame &amp; body plans, line drawings are very accurate as they are results of blueprints' deep investigation.This book is really an authoritative source for studying battleships from their inception to their final days."},{"Title":"Battleships: Allied Battleships in World War II","review":"Excellent as a general technical reference.

Wish they would redo the book on US battleships."},{"Title":"Battleships: Allied Battleships in World War II","review":"I'm adding my voice to the chorus of praise for the G&amp;D books. The attention to detail is impressive. The authors go so far as to account for the different definitions of &quot;inch&quot;--an inch of armor in the Royal Navy was actually 0.98in, and this reflects correctly in the figures cited for the KGV, Lion, and Vanguard classes. In citing the damage inflicted on France's Dunkerque by exploding depth charges, the authors properly tally, not the amount of explosive in all the depth charges lying alongside the ship, but only the amount which detonated properly. Impressive work.It should be no surprise that more recent revelations have overtaken G&amp;D's look at Soviet designs. Still, the info they do present is generally representative of the design's actual properties. A similar state applies in the chapter on Dutch Design 1047.The only caution requiring the reader's attention is that the occasional typo pops up to confuse the statistical information. This is a general caveat for all three volumes rather than this one in particular."},{"Title":"Battleships: Allied Battleships in World War II","review":"FIRST THOUGHTS: THIS VOLUME INCLUDED BOTH THE MOST AND LEAST FAMILIAR SHIPS TO METhis was a real pleasure to wade through. Although I have read a great many volumes which detail the British Dreadnought classes quite well, I knew very little about the 2 French classes and the proposed Dutch Battlecruiser. The oversize fold-out sketches were a real pleasure to behold, especially under a bright light and a magnifying glass. Over the years I have read many books about naval vessels and military history and this volume, like the rest of the series, adds some new and fresh perspectives to my thinking. Whereas NO single book or series on the subject of 'Battleships' can be considered THE FINAL WORD on the subject, this series, of which this specific volume belongs, is so well organized, detailed and comprehensive that I firmly believe that it is a 'must-have' for those with an intense interest in Battleships - like myself.IN A NUTSHELL: CASE STUDIES OF 8 DISTINCTLY DIFFERENT CLASSES OF DREADNOUGHTS FROM 4 COUNTRIESCHAPTER ONE: INTRODUCTIONCHAPTER TWO: THE DUNKERQUE CLASSCHAPTER THREE: THE RICHELIEU CLASSCHAPTER FOUR: THE NETHERLANDS - DESIGN 1047CHAPTER FIVE: THE KING GEORGE THE V CLASSCHAPTER SIX: THE LION CLASSCHAPTER SEVEN: THE VANGUARDCHAPTER EIGHT: THE SOVIETSKII SOYUZ CLASSCHAPTER NINE: SOVIET BATTLECRUISERSCHAPTER TEN: CONCLUSIONAPPENDIXESA. FULL-SCALE ORDNANCE TRIALSB. THE PRINCE OF WALESC. BATTLESHIP AND BATTLECRUISER GUNSWHAT IT IS: THE ABSOLUTE ZENITH OF A NATION'S JINGOISTIC TECHNOLOGY & POWERIn essence, the Dreadnought represents everything a powerful or wanna-be powerful nation can impart into a ship to project power on the behalf of that nation. I just made that up, but it is so obviously true. When one goes through these volumes, one can see a combination of the national pride, desperation and deviousness that lay behind the erection of fleets of these incredible vessels. Here are some motives that are touched on in these volumes:The British wishing to limit the size, power and number of Battleships by treaty as their global fortunes were on the wane proposed and built ships that were less than ideal in all respects prior to World War 2;The Japanese wishing to keep the world in the dark as to the size and power of their new ships [Yamato Class], hide the construction of the ships and put out false documents regarding the ships' displacement and the gun caliber of its main batteries [460mm];The Americans utilizing the escalator clause to include 16\\" guns in the North Carolina class as a response to the secret Japanese building program;The Germans building larger ships than they were limited by treaty to do as the need for armored protection increased as war approached;The French built the Dunkerque and Richelieu class as a response to the Germans building the 'Pocket Battleships\\", followed by their 'Battlecruisers';BOTTOM LINE: THE SECOND VOLUME OF AN AWESOME HISTORIC TRILOGYAfter a complete reading of the entire trilogy, I feel, I now better understand the construction and design considerations that lead to a completed Dreadnought. These books including this volume have fed my interest and have encouraged me to look deeper into the topic of Dreadnought engineering and construction. Now, after reading this series, and then re-reading it, I feel better able to grasp the technical materials that I will have to deal with as I continue to delve into the fascinating topic of 'Dreadnoughts' and their effect on history."},{"Title":"Battleships: Allied Battleships in World War II","review":"For anyone who is a serious student of battleship history.

Eliot opposed the cheery images of villagers happily frolicking in their quaint but comely homes. She intended to inject a lasting note of rustic realism in the person of Silas, a character deliberately conceived as a fairy tale creation. By depicting the metamorphosis of Silas from one of twisted values to one of traditional humanistic ones amidst the background of the pastoral fairy tale, Eliot was able to present a believable tale of personal redemption that made use of the political, economic, and social changes that were transforming England from a rural to an industrial based economic system.Silas is initially seen as a sympathetic character who suffers from a false accusation of theft in his small rural village. It is this village that connotes a totality of pre-industrial images of which much of England's older population still retained vivid memories. After his journey to Raveloe, he lives in a small cottage where he works as a weaver and slowly accumulates a hoard of gold which he keeps buried in the floorboards. He likes to play with his gold in a non-productive manner that now calls to mind the similar antics of the cartoon character Scrooge McDuck, both of whom saw their treasure only in terms of watching it grow. This gold is the central symbol of the book, for when he encounters the golden haired Eppie, he transfers his fascination from coin to strand, a changeover which mirrors a similar melding of gold as non-functional to gold as human functional in that a growing capitalist society began to include increasing numbers of newly rich middle class entrepreneurs who put their gold to productive use. As Silas raises Eppie from baby to young woman, he similarly raises his own consciousness so that the bitterness that led him to Raveloe he now sees as but the first step in his redemption. It is not only his ability to shed his bitterness that marks his emotional growth. He now can reintegrate himself into the community of men that he symbolically discarded when he entered the isolation of his secluded home. He further comes to trust in a Higher Power that he was sure had discarded him earlier. Finally, through Silas, Eliot shows that personal redemption also includes the belief that justice delayed is not justice denied. Contrapuntally, the one who stole the treasure for which Silas was blamed did not escape justice. He was killed by falling into a stone pit. Godfrey Cass, who refuses to identify himself as the true father of Eppie, is punished for doing what Silas does willingly. Godfrey must endure seeing his daughter raised by the very one whose purse is dwarfed by Godfrey but whose heart dwarfs Godfrey's. In the regeneration of Silas' nearly lost humanity, Eliot shows that as long as one has someone to care for, then the giving of care results in its return with interest, sort of like investing gold rather than hoarding it."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"George Eliot, born Marian Evans in 1819, spent most of her early life in rural Warwickshire. This early upbringing is apparent from her easy comfort in writing about country settings, with attention to detail and niceties that a born-Londoner would generally not be able to provide. Eliot's life was not that of the typical Victorian lady; she worked in publishing, including periodicals, translations, and writing her own fiction. Eliot led a 'colourful' life; living in a common-law marriage with Lewes, a man who left his wife and children for her, she then married after his death a man twenty years her junior, only to die eight months later.Silas is a weaver, a rather grumpy and sour man, whose primary occupation and avocation is the making of money. He is an outsider in Raveloe, having been driven from his earlier community under the false accusation of theft, an accusation that also cost him his engagement to his beloved, and left him with little faith in human nature, particularly that of the church-ly humans.The high society in Raveloe reached the pinnacle in the Cass family. Squire Cass had two sons, Godfrey and Dunstan, each his own unique form of scoundrel. Godfrey, who had an illicit marriage to a local barmaid Molly, is being blackmailed by his spendthrift brother Dunstan. Alas, Godfrey is expected to marry another, Nancy Lammeter, daughter of another society family. Godfrey attempts to buy off Dunstan with his horse, Wildfire, and during a journey to sell the horse Dunstan accidentally injures and kills Wildfire.Dunstan is stranded in the countryside, but sees light from a cottage -- the home of Silas Marner, reputed after fifteen years of weaving and miserly activity of having accumulated a large stash. He steals the bags of money he finds in the deserted cottage, and disappears into the night.Silas reports the theft, but is unaided. He is heartbroken, for his life's purpose has been the accumulation of this wealth. No one seems to make the connexion between the lost money and the disappearance of Dunstan (one flaw in the novel, in my opinion). Silas gradually recovers from this blow, and the people of Raveloe begin for the first time to see him in terms of friendship.At a Christmas party, the Cass family is in full celebration, for the upcoming marriage of Godfrey and Nancy. However, Nancy is not pleased, given Godfrey's reputation. Later in the holiday season, Molly makes her way to the Cass estate and confronts Godfrey with a two-year-old daughter in tow. Upon her return from the estate, she falls and dies in a drunken, drug-induced stupor, and the child wanders through the snow to the cottage of Silas. Silas lays claim to the golden-haired child, and Godfrey is relieved to be free from Molly and paternity.Sixteen years pass, and we come to meet a very different Silas, one who is now a truly human being, who is loved, and has an object of love in his daughter Eppie. Eppie is in fact about to be wed to the nice Aaron Winthrop. Godfrey and Nancy, however, have had a loveless and childless marriage.Things develop rapidly near the end of the novel. A pond near Silas' cottage is drained, and the remains of Dunstand with two bags of gold coins is found. Godfrey feels compelled to tell his wife now everything, how Dunstan dishonoured the family, how he (Godfrey) was being blackmailed, and admits his paternity of Eppie. Nancy is strangely tolerant -- she only complains of not having been told sooner. They decide to demand that Eppie be returned to them.In a beautiful scene of compassion and love, Eppie, given the free choice of deciding between Silas and connexion with the noble Cass family, opts for the man who was her true father, and chooses to remain with Silas.Later, Silas and Eppie revisit Lantern Yard, from which Silas was expelled so many years before. Here in no longer the old church, his old home, or his old friends -- all has changed; life has gone on. The old place is dirty and noisy by comparison to the serene Raveloe. The question of Silas' guilt or innocence cannot be resolved, but then, is no longer a question of concern for anyone in either place. Eppie then marries Aaron, in a wedding paid for by Godfrey, who cannot attend due to business, and Eppie declares in the end that 'nobody could be happier than we are.'Elliot intended to show that misfortune can lead to greater things, and provided a typical Victorian happy ending.This novel has been a traditional one assigned to students of secondary school age for decades now; it is a classic, fairly simple in construction and vocabulary, and brings up the timeless themes of good, evil, fate, and has a wide range of characters who change over time. Alas, many school-age readers come away cold, often determined never to read another novel again, as it is presented poorly and not put in a more modern context which students will more readily understand. But, it remains a good story, and a fine representative of the Victorian novel."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"I would say that it is very difficult to read, but that makes you want to understand. I had to read it for school, and it was excellent! I would have given it a five had it not been for the ending. aFter all that Silas goes through, yes, you are happy for him, but things work out too well. There is not enough tragedy or bittersweetness at the end to make you think about it constantly and writhe in the pain of the characters, thinking, if only. I really get into books like that. But this book, however good and painful throughout ended TOO happily. I do like the fact that Silas had to endure so much. It made it a tempestuous book, and painful to read. That quality makes the book all the more wonderful. You can really sympathize with the author. It's a good read though, and I reccommend it."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"George Eliot, a.k.a. Mary-Anne Evans, was a popular novelist in her time, which has immediately made her books classic reads in schools, libraries, or even a novelist looking for inspiration to write a novel that shall be a classic in the future. Evans crafted a beautiful plot, and captivates the readers once the background chapters have been set up, and the action begins. It is rare that such a book in our day and age exists, and it is nice to read the popular things that were back in that day and age. I, being in high school, had the option of reading this book or Evans' other brilliant novel, \\"Middlemarch\\". I thought this might be an excellent read, so I chose this.At first, I thought I had made the wrong choice and thought of switching to \\"Middlemarch\\" before it was too late. It starts out slow if you are reading Eliot for the first time, but the mind is only preparing itself to the odd language of the period (thank goodness it isn't Old English). However, once the background of Lantern Yard and Raveloe have been given to us, along with Silas Marner's history, we dive straight into the plot -- Godfrey and Dunstan Cass, Nancy Lammeter, The Red House, The Rainbow, Silas, Eppie, Molly, Priscilla, Squire Cass, Dolly Winthrop, Aaron -- all characters and places which set us into the story. With the dialogue and tension perfectly set, it is no wonder why this has become a classic.Perfect for a classroom, Silas Marner promises each person who reads it a lesson in what really matters to the heart -- in Silas' position, I would have chosen the golden locks too."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"I cannot more agree with the reviewers who say Silas Marner is slow moving at the beginning, and that it is slow moving for the first half of the story, however I find that Silas Marner is not actually a story, more a biography, or a discription of the times. The scenes are that era are very vivid; the characters are very true and clear. Silas's betrayal, his 'death' and his obsession with money are reflected in the monotony of the book, just when you begin to feel the story has completely lost track of any clear-cut line, something new happens. Then, Silas is reborn, he remembers who he has been and his family. The most wonderful thing about this book is its summing up, happy ending. Nothing is left hanging, this book definatly has a good ending, and a book with an ending such as this is clearly the work of a gifted author; such as George Eliot. Do not read this book in search of thrilling plot, and captivating characters, read it for it's planning, and mostly for it's joyful conclusion."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"\\"Middle March\\" is often regarded as George Eliot's greatest novel but \\"Silas Marner\\" is undisputedly a novel foray by the Victorian authoress into the realm of the rustic. First published in 1861,this masterpiece has transcended much beyond the bars of time and even in the 21st. century retains its ambition to tell a colossal saga in a genteel fashion boldly underlined by a conversational tone. \\"Silas Marner\\" is a brief and tightly cultural story invoking a symmetrical plot and adroit symboism to depict the tale of a linen-weaver who loses everything in his life only to discover them in a more divine,vibrant and concord dimension.Silas Marner is a poor,hapless linen-weaver who leaves his own village after being framed in a robbery case by his friend William Dane who goes on to marry his lover Sarah. Ignominy,betrayal and a haunting sense of being abjectly wronged conspire to lead him elsewhere and Silas Marner finds respite from his unforgiving past in the village of Raveloe. Here none is cognizant with his bitter history and Silas becomes a \\"simple weaver\\" and all the more enigmatic for it. He creates an atmosphere of mysteries around him and remains confined in this narrow scope of self-development for fifteen heavily limping years. He hoards up a massive amount of gold and silver but favours miserly expenditure. And then when everything gives the impression of being normal and steady,life takes a sharp bend for Silas Marner and forces him into a strange world.Running parallel with this story of a diminutive figment of the domain of village is the gentryfolk version of a life inndated with posh manners and biting apprehensions,this too in Raveloe. Godfrey Cass is the eldest son of the Squire who succumbs to his brother Dunsey's blackmail and leaves him his horse to sell. Dunsey Cass epitomises all that is lavish and bad and nonsense and grotesque and crooked and deceitful and cunning in a gentry society. He kills the horse in a freak accident and then to save his skin,steals the money from Silas Marner's dilapidated house. At the heart of \\"Silas Marner\\" lies his robbery---it lends an excuse to George Eliot to intersect two different,and at times poignantly contrasting,worlds and in this scheme,the reader is invariably led to ruminate on William Shakespeare's \\"The Merchant of Venice\\",where the two parallel stories,one concerning Antonio's plight thrusted upon by Shylock and the other describing Bassanio's endeavour to win Portia,coincide at the critical junction to shape the drama into the right posture. This comparison is not to say that Shakespeare's \\"The Merchant of Venice\\" and Eliot's \\"Silas Marner\\" resonate with each other but goes a long way really to prove tat the intersection of the various works of literature are not that detached from the intersection of events in a single work of the same.This robbery transmutes the eponymous protagonist of the novel from \\"a half-crazy miser\\" to a God-fearing man of depth and substance. That very same night Silas Marner's house is radiated by the return of the lost gold and silver pieces in a more divine and colourful form:\\"a tamp's child\\". Silas is bold enough to accept her as his daughter and despite being a bachelor,he undertakes for the development of the girl-child he baptises as Eppie. Eppie's growth and realisation of the world in the subsequent years spent amidst poverty and few glimpses of fortune results in Silas's own comprehension and rise from a one-dimensional figure to a pluralistic person,\\"There's good i' this world---I've a feeling o' that now;and it makes a man feel as there's a god more nor he can see,i' spite o' the trouble and the wickedness\\"---this may seem as the ultimate realisation of Silas Marner but it's not as much the understanding of Silas about life as the authoress's recurrent theme:that life,despite all the human,divine and unforseen forces perpetually thretening to distort its shape,is always beautiful.\\"Silas Marner\\" is virtually a ballad inprose and so inevitably always soaked in a gentle reassurance of poetic justice. Throughout these pages,the reader discerns elements of ballad structure,most notably in instances where the vivid flow of the tale is punctuated by phiosophical discourse. George Eliot's general framework of things in this book is great and occasioned with touches of delicate humour and subtle satire blent with the accent of superstitions so vehemently disturbing the society during the writer's era---all these features being reflected in the conversation at the Rainbow---augment the authoress's successful employment of a taut and intense yet elaborate and defining language. George Eliot may be focusing on a particular character in this novel but she doesn't neglect the suitable etching of other characters. art is symbolic in tone with singular effigies representing wider landscapes and in \\"Silas Marner\\" this nature is made pretty evident. Geofrey Cass embodies a man repressed by circumstances and personal fears,Dunsey is the sole villain in the piece,Nancy Lammeter proves a dedicated and devoted wife to Godfrey despite illustrating herself of a meek submissive nature bordering on self-denial,whilst Dolly Winthrop is the most accomplished of women characters in the novel,a constant source of sometimes vain but forever honest judgement and help to Silas Marner.George Eliot's language in this book is typically idyllic with a stunning coupling of narration and dialogue,the former being personal as well as philosophical and the latter neither lofty nor mundane but in essence commonplace and genuine. Dunsey's end is an apt revelation of the writer's belief that truth can never be obscured or erased. The book doesn't attempt to keep many mysteries from the reader---Eppie's father is forever a known person,Dunsey's ultimatum is never in doubt and the conclusion isn't that difficult to fathom. \\"Silas Marner\\" is not a superb classic only for the easy flow of its plot but also for the easy fairy-tale gratifications that it manages to combine with massive social and personal insights. This work must rank alongside the best novels of all time and indeed when George Eliot remarks this about Nancy's elder sister Priscillia,\\"She serves a little pepper to sprinkle over the talk---that's the reason why she never puts too much in her pies\\",we can easily qualify this statement to the authoress's ability to weave magic with her own talks and pies."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"This book explores the best and worst of human nature in people, when they are at their highest and when they are at their lowest points in life. Marner also writes about the good nature in others that can develop after ones worst moments in life. I really enjoyed this book and hope others will to.-Tipcat"},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"On the surface, Silas Marner is a fairly simplistic fable about a jaded weaver who finds solace only in weaving and in counting his gold each night until a little girl appears on his doorstep and he finds meaning and life in her love loosing his obsessions and becoming a well adjusted and well liked person. I can see how some do not find it interesting. It was several weeks after I read it that I realized that maybe Silas Marner was not the main point. He doesn't actually do anything, after all. Everything happens TO him. He simply responds to what happens to him. To rediscover life through the love of a child is a good theme but look at Les Miserables. There is no comparison.Look instead at Godfrey Cass and consider the story with him as the main character. If Silas Marner is actually the counterpart for him instead of the other way around (like a constant in a science experiment), it starts to take on the qualities of a classic. Godfrey Cass is also jaded and harassed but he schemes. He tries to manipulate the circumstances to his best benefit - not in a malicious way, no more than Voltaire's Candide. If we look at it that way, what we have here is an English Candide for, with Silas as the counterpart instead of Godfrey, the moral changes to become, basically, 'Roll with the punches', or - as Voltaire put it, 'We must cultivate our gardens'."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"So, you've savored Middlemarch and reveled in Mill on the Floss. What do you read when you're in the mood for the kind of witty observations and perceptively drawn characters you loved in Eliot's masterpieces? Though more sentimental and simplistically plotted than Eliot's other novels, this slight little fable is nonetheless a rich and rewarding read. It's perceptive, touching and written with Eliot's characteristic grace and gentle humor."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"This book is considered a true classic. The story about a miser who was driven from his original home by false acusations to end up as a miserable weaver in a new town. His life changes when he finds a foundling and begins to care for her. It turns out the girl is the daughter of landed gentry who now want her and Silas does not to give her back. The story is not bad, but I do not understand why it is such a classic. I must be missing something because it was originally written in 1861. It is possible I am missing the forest for the trees in this case. It is a fast read and it is not a bad book by any definition."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"Question: How can you ensure that a person will hate a book? Answer: Make her read it for 7th grade English class, make sure that the language is old-fashioned, and above all, make sure that the ideas and concepts are over her head. If that's what happened to you, and that's why you have an aversion to Silas Marner, and you are now over 30, pick it up again. Read it twice. Silas Marner is one of the greatest novels in the English language.Yes, it starts out sad, as our pathetic hero looses both his trust in humanity and his faith in God. But the power of love replaces his lust for money, and wins out in the end. Meanwhile, morally poor but financially rich, high-living Godfrey Cass provides a counterpoint to simple Silas. At the end there's a surprise when the fate of Godfrey's evil brother is revealed.When you're all done, before you file Silas Marner on the shelf, go back and read the paragraph about Silas' thoughts when he discovers that his hordes of coins are missing. If you have ever felt sudden extreme loss, you will recognize the stages of despair from disbelief to acceptance \\"like a man falling into dark water.\\" Which is why this book is not suitable for children, and is most appreciated by those who have undergone their own moral redemption.Silas has been the inspiration for many other characters, including Dicken's Scrooge. He has been portrayed in movies, including \\"A Simple Twist of Fate\\" starring Steve Martin. But none is as good as the original. If you haven't read it since junior high, try it again.

This is a very human, very English story of simple people living through those very basic emotions that make the world turn and give the universe meaning."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"Silas Marner is an excellent classic novel set in early Nineteenth Century England. In this story, George Eliot (pen name for Mary Ann Evans) depicts a man named Silas Marner, a weaver by trade. He lives happily in his home town of Lantern Yard, until his best friend William Dane betrays him by setting him up as a thief. William then marries Silas' fianc&eacute;e, and Silas is shunned from the town. He eventually settles in a very small cottage in Raveloe, where he spends his days making cloth and other materials for the townspeople. Due to his now secretive and reclusive ways, the people of Raveloe never really come to know Silas, and he lives in solitude, having turned away from his former faith and happiness.But one winter's night, a small orphan girl comes to his house, and everything changes. Silas cares for the child (with the help of his neighbor, Mrs. Winthrop, whose family soon befriends him), and his heart begins to soften.This is a very good representation of the redeeming power of love, and the consequences of a person's actions. For people who enjoy classic literature, this is definitely a must-read.Ryan RobledoAuthor of the Aelnathan:"},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"Reviews of this novel, seem to fall into three categories: those written by people who like to read great literature; those written by people who would prefer to read brain candy; and those written students forced to read the novel as a class assignment and,in some cases, would prefer not to read anything (if the third category is discarded, the average rating is much higher).One of the most remarkable things about this novel is the fact it was written by a woman, using a male pen name, in 19th century England when women were generally oppressed, i.e., they were not encouraged to have careers or to do anything outside the home. The story is well known. A man who blacks out during seizures, not remembering what happened, is falsely accused of theft of money from his church. He is shunned by his former friends and becomes a recluse. When he is later robbed of his savings, and an abandoned child appears on his doorstep in place of the gold, his life is changed as he takes responsibility for the child.This is classic literature from that time period, and is most certainly easier to read than many other novels from the same period (students should consider themselves fortunate that they were not assigned to read one of Thomas Hardy's novels). I first became acquainted with the novel when it was assigned reading in a high school English class. That was over 50 years ago, and the story is one that has stuck in my mind."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"I used to hate \\"Silas Marner\\" when I was forced to read the thing for my English class in Middle School (1959). The teacher I had was terrible AND I was not a gifted student. Since then, over the years, I have reread this classic about four times. Now that I have my Kindle I decided to read it again. The text is laid out very well for the Kindle. At this price it is truly a must-read. What a terrific book!This is a tale of how love conquers all. A bitter man, Silas Marner, who was done wrong gave up on humanity and decided to live in a cocoon of his own making. Silas' only joy and purpose in life was making and hoarding money. He spent hours on end working himself to no end all for the purpose of earning, saving, and collecting money. Then one day his money hoard was stolen. The rest of the story is a lesson in love.I have no idea why; here in America, George Eliot's \\"Silas Marner\\" is not well known. None of my friends have ever heard of this book.

He is heartbroken, for his life's purpose has been the accumulation of this wealth. No one seems to make the connexion between the lost money and the disappearance of Dunstan (one flaw in the novel, in my opinion). Silas gradually recovers from this blow, and the people of Raveloe begin for the first time to see him in terms of friendship.At a Christmas party, the Cass family is in full celebration, for the upcoming marriage of Godfrey and Nancy. However, Nancy is not pleased, given Godfrey's reputation. Later in the holiday season, Molly makes her way to the Cass estate and confronts Godfrey with a two-year-old daughter in tow. Upon her return from the estate, she falls and dies in a drunken, drug-induced stupor, and the child wanders through the snow to the cottage of Silas. Silas lays claim to the golden-haired child, and Godfrey is relieved to be free from Molly and paternity.Sixteen years pass, and we come to meet a very different Silas, one who is now a truly human being, who is loved, and has an object of love in his daughter Eppie. Eppie is in fact about to be wed to the nice Aaron Winthrop. Godfrey and Nancy, however, have had a loveless and childless marriage.Things develop rapidly near the end of the novel. A pond near Silas' cottage is drained, and the remains of Dunstand with two bags of gold coins is found. Godfrey feels compelled to tell his wife now everything, how Dunstan dishonoured the family, how he (Godfrey) was being blackmailed, and admits his paternity of Eppie. Nancy is strangely tolerant -- she only complains of not having been told sooner. They decide to demand that Eppie be returned to them.In a beautiful scene of compassion and love, Eppie, given the free choice of deciding between Silas and connexion with the noble Cass family, opts for the man who was her true father, and chooses to remain with Silas.Later, Silas and Eppie revisit Lantern Yard, from which Silas was expelled so many years before. Here in no longer the old church, his old home, or his old friends -- all has changed; life has gone on. The old place is dirty and noisy by comparison to the serene Raveloe. The question of Silas' guilt or innocence cannot be resolved, but then, is no longer a question of concern for anyone in either place. Eppie then marries Aaron, in a wedding paid for by Godfrey, who cannot attend due to business, and Eppie declares in the end that 'nobody could be happier than we are.'Elliot intended to show that misfortune can lead to greater things, and provided a typical Victorian happy ending.This novel has been a traditional one assigned to students of secondary school age for decades now; it is a classic, fairly simple in construction and vocabulary, and brings up the timeless themes of good, evil, fate, and has a wide range of characters who change over time. Alas, many school-age readers come away cold, often determined never to read another novel again, as it is presented poorly and not put in a more modern context which students will more readily understand. But, it remains a good story, and a fine representative of the Victorian novel.This particular edition contains many extra pieces of commentary, notes and other study aids that will be helpful to the student trying to understand the text, the motivations of the characters, the world context of the story, and different ideas of interpretation."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"Silas Marner is a very interesting book. It is filled with excitement and suspense. I liked the book very much, but as a freshman in high school, it was very hard for me to read. George Eliot uses a lot of dialect along with some Old English words in her lovable tale. Eliot tells the story of a lonely weaver. After getting betrayed by friends in his old town of Lantern Yard, Silas moves to the town of Raveloe searching for a new life. His delusions keep him from getting accepted into the Raveloe community. After losing his faith in God and having his money stolen he gets a very special gift from someone he doesn't know, a little baby girl with golden hair. After that things work out for Silas and Eppie. George Eliot tells her classic novel in great detail with a lot of adjectives and metaphors. She has made a great novel that while a challenge is good for everybody. Silas Marner is really easy to comprehend because it is so realistic. I live in a small town and it reminds me of Raveloe. Sometimes I imagine that I am in Silas Marner's place and all my friends are the villagers. I think about what I would do if I was in Marner's place. Eliot also created a great plot for this book. This classic is great because it teaches people about life. It teaches people not to be selfish and to be kind to people no matter how good you think you are. Eliot has made a great book that would be great to read as a family."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"Silas Marner spends his days weaving for the village-folk of Raveloe, weaving and saving, hiding his money in leather bags in the floor of his home. At nights, he counts the money, tinkling it between his hands, memorising the increasing total. He spends little, and has no friends or family. His life consists of waiting to leave his life, an endless weave that seems to have no beginning and no end.But Silas was not always a weaver. As a young man, he was engaged, and living in another town. But his best friend, William Dane, who was jealous of his good fortune and hopeful prospects, engendered a plan to strip Silas of everything he held dear. His hometown, convinced he was involved with the robbery of a senior deacon, accused him of theft and he was forced to leave. He stumbles upon Raveloe and begins to weave, and fifteen years past.It is to George Eliot's credit that a story with such fairy tale qualities is so successful. From the very beginning we are made aware of character-types and ideas, with Silas being an innocent man wrongly accused, and then, as a weaver, a giant metaphor of toil and struggle in an unfair world. The townsfolk of Raveloe, as they are outlined, remain simply that - a thick line that purports to show the broad details of a person, but in no way offers the subtle shading that makes a character come to life and become a person. But this is to the story's credit, for we are not interested so much in depth of character and complexity of situation, as we are in the constant weaving, the endless sadness, of Silas Marner's self-imposed exile.While we learn of Marner's new life as a hoarder, a miser, a weaver, we come to see other characters and situations. There is a young man, Godfrey, who is running out of money and seeks a desperate measure to fix his worries. There is his father, who disapproves of his life and choices. One New Year's, the two stories intersect, and after Silas is robbed of all his money, a young girl, blonde and innocent and nameless, is found on his doorstep. Her mother, an opium addict, is discovered nearby, frozen to death. A father, if there is one, does not step forward.Here, Eliot allows us to know the secret well before Silas or Eppie, his newly christened adopted daughter. Godfrey is the father, and it is a secret he carries with him well past necessary. His duplicitous action is flagged at a very early stage, which sets in our mind the idea that a comeuppance, or a truth revealing set piece, is somewhere along the line. Because this is known - for what fairy tale does not, in the end, end in goodness and retribution and justice for those who deserve it? - we are able to enjoy the experience of Silas as he becomes a good father, and learns how to love.In a sense, the themes surrounding Silas are trite and over-used. The idea of a sad, lonely man discovering the beauty of the world again through love, is nothing new. Yet Eliot's mastery of character and evocation of place allow us to sail along with Silas as he sheds the hard carapace of armour that he has placed around himself. He becomes, as we do, devoted to Eppie. She is a caricature, a purely good and ultimately pure girl who, through the tutelage of her father, understands the meaning of love even where Godfrey, her real father, does not.Eliot makes heavy use of dialect in Silas Marner. As a personal taste, I distinctly dislike dialect, because I find I spend more time translating what is being said than enjoying and understanding the character as they are presented. Yes, it can aid in characterisation and 'realism', but at what cost? Much like Wuthering Heights, several characters in Silas Marner were ruined for me, purely because I had to work so hard at what they were saying. And of course, upon figuring out their obscure words, I realised that they were saying nothing meaningful at all. A great disappointment, that.Throughout, various characters are introduced and then pushed to the background, as needed by the story. When Silas is in difficulties concerning the raising of a child, a goodwife is found, Dolly Winthrop, who provides him with advice and stresses that the child must be christened. Later, a love interest is given to Eppie, because what happy ending does not finish with a wedding?But these are minor quibbles. As a fairy tale, Silas Marner excels. There are good people done wrong, and bad people who come right in the end. There is a happy - or mostly happy - ending for everyone who deserves it, and a few that don't. But more than that, there is the construction of a wholly sympathetic man, and that is Silas Marner himself. Eliot does not stray down an easy route with him - when he becomes a miser, there is sadness, not avarice, in our minds as we sympathise.This novel is considered minor Eliot; it is not hard to fault that estimation. Middlemarch is a towering literary achievement, whereas Silas Marner is merely a single flower in a garden of like experiments with words. But what flower does not deserve to be smelled, at least once?"},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"While reading SILAS MARNER, I kept thinking of a scene from Season Five of BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER, in which Tara's father and other relatives come to take her back home with them, very much against her inclination. Once Buffy realizes that Tara wants to stay, she states that they can take Tara only by going through her first, which causes the father to ask, \\"We are Tara's blood-kin. Who are you to interfere in her affairs?\\" To which Buffy replies, \\"We're family.\\" The same emotions that I felt watching that episode of BUFFY came roaring back in the marvelous scene near the end of this novel when Mr. Cass decides to reveal after sixteen years of denial that Eppie is his daughter and will take her to live with him instead of Silas when he says, \\"Your coming now and saying 'I'm her father' doesn't alter the feeling inside us. It's me she's been calling her father ever since she could say the word.\\" And Eppie herself adds, \\"And he's took care of me and loved me from the first, and I'll cleave to him as long as he lives, and nobody shall ever come between him and me.\\" It is one of the lovelier climaxes of any 19th century English novel.SILAS MARNER is very much a novel about faith and the search for those values that make life worth living. Marner himself seeks early on to find hope in a superstitious religion that ultimately disappoints him, and later in the acquisition of gold through hard labor, gold that is stolen from him. The money is later returned to him, but during the long interval he discovers the power and greater importance of love and simple human relationships, as he inadvertently inherits a young toddler who miraculously appears inside his cottage whom he adopts as his own child. Despite his hurts and crusty personality, Marner in loving the child is brought into the larger community as well, and achieves a kind of happiness he scarcely imagined earlier in his life.These concerns were very real to Mary Anne Evans, better known by her penname of George Eliot. Though of humble intellectual origins, she was precociously intelligent, and no figure of the 19th century overcame such obstacles to become one of the leading intellectuals of her day. In the 20th or 21st century, Evans would have held a chair of religion or literature at Cambridge or Oxford. Instead, she wrote literary reviews on a host of books on a wide range of subjects, made some of the most important translations into English of crucial German theological texts ever made (Feuerbach's THE ESSENCE OF CHRISTIANITY and David Strauss's THE LIFE OF JESUS), and wrote some of the most intellectual novels of the century. Eliot's novels are remarkable for their intellectual diversity and depth. Her novels constitute a fascinating exploration for how to have faith in a post-Christian world, and in this way she is the most typical post-Darwinian novelist of the 19th century. Furthermore, during the first half of her career as a novelist, she brought the novel down to earth. If Dickens was unique in writing in his books about many lower and working class characters in an urban setting, George Eliot did much the same for the rural poor. In novels like ADAM BEDE and THE MILL ON THE FLOSS, the bulk of her characters, even the landed characters, are very much below virtually all of the characters in Jane Austen's novels, and set even more off the beaten path than hers. Although she would turn to more universal, less specifically rural characters in themes beginning in ROMOLA and her later novels, SILAS MARNER represents her last exploration of the rural poor. She manages to catch in her pages a rapidly changing world, setting SILAS MARNER in an area where the lone weavers such as Marner were disappearing in favor of industrialized cloth manufacture and the countryside was giving way to a rapidly expanding coal industry (Eliot's part of England is very near what would later be the setting for D. H. Lawrence's coal mining novels, with Lawrence also reflecting in his pages on the changes industrialization had wrought, although he writes from the end of the process while she writes at its beginning).We tend sometimes to think of those who reacted against the Christian faith following Darwin and David Strauss as having forsaken faith entirely, but that is very much not the case. Most Victorians who forsook Christianity looked instead for alternate forms of faith. Take the philosopher Henry Sidgwick, who ceased to believe in Christianity, but founded the Royal Society of Psychical Research. Like many of his age, Sidgwick believed that a supernatural realm was essential to provide the ultimate validity of morality, and no longer believing in Christianity, sought to investigate like a 19th century Fox Mulder a wide range of supernatural phenomena to validate some vague form of faith. Eliot in this novel is desperately trying to believe in something. Like Mulder with the poster on his wall reading \\"I Want to Believe,\\" Eliot wanted faith. Not merely that, but she was convinced that there had to be a viable form of faith to make life worth living. She was hardly the atheistic materialist that many wrongly believe that Darwin produced.Just as Sidgwick believed that there was a supernatural order that make sense of morality (in particular instances of self-sacrifice), so George Eliot clearly sees a divine order in the workings of the world. This is illustrated over and over in SILAS MARNER, where everything balances at the end. Although she no longer believed in the Christian teachings, she remained very much a person of faith and ultimately an optimist. By the end of the novel, no bad deed has gone unpunished and no scales are left unbalanced. In the old expression, \\"Bad deeds will out.\\" But it is also a novel of redemption, with Marner finding his anti-social sins being forgiven and through family and friends discovering, very much to his surprise, happiness.Though George Eliot always liked to write superficially simply stories that were in fact paragraph by paragraph commentaries on the intellectual debates of her age (she had, for instance, been reading widely in German and English theorists on the folktale when writing MARNER), her surface simplicity always feels real and unforced. And the story she created is a lovely one, with vivid characters, a marvelous plot, and a thoroughly satisfying conclusion. I will confess that I came to this novel much, much later than most others who read the book, and only after having read many of her other books. This is one unquestionably one of her most enjoyable and marvelous works."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"I was under the sexist opinion that George Eliot was a man. How pleasantly surprising that George was actually Mary Ann Evans, a woman gifted with powerful insight into human behaviour.The story of Silas Marner is that of a wronged man who finds solace in solitude and hoarding. The ritual and monotony of his loom keeps him captive, the reckoning and manifestation of his gold gives him companionship.One day his gold is stolen replaced by a far more precious gem, an orphan girl. An abandoned child offers Silas salvation, a withered miser offers the child a home. Together they change each other and those around them.The story is replete with penetrating behavioural analyses applicable to all of us but just beyond our reach."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"This is truly a wonderful book. It is timeless and ought to make one pause and think about the priorities in one's life. A must have for a classic collection."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"The book Silas Marner is an interesting book to read. The book starts off slow but gets more interesting as you get into it. It's a good book about how lies can ruin peoples' lives. I am giving a mixed review because it has both good and bad points to it. In the book Silas Marner, there is a man named Silas who lives in a small town. One day he is betrayed by his best friend and gets into a lot of trouble. After that he moves to another town were he is an outcast. He works as a weaver; he was the only one in the town so he made a lot of money. One day something happens that causes great pain to him, but one day someone comes to him and turns his life around. He is happier than he was before because he realizes that there is more to life than his money. The book has many good points to it. It has some good morals to it which are nice to know. One of the morals are that people shouldn't tell lies or keep secrets because they aren't good for the people involved. That is why this book is a good one to read. The book is bad because it was hard to understand what is going on all the time. It wouldn't be a good book for people younger than the ninth grade to read because it is hard to understand. It would be a hard book for younger people to read. It is also slow through the first part of the book because it just gives information and nothing happens. That is why it isn't a good book to read. Even with these problems, it would be a good book for older people to read."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"After Silas Marner's hoard of money was stolen, I was afraid this would be another dreary, Bronte-like novel, full of doom, gloom and cruelty. I almost decided not to finish it. However, I looked up a plot summary online and found that it was not so dark. I'm glad I went ahead and finished the book. The author paints for us all kinds of interesting scenes of life in a small English village in the 19th century. We read of virtue and vice, pompousness and humility, love and devotion, and even of good intentions backfiring.All in all, this is a pleasant read. The good are rewarded and the bad get their just deserts."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"I give the book Silas Marner a mixed review because although it is a good book with a lot of details, it is hard for younger people to understand. I am a freshman in high school and I found it difficult to read. Geoge Eliot has written a fable about Silas Marner. After his friend blackmails him, Silas moves to Raveloe after losing his faith in the Lord and starts a new life. He gets rich from weaving and becomes obsessed with his gold. His life starts to crumble after something happens and then it all comes back when a little girl with golden hair comes to his cottage.Silas Marner is not the best book because the narrator tried too pack to much information in to this book for how short it is. It is too hard for younger people to read because of the hard words like metamorphosis and the time period it is written in which was the Victorian age. Another bad thing about it is there are too many coincidences in it that makes it seem like a fairy tale; for example, like when Silas has his fits at the most convenient time in the plot. Some good things about the novel are that there are some good morals in it for people to learn. Eliot helps up realize the importance of love, trust and religion as Silas loses and gains these things back again. Some other morals that I learned from reading this book are not to keep lies from the people that you love and to always think about your decisions. All an all, Silas Marner is a good book. I think that George Eliot did a good job on this book."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"I don't know about anyone else, but when I read a plot synopsis on the back of a book, I like for that story to kick in at some point. However, that's not how this book is written. The basic plot doesn't get set into motion until about 120 pages in...and the book is 183 pages. To put it bluntly, the first 120 pages are spent aimlessly pondering life's many riddles and offering sometimes interesting, yet mostly tiring social commentary (I really don't care how the people at the Red House and the Rainbow act similarly despite class differences. I just want to finish this reading assignment so I can actually enjoy my summer). A plodding, slow book for the first two-thirds, it picks up somewhat before somehow managing to wrap things up in 10 pages...making me wonder why the book is even this long in the first place."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"This book is billed as a reproduction of a classic edition of Silas Marner. It appears as is someone just scanned the pages of a classic edition and bound them together. There is no warmth to this edition. The pages are overwhelimingly bright white with a reproduced page in the middle. Doesn't even have a book title on the edge binding. This is not the edition for anyone who loves the warmth and comfort of reading classic books."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"Silas Marner was a good book. I give it three stars because it is kind of hard to read and the beginning of the book was really weird, but the ending was pretty good.I give it a mixed review because the beginning of the book is very boring because all George Eliot writes about is Silas' life in Lantern Yard and the boring life he leads. The middle and the end are the best parts because they at least have some excitement with some people dying in the snow and the water. I think there should be some more action in the book like fights. I am a freshman in high school, and I thought that the book was kind of hard to read because of the long paragraphs and the hard vocabulary in the book. I do not recommend this book to high school freshman because it is hard to read and hard to follow.Silas Marner is a good book because it teaches you some lessons on life. It has some good morals like to think thoroughly before you marry or before you have kids. I think that George Eliot did a very good job of writing the story with the morals even with the hard vocabulary and the long chapters and paragraphs. I think George Eliot should have written about someone who actually lived around that time because it would have made it more interesting. She should have made the book she wrote more exciting than it was."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"Eliot is clearly a master - I've read \\"Mill on the Floss\\" and loved it, and I look forward to reading \\"Middlemarch.\\" However, \\"Silas Marner\\" was a bit of a disappointment. The supporting characters are well-drawn as is the town, which is really the star of this book. I found the character of Silas Marner to be vague and unbelievable. His growing isolation is described in a fair amount of detail, but his transformation is glossed over too quickly. It is simply not believable that someone who shuns others would be so willing to adopt a child and change so quickly. The message that love can transform even the most hardened person is beautiful, and the ending is wonderful, but I found it difficult to make it through most of this book."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"If compared to Eliot's best (Middlemarch, Mill on the Floss), Silas Marner is almost a disgrace. The brilliant literary style of Eliot seems all but gone, and the story could have easily been dispensed with in a form of a short story. The story, taken on its own, is heart-warming. But there is so much &quot;background noise&quot; to contend with. Overall this book should be a definite miss, even for Eliot fans (like me!).In addition I'm quite surprised this novel is used as part of the English literature curriculum in many schools (here in England at least). I feel sorry for those young minds having to wade through this. I hope schools will choose Mill on the Floss instead despite its length."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"George Eliot (Mary Anne Evans)wrote \\"Silas Marner\\" in 1861 and it is still being read to date. I read it first in junior high school, so long ago I had forgotten what it was about so I reread it. I had high expectations for it, lasting so long but I was disappointed. First, it is a hard read, her sentences are so long and so convoluted it is hard to maintain the connection from one sentence to the next. In addition many sentences are written phonetically, to create, I guess, the sense of the spoken word in the time period (early 1800's) as well as its sound and locale(Warwickshire, middle England). Add to that the coincidences involved to have the novel generate the correct happenstances of most of its characters and you have a novel incorporating most of the defects most stressed in English writing courses. How could this story have survived 150 years? If the reader is a juvenile he or she empathises with the characters and wants them to get their just desserts, and the reader has an opinion of who gets what. Eliot satisfies these desires and the young reader has read a story with characters who strike a responsive chord with the reader who then keeps the story in memory.Most accounts of the novel speak highly of the effect of Eppie, the supposed orphan, on the protagonist, Silas Marner. But she does not appear until about two thirds of the book has been read and I think this makes her a minor character. The book is primarily devoted to character changes in Silas Marner and Godfrey Cass, that is what the book is about. Yes, Eppie is the major factor in Silas's changed character but first his character must be developed. The same is true of Godfrey Cass, the biological father of the girl. His character is developed independently of her; Nancy Lammeter does her duty towards him but she does not get the attention Eppie does. The title of the book is Silas Marner but he only gets a slightly greater mention than Godfrey, the title must be the deciding factor. I think the book is highly overrated and is a book for juveniles except its construction is so difficult it is hard to praise for young readers. But I think I read it in juhior high, has reading changed for present day youth?"},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"I thought this book was fantastic. In the beginning, it was hard to read though. But the story itself was marvellous! It made me think of redemption (Godfrey Cass kept many secrets from people) and rebirth (Silas's new love in his life: Eppie). The story provides moral things and it made me think of the most precious things in my life (-&gt; not money)."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"The beginning of this book was slow and long. The writing style was somewhat difficult for a 9th grader, and the sentences tended to run on. Almost an entire chapter, in the beginning, was about a long, dull conversation almost irrelevant to the story itself. When Eppie enters Silas's life, however, the story becomes more interesting. She makes the characters more interesting, and the whole story more enjoyable. The large development of Silas in the beginning to the end is apparent and important. The few final twists at the end also make it a story worth reading. Therefore, this book was a good classic and should be read by those interested in historic England."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"Not too bad, not great, just an enjoyable book for some light reading. Yes, I'd recommend it if you would just like a nice story without any hidden meaning or deep thought necessary, but if you can only afford a little time to read in your hectic life, you'd probably be able to find something more worth your time."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"Silas Marner is a pretty good book. It has some pretty good points to it because it is pretty realistic, but it has its monotonous spots to it too, like the introduction. Toward the end, the book improved though the beginning was pretty dull because there is so much background information. I wouldn't suggest this book to readers below eighth grade since the way it's written makes it a little hard to follow for younger readers. The novel, Silas Marner, could have more action in it because there wasn't much to keep me on the edge of my seat. The book also could have used some more dialogue between the characters; some of the paragraphs got pretty long and hard to understand. Younger readers would probably lose interest in it because the paragraphs are so extensive. Although the book gets pretty good toward the end, the person reading it has to be patient to reach the exceptional parts. Although it is very challenging, Silas Marner is still a fascinating book because it teaches a lot about trust. The end of the book is pretty commendable because it's suspenseful. I like it more than a lot of other books endings. This book had things transpire that may happen in real life, like the mom dying from an opium overdose. This novel is a really good book to teach about the way one would want to deal with people and the way one may want to be treated. I like this text because it is one of those books that anybody could be able to sit down and appreciate as long as he or she is an efficient reader."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"I couldn't bear reading this book for long periods of time because I would fall asleep.

Silas, a young man, feels connected to his neighbors and his God. He works hard and looks forward to a normal life. But then he suffers an injustice at the hands of his Christian neighbors and blames his community and God. He suffers a self imposed alienation from both. He resorts to greediness. Suffers injustice again and hits bottom. Then the focus appears to turn to how does such a person redeem his faith in neighbors and God? How does a community redeem an outcast like Silas Marner? Also interesting was how the Church functions in the community to provide for the aged and and the disabled. Marner is told he would be taken care of despite the fact that he for years made no contributions to the Church to help it provide for his old age and disability. First rate author, this Mary Anne Evans, and a significant contribution to our great conversation about life, injustice, religion, and the redeeming power of love and loyalty.

It is one of my favorites from classic English literature."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"I failed miserably at reading The Mill on the Floss by George Eliot, but I loved Silas Marner. I think it was just that my edition of The Mill on the Floss has really off-putting font, and seems really long. At any rate, I sped through Silas Marner, which is a slim little volume, and is quite interesting. \\"Wrongly accused of theft and exiled from a religious community many years before, the embittered weaver Silas Marner lives alone in Raveloe, living only for work and his precious hoard of money. But when his money is stolen and an orphaned child finds her way into his house, Silas is given the chance to transform his life. His fate, and that of the little girl he adopts, is entwined with Godfrey Cass, son of the village Squire, who, like Silas, is trapped by his past. Silas Marner, George Eliot's favourite of her novels, combines humour, rich symbolism and pointed social criticism to create an unsentimental but affectionate portrait of rural life.\\" (from the Penguin Classics edition). Yes, \\"her.\\" George Eliot was a pen name. My question is, why do we still use the pen name in this case, but Charlotte Bronte's pen name (Currer Bell) isn't used anymore? I might research that...The actual edition that I read called it a moral fairy tale, and I would agree with that term. The book is fairy-tale-like, and highly entertaining, but also thought-provoking, as moralities (and fairy tales for that matter) are supposed to be. The sentences can be very long, but somehow, unlike Charles Dickens, they don't seem overwritten; they seem to fit the tone of the story just right.I loved how the little golden-haired orphan Eppie made her appearance; she is the child of Godfrey Cass, and when her mother keels over, Eppie toddles into the cottage of none other than Silas Marner, who now has a chance for redemption. She is the reappearance of his precious gold that he lost.A chance for redemption. I suppose that's not really the right phrase; Silas Marner isn't bad per se. He's complicated, and yes, he's miserly, but that's because he was wrongfully accused of a crime in his past life. He's just drawn into himself, and he no longer wishes to associate with the rest of the world or have anything to do with religion. But bright little Eppie gives him a chance to get past that and start again. Godfrey too isn't strictly good or evil. He's conflicted, and he's done some bad things which he wants to forget about, and he's done some good things. I won't tell how the book ends, but suffice to say that Silas Marner is an amazing classic novel, for its social commentary, and its humor, and its symbolism. I would highly recommend it, and am thinking of trying to tackle The Mill and the Floss once again. Or perhaps Middlemarch. I do think Silas Marner is a good book to start off with if you're going to read George Eliot; it's short and (it seems to me) less overwritten.My blog is at novareviews.blogspot.com."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"It has been several decades since I last read it.

It shows that what you see does not always tell the whole story."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"what a wonderful story. But it took a while before you got to the good parts and all the background information starts to make sense. But if you hang in there it is a great story. I found the ending to be abrupt after reading all her flowing descriptions of everything else. LOL>"},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"This is a classic and should be read as such. Going in, you have to know that Eliot is a master at words and dialects and that this will not be easy reading. I did find that reading it was tedious at times. It wasn't the kind of book that I couldn't put down or that I'd look forward with eagerness to picking up again.That said, there is much to recommend this book. The morals and the values are excellent. From the first few chapters, you might be afraid that the book is going to be filled with rather amoral, money-grubbing characters, but you will soon find that the good, decent people here are head and shoulders above many people. There is one thing about certain writers of classics--when people are good or evolve from good to better they are superior people. You'd be hard put to find such perfect people. The father-daughter relationship in this book is incredible. I'm always amazed at the classics that have extended families living together and it's all so beautiful. The in-laws become beloved family members and look after the old folks as though they were blood relations. It's a fairy-tale experience, but if you can suspend judgment and believe that people can live together in harmony, not to mention choosing the spiritual over the material, your heart and soul will be warmed by this story.But be warned that although it's a short book there is a multitude of wordiness to get through. You may have trouble with unfamiliar dialects and long sentences that never seem to end, but your patience will be rewarded. There is nothing stereotypical about this story. It's quite unusual, has some twists and turns, and ultimately a very satisfying finish.Just a postscript: I decided to read this book because I remembered a nun who recommended it. She had just had our junior class in high school plow through Eliot's Adam Bede which is considerably longer, but we all enjoyed it. So she said that Silas Marner was good also and several girls groaned audibly. This was all I needed to hear--those groans convinced me that this wouldn't be easy reading for a 17-year-old young woman. But the nun said, \\"Oh, girls...\\" in the most wistful manner. I always wondered what there was about Silas Marner to make Sister look so moony-eyed. Now I know. I had to groan a little through all the verbiage, but I did find the warmth that Sister had evidently discovered."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"Silas Marner is something of a rustic parable, in which the concept of wealth is held under a critical, moral light. It concerns a miserly hermit-weaver, who, after years and years of hoarding his earnings--reveling in the shimmer and chime of his beloved coins--is robbed of all his money. Yes--the thieving Dunstan Cass is punished for his wickedness, drowned in a nearby pond. But most intriguing is the way Silas's monetary misfortune marks the beginning of his passage to spiritual wealth. From the moment he is robbed, he is compelled to go out among the townsfolk, and establish relationships with his neighbors. Eliot's description of Silas's coins as \\"children waiting to be born\\" will remind some readers of one of Marx's descriptions of money as \\"monetary larva.\\" But the central transformation in Silas Marner does not occur in the market realm of commodity exchange, but in realm of symbolism and spiritual reformation, when Silas discovers the little \\"orphaned\\" Eppie in the ruddy glow of his hearth. It is, of course, a new, human treasure that Silas discovers in Eppie--one of rejuvenating import. And one of the most poignant scenes in the novel is when Silas confuses Eppie's golden locks of hair with his stolen gold coins, for it offers him a startling, new vision of human wealth. It's rather a queer novel, but not without its charm."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"A simple but beautifully written morality tale. Established religion, through church and chapel, is shown to be wanting, the petty aristocracy eats its own and Silas, the sad downtrodden misfit, wins the day and the girl.

The meek do inherit the earth, or at least find contentment, and live on in happiness.The best 89c I ever spent - thank you Amazon."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"Read this as a Sophomore in high school.

I must have been nearly illiterate when Silas Marner turned up as part of my 9th grade English class. By all recollection, the text was reprinted into our English text book for that year; and it was a class-wide assignment during that year.My best memory is that I couldn't read it; I couldn't understand a thing about it; it was daunting. Somehow, I got a good grade in the class: it was either that the standards had already fallen or maybe that it was just the Cliff's Notes allowing me to escape the experience with pretense that I may have actually read it at the time.So, it happened to come across my desk four decades later (February 2013); actually it showed up on my Kindle app when we purchased the complete works of George Eliot, when my wife wanted to read Middlemarch --- who knew that George Eliot was a pen name for a female author of the early 1800s, at a time when only male authors could garner a readership.I suppose a theme of man's moral certitude and the perseverance of man's spirit could be a central message here. But I wasn't struck with a particularly artistic nor elegant narrative. It all seemed a bit on the stilted side, although with some flowery language sprinkled in. The unfolding of events is more or less just told straight out, and not revealed using a colorfully narrated unfolding of events.I ploughed through it with a sense of duty to complete something that I only pretended to complete in high school. And I was immensely relieved to discover that it wasn't unreadable, as I had thought all these years. Tony Morrison and Immanuel Kant, however, do remain unreadable."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"XXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXX xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxI do not want to rate this at this time.

I was not disappointed. I really enjoyed the book."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"This is George Eliot's most compact novel, but it is a stunner.It is basically the story of loss of faith, and its replacement--first, by money, then (when the money is stolen) by love. It is also a secular resurrection story: Silas, after losing his friends, his faith, and his fiance, becomes a reclusive, obsessive weaver, who is essentially dead to society and himself. He hoards his money, but when it is lost, he finds the baby, Eppie, who is a greater treasure, and who essentially restores his life.It is also a terrific study in Class Conflict--a favorite of Eliot's. Silas, of the lowest (almost serf) class, is hardworking, honest, helpful, whereas the Casses, Dunstan and Godfrey, are both aristocratic scoundrels. Dunstan steals Marner's money; Godfrey attempts to steal his child.The language may be daunting to modern readers, but it was standard prose for Victorian novels. Oddly, the most difficult chapter for readers today, Chapter 6, was the one most loved in Eliot's day: it is a tour de force of local dialect of the Midlands.Eliot, as usual, sees clearly, almost like God: she knows everyone's flaws and strengths, and is harsh on what causes harm to others; but she is always generous-hearted and understanding."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"Silas Marner is a classic.

My parents adopted 3 children, so I love this story's look at adoption and how it's the love and time put into raising a child that are important; being related by blood doesn't matter. This book shows that our mistakes can't truly be hidden; they will always be there in the back of our minds bugging us until they are exposed in the end. So it's best to take responsibility for our mistakes and go through the repentance process, instead of hiding mistakes for \\"convenience.\\" I love how Silas is healed from his suffering and gloom through the love of a child. George Eliot is a masterful author."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"As usual, Focus on the Family does a wonderful job at dramatizing this classic story. They use first-class voice actors and sound effects. However, this version does not quite reach the level of the original book. It is not that there is any lack of quality, but just that something is lost in translation when a book is dramatized. No matter how good a dramatization is, it loses some of the depth of the book.However, this dramatization is high-quality entertainment and I highly recommend it. But if you like this dramatized version of Silas Marner, then you will like the original novel even more."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"Early in the story Silas Marner has a great life - he's happily engaged, living among good friends, and doing work he enjoys.

And as the book went on, I almost felt myself getting dimmer,more cut off from society. It was rather sad.The book isn't the best representative of what life in 19th century England would have been like, but it is a very good picture of how uncultured people treat other people from other lands. It's only when misfortune falls upon that person, do they accept them.I absolutely loved the fact that Silas found a \\"golden-haired replacement\\". That was the sweetest thing I've read in my life, how he instantly wanted to protect her and give her the best things in life. Godfrey seemed nice at first, but as the book uncovered his past, I started to like him less and less. He needed to act like a man, buck up and take control of his life, and not be constantly cowed by his father. I can understand due to the time period why he thought Eppie would come with him and Nancy, but still, the way he kept asking even after she said no the first time was rude.The book was very uninteresting in the beginning. I had to force myself to read it. It was only after Dunsey stole Silas's money that it began to be interesting. Still, it was a sweet book and I liked it a lot."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"George Eliot is the best woman author I've ever read. She had God-given talent that you or I, no matter how much we read, no matter how much we write, could not consciously replicate. She had something which can't be taught, a kernel of genius hidden somewhere in the brain, which was allowed to express itself...to our collective benefit.Silas Marner, while not perfect, is something recognizably special--a book with lingering phrases, a book with extraordinary insight, a book that instates the reader with the feeling that the author knows what the hell she is doing. It's a book that matters.I know what you are afraid of: you are afraid this book will be a bloated succession of tea parties and persiflage with mutton-chopped vicars. No fear: the plot is credibly organic, and moves along briskly, wrapping itself up in just over two-hundred pages. It should hold your interest so that you can discover the ten or so gem-sentences dispersed throughout. Sentences that are not just airtight, but that meld with your mind, and cause an \\"Aha!\\" reaction. You know what I'm talking about.Perhaps the most convincing signal I can offer of my sincere regard for her abilities is the fact that I'll now seek out her other works...something I can't say about Virginia Woolf, for instance, whose literary inferiority to Eliot I would take as axiomatic. (Ironic, isn't it--or maybe not--that feminists seem to esteem Woolf more highly than Eliot?)"},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"Silas Marner by George Eliot, the pen name of Mary Evans, is a well-written story, made more so by the fact it was written by a woman in the Victorian Age. The novel is set in the early nineteenth century England, during a time that society had three distinct classes: the rich and powerful, the working people, and the tradesmen.While the characters personalities in the book seem exaggerated to make there qualities or faults more obvious, Eliot's detailed descriptions of the people made it easy to create a mental picture of them. Though the book is well written, the style of language makes it hard to read and even harder to understand. I found I had to read it more then once and spend time thinking it through to get to the point of enjoying it. Silas Marner has many valuable moral and lessons in it, the most important one being that people are worth more than gold."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"The fact that Amazon has so many editions of Silas Marner available indicates that it is truly a classic if it is still being read more than 150 years after it was written.It is unfortunate that some high school reviewers (or former high school readers) feel that they had this book \\"forced\\" on them. Yes, the English language has changed since the early 19th century, especially for American readers of this British author.My suggestion would be to listen to \\"Silas Marner\\" as an audiobook, perhaps while reading along. I recently finished listening to this fine book narrated by Margaret Hilton, but I couldn't find her rendition among the titles available here. I'm sure there are many fine versions available.So, give this tale a listen, and let the language flow into your ears. Then you will discover why this tale about a miserly old weaver, who has been wronged by his neighbors more than once, finds redemption and a new life when he adopts the little girl left on his doorstep is truly a classic."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"I don't really care a whole lot for this book...mostly because in 9th grade advanced english at school, my first high school experience, I was forced to read Silas Marner. The language and literary context is very deep and very advanced...it's a struggle at first to read until you get used to the flow of the book. This is definitely a book that you cannot read/skim like you can in most others. You have to carefully read and think about every sentence in order to comprehend the plot. The book gets better about half-way through, where more conversation takes place and is easier to follow. The worst aspect of the book, in my opinion, is the sentences that run on and on and take up entire paragraphs and in turn, the paragraphs that run for pages.

The first quarter of the book goes at the pace of a moderately entertaining tale, but then grinds to a halt as soon as Silas is leashed with the orphan girl.

I read the book of &quot;Silas Marner&quot; and personally to me the book was not that great. It is supposed to be a classic, but I don't have a taste for this type of book. The story didn't seem to have much adventure or anything in it. When I think of a good book I should like the plot. I feel that the author in places went off describing the details and the scene to much that it made the book frankly boring and it didn't need to be told.

Eliot was a very fine writer in the Victorian style, with an assured, elegant vocabulary and lofty moral sensibility. Like other authors of the period, she occasionally gets carried away with grandiose elliptical constructions yielding minor observations of human nature that could be conveyed much more simply. Here's one that occurs early on: &quot;For the rude mind with difficulty associates the ideas of power and benignity. A shadowy conception of power that by much persuasion can be induced to refrain from inflicting harm is the shape most easily taken by the sense of the invisible in the minds of men who have always been pressed close by primitive wants.&quot; Translation: powerless people distrust powerful people. Or this gem: &quot;a dull mind, once arriving at an inference that flatters a desire, is rarely able to retain the impression that the notion from which the inference started was purely problematic.&quot; Whew. Translation: people believe what they want to believe.OK, so sentences like these fall a bit humorously on modern ears, but that's half the fun of reading this stuff, and Shakespeare did it too. Anyway, these characters are very likeable and the story is engaging. You'll sympathize with poor Silas and fall in love with adorable Eppie, and everything turns out well in the end.

I know I was! And I also know that, because of my age at the time of the assignment, I got little, if anything, from the reading of it. What a dire shame! This beautiful tale is literally filled with credos on how to live a quality and meaningful life! But we, being mere immature elementary students at the time, had most of these teachings allude us completely.'Silas Marner' truly is a literary classic. The author brings to light the life areas of deceit, mistrust, bribery, greed, and eventual unrepentant love through a set of intermingled and memorable characters. Her style is very similar to that of Dickens insomuch that there is not only a riveting plotline that weaves its way throughout the book but a series of side adjuncts which not only give us a firmer grasp of the life and times of a small town but the inequalities that are caused through its income and social disparities.Take the time, as I did, now that you are an adult to grasp the life-teaching tale that our 8th grade teacher so desperately wanted us to glean from this classic novel. It is worth the journey back to a long forgotten academic assignments......"},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"It's been so long since I first read this book, so when I recently reread it, it was all new to me. I absolutely love Eliot's writing style, and the story unfolds beautifully. It's a sweet and believable story that reminds us to consider the consequences of our actions. It's not easy to read out loud, because some of the words are spelled as the speakers would pronounce them in their heavy accents...unless you plan to read the entire thing in the character's accents. ;)"},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"Strange that so many people complained about this book after having been forced to read it in High School. I had never heard of this particular Elliot book until I acquired the list of \\"1001 books to read before you die.\\" I can see where the language in this book would be troublesome to many young students, particularly if they have little to no experience reading anything from the time, much less anything written in phonetic slang. But the theme should be universal.Short Synopsis - we follow to individuals through the tale, the title character - Silas Marner, a weaver who has had a long run of bad luck in dealing with people who has then holed himself away from society and fills his days with weaving and counting his slowly growing stack of gold. The other is Godfry Cass, a wealthy son of a land owner who's poor in morals and scruples. Through a series of events triggered by Godfry and his brother, Silas is thrust into various situations of both grief and joy. Always Silas maintains his high moral standard and simple way of life and is thusly rewarded for it.As is standard in the literature of the time - the good get what they deserve and the morally lacking get their just ends. The interesting part that Elliot weaves in to the tale is that the unfortunate events that happen to Silas, all end up leading him to true happiness. Now I don't want to give the story away as many others have, but I will say that once you get past the first third or so (where the reader will find themselves wondering if ANYTHING is ever going to happen) the book picks up and becomes very enjoyable.The language may be tough for some, but once you get about 20-30 pages in, you shouldn't have much trouble reading it. If all else fails, read it out loud. On the whole this is a very enjoyable book, though not my favorite - the story is fun and happy and leaves the reader feeling rather warm and fuzzy."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"Unlike the tragical nature of Eliot's \\"Mill on the Floss,\\" for example, \\"Silas Marner,\\" is an inspiring, thought-provoking story of a lonely old man who is given a gift that illuminates his life. The story is written in Eliot's astute and intelligent way with words, and also sparks discussion of some underlying themes (such as religious faith issues). It would be wonderful if A&E or the BBC would give it a faithful movie adaptation. We only have Steve Martin's movie, \\"A Simple Twist of Fate,\\" that is loosely based on the text of this timeless story. If you are a fan of Victorian fiction, don't miss Eliot, as her writing differs in style and tone from other works of the era, and offers the reader a lot to sink their thoughts into."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"Silas Marner is a wonderful story about life and love. It begins with our hero, Silas Marner, a lonely, luckless old man, being robbed of his life savings. But then a mysterious appearance of a homeless, golden-haired little girl opens up an unexpected new chapter in his life. Silas Marner was a weaver who through loneliness and through life's occurrences becomes bitter and miserly. The theft of his life savings causes him to rethink everything about his life. Ms. Eliot also introduces Godfrey Cass to her cast of characters. Godfrey is a foil to Silas. He is the real father of Eppie, the young girl that Silas adopts. We watch as Silas' lot and outlook on life improve, Godfrey's life dissolves into disappointment, fear and guilt.

This book changed my life."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"This 19th century classic by George Eliot/Maryann Evans retains its timeless appeal; it charms and touches us no matter how jaded or sophisticated we consider ourselves. Perhaps the characters are something out of Dickens (in their extreem personality types and the idealized heroine). Yet this novel reaches our inner selves, where it is safe to applaud the unselfish and the compassionate, to appreciate social redemption and sincere devotion.Silas, a disillusioned weaver who lives the life of a recluse, has never been accepted by the villagers of Raveloe. Paid in gold for his fine cloth, Marner hoards most of it in an iron pot buried in the sand under his loom. Having lost faith in God, church and his fellow men because of a tragic injustice in his former town, he lavishes his lamentable affection on indifferent gold. Until it is stolen.The theft of this gold--his only friend as it were--leaves him desvastated. Yet fate seems to compensate him by the sudden apperance of a golden-curled baby, who toddles over his doorway one night when he is in a mild catatonic state.How Eppie pulls at his heart and transforms his miserable, miserly life is the soul of this novelette. Evans' weaves a tapestry of tenderness and redemption through juvenile affection. SILAS MARNER remains a contemplative read for students 14 and up, and for all who enjoy British classical literature. The action is in the Heart."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"George Eliot's SILAS MARNER is a literary classic. What does that mean? A classic is a book that has passed the test of time. A book taken out of its historical milieu and placed in a contemporary one, e.g. our 2008 society, and still reads fresh is a classic.SILAS MARNER still reads fresh, if you are a sophisticated reader or have a teacher to guide you through the ground mines of vocabulary and complex writing. However, wrapped inside those is a great story, even a soap opera that students recognize as soon as the Cass brothers are introduced.Two story lines run parallel until they intersect with the theft of Silas's gold. Silas Marner has been in this village for seventeen years, living a life of isolation, while he makes a living as a weaver. Even if he had chosen to live amongst people, he possesses two things that would always hinder acceptance: he is a herbalist and a victim of catatonic seizures. He discontinues his use of herbs early on, but he cannot stop catatonia, which of course becomes a metaphor for his life with others before Eppy appears.It is these quiet seizures that result in blackouts that--bottom line--cause his banishment from a religious community where he was highly respected. In the seventeen years near Raveloe, nothing has happened to change his life with a dead heart. His great love in this time is his growing stacks of gold. He loves it! He idolizes it!Enter Godfrey and Dunstan Cass, two landed gentry, both dissolute in differing ways, both catalysts in the change in Silas Marner's dull life. The younger brother, Dunstan, is a n'er-do-well, a gambler in debt and subject to embarrassment by a man to whom Dunstan owes a great deal of money. He finds gold in Silas's house. On the other hand, Godfrey leads a superficial respectable life, because he too has indulged himself and has a child born out of wedlock.One cold, dark, stormy night two stories intersect: Dunstan steals Silas's gold, then disappears forever, and Silas is devastated by the loss of his gold. However, this loss brings Silas into community. The night the golden-haired child appears magically on Silas's hearth clinches Silas's total acceptance into village life. Silas adopts this child and Dolly Winthrop becomes his guiding angel in helping to raise the child.When the two secrets are revealed concerning Dunstan and Godfrey, the reader cheers Silas on, directs hisses at Godfrey, and stands amazed at Dunstan's revelation.Inside this \\"soap opera\\" is a fabulous story of love and redemption. Without love one man lives a life of solace in gold with a heart dried and shriveled. With love his heart beats passionately and lovingly and makes him live fully with family and friends. No greater lesson can come from a story as one of redemption. From the still-point of one golden-haired girl radiates a life that redeems a man.George Eliot, or Mary Ann Evans, is a genius in depicting the lives of men and women and their influence on others for good or evil. Eppy is the source of good out of sinful circumstances and selfishness on Godfrey's part. Godfrey continues his static life force by not claiming his child at one point and trying to claim her when it is too late. The contrast between one man who has little and the other who has everything is instructive in explaining the ways of the heart.If I were marooned on a deserted island and could take ten books with me, SILAS MARNER would definitely be on the list. It is a great book to teach and listen to students respond to it (and NO, I won't be stranded with students). Watching their faces in class discussion concerning Dunstan's re-appearance in Raveloe is absolutely priceless. Even though the foreshadowing is huge, students never figure out what happens.Just think of all the choices we make in our lives, some irrevocable as to cause and effect. SILAS MARNER is a caution and a beacon to making the right choices. Making wrong choices to hide one's actions, more often than not, results in dire consequences. Silas shows us that right actions produce right results. I love this book!"},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"Silas Marner is quite an unusual piece of work.

But in my opinion Nancy and Godfrey deserve each other in their stupid piety, Eppie is contrived and spouting with saccharine, the villagers are patronised, Molly is treated dreadfully, Dolly is held up as some kind of saint, Silas is treated like a freaky experiment subject to a string of highly unbelievable coincidences despite all Eliot's psycological reasoning. And all the time Eliot sits on her high horse above them. A large part seems to our ears to be sentimental tripe, for example Aaron's charming little carol..I'd love to hear what Goldsmith had to say about this purile pampering of the reader. I'll leave off what I think about portrayal of women in the novel before my blood boils...."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"Very chilling tale.

I found that seeing the movie version before or after reading segements of the novel helped me visualize and comprehend the action more.I particularly enjoyed seeing a book showing how greed and denouncing religion and charity only backfire. I also wish people who are about to give up their children for adoption would read it, to make them think about the precious gift they are surrendering. It also illustrates how unfair it is to try to reclaim a child you give up. On both the surface and deeper meanings, it is a good novel."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"It is interesting to note briefly George Eliot's background when setting out to examine the novel from the standpoint of a moral or religious philosopher. Brought up in a strict evangelical home, and sent to a school institution run along similar lines, she rejected this evangelicalism, forging a sort of broadly &quot;Christian&quot; humanism, which undeniably belonged strongly to Eliot. This is powerfully evident in 'Silas Marner'. Marner's rejection by the Leeds brethren on the grounds that he had stolen the church revenue, (when in fact he had be 'framed' all along,) led to his rejection of evangelical beliefs. As he moves away to ply his trade as a weaver, &quot;his God&quot; remains in the congregation in the city. Faith belonged not to him, but to a particular place. He replaces his religion, with the worship of Mammon - drawing comfort from his gold pieces. When these are stolen, his world falls apart once again. It is then that the child Eppie comes into his life, and becomes his ambition. Thus, she is seen by some as a &quot;Christ-child&quot;, in turning him from is love of the material, but importantly she is seen as the fulfilment of NATURAL JUSTICE - a concept which Eliot clearly espouses. The other predominant theme in the book, is the conflict between Nature and Nurture. As Eppie's natural father - the wealthy Godfrey Cass, a victim of circumstance who disclaimed the child - tries to claim her back at the age of eighteen she refuses. Thus, against the recieved morality of the time, nurture wins over nature, and a poor but contented way of life is chosen over one of status. The other notable feature of the book is its fairy tale quality. The first two chapters serve as an introdution to the scenario, but the third chapter, introducing village life in Raveloe, has a definate fairy tale quality about it, as does the sickly-sweet end. A radical and deeply profound, thought provoking work, it is a must for any student or lover of Victorian Literature, and should not be overlooked as it ha! s been in the past."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"Love all Focus on the family....I bring these audio books to work...everybody loves to listen as a group.

She taught school turn of the century and left part of this book for us, so now I can read it myself, pleased."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"The novel Silas Mariner is 182 pages in length, and this is one of the shorter novels by George Eliot. This is an interesting story and a recommended read. Is it pure gold? No. That is an over-statement. It is not another \\"Notes From the Underground\\" or \\"Death of Ivan Ilych.\\" It is a bit of a romance smaltz novel, and it is short. It is a long short story. But it is different from what one might think. After all, consider the author and the times in which it was written.The novel does have a measure of charm. The title is taken from the name of the lead character. He is a weaver in a small English town. One might say that he is a very dull character. But he has a few interesting events in his life - which I will not reveal here. There are only four interesting characters that run the complete length of the novel. They all live in the same small village. Also, there is a secondary set 3 or 4 characters. These are interesting and almost Dickens-like characters who drift in and out of the action.Coincidences give away the plot. That is a weakness. After 100 pages or so, or about 60% through the read, it starts to become clear what will happen. And, from that moment going forward it follows a most predictable script. Still, it is well written and colourful, and the novel does hold some delightful surprises.The novel is a quick read.Recommend. It ranks 4 stars."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"I expected a masterpiece, instead I suffered through a predictable plot with religious overtones that were a little too heavy-handed & unsubtle."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"Silas Marner is an excellently written book with many applicable themes. Although written in the 1800s its central theme and life lessons are still relevant today, truly making Silas Marner a classic. Because the book was written in the 1800s many words and the style of writing are hard to follow. This makes for a slow read, and although very descriptive, beats around the bush at getting to the point. For that reason alone i give it4 stars.The central theme here is the reedeming power of love. We see this in the evolution of the protagonist Silas marner. Silas is an old miser living in the English town of Raveloe. Silas was not always a miser. In his previous life in Lantern Yard he was falsely accused of a crime, and had his fianc&egrave; stolen by his best friend. As a result of these events, Silas became hardened, denounced God and moved away. For years he spent his time weaving cloth. He grew attached to his money, particularly the gold guineas. On the other side of the story we meet the antagonist Godfriey Cass. Godfriey is the selfish spoiled grown son of Squire Cass, the richest man in Raveloe. As the plot unfurls we see how these two very different peoples problems and lives intertwine, and through the power of love a life is restored, consequences are dealt, and the realization that nothing ever stays hidden.In sum the book is powerful for the reader who chooses to pay attention. When it gets bogged down with details, just keep reading knowing something great is around the corner."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"A rather sentimental tale of the recluse who regained faith and the ability to love his fellow man. If this didn't have the name George Eliot on it, I doubt this would still be in print, cause honestly, there isn't much to see here (move along.) Middlemarch is fan-freakin-tastic, don't get me wrong, but this one is nowhere near to that status. The story itself is rather unexciting, and there isn't (to my eyes) a depth of examination by a probing mind to merit serious study. Poor kids, having to read this in school! There's so much better, so much more worthwhile...."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"This book is as sentimental as &quot;Middlemarch&quot; is complex. I found that the long introductory sections made for a difficult set up to the primary situation. The narrative involving the actual bond between Marner and the child were condensed and telegraphed so quickly that the reader is forced to take the author's word that there was an attachment. As a result, the emotional climax feels like a tear-jerker rather than an honest resolution of the characters' lives. It gives the impression of a 19th century &quot;Afterschool Special.&quot;"},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"I tried to download Audible.com 's download manager -- but it kept stalling on the manager.exe and download.exe for some unknown reason.

I'm a particular fan of writers from the late 1800s, but this story's plot line, set in an earlier period, snagged my attention. I fully anticipated enjoying \\"Silas Marner,\\" even though it falls in a period a bit more obscure to a modern reader.Alas, I am that modern reader. When Silas Marner was center-stage, the story moved along, and it was hard not to empathize with the false accusations he endures and the self-exile he chooses. I enjoyed the plots twists from darkness and isolation to deeper darkness, and finally to unexpected redemption. The appearance of the little girl, though less enigmatic than the synopsis implied, was a nice touch. Despite these highlights, I found myself plodding through numerous pages and scenes. The writing has some high moments, but it violates so many of the modern rules of fiction-telling, telling us instead of showing us, pounding home its points instead of letting them simmer just below the service. I truly wish English teachers would use creative minds of their own, instead of succumbing to intellectual pressures and pushing books with little accessibility or interest to a new generation of readers.I can fully understand this book's appeal to readers of its day. It wrestles with certain issues of class and status, with the hypocrisy of the rich and the religious, and the superstitious but honest efforts of the working class. I'm glad to have entered the world of \\"Silas Marner,\\" but, sad to say, I was also glad to leave it behind."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"This book IS slow...it's a Victorian novel, and full of descriptions of the people and the countryside, which makes it seem to drag in places. You have to have patience to read Victorian novels, and remember that at the time they were written, most people did not travel much, a journey of 5 miles in a carriage took an hour in good weather and on good roads, riding a horse that distance would take half an hour to 45 min, depending on the ablility of the horse and skill of the rider. Without TV and movies, people had limited opportunities to see scenes of other places than where they lived, so writers needed to describe scenes in detail. It is this richness in detail that attracts me to Victorian novels. I was not bored at all by this book.Silas Marner is a complex character, a nearsighted weaver, given to \\"fits\\" (possibly petit mal seizures), not handsome, and not wealthy enough to overcome his ugliness. He is betrayed by a friend, which puzzles him, rather than angers or embitters him. His neighbors distrust him, though they bear him no ill-will, for he comes from \\"outside\\" the village, and lives a short distance outside the village. The rift--such as it is--is partly due to Marner's nature, partly due to the villagers' natures. He becomes a miser, partly because he needs something to love, and gold is what he has....this becomes the object of his affections. Not because he cares to be rich, but simply because he loves the gold.He is robbed one evening. The thief is Dunstan Cass, a younger son of Squire Cass. Dunstan is a drunkard, a wastrel, a thug, and a blackmailer....he is blackmailing his older brother Godfrey (weak willed and spineless, easily led by the stronger-willed and cunning Dunstan), who has married an opium addict and kept the marriage a secret from his family, for fear his father would disinherit him. He pays Dunstan to keep silent. At one point, Godfrey collects rent from a tenent farmer, gives the money to Dunstan to buy his silence, and hopes not to be found out. However, he is unable to raise the money to repay his father for the rent he stole. He gives his prized horse to Dunstan to sell, but Dunstan kills the horse in a hunting accident. Dunstan walks home, past Marner's cottage, sees no one home, remembers the stories of Marner's hoarding of gold, finds the money and makes off with it. Marner comes home from his short errand, finds the money gone, and is devasted. He seeks help in the village to find the theif. But by this time, Danstan is gone, and the help the villagers can give is both confused and useless. The money is never recovered, and Marner almost loses his mind.During the New Year's party at the Manor, Squire Cass, his family (minus Dunstan) and his guests are enjoying themselves, not knowing that Godfrey's secret wife is coming with their child to force Godfrey to acknowlege her and pay child support. However, she drinks opium, loses her way in the snow, and heedlessly falls asleep under a furze bush. The child, about 2 years old, toddles aawy, a short distance to Marner's cottage, and enters while Marner is at the open door, in one of his \\"fits\\". He comes to, and sees the little girl asleep at the hearth. He traces the child's footsteps back to where the mother lies, frozen to death, under the furze. He runs to the manor to summon help, for he knows the village doctor will be at the party. Godfrey goes out with the doctor, for he has a suspicion who the woman is. He is relieved to find her dead, for this frees him to marry the girl he really loves.Marner insists on raising the little girl as his own child. Godfrey occasionally gives money or goods to Marner to \\"help\\" with the raising of of the little girl (called \\"Eppie\\" after Marner's sister, who died in infancy) but the bulk of the assistance comes from the villagers. Impoverieshed themselves, they nevertheless share what they have with the weaver and his child, and gradually their suspicions of Marner ease, and they become friendly with him.Fast Forward, to 16 years later: Eppie has become a beautiful young lady, loved and courted by one of the village boys. Godfrey and his wife, Nancy (whom he married shortly after discovering his first wife dead) are childless. Godfrey finally confesses his early marriage to Nancy, and tells her that Eppie is really his own child. Meanwhile, Dunstan's body is found, in the bottom the the stone pit, long filled with water, now drained. The bags of gold Stolen from Marner are with him. Godfrey is horrified by Dunstan's crime, and wants to make right all the wrongs done to Marner by the Cass family. He and Nancy decide to adopt Eppie, Nancy with the desire of righting a wrong, Godfrey with the desire to salve his conciense (he has a conciense, it's just a weak-willed one). They approach Marner and Eppie in Marner's cottage, and tell them the story, and that they would like to adopt Eppie, and give her all the privileges, comforts, and advantages that wealth can provide. Maner, thinking of Eppie's future, agrees, though it breaks his heart. Eppie, however, thanks Godfrey and Nancy kindly, but turns them down flat. She has no desire to leave the only father she knew, the villagers she's known all her life, and the young man whom she loves. Godfrey and Nancy leave, saddened and chastened.This is a story of redemptive love. Godfrey is redeemed by Nancy's devoted love of him; rather than berating him or leaving him for his early indiscretions and marriage, she continues to love him unconditionally. Silas Marner is redeemed through his love for Eppie; she literally changes his life, and he is a new man after she comes to him. The gold that Dunstan stole is returned to him, and he no longer cares about it. The desire to hoard is gone. The villagers are also redeemed; the man they formally shunned as an odditity and outsider is accepted into their homes as one of their own, and even the most belligerant village man (the farrier) is softened when Eppie comes to visit. Eppie, had she not been saved by Silas Marner, would have been an orphan and sent to a workhouse as soon as she could walk and feed herself.This is also a story about choices, and how making a decision can affect your life. Godfrey choses to marry in secret, and that choice leads to a life of fear, even after his wife's death, fear of people learning his secret, fear of his new wife learning his secret....he is never free of fear, until he chooses to confess his transgression. Marner chooses to keep the child, though he knows doing so will change his life, not necessarily for the better. A good-hearted village woman chooses to help him in this endeavor, rather than continue to shun him, and her life is enriched as a result.The differences in the lives of the rich and the poor is well definied. The rich, dispite all their wealth and privilage are the poorest in spirit. They are the useless idlers, the parasites, the criminals. The villagers, despite being impoverished, owning little or nothing, uneducated, are the richest, in terms of happiness and love.This is a powerful book."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"I may only pity the plight of American society, for time and time again I hear complaints lodged against the British literary canon (indeed, even the American canon) that the books written long ago simply hold no relevance and plod along with no point. There is no relevance to an outcast being condemned in Victorian society for being an outsider and different? But certainly this country has no racial problems, particularly as we are so incredibly lucid and politically correct. Look at how openly we welcome outsiders into our society. We are nothing like the people of Raveloe.Is this George Eliot's masterpiece? No.Yet what parent hasn't felt the dilemma Siras faces with his future with Eppie? Who hasn't had their faith deeply questioned by a deeply-felt wrong in the world? Who hasn't felt the guilt of being unable to speak the full truth to those loved the most?Oh, the plot isn't there.

In his home-town, Silas Marner is wrongly accused of a heinous murder, forcing the poor weaver to move to Raveloe; there, his life-savings are stolen by a greedy aristocrat. Through this fictional character and his grievances, George Eliot brings tremendous support to the idea that Providence will mend things and make them whole, and that we can survive our trials by trusting in this goodly power. Although the plot develops slowly, it is engaging. You cannot help but sympathize with Silas when his reason for living- his money- is taken from him. He is devastated, and when neighbors come to offer support, he remains speechless. Life seems to have crushed him with its unfairness. It is at this point of despair that Providence intervenes, bringing an orphan girl to Silas' cottage. Silas finds her mother dead in the snow, but still he &quot;had formed no conjectures of ordinary natural means by whihc [the arrival of the girl] could hav ebeen brought about&quot; (115) The little girl, Eppie, transfroms Silas' reclusive life into one full of love and new happiness. Eppie comes to life as she &quot;toddles about&quot; and &quot;clings&quot; to weaver, who receives her affection awkwardly. Eliot shows, through heart-warming descriptions, how fate has blessed Silas by its miracles. Silas learns that the key to contentment is to remain optimistic. He learns the truth of neighbor Winthrop's advice: &quot;. . . isn't there Them as was at the making on us, and knows better and has a better will? And that's all we can be sur eon, and everything else is abig puzzle to me when I think on it&quot; (148)."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"\\"Life is what happens while we're busy making other plans...\\" John Lennon's lyric are words to live by in this hardy Victorian chestnut about a simple miser who finds love at his doorstep one snowy evening.Published in 1861, George Eliot's novel has a reputation for dreary earnestness that kept me away from it for quite some time, until I decided to make an effort at reading all the books I successfully avoided in high school. \\"Silas Marner\\" turned out one of the easier assignments, not only because of its shortness and simplicity, but for Eliot's engaging manner of writing, which feels less wedded to its time than even more famous writers of her generation like Dickens.Marner is a weaver and a kind of social exile who sets up his home and business in the English country town of Raveloe. Not happy but content, he spends his time either working or sleeping, his sole recreation being the counting of his gold coins. All this is suddenly taken away from him, but Silas's misfortune turns out to be a blessing, pushing him out of what had been a rut-like comfort zone.\\"Our consciousness rarely registers the beginning of a growth within us any more than without us,\\" Eliot notes early on in Silas's transformation. \\"There have been many circulations of the sap before we detect the smallest sign of the bud.\\"There's a lot to like about \\"Marner\\" the novel. The title character is a real treasure of literature as Eliot describes him, not because he's particularly exciting so much as because he's so readily identifiable, especially with those of us who are old enough to know disappointment in life. Many reviewers here compare him to Scrooge; Marner is a materialist and a bitter social outcast, but unlike Scrooge he retains a certain palpable sympathy and humanity throughout. This in turn makes the character's journey more compelling.Eliot captures a pastoral vision of English village life that feels absorbing and affecting, even if it is a bit gauzy. Her philosophic asides are marvelously quotable without ever getting in the way of the narrative. Her plot twists are well designed and hardly predictable, at least to me; I was especially impressed by how she dealt with a long-absent antagonist late in the story.But here's an odd criticism for a Victorian novel: It wasn't long enough. That's actually a problem, as the central game-changing transformative act of \\"Silas Marner\\" takes place when the novel's already half-over, and from then on the story speeds toward a spotlessly tidy resolution. The development of Silas's relationship with the others in his village, and with the little girl that changes him, feels rushed.To want more of a book is thin criticism of what is there. Perhaps a solution might be to read it again, for Eliot's ruminations on how people deal with the specter of misfortune, using various designs to try and ward it off, are both deep and charming. Her metaphysics are a trifle muzzy (I'm not sure if she was a Deist or an agnostic; maybe she was both at various times) but her take on the human condition comes across as well-grounded and relevant. She is a keen social critic, but not a blanket one; her take on organized religion manages to be both dubious and positive.In short, this woman with a man's nom de plume is very hard to pigeonhole, which also goes for her nifty novel. To adults like me of a certain age, the title may suggest boring homework assignments thankfully dodged, but \\"Silas Marner\\" is a real treat worth picking up."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"Silas Marner is a great classic that tells a wonderful truth. I loved reading about the village and how mysterious it was. George Eliot twines a great story about a lonely man who keeps to himself until a surprise shows up at his house. It was fun and intriguing to watch Silas change and grow along with his suprise. The end is great!"},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"This is a book I read over and over again. I picked it up the for the first time when I was 15 years old. It was required reading in English class. Being a cynical teenager, I balked at it at first. As the class got into reading it, I was totally taken with the complex story line. I loved it. It is one of the best books I ever read and reread. A few years ago, I mentioned it to an English teacher who jokingly asked me to \\"compare and contrast the moral revelation between Scrooge in a Christmas Carol and Silas Marner\\". Well I replied, Scrooge changed his ways and realized what was important by being confronted with the unlikely encounter with the supernaternal; Silas Marner came to his realization through \\"bad eyesight\\". My answer brought much laughter, which of course was my intention. Read this book and love it."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"Like so many other American high- schoolers I with great difficulty went through this work. Years later I subjected one of my children to the same ordeal when she needed to write a book- report. And this because I found then and now, this moral tale of redemptive love to be moving and instructional. For young people and I expect for most readers today the complexity of Eliot's language is an obstacle to be overcome. She writes the kind of sentences the masters of style have been teaching Americans not to write for years. But she writes with great intelligence and intuition, great moral feeling. The story of the weaver unjustly accused of a robbery, who retreats into his own private world and who is later redeemed by his meeting and taking care of an orphan child is one which cannot help but touch the heart. And as Hawthorne said when the heart is touched we begin to be .And this work comes alive with the old codger's care for and love of the orphan child. Like Scrooge the other great scowling isolato of nineteenth century Literature he exemplifies and proves the greatest moral lesson of all, that in loving and caring for other human beings we become human ourselves.Who can make it through the difficult language will find not only a very detailed and convincing description of English village life in the early nineteenth century but also a warm tale of the human heart healing itself through love."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"I first read Silas Marner when I was 18 years old, and loved every word. I started reading it again immediately after finishing it! As said in other reviews, perhaps 9th grade is indeed too early because at that age, this older language style is difficult to \\"get into\\" quickly enough to hold their interest. I found myself wrapped in this little town with its odd characters and gossip, and wished I'd lived there. The imagery is so strong and sweet I still refer to the scenery evoked by this novel when I read completely unrelated historical articles! The story itself cannot be called remarkable because it is one of the basic stories about humanity and what matters in life. Yet George Eliot surpasses all others in the telling of it. There is a reason this book is on all the reading lists -- it is a great achievement."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"There are few great novels about people who are basically good and who are, in the end, rewarded for it. I can think of only three others I have read in this genre that had any literary merit: Eliot's ADAM BEDE; Elizabeth Gaskell's CRANFORD; and Oliver Goldsmith's THE VICAR OF WAKEFIELD. I can see why SILAS MARNER is usually regarded as a novel to be read by the young, if only because it reinforces values that most of us see as desirable.Granted that Marner starts out as a miser, if only because he is so isolated from the rural community in which he lives. When Marner's small fortune is stolen, a strange thing happens: His neighbors gather closer to him and help him, drawing him out of himself and illuminating the goodness that was always inside of him. Marner's neighbor, Dolly Winthrop -- a poor, inarticulate wheelwight's wife who does everything she can to make Silas a part of the village of Raveloe -- particularly shines through in an excellent supporting role, one of many in the book.When a toddler whose mother dies crawls into Marner's house, the process begins to accelerate as he adopts her. The weaver now has someone to live for; and the love between him and the little Eppie begins to flower.Good seems such undynamic a quality in literature. George Eliot is one of the few writers who can make the tribulations of a good person worthwhile reading. In weaver and his neighbors, Eliot has created an entire community that strives for the greatest good (with the sole exception of Dunsey Cass, who steals Marner's fortune). The best books always make you wonder what happens next; and SILAS MARNER kept me turning the pages, marvelling at my own reactions to what I would once have thought was too simple and flimsy to engage my attention.George Eliot is a writer of many surprises and many surprising strengths. I had approached this book only because I was filling in a gap in my reading. Having read it, I urge anyone to pick up this book if you are young and hope for the best in life -- or come to it, like myself, an adult who has been &quot;nicked by the scythe,&quot; who has forgotten some simple truths about which he needed reminding."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"Jan 28 2010 - Melvyn Bragg discussed this novel with leading academics in the UK. See [...] where this can be listened to............SILAS MARNERPublished in 1861, Silas Marner is by far Eliot's shortest and seemingly simplest work. Yet beneath the fairytale-like structure, of all her novels it offers the most focused expression of Eliot's moral view. Influenced by the deconstruction of Christianity pioneered by leading European thinkers including Auguste Comte and Ludwig Feuerbach, Silas Marner is a highly sophisticated attempt to translate the symbolism of religion into purely human terms.The novel tells the story of Silas, a weaver who is thrown out of his religious community after being falsely charged with theft. Silas is embittered and exists only for his work and his precious hoard of money - until that money is stolen, and an abandoned child wanders into his house.By the end of her lifetime, George Eliot was the most powerful female intellectual in the country. Her extraordinary range of publications encompassed novels, poetry, literary criticism, scientific and religious texts. But beneath her fierce intellecualism was the deep convinction that for society to continue, humans must connect with their fellow humans. And it is this idea that forms the core of her writing."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"Newspaper readers were invited recently to submit their choices for the greatest works published in the English language. When the choices were totalled, two works by Shakespeare featured in the top ten. Also featured, I was pleased to see, was a novel by George Eliot. Internet users, familiar with her works, will probably guess which of her novels was chosen. For those unfamiliar with her works, the best one to start with is \\"Silas Marner\\", a much shorter one. It is short, it is easy, it even works well in schools (as I can testify), and yet it is undoubtedly a masterpiece.George Eliot sets her 1861 novel in the early decades of the nineteenth century in rural England. Silas Marner is a weaver. In the pattern that life weaves, he usually features as a victim. Because he is unjustly \\"framed\\", he loses his reputation and his betrothed in the town where he grew up. After years working as a weaver and living like a hermit in a rural district then, he is robbed by an unknown thief who uncovers and makes off with the cache of gold guineas Silias keeps under his floor. Happiness and joy come to Silas, however, and at the end of the novel he is told, \\"Nobody could be happier than we are\\".George Eliot tells her tale with a mixture of womanly sympathy, sharp observation, tact, and humour. Her depiction of a long-gone past, and her clear pointing of right and wrong impulses, give the story qualities that are sometimes found in morality plays or in fairy tales. Don't skip over the scenes in the local inn, the Rainbow, where the simple-minded rustics discuss relevant issues, including the existence of ghosts.For those who appreciate hearing good literature read aloud, I recommend the unabridged audio format of \\"Silas Marner\\" where the reader is Andrew Sachs. As you might expect of this fine English actor, who made Manuel from Barcelona so memorable in \\"Fawlty Towers\\", he is especially wonderful in portraying the argumentative, credulous, muddle-headed rustics that foregather at the Rainbow. His reading extends for nearly seven hours."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"I use Silas Marner with many of the students I tutor because it so effectively portrays that there are consequences to wrong actions. In contrast, what is right stands out purely (Silas and the child). I also use Silas Marner to make students aware of their own predispositions toward people who are &quot;different&quot;...people they don't want to know. The superstition of the townspeople toward Silas Marner reveals the common human tendency to deny a stranger his own personal history by conjuring one for him. This is an excellent book, especially for pushing young people to THINK!"},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"A charming, delightful book, as sad as it was.

I was very pleasantly surprised. In a few places, the language is a little tedious. Mostly, it is read with a lively colorful and varying voice, that brings the novel vibrantly alive. That is saying a lot since it is piece of writing that is almost 150 years old."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"If you're required to read this book in high school, then kudos to your teacher for introducing you to George Eliot.Having said that, when I was in high school, I wouldn't have appreciated George Eliot either. She was a master crafter of literature, choosing words thoughtfully and laying patiently the foundation of characters, observations, storylines to form a more perfect novel. In other words, to most high school readers of classic literature, her books can be boring.But wait at least 10 years, pick up her works again, and find yourself pulled into stories that simultaneously take you back to provincial Victorian England while portraying the lives of characters who could be your friends, family, yourself.Silas Marner is a wonderful precursor to Eliot's Middlemarch. The story focuses on the main title character, of course, following this sad little weaver from the time he was a respected member of his community to the moment he was cast out to his wandering and settling in sleepy Raveloe where he seeks to be left alone. Betrayed by his best friend and rejected by his fellow worshippers at Lantern Yard, Silas loses faith in God and people. He means to live the rest of his life in Raveloe, shielded from the God who failed him and from people who would only disappoint and hurt him.He passes the next 15 or so years of his life, shunning society who responds to this odd-looking stranger by alienating him. Silas finds solace in weaving, weaving, weaving, accumulating gold for his work, and transferring his love to these gold pieces.Silas' core is shaken again by a shocking event, and he is in danger of soon dying a broken man. He is restored when a little girl with golden curls toddles into his life. He comes to believe the gold he lost came back to him in this \\"golden-haired replacement.\\" And from then, Silas is slowly drawn back to life, back to society, back to faith in God. The little orphan he saves and names Eppie ends up saving him.Sounds like a simple almost sappy story, no? Under George Eliot's pen, it's a wonderful telling of faith (in God, in people, in life) lost and found because of unconditional love for a little child. But it's also much more than that. The story explores themes of alienation, societal rejection of otherness and being different, questions of where one fits in society and how that role is interdependent on one's participation in society as well as its acceptance of one on what terms, love of course as a restorative panacea, love between a father and his adopted daughter trumping all, and so many different aspects of life and its challenges and rewards.All of these ideas are so expertly presented and turned over, my eyes were sometimes stopped dead in their tracks by a passage that I would then reread several times to appreciate the beauty of its truth and language. I'm about to date myself (I'm currently in my late 30s), but I just had to share one of the most memorable observations I'd read in a long time. It's about Godfrey Cass, a man who seems to have everything, except a child to call his own:\\"Meanwhile, why could he not make up his mind to the absence of children from a hearth brightened by such a wife? Why did his mind fly uneasily to that void, as if it were the sole reason why life was not thoroughly joyous to him? I suppose it is the way with all men and women who reach middle age without the clear perception that life never *can* be thoroughly joyous: under the vague dulness of the grey hours, dissatisfaction seeks a definite object, and finds it in the privation of an untried good.\\"I don't think George Eliot is saying here that Godfrey is silly for wanting a child when he has everything else a man could possibly want. It is the idea of many men and women never being able to be truly happy and forever chasing some thing, which they find is lacking in their life at that time, because they're sure that thing will make them happy. This is the classic middle crisis, but it is universal in us all to desire what we can't have and to think our happiness depends on us getting it. It doesn't of course.I say this book is a precursor to Middlemarch because we start to see in this novel George Eliot's beginning of writing novels with distinct townsfolk full of characters as memorable as the main characters -- folks that populate a village and are as recognizable as your kind neighbor, local bartender, neighborhood elder. I'm thoroughly entertained George Eliot's creations here: Mr. Macey, Dolly Winthrop, Squire Cass and his brood, Nancy and Priscilla and their respectable kin.So why did I not give this 5 stars? Honestly, it was too short. Much time was spent on Silas and his life before finding Eppie, but not enough was flushed out in the story after. I loved the chapter when Eliot described how this old bachelor is suddenly befuddled by the two-year-old he's adopted and becoming a father to her. Where does he begin? And when Eppie turns 3 and mischievous, it's hilarious to follow Silas as he tries to discipline his precious...and can't. Those little nuggets are treasured by this newish mom. But it comes to an end too soon and Eppie is next seen as an 18-year-old girl about to embark on her new life.The second part of the book feels hastily completed. Loose ends are tied up; difficult conversations improbably take place and are resolved in one day; Silas' journey to his old life at the former Lantern Yard and back home to Raveloe is rushed; and Eppie's story has its happy ending.Had George Eliot wanted to keep writing to flesh out all these paltry scenes, I would have happily kept reading and delighted to have given this book a 5-star rating."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"Don't read the review following this one unless you want all the plot points revealed.If you've read George Eliot before, you know to expect interweaving plot lines, good characterizations and moral themes. This story is shorter than Middlemarch and Mill on the Floss, therefore not as deep in its levels and plot lines, but still absorbing and satisfying.It's the story of a bitter man, older than his years; a young child who changes him, and how their lives are interweaved with the lives of another, wealthy family. It's filled with life: tragedy, comedy, scenes you want to read out loud. George Eliot is a wonderful writer, one who can transport you to the English countryside and to the time period so you feel like you are there, and you always care deeply for the characters.I think very young readers might find feel there are \\"too many descriptions,\\" but I found it very entertaining all the way through.

In the height of his youth, when he is healthy, happy, and totally in love, young Silas is betrayed, cast down, and taught the 'lesson' that only the criminal and avaricious get ahead in life. He moves to a new town and abandons any attempt to connect with the society around him, instead focusing on hoarding his wealth and lovingly counting his money nightly. When his precious hoard is stolen, Silas is again crushed, but the arrival of a small \\"angel\\" - a little orphan girl with golden curls - starts him down the long road to redemption.A powerful aspect of this novel is the use of foils and counterparts against the main character as he learns his life lessons. The members of the local nobility live out their seemingly \\"perfect\\" lives unhappily, having not learned the lesson that Silas has learned through his exploitation as a lower-class member of society. By the time the local nobility realize what a treasure Silas' adopted orphan would have been in their barren home, it is too late; only the poor and miserly old man truly understood in time the value of living life for the sake of another.~ Ana Mardoll"},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"I think the reader made all the difference.

The entire thing is practically one long sentence."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"Silas Marner is a skillfully crafted novel to be enjoyed by readers with varied tastes. It was written by a woman, who found it necessary to use a man's name because of attitudes in England in the nineteenth century. It is built around problems that all of us face in our lives, such as, \\"How important is money?\\" As in all great novels, the characters change as the plot develops.SILAS MARNER is a realistic novel because it portrays life in a real and believable fashion. The author, Mary Ann Evans, who used the pen name, George Eliot, pays careful attention to a few distinguishing details about here characters and settings.For example, we can see Silas Marner, the central character of the novel, with his pale skin and undersized body. We know how he looks with his large, near-sighted, bulging eyes. We can see the important-looking village of Raveloe, which lives peacefully in opulent neglect.When I was a teacher, I directed many high school sophomores to read SILAS MARNER. Most students dreaded reading the novel included in their literature textbooks. Once they met Silas and spent enough time with him to become acquainted with his unique personality, they became eager readers of this well-crafted classic.It has some of the same qualities that madePride and Prejudice (Vintage Classics)an endearing and enduring novel. In both works, the idyllic English countryside is an enjoyable escape from everyday life. There is romantic courtship in both, but the romance of SILAS MARNER is not the central theme; therefore it is not as compelling as that in PRIDE AND PREJUDICE. Since the readers are not required to become obsessed with yearning for romantic fulfillment, young guys who were in my class felt free to enjoy it. (Sixteen year old young men are still self-conscious about these matters.) Both books contain the same kind of satire buffered with compassion. In both novels we laugh with the local rural and village people. Because the language in SILAS MARNER is less complex, adolescent readers enjoy it more than they do PRIDE AND PREJUDICE.When as a student I first read SILAS MARNER in high school and when I read it with my students, I considered the coincidences plot weaknesses. Life doesn't work that way, I thought. Now that I have experienced a life of incredible coincidences, I no longer find anything in the book unbelievable. Events caused by Silas Marner's catalepsy seemed unlikely, but now they represent no problem.Theft with its resulting bitterness provides conflict with which the readers can identify. Earlier I found it difficult to believe that the lightning of theft could strike twice, but that part of the plot is one more realistic element now. Other twists and turns with their ironic mysteries are typical of human life as I have lived it.All the parts of the novel that seemed to be a contrived fairy tale are now a vignette of life. Even if I could not believe it all, the book would still break my heart the wayForrest Gumpdoes with its twists and turns of satirical accounts.When I enjoyed SILAS MARNER in my twenties with thirty teenagers at a time, I did not notice the shaping of Silas' religious beliefs as much as I do now. I remember that the students and I were indignant about the way Silas was duped by the evil church members at Lantern Yard. Now I have compassion for them, especially William, as well as for Silas.Mary Ann Evans showed the futility of idolatry. All my students understood the disaster of worshiping money. If I could return to my students, I would like to ask them what they thought of the villagers who seemed to rely on the habits of their church to bring them close to God. Could we discuss that in the 21st century? I feel sure we would discuss the addiction to narcotics as it is realistically portrayed.SILAS MARNER is a great English novel not difficult to read, but rich in insights. It shows what is evil and what is good in human hearts."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"This is a very touching story. Our whole family loves to listen to it while we are in the car.

He never spent his money because he enjoyed its company. His gold was his only companion for several years of his life. Then one day, he was robbed, and he no longer had anything worth living for.Silas was slowly dying of misery and depression. He had no reason to live. Then one day a little girl walked into his house and into his life. Her mother died, leaving the baby girl as an orphan. So, Silas adopted her and took her into his home. She grew up a poor, hard-working girl who loved her new father Silas and vice-versa. Because of this new daughter of his, Silas changed for the better. He became more caring and devoted to someone else besides himself. He started to go to church again and changed his views on what really was important in life. And one day when his treasure was found and returned to him, he didn't even care for it. He had something even more precious than gold: someone to love and receive love from."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"Set in nineteenth-century England, Silas Marner is a weaver who has moved to a new town, Raveloe. Repulsed by his appearance and cataleptic fits, he is ostracized by the community. After losing his faith and having his fortune stolen from him, his fortunes change over time.The fascinating subject is not Marner but the town, Raveloe, whose characters are of particular interest. It is interesting how Eliot spends more time discussing their thoughts and actions than the does Marner, the title character.I was interested in this book from reading Middlemarch and found Marner to be decidedly more entertaining, but not as in-depth. Yet there are important themes found in Marner--the loss of faith, the good of the community vs. the rights of the individual, and the importance of social class (this is present in every British novel).Marner is a masterpiece--written by a woman in the nineteenth century, the book's unassuming nature belies its importance as a great literary work. It is also an entertaining book to read, and not too difficult, seeing its short length. Those interested in reading Eliot may want to start with this classic."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"Silas Marner is a nineteenth century Englishman.

Scrooge is redeemed by the ghosts of Christmas and the sick lad Tiny Tim.George Eliot was a freethinker who held to a high moral standard of behavior. She knew rural England and its folkways well for it was here she grew to womanhooid. Her use of the customs, dialects and culture of the British peasantry is superb. She was before Thomas Hardy on the literary landscape and surpasses that great author in her ability to delve deeply into the human heart in conflict with itself.Many readers may have been turned off to Eliot through being forced to read \\"Silas Marner\\" in high school.

Faith can be something one believes in without knowing if it is really there. In the novel Silas Marner, George Eliot makes clear how a weaver loses faith in God. The weaver [Silas Marner] regains belief when he finds a little girl around the age of two wondering around his cottage. He raises her [Eppie] and becomes very close to her. While raising Eppie, Silas takes her to church to be raised and taught like a Christian. This novel has a great shift when his love for Eppie starts changing his personality. George Eliot describes Silas's as a person with no hope. He describes the lost of devotion when his best friend steals a bag of money from a dying man. His best friend then blames it on him. The decision was left to God; whether or not he was to blame. This method convicted Silas, which is when he decided to loose all his faith. Silas hesitates when he finds out that Eppie is Godfrey's daughter.Sometimes having faith can help people continue their daily activities. This novel is really captivating, and interesting. It can make you understand the different ways in which God protects his children. When Silas was to busy avoiding confrontation with God, God put Eppie on his path. If you are a person in need of finding yourself it would be a great idea to read this novel. It focuses in the struggles one has throughout their lives. The many obstacles one will have to go through to know that at end everything will be alright. Sometimes it helps to know that there is someone waiting for you on the other side. This novel's rating is a five because it captivates the readers mind."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"I'm sure there are other good versions of Silas Marner available on CD or audiotape, but I must express my admiration for the reading by Andrew Sachs in an excellent unabrdiged edition of this Victorian classic. I was perhaps fortunate that I was not forced to read this book in high school when I might have found it a chore, so I approached the story with an open mind. Sachs manages beautifully to convey the inner life of Eliot's characters through his acting talent and his choices of slightly differing voices for each individual. A great reading of a great novel."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"This is an odd little book, but it's a good one. It's odd because the famous story of the old miser who is redeemed by taking in an angelic little girl to raise doesn't really even begin until half-way through the novel. This was definitely a surprise to me, but it wasn't a bad one. It ends up that there is a lot more to this novel than I thought there would be. In that first half of the novel, George Eliot brilliantly elucidates the fallen nature of both Silas Marner and the community. They're are revealed to be such selfish and sinful people. They are all in the throws of despair, lamenting their plight as humans and questioning a God who placed them in their lives. Eliot is really wonderful at capturing the need of each individual for redemption and also that need in the community as a whole. The individuals are criticized as is the unfair societal structure. Into this fallen world comes the angelic Eppie, and that's when the story really picks up. Eppie is the catalyst of grace offering redemption to Silas and the rest of the community.Silas Marner is really an extraordinary little novel. It's a thoroughly enjoyable book (especially after you get through the first half) with a lot of valid criticism and some hope. It's a really beautiful little classic."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"Long ago George Eliot breathed some life into these characters and their world of Raveloe, and if you look in on that place and time through the words on these pages, you'll find that things are still very vibrant there today. \\"Silas Marner\\" lives on because of the outstanding prose style and moral connundrums Eliot lays down as the foundation of her story.Her descriptions of people and places are so beautiful, her command of language so complete, and her style so refreshing, that it makes the world these people inhabit seem more alive and real than the worlds other authors attempt to spin. Her dialogue occasionly lets slip a touch of upper class pride, but overall her characters are expertly drawn, well filled out, and entertaining.The moral underpinnings of the story make it seem like a fable almost, but Eliot fortunately leaves final judgement of her characters up to the reader. Seeing Silas vindicated after so much going wrong for him made this worth the read for me. Despite some of the harsh realities of the class differences depicted, it is pleasant to watch the goings on in a small English town and to see Silas Marner at last catch some breaks and come into his own as a person. Even if it's a little unrealistic, heck, it's a novel so that's part of the fun.The choices we make for ourselves only determine part of our fate, Eliot seems to say with this story. Other things are not up to us, and those happen to us independent of any choices we make. I enjoyed pondering my own fate that way, through the lens of the little world of Raveloe. For such a short book, \\"Silas Marner\\" packs a lot of power in both language and meaning. This was my introduction to the work of George Eliot, and now I look forward to reading some of her other works."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"What can the reader of today find in a story about a weaver, who felt unable to assimilate into society, that he keeps to himself in his cottage?

We needn't rehearse the elements of the story in detail because virtually every English speaking youth on the planet reads it in school. Just to jog your memory, Silas Marner is a devoutly religious weaver who is unjustly accused of theft. He moves to Raveloe where he becomes fairly reclusive both because he wishes it so and because the villagers find him odd. He devotes himself to the accumulation of wealth, but is once again devastated, this time when he is the victim of theft. Ultimately he is redeemed by a young girl who wanders up to his door. He raises the child and they come to love one another as Father and Daughter. The lesson being that neither religious fanaticism nor the love of filthy lucre will suffice to save a man's soul, but the basic love between two humans will do the trick.It's a fairly simple and straightforward story about the capacity of love to heal spiritual wounds and make damaged beings whole, hence its power. Her other novels are in vogue right now, particularly the unreadable Middlemarch, but this is clearly Eliot's best and one of the most affecting novels of the 19th Century.GRADE: A"},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"A powerful novel about despair and redemptiom, when everything in Silas's world was gone something unexpected happened to replace his gold with a new golden life.Always darkest before the dawn.Hope for the hopeless."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"THIS BOOK HAD A LOT ABOUT LIFE IN IT AND WAS A GOOD LESSON TO SOME PEOPLE WHO HAVE A TENDANCY TO DO THINGS BEHIND OTHERS BACKS.

First of all, it is very boring and reading can become extremely tedious at some points. The storyline and plot is actually very interesting, but I think that if Eliot had presented it in a less descriptive and detailed way, it could have been much easier for a larger spectrum of readers to comprehend the messages she was attempting to transcribe through this story. This is definitely a selection that should be avoided by and young reader with any lack in patience or determination. This book is aimed much more towards scholars, historians, and English teachers."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"This book drags on about the most senseless details that neither matter at all to the book, or interest the reader.

Not that an old, slower style of writing is bad--I have nothing against old books. What I imply when I say \\"old\\" is that we've outgrown this and expect more from books these days than a story like this.There are too many other excellent books which do a better job of exploring the same themes better to waste a few HOURS of your life in the pages of \\"Silas Marner.\\""},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"This is the worst book I have ever read.

But it was a great surprise to me to find George Eliot writing of this so long ago - and I think there is little doubt where her sentiments lay (but then the issue in 'Silas Marner' was clouded by the involvement of the innocent and victimised, versus the guilty and self-possessed - but I'm sure that was written by design to emphasise a point).For a while 'Silas Marner' is a detective story. I had always thought Edgar Alan Poe was the originator of the detective story - but perhaps 'Silas Marner' may have been a trigger. This is an interesting mystery because we know who the culprit is and who the victim is - but will the culprit be exposed? and if so, how? For me, the circumstances of the crime was a little contrived but it did create a stimulating situation. But then the events of the story overtake the mystery and displace its resolution. When the resolution does come it is a real shock, not only to the reader but to characters as well - the ending is gripping and brings forth such desires for the four principle characters that I found it quite breathtaking to read.Some reviewers have bemoaned the use of this novel as a student reading text. I agree with them. I remember struggling through books inappropriate to my time when I was a student. It is only when people get older that they start becoming attuned to their history and the background to their society. The first George Eliot novel I read was 'Adam Bede' and its portayal of the Methodism I grew up with as an innovative cult was fascinating. But, as a youth, I'm sure it would have been just wierd. What would I recommend as a student text? Something current and engaging. As I have suggested elsewhere Philip K Dick's 'A Scanner Darkly' with its non-judgemental observations on the tragedy of individual destruction by the use of drugs, might have many levels of value to a student learning about literature."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"The plot of this book was very anbsorbing. At the end, I had to remember that I was just the reader and not in the book. I read sixty pages to read the conclusion. Also, George Eliot(pen name for Mary Anne Evans) has a way with words that is amazing. She uses specific words that give the reader an exact image. Though the sory was great, George Eliot needed to describe the characters greater detail. Other than Silas Marner and Eppie, the characters were left as vague beings with specific personalities, but no physical characteristics.:)"},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"An exceptional piece of literature.

I thought it would serve as a good intro into her work but the novel was far too simple in prose and spirit. While there is nothing wrong with the story of spiritual rebirth that's all it adds up to - a story. For me the definition of great literature is not just a good story but something which takes advantage of the art of writing by plumbing into the heart of humanity and translating it so the reader can feel what has been written. To put it simply, great literature can not be translated into a movie without losing what made it so great. This book can be easily translated into a movie as there is not much going on outside of the story. No deep character analysis, no discourse on anything really outside physical perception. From the plot the book should have been a very emotional read but it wasn't. Eliot's prose wouldn't allow it. She really serves as an outsider looking on these characters and situations rather then someone intimately familiar with the emotions and thoughts which make up the themes of the book. So, in turn, I felt like an outsider reading it. This would make a good movie where the story and physical emotion are the most important aspects, but as a novel it doesn't do the craft justice. In terms of English Victorian era literature Silas Marner just can't compare to novels by the likes of Thomas Hardy and Emily Bronte."},{"Title":"Lifer!","review":"Bill Craig Has done it again.

We are all sinners but there is salvation that God gives if we repent and believe in God's word. It does not matter how far we have strayed and what sins we have committed that have offended God. God loves each one of us unconditionally. God selected us to be... before we were a twinkle in our parent&#8217;s eyes. God created each one of us in our mother's womb at the moment of conception. God's wish is that we spend eternity with him. All God ask that we serve him, love him and keep His Commandments. It is not easy but God is with us every step of the way. God provides the tools and all we have to do is keep his word. But since we are all sinners because of &#34;Original&#34; sin we need God to show us the way. In Holy Scripture and the Holy Bible God talks to us and we must listen. We should listen because this world and our life here is temporary. Our permanent home is in Heaven. In the case of Saint Augustine he tells he reveals how as a young man he lived a very wretched life. His mother prayed for his conversion. Now his father also was a very sinful man. So his mother prayed for both of them. It took a while but God answered her prayers of a mother and wife and they both were converted and left their sinful lives to live a more pleasing life by keeping God's Commandments. The Confessions of Saint Augustine is a way to tell the world that he was a terrible sinner but now he sins no more. In the confessions he also shows that prayer can be as simple as talking to God. One must remember that God should always be the center of our lives. Some people before making a decision say, &#34;What would God do?&#34; That is the right attitude but we must follow through. We may be very alone here on earth because of our current situation but we should not worry for God is with us. My mother was very religious in life. She is no longer in the visible world but in the invisible world. She would often tell me, &#34;If you are with God nothing can be against you.&#34; I can imagine that Augustine's Mother besides continually praying for Saint Augustine she also encouraged her son to go in the good ways of God. This book also shows that miracles do happen to all who believe in miracles. In conclusion God will not abandon us if we ask for help and our number one goal while here on earth is Heaven. We can get there is we stay close to God. The Confessions of Saint Augustine is a manual of how God's love can make this possible in a heartbeat. Today is Ash Wednesday so at mass ashes were distributed by place a bit on our forehead and saying, &#34;Remember that you are dust and to dust you shall return.&#34; God bless all who repent and believe the gospel for Saint Augustine did and now he is in Heaven where we should all be some day but we must believe in the word of God. ."},{"Title":"The Confessions of St. Augustine, ([The black and gold library])","review":"The claim of being &#34;optimized&#34; for Kindle is misleading.

It was a monumental experience in terms of both the content of his writing and the freshness and relevance of his writing style. After re-reading them again recently, I am still struck with how contemporary the book feels. Aside from many of its 4th century particularities, the concerns that St. Augustine had and the way he frankly and honestly dealt with them could be lifted from almost any contemporary tell-all autobiography. The biggest exception is the fact that \\"Confessions\\" is a quintessentially and irreducibly a religious text, and in an age when religious considerations are largely pushed towards the margins of their life stories, it is refreshing and uplifting to see what would a life look like for someone who took them very seriously and committed himself to reorganizing one's whole life around the idea of serving God wholly and uncompromisingly. \\"Confessions\\" is a very accessible text, and for the most part it does not deal with theological and philosophical issues. The exception is the latter part of the book, which are almost exclusively dedicated to those topics. You may want to skip those at the first reading, but I would encourage you to read them nevertheless. Maybe the very inspiring and uplifting story of St. Augustine's conversion to Christianity can lead you into deeper considerations about your faith or the meaning of life in general. I cannot think of a better introduction to those topics than \\"Confessions,\\" nor of a better guide than St. Augustine."},{"Title":"The Confessions of St. Augustine, ([The black and gold library])","review":"I won't recount all the excellent reasons for reading this remarkable book. It's not a part of the Western Canon for nothing! It's a seminal work (autobiography) in a seminal field (Patristics)worth reading regardless of religious orientation, including none. What makes THIS particular version so exciting is that it is eminently readable and still quite stylized. Chadwick's eloquent translation caputes not only Augustine's ideas and thoughts, but equally important, his rhetorical skills. This alone justifies the purchase of this work. The philosophical nuances that, ironically, have entered twentieth-century thought again are very clearly articulated in Chadwick's translation. Other translations are likely to obfusicate what Chadwick elucidates. Read this great work by a great translator.

The metaphysical argues from logic and the existence and nature of reality, the historical from the past - both human and pre-human, and the experiential from personal, and private, experience.While I don't want to diminish the metaphysical or historical components of Christian belief and apologetics, I think that the most important source of living belief is the experiential, but it is also by far the hardest to communicate, since it is by nature, private and personal. While my experiences may convince me of the truth of the Christian faith, how can they convince you? They are part of my experience, not yours. It might seem to be an impossibility, yet this is the challenge that Augustine took on in &quot;Confessions&quot;, and it is by the degree of difficulty that the extent of his success and the greatness of the work can be measured.&quot;Confessions&quot; is a work of great beauty. Written in the form of a confessional prayer, Augustine bares himself utterly, and in so doing, makes the reader want to lower his defenses as well, making it possible to experience another's life more deeply than he might have thought possible, and in so doing, to translate his experience of Christianity across the divide that separates us from each other.Because of the nature of &quot;Confessions&quot;, I think that analysis of it is to be avoided. Analysis is distancing - it encourages the reader not to dive it in, but to stand back.

Down off the mountain comes a clock maker and his 14-year-old daughter, lost after leaving their broken-down truck. The woman befriends them and takes the man to meet her father and three brothers, enlisting their help in setting the man up in business. The mountain family appears to be a tiny bit eccentric, with jealousy between the brothers and perhaps some sexual jealousy on the part of the youngest brother about his sister and her mystery lover. Then the clock maker and the young woman fall in love, but one night the mystery lover comes back and all hell breaks loose.I hope that's not too much of a plot spoiler; I don't think so, because the events have a feeling of inevitability and are easily anticipated. Anyway, it's the characterization, the dialogue, and the tone which make this novel exceptional. Ehle's characters jump off the page, and the conversations read like transcripts of recordings. The tone progresses from a companionable folksiness to one of high tragedy. Quite a writing feat, Mr. Ehle.This novel reminded me very much of Faulkner, specifically of The Sound and the Fury. The writing style is not nearly as convoluted as Faulkner's, but the sense of hovering tragedy and of barely controlled violence is the same. The plot situation has some similarities, and the people seem to have the same primitive emotions under a veneer of respectability. Perhaps it should be assigned the genre of \\"Mountain Gothic.\\""},{"Title":"Winter People","review":"I actually purchased this book and the DVD for my daughter, who is also an avid reader. Years ago, I happened to see the movie and loved the unusual story, so I searched out the book. At that time, locating the book took some doing. Now, happily, it is here on Amazon. The book is set in the remote mountains of Appalachia, where generations of my own Scottish ancestors carved out difficult existences in this beautiful, harsh environment. The plot is populated with fascinating and complex characters, each with plenty of personal history and emotional baggage, which, of course, fuels the riveting central conflict. This is a story about uniquely honest, clannish people--some noble, others less so--who live surprisingly complicated lives in a manner much &#34;closer to the bone&#34; than most of us can imagine. Yes, there is a central love story--several, in fact, but they are portrayed as befits the characters and the locale: in Ehle's spare, but cleanly elegant style.

It recounts how the intelligent idealistic parents - and then the author herself in her teen years - were deluded into believing communist states really promised a more just society, until disillusionment set in. I also found it very interesting that the author, immersed into a Czech society and schools, considered herself almost more Czech than American (while her parents hardly learned the Czech language). Her love of Prague is very poignant to me, since my family lived there when I was 5 to 12 in the 1930s, escaping the Nazis just before WW2 started."},{"Title":"An Un-American Childhood: A Young Woman's Secret Life Behind the Iron Curtain","review":"Interesting perspective. While others were seeking refuge in the US, her family had to leave the US, due to her father's high position in the Communist party in the McCarthy era. This is per the Party's directive, (her father/parents knew too much), but surely they would have faced serious difficulties if they had stayed.They settle (per Party directive and assistance) in Czechoslovakia. At eight years old, she is young enough to learn Czech with native fluency. Long story short, she misses her last two years of Czech high school, but amazingly (imho) on their return to Czechoslovakia, she studies madly for two months, passes the exams in all her subjects and gets her high school diploma of a type that allowed her to attend university.Due to the worsening political climate in Czechoslovakia and recruitment by the Chinese government, they move to China for those two years. During that time she attended Russian school and becomes fluent in Russian, also working very hard in other subjects.At least she didn't have to worry about passing her Russian exams on their return to Czechoslovakia. Talk about making lemonade out of lemons. Her sister was four years older, so it would have been interesting to hear more about how she fared. At the sister's request, most of her story is left out.

Carruthers [if that one is a 5 star book, this one should get 4.5 stars], but is still a very good book. The book covers an eclectic and excellent selection of paleontologists, starting with Georges Cuvier, the first paleontologist, and concludes with Jack Horner, a model for the paleontologist in the first Jurassic Park movie. I am glad Cuvier is included. Even though Cuvier was the first paleontologist and convinced the scientific community of the validity of extinctions, he is often vilified in geology texts as an unscientific Catastrophist. [This is a misrepresentation of Cuvier and the Catastrophists, who were not unscientific. They were just wrong about certain aspects of Earth history.] The section on Roy Chapman Andrews [a model for Indiana Jones] includes equal billing for Walter Granger, the paleontologist with the Central Asiatic Expeditions, which gives the reader a better idea of what went on during those classic expeditions to the deserts of Mongolia. The book includes a Geologic Time Scale, a good bibliography, and an index, but lacks a glossary. Reading Between The Bones would have benefitted from the subsections and subtitles used in Pioneers of Geology, which made the later book easier to read. My few reservations do not negate the fact that this book should be on the shelves in every elementary school and middle school library in the country and would be a killer gift for the budding dinosaur hunter, especially those who are not ready for the more advanced books written by Jack Horner and others.

The information he presented was informative and easy to follow. I have learned many new things after reading just one chapter (Preparing for Exams) in his book. The things I have learned could be incorporated into my life. Dr. Halberstam sounds high intellectual. Being a professor himself, he knows the way colleges are run and the tricks of the trade. Everything he wrote made sense. He wants people to work hard to get an \\"A\\" in school, none of his pointers involves the easy way out. Allot of what we had written was approaches to studying I had already known. However, after reading the chapter, I became more self-conscious about my study habits.

I found myself longing to meet someone like Gavin. i can't wait to read more by this author."},{"Title":"Always, Now and Forever","review":"Always, Now and Forever is a delightful and poignant debut novel from Sheila Lipsey. Lipsey sensitively and clearly writes about a subject matter that is rarely addressed in fictional novels...the plight of those with physical disabilities who want to be loved and enjoy a relationship the same as others.Stricken with polio as a young child, Clarye was always physically different from other children and as such was taunted and teased during most of her childhood. As the years passed, especially during the teen years, the comments/words would hurt severely and impact her mental/emotional state and especially her self-esteem. Since childhood Clarye has always expected the worst and even as she gets older her two closest companions continue to be fear and pain, although she would happily trade both of them for love. Unfortunately, Clarye would marry three times but none of the marriages would possess love. Instead, they would be filled with verbal and physical abuse along with pain and fear.After surviving her last marriage, Clarye vows that she will only live for self and her two sons. As a result, she puts her all into her career and becomes a successful writer. When Clarye least expects to meet Mr. Right she does in the form of grocery store magnet, Gavin Elliston. Gavin helps Clarye to realize that with trust and faith in God that true love is possible if only she would open up her heart and give him a chance. Unfortunately, Clarye's faith will be quickly tested and a tragedy will strike which quickly throws Clarye's world once again into a tailspin.While reading about Clarye's heart-wrenching and often painful life, I experienced a gamut of emotions usually ones of sadness and despair but very rarely happiness and joy. This was surprising in that I thought this was a romance novel but it really read more like mainstream fiction as I longed for more sexual tension/excitement between Clarye and Gavin. When heart-wrenching events happened I cried with Clarye. When she seemed to have found her soulmate with Gavin I cheered loudly for her. But I was deeply disappointed when she finally found happiness, romance, compassion and love that it would all be short-lived due to unforeseen circumstances. I was taken back that after everything that Clarye went through that pain and fear would still be the biggest factors in her life rather than love. The author left me with the impression that if you were physically challenged your life would be filled with more sadness than happiness and that love would elude you most times. Hopefully as Ms. Lipsey grows as a writer and if she continues to write about those whom are mentally or physically disabled, she will show readers that even those with handicaps can overcome life's obstacles and have wonderful relationships."},{"Title":"Always, Now and Forever","review":"Yvonne, a 48 year old from Oregon. I enjoyed this book tremendously. it truly is a different kind of love story. Ms Lipsey's characters were really true to life and the novel is one that made me take a look at how I see myself I look for more books by this author"},{"Title":"Always, Now and Forever","review":"The story of these two people was just great. It really gave me some hope. My only sadness was that it ended too soon. I found the book interesting,and read it within a day. It is sad what Clarye went through and kept picking the same type of men. It seemed as when her mom kept talking about those sons needing a father, then Clarye would go and marry the man. I don't particularly care for what her minister said. I know we all got pay for whatever we have done in life, but it don't mean that you have stay and be miserable about it either."},{"Title":"Always, Now and Forever","review":"Although this book was written several years ago, the topic is timeless. The author hit the ground running with her first book, which deals with hard issues like abuse, infidelity, spiritually and life in general from the eyes of a physically handicapped person. Clayre is strong character that the reader immediately cares for. She is our mother, our sister, our friend or perhaps she's you. She is very real and like most of us she tends to make the same mistakes over and over again. Like many of us she eventually gets it right. The reader understands her feelings of low self esteem and is appauled by the frequent episodes of abuse. Through it all Clayre is a mother to her children first and she never loses her faith in God. Her daily battle with polio allows the reader a glimpse into the life of one dealing with more than life's ups and downs. Though she seems weak at times, Clayre is actually very strong. She endures much and survives much in the process. Her message seems to be, \\"You can get through this rough time and life does get better.\\" What I love best about this book is that Clayre did find true love. It was short and sweet, but most importantly it was real. I shed many tears while reading this book, but hey isn't that the mark of a great writer? If you can't feel hurt or scared or happy or angry has the writer done her job? Shelia Lipsey truly did her job with this book and I'm happy to know that she continues write emotionally riveting novels."},{"Title":"Always, Now and Forever","review":"Always, Now and Forever is a romance novel that shows that the power of faith and the belief in God can help you withstand any pain and can also open you up to finding love.Clarye Dawson's life has been full of horrible experiences. Suffering from polio since childhood, Clarye has has been taunted and teased, and as a result, her self-esteem is beyond damaged. Her self-deprecative ways take her into three violent and abusive marriages that leave her not wanting to ever deal with the opposite sex again. As an adult, Clarye is a successful novelist, and has the type of lifestyle that many would envy; but despite her career and material gains, life continues to throw pain and heartache in her way. That is, until she meets grocery store magnate, Gavin Elliston, a man with his own painful past. Through his belief in God and his unwavering faith, Gavin helps Clarye realize that she deserves love, and the two begin a relationship that binds them together through love and faith. With any great love, situations ensue, and when tragedy hits home once again, the characters are forced to face their faith head on in the hopes of coming out of the most tragic pain imaginable.Always, Now and Forever was a different read for me. This is the first novel I've read in which the main female character was not some thin, &quot;perfect&quot; specimen, but was someone with a physical disability; however, beautiful in her own right. That alone made the story an interesting read. Clarye's journey was a very dramaful one and brings the reader deeply into the story and her pain. I found the novel to be more fiction that romance, and would have liked to have seen a more romantic/sexual scene between the two main characters, and I say this because Clarye thought so lowly of herself and her body that it would have been nice to see Gavin showing ALL of her attention in a nice, drawn out scene. I'm also a lover of dialogue, and the majority of this novel is narrative, so I didn't receive the pleasure of hearing what the characters had to say as much as I would have liked to.Overall, Lipsey has written a very nice debut novel that has wonderful messages about love, faith and God, and I would check out future works by this author.Reviewed by Shonie"},{"Title":"Always, Now and Forever","review":"A Bell (ALBJR@aol.com), a 38 year old engineer from Chicago, October 20, 2000, clarye made me look at myself.

I think we all do in some form or fashion. this novel truly had me feeling the characters. There were times i cried, laughed and even fantasized. I would love to have a love like Gavin in my life.

I heard the author on local radio station as she talk about her story she aspired a lot of listners she also touched my heart as well i couldn't wait to go get the book.

But when I read the back cover of this novel, I was drawn to read it! This is one of the unique books that takes you deep into the characters! Clarye and Gavin seem to jump out from the pages! It has some parts of it that made me ashamed at how some of us guys are to our women but then it showed how us &quot;for real&quot; guys are and how they should be. I recommend this to all you fellows out there. Now to you ladies, I believe I can say without reservation that you will be able to feel the joy, the pain and that &quot;for real kind of love&quot; that Clarye and Gavin hope to find. It is good reading for adolescents as well as baby boomers! I can't say enough excellent things about this book. To the author, I can't wait until your next novel comes out. I want to be the first to buy it!! I just bought three copies of this one to give as gifts to my sister, momma and of course, my lady! Keep it up Shelia, you are indeed a superb writer."},{"Title":"Word Biblical Commentary","review":"Word Biblical commentaries are good in general for their interaction with the origianl languages and their analysis of the form of the text. O' Brien has a good overview of the hypothesises for the writng of colossians."},{"Title":"Word Biblical Commentary","review":"Much praise has already been laid down by others concerning this commentary. The five star rating I gave it should confirm to the reader my agreement. With this in mind, I'm going to focus on one particular aspect of the book.If I could have any complaint about this commentary, it is that it is too scholarly and thorough. O'Brien interacts with so many sources and views, one can get a little too bogged down in all the reasoning. Some parts are hard to follow lucidly with so much material being compared and contrasted. The sheer number of inline references and sources can make following the text with your eyes rather difficult. This is my general complain of the Word Biblical Commentary series as a whole, and this one seems especially representative.O'Brien commentary is a gold mine for those serious in academics, or pastors who are series about having a broad base. O'Brien offers a huge (indeed, perhaps exhaustive) bibliography of the different works dealing with the text. O'Brien could be you one stop source for all your researching needs. For the layman though (like myself), it might be a little too much.That said, I wholly recommend this commentary for all those serious about study."},{"Title":"Word Biblical Commentary","review":"This is the best commentary available on Colossians. Like O'Brien's commentaries on Ephesians and Philippians, this work features in-depth exegesis, summaries and critiques of all exegetical options, interaction with the best contemporary scholarship, and clear writing. O'Brien argues for Pauline authorship, and his theological perspective is broadly in the Reformed tradition."},{"Title":"Word Biblical Commentary","review":"O'Brien's commentaries on the prison epistles have never failed to help me when I have consulted them to understand Paul's letters better than I had before. The author writes from a theologically conservative and complementarian viewpoint but is always prepared to evaluate other views, while also clearly articulating his own.This is one of the most helpful of the Word Biblical Commentary series.If you read commentaries to help you to understand the text, so that you can better serve Jesus Christ, you will really appreciate this one, as well as the author's commentaries on Philippians and Ephesians.If you have not studied New Testament Greek, you may find some of his argumentation hard to grasp.[If you are serious about understanding the New Testament, a couple of years studying the language it is written in will be enlightening, and will at the very least open up for you the majority of the best commentaries!]"},{"Title":"Word Biblical Commentary","review":"This being his first commentary on his way to becoming one of the most respected commentary writers and scholars today should be consulted if doing any sermon or serious study on Colossians. His comments are usually profound with a clarity not often found in technical commentaries. I read this book straight through and sometimes didn't want to put it down. I've now dabbled into Douglas Moo's Pillar Commentary on Colossians which I find also to be great, but it gives me a fresh appreciation for the precedence that O'brien set with this work nearly 25 years ago. Many don't like the layout of the \\"Word Biblical Series\\" I find it to be helpful. O'briens Summary section at end of each segment is amazing, a perfect remedy for a tired brain after plowing through the rigorous exegetical section. He basically ties the translation, structure, and exegetical sections into a nice bow (explanation section.) Many regard this to still be the best commentary on Colossians."},{"Title":"Word Biblical Commentary","review":"Another in an excellent set of exegetical, scholarly commentaries. The layman will find this to be not quite &#34;user friendly&#34;, but if you are in seminary or Bible college, your instructor will certainly allow you to use this in your bibliography. Impeccable academic work."},{"Title":"Word Biblical Commentary","review":"The commentary itself is excellent - O'Brien is consistently insightful and helpful - but the formatting of this commentary is absolutely atrocious. What do the editors of the WBC have against footnotes? Why did they think that three or four line parentheses separated by half a line of text was an acceptable way to handle O'Brien's style? Frequently a single sentence is interrupted by two or more parenthetical remarks which should have been placed in notes, and the reader struggles to follow the author's argument. If you can overcome this problem, the commentary is worth your time."},{"Title":"Word Biblical Commentary","review":"I have studied through two of Peter T. O'Brien's commentaries, this one and his Pillar New Testament Commentary on Ephesians. In both commentaries O'Brien comes across as a very capable scholar with a broad knowledge of primary and secondary resources and a strong grasp of the original Greek. His exegetical and syntactical insights have helped illuminate my understanding and appreciation of Colossians greatly. Even when I inevitably found that I agreed with another scholar on particular points, it was his fair and respectful treatment of that scholar's point of view that facilitated my decision. The format of this volume is the only reason I have withheld a five star rating. It is sometimes difficult to follow the authors stream of thought. The inline notes and references interrupting the main text so often do not help. Others have commented that this is the fault of the publisher and the WBC format. I agree to an extent, but have found the same trouble to a lesser degree with the other commentary on Ephesians. That commentary has footnotes and foot-references. At least some of the difficulty is his writing style. All in all though this is a great commentary and I am happy to have it on my shelf where I know I will refer to it again and again."},{"Title":"Word Biblical Commentary","review":"If you are familiar with O'Brien's other commentaries you know that his exegetical precision and scholarly explanation are invaluable. In this commentary O'Brien maintains his position as the \`answer book' for Colossians. If you can only buy one commentary for this book...buy this one."},{"Title":"Word Biblical Commentary","review":"I bought this commentary to help supplement my sermons, but I didnt realize how in depth it was. This was the best commentary on this book by D.A. Carson's commentary reviews and he is right. There is Greek and sometimes it is not translated so if you know Greek it wont bother you. Other than that its a great commentary that looks at all perspectives but breaks it down to make it manageable to the layman and strong enough for the scholar, pastor."},{"Title":"Word Biblical Commentary","review":"Excellent work from O'Brien as usual. I purchased this book on the recommendation of Dr. Roscscup and it has proved to be an excellent resource. This books is targeted to those interested in an exegetical work on Colossians and Philemon. Recommended for those with a working knowledge of NT Greek."},{"Title":"Nobody loves a drunken Indian","review":"I read this book back in the 70s while living on an Indian Reservation. The book brings to light very real problems but does so with laughter. The laughter runs the gamut from the giggle type to the roll on the floors with tears running down your face type. The book catches the nuances of problems faced by Native Americans, and does so without &quot;preaching&quot; about solutions or causes. It is a marvelous book. When it is re-issued, it will once again, have it's place of honor in my book case."},{"Title":"Nobody loves a drunken Indian","review":"FLAP IS THE BEST IN ALL OF US AND THE WORST IN ALL OF US.

Think I was [quite young] when I first read it (what can I say, I was precocious!). I was always the type of kid who rooted for the horses and Indians before even thinking about the cowboys. This book made a *huge* impression on me.For a white-bread Army brat, it was hard to imagine the life on the Paiute reservation, but the author's words were able to give me a very good, if not very wanted, understanding of just how rough it was - the amenities that we take for granted they didn't even have as an option, like electricity and TVs, and even more importantly, basic medical care.Flapping Eagle's \\"don't tick me off\\" attitude and his dealings with Snowflake, Mike, and especially H-Bomb, made me love him from the get-go. He wasn't afraid to speak his mind and stick up for what he thought was right.From the beginning where you meet the main characters, to the drunken attempts to ride a drunken H-Bomb while avoiding his big teeth, to the train that was hijacked, the equipment that goes over a cliff, the court proceedings, and the final scenes in Phoenix, the book pulls you into the story and real life takes a back seat until you turn the last page.I am a voracious reader and this story affected me to the point that even now, 30+ years later, the book is still in the top 10 of my favorite all-time books. Read it. You won't regret it."},{"Title":"Nobody loves a drunken Indian","review":"This is one of my favorite books of all time; the story just draws you in, and keeps you there.

It's been over 20 years, and I still chuckle when I think about Flap, Eleven, H-Bomb and all the other unforgettable characters and their many wild and crazy adventures. I've since married into a Native American family, and I realize that many of the problems that the author pointed out with humor back then still exist is some degree today. Crude language not withstanding, I think that this is a great book and should be a must read for anyone with a social concience."},{"Title":"Nobody loves a drunken Indian","review":"Browsing the stacks of Literature at a University of Arizona Library, my head turned sideways trying to pick up titles, I happened across this book. As all good University books, there was no cover art just that green binding.

There is no Phoenix, Arizona. There is no such thing as racial inequality and hatred. And there is no book in your hand.&quot; Now...who could resist that! The book moved on to impress me with its riveting setting of the desert, Shakespearan characters and its rompous story. Notes: Claire Huffaker was a man, not a Native American, did alot of screen plays, was from Iowa (I believe) and wrote another story based on his parent's lifes (not nearly as good)of which the name eludes me.

I have several native students (adults and teenagers), and this book, I am certain, will be a revelation for them.

I bought this book thinking that I had bought another book with almost the exact same title. I am more than pleasently suprised with the variety of subject matter covering all sides involved as well as the technical aspects of the sailing navy. I recommend that this book be read in conjunction with a book that covers the battle on its own like Roy Adkins' Trafalgar, The Biography of a Battle. The Trafalgar Companion is a very worthwile addition to any Nelson/Trafalgar library."},{"Title":"The Trafalgar Companion","review":"This book gives an overview of the campaign and battle of Trafalgar. Its written by different writers, all who are respected in this field. This book tries to bring the campaign and battle in proper perecption by covering each aspect such as British fleet, Allied fleet, life of Nelson, political situation, seamen's life aboard these wooden world and so on. Each chapter seem to be well written but sometimes, it seem to carry the coverage too much. For example, I thought the coverage of the Trafalgar campaign didn't have to be traced all the way back to the beginning of the French Revolution and beheading of Louis XVI!! Due to the limited nature of this book (its published by Ospery after all), each chapter seem to give a pretty superifical treatment of the subject matter, not giving much details or any new insights about the campaign and battle of Trafalgar.Its my understanding after reading this book that its more geared toward the novice level and if you are a veteran reader of this campaign, you will gain no new knowledge or gain any fresh insights here. This book should not be mistaken for the book written by Mark Adkin with the same title. That book is light years ahead of this book in handling all aspects of this campaign and battle of Trafalgar.If you really want a true companion book, I would recommended Mark Adkins' book. If you are a novice into this field of reading, maybe this book would do the trick for you but to be honest, I don't know why it would since most of the terrific books out there covering Trafalgar does a good job already covering what this book tries to do."},{"Title":"Captain Cook's World: Maps of the Life and Voyages of James Cook RN","review":"This book caught my eye at Pearl Harbor on my first significant visit to Hawaii a few weeks ago.

He states early in this 1896 book, \\"The theory of the Divine Right of Kings ... involves the following propositions: (1) Monarchy is a divinely ordained institution; (2) Hereditary right is indefeasible... (3) Kings are accountable to God alone... (4) Non-resistance and passive obedience are enjoined by God.\\" (Pg. 5-6)He summarizes, \\"Kingship has ever been regarded as in some especial way protected by a Divine authority; that the influences of Christianity has in all ages been held to support this view; that English Kingship from being elective in a single family had become purely hereditary by the fourteenth century; that coronation had ceased to be regarded as necessary to the making of a king; ... the English Kingship towards the close of the Middle Ages wa strictly hereditary and unconditioned by constitutional restraints.\\" (Pg. 37)He argues, \\"It is in the gradual rise of Papal claims to universal supremacy, that are first put forth those notions which form the basis of all theories of Divine Right... With two powers within the State in the relative positions of Pope and Emperor, it was inevitable that sooner or later there should arise between them a struggle for supremacy.\\" (Pg. 45)Later, he added, \\"Both sides recognize that power is of God, both are aware that there must be in the state some supreme authority above the law. But in (the Papal) view the Divine source of all authority is held to carry with it the supremacy of the spiritual power. These pretensions could only be met by the assertion, that secular government was not merely allowed but was actually ordained by God, and that the secular prince held immediately of Him with no intervening authority.\\" (Pg. 65)He notes, \\"For the theory of Divine Right is a religious as well as a political dogma.\\" (Pg. 208) He observes, \\"In opposition to the claims of the Pope to sovereignty by Divine Right, men formulated the claims of the King to sovereignty by a right that is not inferior.

In the name of the Communism he advocated millions of people were murdered.For Strathern Marx is along with Adam Smith and Keynes one of the great economic thinkers. His understanding of the injustices of the world of the Industrial Revolution, his understanding of moral failings in Capitalism are often sound ones. Marx however prescribes a cure which is worse than the illness. He dreamed of ' from each according to his ability, and to each according to his need' but this does not come about in the Soviet Union the great testing ground of his work. He too wanted a 'dictatorship of the proletariat 'as preliminary step toward the new order which would come when the capitalist system broke down.

Talk to any expatriate in Paris, and you will be told extraordinary stories relating to their first few weeks in town - who put them up, the first youth hostel they had to stay in, the dodgy landlords... Paris throws up hard luck stories and good luck stories alike. The Paris in Roman Payne's first novel, Crepuscule, is that of all our worst, and best stories.Crepuscule starts on a ship, with the male hero David being shipped over to France in a wooden box. Sick and suffering, David is an American from Seattle with a French passport, and arrives in Brittany, where he is saved by a kind old man nearing retirement at the docks. Eventually, David makes it to Paris, where all his money is stolen, and wakes up in a hospital, which is demanding over 4000 francs worth of money in return for his passport.David ends up in the care of an old doctor, Odette Moreaux, one of the book's most twisted characters. Moreaux drugs him and takes advantage of him regularly while he is unable to physically respond.The book's heroine, Nastya, is a ballet dancer from Moscow. Displaying a considerable knowledge of Russian culture and character, Payne weaves in the story of Nastya with that of David, leading the reader from city to city, story to story. To do this, he takes Bulgakov's trick of the kindly, verbose narrator.Bulgakov's masterpiece The Master and Margarita is a clear influence in Payne's first novel. Even the central idea of fate is crucial to both books - in Master and Margarita, the Master is resigned to his fate, while in Crepuscule, David is convinced that his fate lies in Paris, and Nastya is drawn to Paris, believing that it is her fate. The idea of the narrator speaking to the reader is developed from Bulgakov, too, and taken a step further when Payne reprimands the reader for having led him astray!Nastya arrives in Paris after having received a letter and a train ticket from a \\"Monsieur de Chevalier\\". This gentleman offers lodging and a position at the Op&eacute;ra Garnier to the book's heroine, but Nastya soon realises the man is a fake.The two stories continue to wind around each other, as they lurch from comic tragedy to comic tragedy. Payne's timeless Paris is far from the saccharine Montmartre of Am&eacute;lie Poulain, and much closer to that of Hemingway. In fact, it would be fairer to say that Payne's Paris is closer to the Saint Petersburg of Dostoyevsky, with its destitute courtyards and broken windows.Fate, or the narrator, brings together the two characters, both having left their lodgings, and both homeless and penniless. They both realise that fate has worked its magic for them, and that the reason for being in Paris was to meet each other.The tragic end sequence comes in stark contrast to the prose-enfused pages of the romance. Payne certainly never intended Crepuscule to become a Hollywood movie. Some readers may be shocked not just by the brutality, but by the speed with which it happens.Blending wit, tragedy and beauty, Crepuscule is a brave piece of writing. Payne's talent is the ability to stir the emotions, to take his reader from the heights of ecstasy to the depths of despair. As the omnipresent narrator, he is fully in control, guiding the reader through the story and ruthlessly terminating the story.Crepuscule is brave in its scope, as well. Bridging Paris and Moscow, Saint Germain and the Bolshoi, and introducing such foul, tragic characters such as Monsieur de Chevalier (also called Salaud, or Salaudski) and Odette Moreaux, the twisted, wrinkly GP from hell, Payne the poet finds something touching in everything he crosses.Don't file Crepuscule under easy reading. File it under essential reading."},{"Title":"CREPUSCULE","review":"Roman Payne's Paris is first and foremost a soil open to the seeds of fiction: lonely, damp bridges and their dwellers, dim lampposts, rusty gutters, and an entrancing dusk - cr&eacute;puscule - that comes back ceaselessly upon the rooftops; all come to life in an estranged, almost timeless vision of the French capital. As you read Crepuscule, do not look for a vision of Paris as you know: you will not find it.Crepuscule starts off with Ishmaelian character David being expelled from America, caged in a box in the middle of the merchandise stored in the belly cargo boat. He ends up stranded in Paris, deprived of any riches, with a ragged suit and an appalling health for sole belongings. Russian dancer Nastya leaves her hometown, invited to perform at the Op&eacute;ra Garnier by request of a (supposed) French nobleman. The two youths will eventually meet in misery and hope, in the midst of the terrible and beautiful capital city that eats one's dreams alive, and decide to find a way out together.The prose of Crepuscule seems to find its source in 19th Century Romance, a highly symbolic genre where verisimilitude is left out in favour of the imagination of the artist. roman Payne's novel is a tale of exile and loss, told by the omniscient voice of an almost old-fashioned storyteller. Most of the characters bear the marks of this slightly \\"dusky\\" quality one finds in 19th Century Russian and American works. The French nobleman could be stepping out from The Dead Souls, while the mysterious Docteur Moreaux is at once grotesque and terrifying.Roman Payne's narrative drive carries the tale to a timeless Paris, reflecting glimpses of its essential bones. It is immemorial as an urban fable that was and will be told on and on, in all its own mirrors - moving in a stream of words, always on the verge between the comic and the melancholic. With Crepuscule, Roman Payne delivers his story with vividness scope and apparent pleasure, in a voice of his own.- Jean-Francois Caro (Editor, The Parisian)"},{"Title":"CREPUSCULE","review":"Mr. Payne speaks this story in print to us as a long, romantic bedtime story. His prose sings with the syntax of a poet giving his characters a fairy tale quality that masks the dark truths layered in throughout the text. I read and read without stopping until I ached; then rested, and read more. A fine read for anyone who believes in the powers of love: both best and worst."},{"Title":"CREPUSCULE","review":"By Gemma Roxanne Williams(Asst Editor, Hackwriters)A poetic exploration of the challenge given to our wildest dreams by the gritty reality that is this world. \\"Crepuscule\\" is a brave new look of the stories of old; in a voice sometimes so cutting the reader questions the sanity of the narration, sometimes so beautiful they get lost in idyllic dreams; Payne brings out the beauty in the horrific.We meet David, stranded in the unkind streets of Paris without money, without health and without friends. His story, sometimes stooping to the filthy depths of humanity, sometimes soaring to the heights of our most romantic dreams, is delightfully interwoven with that of the salient Nastya, until their lives and dreams collide.With the ghastly beauty of Paris as our background we watch the dreams and nightmares of David, who travelled the ocean in a box, and Nastya who left her humble Russian home to be transformed into the star of the Op&eacute;ra Garnier by a charming French nobleman. The grand cities can be the most wonderful and the most awful of places, turning dreams and nightmares alike to reality. The reader watches, holding their breath as the horror and beauty of Paris is played out in the lives of passionately crafted characters.The tragic end stands in stark contrast to the sprawling poetry of the earlier pages of the romance. This is Payne's magic, the reader never quite settles into the story, never quite knows what will happen next. Even when the story is over, the book closed; still the reader wonders...Beauty and disgust, love and hate, wild dreams and harsh reality are so blurred they are almost one in this unending story distilled through the unique voice of Roman Payne. The reader is almost lost as to where the narration ends and the story begins, as our omnipresent narrator involves us in the emotional rollercoaster that he too seems to feel along with his beautiful characters.Sometimes enchanting, sometimes repulsive; Payne seems to search to the ends of every human emotion and still evoke something more poignant. With an almost mocking disregard for the rules, Payne marks his own way, and tells his own story and the grime of Paris lit by the beautiful morning light captures the essence, the timelessness and the beauty of his storytelling.- Gemma Roxanne WilliamsAsst Editor, Hackwriters"},{"Title":"CREPUSCULE","review":"\\"And the star looked back, and loved her so,for making beauty with her woe.\\"Making beauty out of woe - this is the act of alchemy performed in Crepuscule, where Roman Payne paves derelict Parisian streets with flowers of the purest tones: from a packed swamp, he drags the flower and the mud alike - unearthing corpses while throwing sand at the stars. The novel opens its streets of misery for the reader to step in, and follows a pair of lovers in a French capital coming to life ghost-like as a stained curtain. Abandoned, damp bridges and their dwellers, streetlights and gutters, and a mesmerizing dusk falling in rains of sepia on the page.David is stranded, penniless in the city, in a ragged suit and a terrible physical state. Nastya leaves her Russian hometown, invited to dance at the famous Op&eacute;ra Garnier by request of a French nobleman. But sometimes one stumbles against one's dreams - and a city like Paris can turn great hopes into a heap of ash. The two youths will eventually meet through their struggle in the terrible beauty of the cannibal city, and decide to find a way to get out of it.Crepuscule recovers a sense of the romance as meant by Hawthorne, linking a by-gone past with the very Present that is flitting away from us, and is a tale in the true sense. The story it tells is immemorial: the story of exile. Dusky love. Loss. Hope and misery. Listen to the voice of the storyteller. You'll hear how David travelled across an ocean inside a wooden box, how he wandered across the streets of Paris. You'll be told about Nastya, looking for the Op&eacute;ra Garnier, the real nature of Docteur Moreaux's disease, and the silent songs of those who gaze at the Seine from its banks with rain for a shelter.Roman Payne's narrative drive carries the tale to an intemporal Paris, reflecting glimpses of its essential bones. It is immemorial as an urban fable that was and will be told on and on, in all its own reflectory glimpses - moving in a river of words, dancing on a tight rope between laughter and tears. As a proper alchemist, Roman Payne molds his story with beatitude and misery blended, with a thrilling, vivid scope and a voice of his own - the voice of a true poet.Paris, November 24th, 2004."},{"Title":"CREPUSCULE","review":"It would have been great if the author had someone proofread the book before publishing.Halfway through the book the locale switches to Seattle when they were in Paris and a character's name changes from Marick to Marc and back again.Waste of time."},{"Title":"CREPUSCULE","review":"Roman Payne's first novel Crepuscule opens with its hero David packed in a trawler's cargo hold, and ends only after he's tasted the full gamut of seedy love, betrayal and murder-meaning he's obviously been shipped to Paris.

Caroline Leavitt gave it 4 stars, and described it as a \\"breathtaking novel,\\" \\"gorgeous and tragic,\\" and written in \\"rich, lyrical prose.\\" Kirkus reviews gave it a starred review. And so did the Library Journal. The great South African writer, Antjie Krog, says that Yvette Christians invented a new language for the book. But it's accessible, and even compulsive reading.As for my own estimation, Unconfessed is a deliriously beautiful work, one that manages to make the main character, Sila van den Kaap, at once pitiable and admirable. Abused by history and its mendacious masters, she is fierce but also vulnerable, terrifying in her capacity for rage and surprising in her capacity for love, humor and even laughter. This is great literature, and also a great read."},{"Title":"Unconfessed","review":"\\"No mother wants to know that her generations are condemned to the life she despises.\\"\\" - Sila from UnconfessedUnconfessed is the story of Sila, a slave who is sentenced to fourteen years of hard labor at South Africa's infamous Robben Island for murder of her son, Baro. Sila, captured as a youth from neighboring Mozambique, has borne a life of hardships. Freedom, promised to Sila and her children upon the death of her mistress, is swindled from her by the destruction of the will by the mistress's financially inept son. She and her children are sold back into bondage to settle gambling debts. She lands at the farm of a sadistic cruel master whose fetish is boxing/slapping slaves about the head, so fiercely that Sila becomes deaf in one ear from the beatings. When six-year old Baro embarrasses the master and his wife in front of their future in-laws by innocently implying that the master is his father, he is beaten unmercifully as an adult would be in such a manner that even the guests are appalled at the master's punishment. After the guests leave, more beatings ensue in the following days for Sila and her son. By the fourth day, Sila realizes that Baro, covered in bruises and suffering from broken bones, will never perform well enough or respond quick enough to ever please their owners. Knowing that he will be the constant target of their owner's anger and eventually will be sold away to a life of bondage, she frees her son from his earthly torment by putting a knife to his throat.The story is told in Sila's voice via alternating memories from her childhood, servitude, trial, and prison experiences. The book's title refers to her never confessing to the crime, but cites one word (heartsore) as the rationale for her actions. Borrowing the theme from Toni Morrison's Beloved, Christianse authors a fictional tale based on proven facts. She created a character that seemed as if she could have actually existed at some point in time. She wrote the story with such convincing ken that Sila's story seems rooted in authenticity - no doubt she worked hard under extreme conditions, was repeatedly raped and sexually abused all her life, and suffered unimaginable mental stress and utmost heartbreak with the death and sale of her children.On a personal note, I deducted a point for a couple of drawbacks. There seemed to be too many repetitive passages that did nothing to enhance or advance the established plot. Sila's soul is angry and tortured, however her extended inner monologues to express those emotions were quite numerous. The lyrical and somewhat poetic dialogues with her deceased children to calm her spirit and justify her actions were a bit protracted and sometimes read as abstract ramblings. However, I really enjoyed the history lessons contained within the book. The author cleverly folds in the inhumane conditions of Robben Island, the Dutch reaction to British anti-slavery laws, and the resistance of the indigenous Xhosa people against the Dutch. This is a notable read for historical (literary) fiction fans.Reviewed by PhyllisAPOOO BookClubNubian Circle Book Club"},{"Title":"Unconfessed","review":"This book is for the reader who wants the challange of a book that makes you think and come up with conclusions.

Pizzey I was an excellent reference, but the plates (by Doyle) were mediocre and of limited value for field identification. Pizzey II features superb color plates by Frank Knight, with a reduced facing-plate text by Pizzey that surpasses other current field guides in the amount of distributional information furnished. Unfortunately, the ungraduated distributional maps are clearly inferior to the maps in Michael Morcombe's Field Guide to Australian Birds (Steve Parish Publishing 2000) and the Simpson &amp; Day Field Guide to the Birds of Australia.Though slightly smaller than Morcombe (6.5&quot; x 9.5&quot;), Pizzey II is a large format book (6&quot; x 9&quot;) that is easy to read, but a bit heavy for packing in the field. Nevertheless, foreign birders visiting Australia would be well advised to take both Pizzey II -- for the illustrations -- and Morcombe -- for the huge quantity of useful information and detailed field notes on the (amateurish) plates. For routine use in the field, the guide of choice remains the light and compact (4.5&quot; x 8&quot;) Slater Field Guide to Australian Birds (Weldon 1989). The other Australian field guide, Simpson &amp; Day, is a worthy competitor with color plates of comparable quality to those in Pizzey II, though perhaps not as conveniently arranged.In conclusion, all four current Australian bird guides are five-star books, though each has its strengths and weaknesses. Pizzey II is artistically the most pleasing and would be the guide of greatest interest to book collectors interested in fine bird art."},{"Title":"Field Guide to Birds of Australia: The Graham Pizzey & Frank Knight Field Guide","review":"This review concerns a 2001 edition which has been updated but not basically altered.I bought this book mostly for reasons of bird art, as I have no immediate plans to visit Australia. The book's layout is of the now conventional and conventient type, with illustrations and text plus range maps on facing pages. As there are usually only three or four species on a page, there is relatively much space for text. The range maps function on a &quot;all or nothing&quot; basis, i.e. more detailed info on a bird's status has to be gleaned from the text. The book tries to follow the most recent systematic order, it seems. This has some rather inconvenient consequences, however. For example, the very similarly looking quails and button-quails appear on pages 23 and 161 respectively!The book is actually not a true field guide as it is too large to take to the field (unless you carry it in a rucksack). Just OK to have in the car or at home. That is a shame. The book is in the same size league as the original Sibley guide for North America. For this reason, I only give it four stars.As I bought the book for its illustrations, I'd like to comment a bit more about these: I can't say much about their accuracy, but I am rather disappointed about their variable quality. One would certainly not think that all the plates were done by the same artist. Just compare pages 115 and 117, for example. Overall, on some plates the birds seem to come alive, whereas on others they are very two-dimensional. I.e. they appear very flat. Some birds like the lesser noddy appear overly slim. And, while some bird pictures are rather smallish, there are some that are rather too large. The storm-petrels on page 93 are a case in point, giving the plate a crowded appearance. But those drawings are otherwise of superb quality.I emphasise these differences of the plates because there is usually considerable criticism when a new field guide comes out that has its plates done by several artists. Here, we find similar differences within the work done by the same artist. It is clear that doing all the artwork for such a book is a monumental task. And even a good artist is not always equally disposed, I would assume. And then, there is probably the pressure of a publishing schedule. However, what counts in the end are the pictures we all have to look at and work with for years. Thus, spreading the task does not seem to be such a bad way to do it, after all. That is, as long as you have several good artists with the available time. But it also means that it is a sensible solution to use the same good illustrations for several books, as has recently been done in the field guide to the Birds of Africa South of the Sahara.One thing that keeps puzzling me - not only with respect to this field guide - is the fact that there is contents included that does not help in the field at all. Thus, we find here a lengthy chapter called &quot;family introductions&quot;, the kind of info one would expect in an &quot;encyclopaedia&quot; type book. Also, what good is a long literature list in a field guide?"},{"Title":"Field Guide to Birds of Australia: The Graham Pizzey & Frank Knight Field Guide","review":"I still have this edition on my bookshelf and used it exhaustively in the field. As you can see from the photo I've uploaded, the spacious plates are a delight, with handsome, large illustrations. Species accounts are helpful and instantly comprehensible.

The size and weight is slightly cumbersome but its not a big deal with an easy plastic cover on and the joy of having decent-sized text and pictures. To me this also has some of the best wader illustrations of any field guide anywhere."},{"Title":"Field Guide to Birds of Australia: The Graham Pizzey & Frank Knight Field Guide","review":"This in-depth field guide is useful for both beginners and experienced bird-watchers.

The rest of the book focuses mainly on toddlers who eat table foods. Along with important nutrition details about vitamins, proteins, carbohydrates and fats, I found the cooking tips included in the second half of the book to be most useful. The chapter called \\"Supermarket Savvy\\" shares great ideas to make store-bought/convenience foods healthier (such as adding apple juice and chopped raisins and celery to stuffing mix or mixing instant oatmeal into refrigerated cookie dough). The recipe section is better than most cookbooks I've seen for kids because it includes healthy recipes for foods that kids will actually eat (such as apple crisp, meatballs, pudding popsicles, blueberry muffins, chips made from pita bread, and macaroni and cheese).This Complete Idiot's Guide does a wonderful job of making feeding and nutrition easy for parents--without making you *feel* like a complete idiot.

The way it's broken down into age ranges, and all the user-friendly tips, make it easy to read in stages as I need the information.

The recipes seem to be geared more toward the older toddler and less toward the baby beginning to eat table foods. I really had hoped that there would have been more ideas/recipes for the younger eater. The book is okay but I certainly wouldn't recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Feeding your Baby and Toddler","review":"This book is truly designed for those who have never read anything about feeding their baby or toddler. I did not really find any of the information new or very useful. Some of the recipes look simple enough to try, but I was disappointed that they do not include basic nutritional information. I would also have preferred to see mention of portion sizes, as well as healthy non-perishable snack ideas for toting in the diaper bag (my toddler is not yet ready for raw veggies).But if you are looking for just the very basics and don't really need details or a lot of information, this might be for you. I personally find the information I get in some of my magazine subscriptions more useful."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Feeding your Baby and Toddler","review":"Has all the Basic info. Probably good for the average reader. However I have a picky 11 month old and this book just doesn't do. The conventional Recipes are great for good eaters!"},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Feeding your Baby and Toddler","review":"Numerous times I've consulted this book and been hugely disappointed. Yes, the recipes at the end look nice and creative. However, they do not mention any recommended age (by the looks of them, they are o.k. only for babies over 1 yr).Here is why I don't recommend this book as a reference-all option: 1) There are no real recipes for babies under 1 yr of age (there are 8 pgs of \\"recipes\\" for pur&eacute;es, if you can call \\"chop vegetables, microwave, pur&eacute;e and mix with formula\\" a recipe!). (to be fair, the description does say \\"specifically created to wean babies from soft foods onto solid \\"adult\\" foods when they reach the toddler stage\\"). 2) Out of 259 content pages, only about 10 of them explain what foods are recommended at what ages and why, and the explanations are very ambiguous.Example: pg 42.Feeding your baby 8-12 months, what foods to serve now and how much: daily recommendations: infant formula 16-32 oz in 2-3 feedings; breastmilk 3-4 feedings; baby cereal 1/2 cup dry; fruits and vegetables 1-2 cups total pur&eacute;ed; meat 1-4 oz. chopped, cooked, fresh, ground, or finely chopped poultry or 1/2 jar pur&eacute;ed meat. Your infant might also have: full-fat yogurt and hard cheeses such as cheddar and cottage cheese, cooked and mashed legumes like lentils and garbanzo beans, cooked egg yolk, combos such as macaroni and cheese or spaghetti and meat sauce (ran through food processor). HOW MUCH?That is ALL that is written about what to feed your baby from 8-12 months!3) (why i don't like it, cont'd) There are no tables that show food appropriateness by age anywhere in the book (no quick reference), and there are a lot of foods that are not in this book. For example, you cannot open this book and find out when you can feed your baby cherries.4) there are about 150 pages of just boring reading. Sure, most of it is useful knowledge (e.g., wash your hands before you prepare baby food; babies need a certain amount of fat and the scientific explanation why), and all parents should probably read this information. However, not much of it is really practical as far as helping you create a plan for feeding your baby from ages 6-12 months.5) most of the recipes involve microwave cooking, and some involve opening packets of pre-made mixes. I personally prefer knowing how to make things from scratch.6) none of the recipes talk about how to store the food or how long it can be kept for.What's good about this book: 1) Mostly accurate nutritional information; 2) explains why junk food is bad for toddlers; 3) has growth charts in the back; 4) a small section of \\"better than store-bought\\" recipes which unfortunately are hidden in the midst of a chapter about grocery shopping.Sorry to say it, but I've found much more helpful info [...] See also my reviews on SO EASY BABY FOOD by Joan Ahlers, and WHAT SHOULD I FEED MY BABY by Susannah Olivier.

It is only 91 pages but it is packed with Biblical light and truth on prayer. Some of the chapter titles will help any reader quickly realise how unordinary this book is. An essential element in prayer is the reality of Christ in prayer. Austin Phelps has this to say on p.85-86 \\"Christ as the atoning one, must be a reality to the soul, or prayer cannot rise to its full growth as an experience of blessedness in the friendship of God.\\" The chapter on fragmentary prayer has many valuable insights on this often overlooked aspect of prayer. While the author does not give a complete formal definition of prayer( I wish he had),we do get bits and pieces of the essence of what prayer is. On p.62 we get one of these bits,\\"Prayer,as we have observed,is an act of friendship also.It is intercourse;an act of trust,of hope,of love-all prompting to interchange between the soul and an infinite,spiritual friend.\\"(That infinte being is the God of heaven and earth).This is not your common book book on prayer,it is uncommon in its style,observations and value."},{"Title":"Best Recipes: From The Backs Of Boxes, Bottles, Cans And Jars","review":"Every recipe I've tried has been wonderful; from Mexican Macaroni Salad to the Apple Bavarian Torte. No pictures in this book but there's a brief descripton of the recipes' history. This is a must cookbook for every kitchen."},{"Title":"Best Recipes: From The Backs Of Boxes, Bottles, Cans And Jars","review":"I have to say that this is one of the most fun, nostalgic, practical and enjoyable cookbooks in our collection. Over the years we have used it many times and still do so.The title of this work sort of says it all. This indeed is a collection of all those recipes you find on the back of boxes, cans, jars and such, published by the maker of the product found inside the container. Now logic would tell you that these companies would not print a horrid, difficult or bad tasting recipe and attach it to their product with a recommendation that you try it. No, no, no! These food companies are trying to sell you their product, over and over and over again. This is how they make their money. They desperately want to put their best foot forward. And I must say that they almost always do!I doubt seriously if you attend a church dinner, organization or community potluck, family gathering, etc. that you will be able to go through the food line without running into at least one of the recipes featured in this work. Many of the dishes here have become so ingrained in our eating culture that the original source is completely lost, and indeed, many have gone into the realm of \\"old secret family recipes that have been pasted down generation after generation.\\" Little do we know that Aunt Grace or Granny actually copped the dish from the back of a can or box years ago and passed it on as her own.There is something is this work for just about every one; whether it be main dishes, desserts, appetizers, snacks, sauces, salads, soups, sandwiches, breads, or just \\"stuff.\\" All of the directions are extremely simple to follow; so simple in fact, that this is a great book to present the young lad or lass that is off to college and away from home for the first time. The eats in this work are far, far better that the microwave noodles, frozen microwaveable pizza or the offerings of the local fast food joint.Now I note that at least one reviewer has stated that most of the recipes in the work are outdated and that many of the products listed here are no longer available. This is absolute cod wallop. Some of these recipes do indeed go back to the 1930s and 1940s but I have not found one where substitutions could not be made, if indeed actually needed. I hate to say it, but people really should read and use a cookbook before they review it.Anyway...Another big plus in owning this book is that all of the recipes featured are not only relatively easy to make, they are also relative fast. Most of them take very little time to throw together. Of course the biggest reason for using this work is that most of the dishes are quite good and you will be missing out on a lot of good eating by not using it.This review was of the 1993 Edition.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks"},{"Title":"Best Recipes: From The Backs Of Boxes, Bottles, Cans And Jars","review":"I have used this book for years, so much that I had to buy another one. I am glad I did. The pages are all new and crisp (not for long!) The recipes in here are priceless, and all those old recipes that \\"grandma used to make\\" are in here. I urge you to have this book in your collection. Pass it down to your future generations. They will thank you for it.I have bought about 20 of these books over the years and given them as gifts. All my friends/family love it. Some of them call me up and say \\"Did you try that recipe on pg XX?\\" We have even made the same recipe for a party just to see who made it the best.Spend the money, get it and enjoy!"},{"Title":"Best Recipes: From The Backs Of Boxes, Bottles, Cans And Jars","review":"This book is very helpful for occasional cooks. It carefully lists the ingredients, so you can be ready to prepare the item. It gives detailed instructions without assuming that the reader already knows the terminology. Although I have used only a few of the recipes, those I did use turned out very well. My confidence in the book's recipes comes also from the sources of the recipes: popular acclaim from those who have used them (from the backs of boxes, etc.). I do not know whether all of the name-brand products are still available, but assume that either they are or that one can readily find equivalents."},{"Title":"Best Recipes: From The Backs Of Boxes, Bottles, Cans And Jars","review":"This book stands on its own as superb.

Add into this the frustration of not knowing what some of the brands are and, as a result, not really knowing how to substitute.I would recommend this book to people who love nostalgia or would like to have it as a reference book."},{"Title":"Best Recipes: From The Backs Of Boxes, Bottles, Cans And Jars","review":"I recently acquired a copy of this book while visiting a used bookstore. I was intrigued by it and brought it home. So far, this book has been absolutely amazing.We have all seen the recipes that get printed on the labels of our favorite products, whether it's cocoa powder, all-purpose flour or frozen vegetables. These recipes always have a couple of things in common no matter what product is in the package - the recipes are always simple to prepare and they produce good results. So, having a large collection of recipes in a cookbook like this means it's a cookbook of simple, easy recipes that stand and deliver. What's not to like about that!There are twelve chapters in this book that cover a variety of disk types: Appetizers/Snacks, Main Dishes, Side Dishes, Sauces, Salads/Dressings, Soups, Sandwiches, Breads, Pies, Cakes, Dessert Dishes and finally Cookies. There is obviously some overlap in these, but there's a good index which makes finding a favorite recipe easy.As a kid I always wanted German Sweet Chocolate Cake for my birthday, and I found out well after I moved out and was on my own that the recipe was the one on the package of baking chocolate my mother always used. I was delighted to find the same recipe in this book. I have not made this for myself yet but I have it planned for the near future.This cookbook is stuffed to capacity with so many good ideas and recipes that it's going to be difficult to make most of the recipes I have earmarked in any short amount of time. Those that I have made have worked out well, and I am so looking forward to trying even more. Of course, some of the recipes are classics that take me back to when I was young and lived at home with my parents, blissfully unaware that many of my mother's secrets were printed right on the labels... This is a great cookbook - if you can find a copy, it's worth the investment - unless you want to buy one box/can/bottle at a time."},{"Title":"Best Recipes: From The Backs Of Boxes, Bottles, Cans And Jars","review":"I've owned a version of this book for over 20 years. Add this to your collection for good recipes that at one time or another were found on the product itself. You can imagine if you found a recipe on the back of a Stokely corn can, then it's bound to be good. Just made the cool corn salad with shredded corn - yummy. I also recently tried a southern chocolate pie recipe from Baker's German Chocolate that was very, very good (bonus - no meringue to make)!Only 4 out of 5 because I've tried to use this like a standard cookbook to find anything and everything. It's very close covering a wide range of foods, but you won't find everything.Just a side note: I recently had to clean the outside of this cookbook from old flour, sugar, etc. It gets used quite a bit."},{"Title":"Best Recipes: From The Backs Of Boxes, Bottles, Cans And Jars","review":"Gotta love this book.Food mfrs. spend millions in research kitchens and at bake-offs to come up with really good recipes. Unlike a lot of cook books which are compilations of steals from other cookbooks, untried recipes with penciled-in changes, and wild-hair 'it oughta work' but untested brainstorms, these are recipes that food makers bet the farm on to make buyers happy with their products.Some of these are as old as brand names, others current. There's a lot of history in these pages and even recipes from before cooking was possessed by PC-ness (remember the OLD Betty Crocker and Americana cook books that had recipes starting with 'take a large scoop of butter ...').Some of these you may remember from childhood, others you'll discover with delight. I won't say you can't go wrong, but there are a lot more home runs than strike-outs.Oh, yes. These recipes tend to be simple and quick; they call for everyday ingredients - no special imported Residue of Fois Gras or Monastic Rubbings of Truffle - they were written so the average homemaker could put good food on the table with minimal fuss and without a special trip to the store.One example: the recipe for Chicken Kiev is the quickest, easiest and tastiest I've ever found.'scuse me now - I'm off to make a Frito pie.Try the book ... you'll like it."},{"Title":"Best Recipes: From The Backs Of Boxes, Bottles, Cans And Jars","review":"This book stands on its own as superb.

The companies who developed and printed the recipes wanted readers to _make_ the food so that they would be using their products.You can save money with many of these scratch recipes (frosting, spaghetti sauce, and more), and every one of them that we've tried has been one we liked. And you don't have to use the brand-name product, of course. They turn out just as well with whatever was on sale. But shhhhhh, don't tell the manufacturers I said that.Easy, tasty, and they'll save you money. I'm not sure what the downside is to this cookbook.

However, many of them are indeed timeless, and looked like fun to make.Before this book was (sadly) stolen from me, I had the chance to make the tomato sour cream casserole(with Doritos), the fruit sherbet, the fruit juice whip, the red velvet cake, and fried green tomatoes. Every recipe came out wonderfully, even without pictures to refer to.

Elaine has such a refreshing writing style. I just came in from shoveling a foot of snow, and I curled up to a warm fire, a cup of tea and got lost in this book. It's best to read it when you want to get away from it all after a tough day. 105 pages of delight. It makes you want to visit the village of Pacific Grove, have a piece of apple pie at Toasties or sitting on the park bench watching the seals and otters swimming near the beach (but not together). I share Elaine's love of cows and Snickers bars. I wonder if you sprinkle chocolate chips on a cow, will you get chocolate milk? (you have to read the book to understand that). Anyway, great job once again Elaine! May God be with you when you bring your '82 Volvo in for its 500,000 mile checkup....I can't wait for your next book."},{"Title":"My Peaceful Forest : Reflections on Life in Pacific Grove","review":"I could not put My Peaceful Forest by Elaine Breen down until I had read the entire book!

This book is a \\"must have\\" in case there is a natural disaster and there is no doctors around, or if you by chance don't believe what your doctor is telling you and you want a second opinion. I use this book to save money on a doctor visit and diagnosed myself. My brother saved money by stitching himself up from a deep cut rather than waiting and pay a doctor to do it and did a great job himself.

Not all decide to follow, but those who do so find a release from their old, sinful self and receive a new nature from the Shepherd (like how Grace and Glory did). How wonderful to see the Shepherd give new names to replace their old ones. See how the Shepherd is able to develop Hind's Feet for those who cannot physically journey with Him to the High Places. Learn also about the nature of the fruits of the Holy Spirit. I read this book with the same inner joy and excitement when I read Hind's Feet. Before I read this book, I was hoping for a sequel to Hind's Feet when God answered my prayer. This books shows that when we surrender our fruits of the flesh to God, He will replace it with His own wonderful fruits of the Spirit. When we live a life loving the Lord, it will draw people to the Saviour and God can make us forgive and love our enemies."},{"Title":"Mountains of Spices","review":"This sequel to &quot;Hinds Feet&quot; takes you to the next level.

I like it very much. However my favorite part by far is the corresponding chapters on the fruits of the Spirit, and I often go back and read them. In each one the King takes Grace and Glory to a new mountain of a ring of nine, each representing a different fruit of the Spirit & teaching it by comparison with spices listed in Song of Songs (or someplace). She describes how that plant corresponds to that Spirit, and He teaches her about it. Then she goes down into the Valley for the days work. He teacher her a song for each one. One of my favorites is something like this:Love must give and give and giveLove must die or shareOnly then can true love liveFruitful everywhere.(from Gentleness I think, also the following:)'The King and Grace and Glory came, just before sunrise, to the Mountain of Calamus, where the spices of gentleness were cultivated...she stood still in delighted surprise, for stretching before her were fields of slender reeds, swaying in the breeze and tossing lightly in rhythmical motion like waves on a slightly rolling sea...He pointed out to her the exquisite grace and lovely, unresisting meekness with which they bowed themselves before the wind, sometimes right to the ground, only to sweep upward again without effort when the wind had passed over them...'They know how to be abased and how to be exalted' ..she realized that the lovely fragrance that exuded from them and which men call gentleness, sympathy and loving understanding was developed by the daily practice of bending submissively to life's difficult circumstances without bitterness, resent or self-pity.'etc. etc. etc. It's really quite good.I've had this book for fifteen years and still go back and read the fruits of the spirit parts regularly (as God seems to be teaching me about that fruit!) It was originally published in 1977 - not many books stay in print for thirty years."},{"Title":"Mountains of Spices","review":"This book is an excellent follow-up to Hinds Feet on High Places.

The writing is not particularly good, but the first book was thought-provoking in its message.I found the message of this book troubling. It seemed to confuse sacrificing yourself for another's good with enduring and accepting their abuse. Allowing others to abuse you benefits no one. You can and should love the abuser -- God does -- but you should not enable or empower abuse, whether it is towards others or towards yourself. It is not the Christian duty of a wife whose husband beats her to stick around for a second helping; it is, arguably, her duty to prevent this from happening, not just for her own sake, but also for that of the husband and of the children.Notably, Jesus did not yield to every form of abuse he encountered. He fled from those who pursued him (Luke 4:30, John 11:54). He told his disciples to buy swords (meaning of this is debated), and to flee (Luke 22:36, Matthew 10:23). And He was very vocal in protecting others from abuse, including women and children (Mark 10:14, Luke 17:2, John 8:7)."},{"Title":"Mountains of Spices","review":"This book is a great sequel to the book by the same author, Hinds Feet On High Places.

Enjoyed it."},{"Title":"Mountains of Spices","review":"Before I begin the review, I would strongly recommend that you read \\"Hinds Feet in High Places\\" before this book.Mountains of Spices is a wonderful allegory of the various plants mentioned in \\"Song of Songs\\" and assinging them various qualities, which are in fact the qualities of Christ and parallel the Fruits of the Spirit (Galatians). In the prologue, Ms. Hurnard talks of seeing the ninefold Fruit of the Spirit and the nine spices mentioned in the \\"garden enclosed\\" and the \\"orchard of pomegranates\\" in \\"Song of Songs.\\" She does point out that she takes artistic license with some of the qualities she assigns to the spices, but is overall very faithful to the Bible verses that inspired the story.The allegory of the people - in a similar fashion to Hinds' Feet - is more aspects of our personalities and how the Shephard can mold us, through Love. Much-Afraid (now named \\"Grace and Glory\\") yearns to return to the Valley to comfort her relatives who were too afraid/proud/etc. to go to the High Places. She learns from the Shephard on the various Mountains of Spices how she herself can be an ambassador of Peace.I can strongly identify with the people who are transformed by Love in its many forms and feel so inspired by this little book.

Meditation master, holder of the Kagyu and Nyingma transmission lineages of Tibetan Buddhism, Oxford scholar, artist and poet, Trungpa Rinpoche founded the first accredited Buddhist University in the Occident (Naropa University in Boulder, Colorado), and established well in excess of a hundred Vajradhatu Dharma and Shambhala Centers world-wide. Ch&ouml;gyam Trungpa Rinpoche was one of the most dynamic teachers of Buddhism in the 20th Century. He was a pioneer in bringing the Buddhist teachings of Tibet to the West and is credited for introducing many important Buddhist concepts into the English language and psyche in a fresh and unique - yet startlingly clear and understandable - way.During his too brief life, he was also one of the most controversial figures in Tibetan Buddhism and more generally in the Tibetan exile community, largely owing to his lifestyle and life choices since leaving Tibet, which were instrumental in his death at the age of 49.Trungpa was identified at the age of only thirteen months as a major tulku (reincarnation) of an enlightened teacher, a revered figure in Tibet's religious history. As the eleventh in his teaching lineage, he underwent a period of intensive training in mediation, philosophy, Buddhist history and scripture, and the arts, receiving full ordination as a monk in 1958 at the age of eighteen, which he captivatingly recounts in &quot;Born in Tibet.&quot;.The following year in 1959, armed forces of the Communist-led People's Republic of China brutally invaded Tibet, and the young Trungpa spent many harrowing months trekking over the Himalayas, narrowly escaping both the dangers of the terrain as well as capture. Trungpa's account of his experiences as a young monk, his duties as the abbot and spiritual head of a great monastery, and his tender relationships with his teachers offers a rare and intimate glimpse into the life of a Tibetan lama. The memoir concludes with his daring flight from Tibet to India. In an epilogue, he describes his emigration to the West, where he encountered many people eager to learn about the ancient wisdom of Tibetan Buddhism as well as those who made a &quot;museum-piece&quot;-like curiosity out of him.This is a delightful and captivating book, one which once begun can hardly be put down. It is exceptionally well-written, and I strongly encourage any student of Tibet or Buddhism to add it to their library."},{"Title":"Born in Tibet,","review":"This superb book tells the remarkable tale of the 11th consciously reincarnated Trungpa Tulku, a Tibetan Buddhist lama, who after living a traditional spiritual life in Eastern Tibet is forced to flee the brutal Chinese invasion of his country in the late 1950s.The story gives a rare first-hand glimpse into the secluded monastic world of pre-communist Tibet as well as some horryfying accounts of the atrocities committed by the Chinese against this totally peaceful nation. Although largely unknown to the West until fairly recently, the Chinese destruction of Tibet and ruthless slaughter its people must surely rank among the greatest of crimes against humanity. One wonders what could possess anyone to parttake in such indiscriminate destruction.But the story has a silver lining of sorts. If it were not for the Chinese invastion the West would never have received a flood of Tibetan refugees, amongst whom we count some of the most accomplished Buddhist teachers ever, including the venerable and late Trungkpa Tulku himself and not least H.H. the late 16th Gyalwa Karmapa."},{"Title":"Born in Tibet,","review":"Arguably the earliest breakthrough account of his homeland before and after the Chinese invasion, when this appeared in 1968 it preceded the Rinpoche's fame and the attention his \\"crazy wisdom\\" inspired among followers and detractors. Boldly, Trungpa sought to strip the Vajrayana, the Tibetan Buddhist doctrine, of its factional distinctions and to transmit to the West, among the predicted \\"land of the red-skinned faces\\" in the age of iron, the dharma.That episode, rapidly told, appends the revised edition of this narrative. It concentrates on a rather matter-of-fact, stolid recital of how he was chosen as a \\"tulku,\\" a reincarnated lama, his entrance to the monastery, his education, countless visits to other foundations, more education, and careful wisdom. While this left me less satisfied, for its tone and style keeps you apart from the inherent interest in his spiritual formation and practical experience, it does provide a first-person report on traditional Tibetan inculcation.Lama Pega tells him how Buddhist teaching can never be theory alone, but must be tested by practice, self-examination of precepts, and reflection over the meaning. True faith emerges only after the Middle Way of moderation. \\"Knowledge must be tested in the same way as gold; first refined, then beaten and made smooth till it becomes the right colour and shows it is pure gold.\\" (98)Sadness, but not resignation, pervades this story as it follows Trungpa's coming of age in an increasingly embattled nation. As Marco Pallis explains in his forward, Trungpa conveys the incursion obliquely. It reflects how indirectly, by hearsay, rumor, distant report the natives heard of the coming of the Chinese. While this may cast a detached, fatalistic tone over the story told, it does express the slow infiltration of the occupiers that precedes their military and political conquest.He climbs \\"the holy Mt. Doti Gangkar,\\" where the founding guru Padmasambhava used to meditate twelve centuries before. Trungpa tells of its green and black lakes, and snowy summit. \\"The legend goes that in the Golden Age this snow never melted and shone like a diamond. In the following age it was like an onyx in which light and darkness are mixed. In the third age, however, it was to become like iron; everything would be dark and our time in Tibet would be over. When we reached the top of the mountain we found that the snow fields were melting and that great expanses of dark rock were showing.\\" (120) (One wonders, fifty-five years or so later, what the expanse now looks like after Chinese decimation and global warming.)About five years after the first occupation of the Communists, teenaged Trungpa is warned by Chentze Rinpoche, an elder lama: \\"You must look after and guide yourself, as in the future there will be no further teachers. A new era has begun in which the pure doctrine of the Lord Buddha lies in the hands of individuals; each one is separately responsible, for I do not think that we can carry on in the way we have done up till now. We can no longer rely on groups and communities. The situation is very serious, many of us are old, and perhaps it is young people like you, the new generation, who shall bear the burden.\\" (97)By his twentieth year, he bears many burdens. After hiding, he must flee the Communists as they turn to all-out war against a few determined Tibetan guerrillas. This picks up the pace, and the latter half of the book tells of the escape as he leads three hundred natives from the threat of imprisonment or death-- towards exile in India. He briskly tells of this poignant departure and dangerous flight. It ends with typical understatement; after recounting the fortunes of the survivors: \\"Nothing has been heard of Karma-tendzin, the Queen of Nangchen and her party, nor of Lama Urgyen's group of monks who went to the pilgrimage valley.\\" (249) The following page gives a poem that laments the nature of the Buddhist lesson of life's impermanence: \\"Mortal, yet once we enjoyed the masquerade;/ Now we see clearly all things perishing.\\""},{"Title":"Born in Tibet,","review":"Ch&ouml;gyam Trungpa (1939-1987) was a Buddhist meditation master, the eleventh Trungpa t&uuml;lku, as well as a poet and writer of books such asCutting Through Spiritual Materialism (Shambhala Library),Work, Sex, Money: Real Life on the Path of Mindfulness, etc. He established the Shambhala Meditation Centers, and died of complications related to his habitual very heavy consumption of alcohol. He notes in the \\"Acknowledgements\\" section of this 1966 book (revised in 1971), \\"This book was begun spontaneously as an authentic record of the wisdom and culture which existed in Tibet for so many centuries, and of the events of the last decade during which the Communists have destroyed everything its peace loving people held dear.\\"He recalls an early (1955) encounter with the visiting Dalai Lama, \\"We were beginning to lose heart, for the Communists were becoming so powerful; it seemed as if our happy days were coming to an end: however, the presence of His Holiness gave us renewed hope that the spiritual teaching and culture of Tibet would not be entirely swept away. Yet it was sad to see him looking so thin and strained as a result of the heavy burden he had to carry.\\" (Pg. 106) While escaping to India, he told his fellow escapees, \\"Our journey to India must be thought of as a pilgrimage; something that in the past few Tibetans have been able to make. Whether or not India has changed, the spiritual blessings imparted to that country by the presence of the Buddha remain... We should not be thinking only about the enemies threatening us from without. Each moment we should be aware of ourselves and of the forces of destruction that threaten each man from within.\\" (Pg. 208)He observes, \\"Evidently not to take life, not to steal or utter falsehoods, to abstain from unlawful sexual intercourse and from intoxicating liquors should be the rule of life for all Buddhists. However, if people are unable to keep the discipline of all these, there is a simpler form that they may take, which is to make a vow to adhere strictly to one or other chosen precept for a given time, and to make an effort to adhere to the others as far as possible.\\" (Pg. 131)He observed about the Jamg&ouml;n Kongtr&uuml;l, \\"[he] had incredibly precise insight when he dealt with people's minds... he had that kind of patience which permits other people to grow. His inspiring way of teaching allowed his disciples vast amounts of space and encouraged confidence in their own energy... For me the inspiration that he gave is so complete and unique that I have no further desire to hunt for another guru.\\" (Pg. 250)He admits, \\"Coming back to Britain, there was the question of whether to continue the experience of [wearing robes, etc.]. The hesitation was powerfully expressed in a car crash in May 1969 in which I was paralyzed on the left side. This led to my taking off the robe. The purpose of this was to gain for me personally the strength to continue teaching by unmasking, and also to do away with the 'exotic' externals which were too fascinating to students in the West.\\" (Pg. 252)Trungpa was a controversial figure; but this early book serves to illustrate why he quickly became such a popular spiritual teacher."},{"Title":"Born in Tibet,","review":"Opened some new insights into world history and Tibet and especially about Chogyam Thungpa, the Buddhist teacher who adapted to America instead of expecting Americans to adapt to him."},{"Title":"Lonely Planet Out to Eat London 2001 (Out to Eat Guides)","review":"I've spent a year in England and have made &#62;30 visits all together.Here are my reviews of the best guides....to meet you r exact needs.....I hope these are helpful and that you have a great visit!

When you get to be an old London hand, remember that the classic Londoners guide will always be an A to Z (zed) map and guide. If you want to go a bit beyond the central core of the city (perhaps to Windsor, Hampton, or further away) you really need the proper AtoZ to be able to find exact routes and streets.Time OutThe Time Out guides are very good.

This reader often found herself gasping, pulling the still-open book against her breast, knowing and afraid to venture into the inevitable plot events. Yet, except for a few unconnected thoughts and moments, this is a novel that involves the reader throughout and lingers in memory even years after the covers are finally closed"},{"Title":"Rima in the Weeds: A Novel","review":"What a wonderful read. The author gave a clear idea of what it felt like to grow up as a young woman in the 60s. It was an adventure, full of the heart-break of real events. The book pointed out that although life does not often have happy endings, some moments do. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and even read it twice, something I rarely do."},{"Title":"Rima in the Weeds: A Novel","review":"this is a good book that tells the story of two people who are not unalike. they both have problems and both face them and evetually conqure them. they become friends and help each other get through a tradjety that happened."},{"Title":"The Latino/a Condition: A Critical Reader","review":"This book answers a lot of questions about the Latino culture, experience, past, present and future. Some essays tell stories, while others are plain facts. This book has about 670 pages, yet it is a fast and informative read where you can't put the book down. It is organized by section of topic and gives suggested reading lists at the end of each chapter. A good introductory to Latin American studies, historically, culturally, and sociologically. It gives a lot of information for the price, you will not regret buying this book."},{"Title":"The Latino/a Condition: A Critical Reader","review":"Excellent book, but know in advance that this book is heavily skewed toward legal topics and lawyer authors. While much of the legal writing is dense for lay readers, it is often well worth the effort. The selections authored by Margaret Montoya, Kevin Johnson, editor Richard Delgado, and non-attorney Gloria Anzaldua were the very best of this remarkably well-written anthology."},{"Title":"Investigations Into Magic: Martin del Rio (Social and Cultural Values in Early Modern Europe)","review":"This is the first and only English translation of Martin Del Rio's famous treatise &quot;Disquisitionum Magicarum Libre Sex&quot;, a voluminous and comprehensive analysis of the occult, first printed in 1599. Del Rio (1551-1608) was a Jesuit priest and scholar who felt that Christianity was threatened by heresy from witches, alchemists, and sorcerers and wrote his encyclopedic tome as not only a thorough discussion on the various aspects of the occult, but as a practical guide for inquisitors and secular authorities to investigate, convict, and punish witches, sorcerers, and occultists in general. In a time when the Catholic Church was besieged on all sides by the perceived heresy of the Reformation, it is clear why Del Rio wrote this long account. The witchhunting craze was at its peak in Del Rio's time, and the populous was ripe with fear and superstition. The Church was struggling with it's own Counter-Reformation and looked to purge the church, and it's followers, of any lingering traces of paganism and non-orthodox elements. It is interesting to see to what lengths Del Rio goes to defend the sacred rituals of the Catholic Mass amid accusations by the Protestants that the very core of Catholicism was tainted by magic and paganism. He carefully sets out what constitutes what is Godly and divine in origin, and what is clearly diabolical and heretical in nature. This book was considered one of the definitive works on witchcraft and the occult for over 150 years and was used by ecclesiastical and secular courts to convict suspected witches. Del Rio himself takes his place next to other well-known anti-witch writers of his time such as Jean Bodin, Nicolas Remy, and Francesco Maria Guazzo. The book itself provides an interesting insight into the mind of the 16th century man amid the constant fear of Satan and his minions."},{"Title":"Phoenix: Therapeutic Patterns of Milton H. Erickson","review":"The book examines patterns in Dr. Erickson's creation, organization, and utilization of therapeutic interventions. What makes these patterns valuable is that they work - if you learn and use them you will be able to reproduce in your own therapeutic work many of the seemingly magical outcomes that are characteristic of Erickson's work."},{"Title":"Phoenix: Therapeutic Patterns of Milton H. Erickson","review":"David Gordon has written a book that seems to have done something the others on this same subject have not; he has made the basic patterns of Milton Erickson very EASY to duplicate and USE. While I doubt that simply reading and using this book will creat Erickson clones, the patterns Gordon presents WILL allow you to use your own abilities to the fullest. An enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Phoenix: Therapeutic Patterns of Milton H. Erickson","review":"So many hypnosis, Erickson and NLP books are stuck on techniques. Well tools only work as well as you know what to do with them. David Gordon does a nice job of approaching the topic from a different angle, the when, why and how to effectively create change.

It is interesting how Erickson's work get interpreted from the particular IR of the various authors who have written about it."},{"Title":"Phoenix: Therapeutic Patterns of Milton H. Erickson","review":"Milton doesn't put people into a trance all the time, many times he just uses it ability to establish rapport and asks the client to do something.

If you want to help me this is what I'm doing: I will mail a letter a day to the Ballantine/Fawcet press asking that they publish The Secret of the Unicorn Queen Series. I will say that there is a genuine need for these books and that they will sell. In order to prove the high demand for these books it would be great to have other people send in letters too. Anyone who is interested can e-mail me (it's a hotmail account with my name) or just write and mail a letter.

I have all six books and even though it's been ten years since I first devoured them, I've kept them and cherish them. The Dark Gods is my personal favorite out of the entire series. The images the book creates are so vivid you feel as if you're right there in the fantasy world of Arren, riding unicorns and using your warrior skills to save them from an evil wizard. It's a shame these books are now out of print. They were excellent reading and I know there are plenty of people who would love for this series to be reissued."},{"Title":"An Anthology of Contemporary Russian Women Poets","review":"If you buy a book of poetry a year you should probably consider this. In her 2004 foreword to Tatiana Shcherbina's Life Without, Sasha Dugdale claimed Russian women poets were 'relatively few' and excessively 'feminine'. Huh! And what's the anti-woman animus all about? Sveta Litvak is domestic - and charmingly so. This spin-off from a 2002 issue of Modern Poetry in Translation, itself impressive, is a labour of love by Weissborts Mr and Mrs.Dina Gatina's 'My eyes are..' particularly appeals, and Inna Kabysh's woman making jam in July, Inna Lisnianskaya addressing her computer ('why have you come to trouble/my last days?') but there's a whole world to explore. Stand-out names not found in MPT include Belchenko, Goralik, Gorenko, Kostyleva, Malanova ('Many films begin with a funeral/For one has to start somewhere') and Weissbort's own selection from Gorbanevskaya has been overhauled, butI was sorry not to find Yunna Morits, originator of the aphorism 'the unit of female power in Russian poetry is one akhmatsvet', who - like, famously, Elizabeth Bishop - asked to be excluded from an all-female grouping. You'll have to see MPT #20 for her, including an interview. Ushakovs and Zubova also fail to make the cut.As I said of Weissbort's and John Glad's 20th Century Russian Poetry, the translators and translations have been hand-picked, and it would surely be invidious to name any, though I have already commended Weissbort's own versions of Regina Derieva, published too late for inclusion here. One does wonder quite what proportion of these names are Jewish - high, on the evidence; but was it not Tsvetaeva who said all poets were Yids? Maybe the Jewish Quarterly (or American equivalent) might care to address the topic?"},{"Title":"Lost Paradise: Book One","review":"Don't read this book unless you're prepared to read the sequel. As the title says, this is Part I and the story isn't finished. Once you read this book though, you'll want to read the next installment. The book is about Kris, a world famous stuntwoman, and Nicole, who is working as a gopher on a picture Nicole's uncle is helping to direct. Nicole is kind,bubbly and willing to help everybody, which is why the quiet, withdrawn Kris is drawn to her. Nicole has a dark secret in her private life though and it threatens any happiness she might have with Kris. The book is well written and draws you in with the characters. The ending definitely leaves you hanging though as you wonder if these two lovers can ever work things out. The author has a web site where she has posted several stories about these two. If you like the book, and you will, you might want to check out the site."},{"Title":"Lost Paradise: Book One","review":"I could not put this book down. The characters were well developed and believeable which is not always the case. I would recommend that you purchase the sequal (Daredeveil Hearts)with this book. I stayed up late one night to finish the book and when I came to the end I was left hanging. I ordered the squal the very next morning!"},{"Title":"Lost Paradise: Book One","review":"Kristina and Nicole...meant for each other in every way. This book tells he story of love lost and found, with a surprising ending. You'll find yourself lost in the characters, lost in the story and lost in the love. Do yourself a favor and get lost in Lost Paradise."},{"Title":"Radulfi Nigri Chronica. The Chronicles of Ralph Niger. Edited by Lieutenant-Colonel Robert Anstruther","review":"Ralph Niger (c. 1140-1200) was an Anglo-French theologian and historian born near Bury St Edmund's who wrote two chronicles (both of which are included in the original LATIN without translation) in this volume. The first chronicle, covers history from Creation till 1199 while the second, covers the deeds of the French, English, and German kings until 1206 (perhaps another writer added to the Ralph's chronicle). Ralph sided with Archbishop Becket during the strife with Henry II and as a result evoked the ire of the King.This volume is a reprint of one of many volumes of primary sources put out by the Caxton Society. This is Volume XIII from 1851. Considering the time period, the introduction is seriously lacking in information regarding the author, his style, and his subject matter. The 1850s was a period of great revival of interest in the Medieval West so this is excusable, however, since this is a reprint with a new editor it is inexcusable that a more suitable introduction was not included. An illustration of the general absence of information is the lack of the authors dates of birth and death. However, the list of Ralph's Theological and historical works is greatly appreciated. The footnotes in the Latin text section are helpful and illuminating while the Latin itself is relatively straight forward and easy. Although the beginning of the first Chronicle, from Creation till 1199, is labeled rather dismissively in the footnotes as \\"prefatory portions... generally omitted by editors\\" this edition includes this important section. Ralph includes in his general history fascinating apocryphal stories of Simon Magus' \\"conversion\\" of Emperor Nero and his competition with the Apostles. These stories are usually found in Eastern sources. Overall, this edition contains two rather minor chronicles which are really only for the Medieval specialist or someone wanting to brush up (in an esoteric way) on their Medieval Latin. I repeat, the TEXT is in LATIN with NO translation."},{"Title":"\\"Billboard\\" Book of Top 40 Albums","review":"I picked up this book hoping to find out what other albums were on the charts at the same time as the Beatles, but &quot;The Billboard Book of Top 40 Albums&quot; is not laid out that way. Instead it provides an alphabetical listing, by artist, of all albums to make the Top 40 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; pop charts from January 8, 1955 to June 30, 1990. Actually, when the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart began it had just the 15 Best-Selling Popular Albums, which expanded to 25 in 1957, and went to 50 Best-Selling Monophonic and 30 Best-Selling Stereophonic LPs in 1959 (separate Mono and Stereo charts were published through late 1963). In 1967 the list was expanded to the Top 200 albums. So what you will find in here are all of the artists who produced those albums, from ABBA to ZZ Top. Throughout this section there are also over 150 photographs of Top 40 album jackets from Dayton Allen's &quot;Why Not!&quot; (he was a comedian on Steve Allen's TV show) to Frank Zappa's &quot;Apostrophe(')&quot; (which featured the song &quot;Don't Eat the Yellow Snow&quot;).In the back of the book Joel Whitburn has a section on The Record Holders, which has over a dozen lists that cover The Top 100 Artists of the Rock Era and an Indez to Albums of Longevity. If you want to know who has had the most number one albums (the Beatles), the most Top 10 albums (Frank Sinatra), or the album that has spent the most time at #1 (&quot;West Side Story&quot; soundtrack), then this is the book for you. For each album you get the date the album debuted in the Top 40, the album's highest charted position (with ow many total weeks the album held the No. 1 and No. 2 positions in parentheses), total weeks charted in the Top 40, and the original album label and number. There are brief descriptions of each group, including members, type of music they played, and other information of note. Basically this should let you know if this reference book would be of interest or help to you."},{"Title":"\\"Billboard\\" Book of Top 40 Albums","review":"Simply put, I truly love my vinyl LP collection. From the album cover art work to the superb sound (compared to the diminished highs and lows of a CD), they are a joy. The Billboard Book of Top 40 Albums fulfills my need to know more about my favorite music, groups and individuals. It is chock full of fun tidbits, history of music and much more. I continually enjoy referencing this book as I listen to my music."},{"Title":"\\"Billboard\\" Book of Top 40 Albums","review":"I am surprised there hasn't been an edition after the 3rd, which only goes from 1955 up to 1994! This is a wonderful book. I had hoped there would be another edition, but it doesn't look like it's happening. Like the Top 40 singles book, it lists each artist's top 40 album with all the quick and easy information you need to settle an argument or clear one's vague memory."},{"Title":"The Old Scofield Study Bible, KJV, Standard Edition","review":"The Old Scofield Leather KJV Bible was exactly what I was looking for.It is in beautiful condition and I could not be happier."},{"Title":"The Old Scofield Study Bible, KJV, Standard Edition","review":"I have seen and used many Bibles and truly feel this one is an excellent choice for the serious Bible student.

I love the large print, even the notes and footnotes are easier to read. The pages are easy to turn and the concordance, chain reference and maps in the back are very useful. I also like the wide page margins for writing notes. the only issue with this Bible that I have is its size. It's 10 1/2in high X 1 1/2in thick X 7 3/4in across. I'm having a very difficult time finding a nice (leather or good quality cordora nylon) Bible/book cover for it. I usually have to carry it in a portfolio with a shoulder strap to protect it. But the advantage of still being able to read it if I forget my glasses when I go to church outweighs any problems carrying my portfolio. However, I also carry my other notepads, pens, etc., in the portfolio, too."},{"Title":"The Old Scofield Study Bible, KJV, Standard Edition","review":"It is a Scofield so can I say more.

I love the KJV and I am a sort of history fanatic. I really enjoy the notes from Scofield dating back to the early 1900's. Fascinating to see how God's Word is the same yesterday, today, and forever. The large print is great and easy to read, with the words of Christ in red in the New Testement. It has book dividers built into the fore edge for quick location and the pages are made of a type of paper that i know will last longer than i will probably live. The cover is made of a durable leather, strong and flexible, and when you carry it you know that you purchased quality. I am so blessed to have this Bible. I know that it will be an amazing tool to help me lead people to salvation in Jesus Christ! After all, that is why I purchased it to begin with. You wont be dissapointed if you order this Bible. It's beautiful and I would recommend it to anyone. However I would suggest an easier translation geared toward our modern day coversation if you are a beginner to the Word of God, because frankly no one speaks like that anymore. But once you are familiar to the KJV it flows like a work of art from God. Bless you in your search."},{"Title":"The Old Scofield Study Bible, KJV, Standard Edition","review":"While I own different \\"versions\\" of the Bible, the most reliable is the KJV without a doubt. 98% of the KJV is translated from the Greek and Hebrew, with only 2% from Latin....therefore it's great reliability is obvious. Some complain they cannot understand the beautiful language style of the KJV, but when you know the \\"Author\\" Personally you are assured that the Holy Spirit WILL lead you into ALL truth.The Old Schofield is reliable, except for his notes concerning the beginning of the true church of Jesus Christ. The True Church of Jesus did NOT begin on the day of Pentecost; but rather started at the time Jesus himself called out His disciples. Both church ordinances of Baptism and Lord's Supper had already taken place prior to Pentecost. The True Church of Jesus Christ that was already in exsistance, was empowered, not started on the day of Pentecost.Other than that small disagreement, I find the OLD Schofield KJV Bible to be a most reliable Bible for novice and elder in the faith alike.

I highly reccommend it to others as well"},{"Title":"The Old Scofield Study Bible, KJV, Standard Edition","review":"I have no comments on the actual substance of this book. The contents of the Scofield Bible are well-known enough to anyone searching for it, and the 1917 version appears to have stood the test of time.The makers of this version, however, have not done users any favors in its assembly. This feels about like a bible you'd find in a drawer in a cheap motel. The cover is hard but very light, the binding is cheap, and mine came with a number of deformities, including but not limited to folded pages, off-center pages, pages whose corners were actually sewn into the spine, and poorly cut pages. The pages themselves are also thin, but I expect this from any bible, so no harm there.If I had it to do over again, I'd definitely look to pay a little more for a more solid version of this book. For my intents and purposes, I don't dislike this enough to return it, but if it were going to be seeing more regular use at my house, I'd certainly be looking to swap it out for something more permanent."},{"Title":"The Old Scofield Study Bible, KJV, Standard Edition","review":"It is a nice finish but the corner of the bible bend very quickly.

Let me be honest right from the start by saying that God's Word does not make any sense unless it is understood with a dispensational perspective. Anything less than that, and your stuck with a Bible that contradicts itself all over the place. All a believer has to do is allow God's Word to interpret itself, instead of listening to the so-called scholars of higher Christian education. They are the main reason for the Laodicean apostasy we find ourselves in today. Scofield did a good job at letting God's Book speak for itself. I have discovered by experience that most of the study bibles out there on the market today are filled with nothing but the authors private interpretation of the scriptures. What's so difficult about just believing what God's Word says, and not adding your own thoughts to it. The Scofield Study Bible does have it's weaknesses on certain passages, but overall it surpasses any other study bible currently out there. With all due respect, people that haven't discovered this have never really searched and studied the Book &quot;with their hearts&quot; well enough to make any worthwhile comment on the subject. Given the choice, I choose to listen and trust God's Word, and not the liberal Christian scholars. Ahhh, there's nothing like a King James Bible to clear up a college education."},{"Title":"The Old Scofield Study Bible, KJV, Standard Edition","review":"The small-sized version of Oxford's Old Scofield bible is a perfect blend of portability and scholarship.

I. Scofield. Although this Bible was published in the early 1900's, it's footnotes are a great help in understaning the Word of God. I've often said that when I get to Heaven, after I meet Jesus face to face (I've already met him through the new birth), and see my mom and dad, I want to meet C. I. Scofield and tell him how much his notes have helped me in understanding God's word.One piece of advice I would give to anyone thinking about buying this Bible: Get the King James Version... it's most accuarte. If you look at the NIV it removes many verses about the Blood of Christ (our only means of salvation).Buy the (King James Version) Scofield Study Bible today and be on your way to a deeper understanding of God's Holy Word"},{"Title":"The Old Scofield Study Bible, KJV, Standard Edition","review":"I love this large print Scofield Bible!

I'm sure you won't be sorry!"},{"Title":"The Old Scofield Study Bible, KJV, Standard Edition","review":"The Scofield study bible has useful, and in some ways unique features, which enhance the King James or Authorised version of the bible. Scofield had a problem in that at the time of writing he knew that the KJV was not the best text available. New Hebrew and Greek biblical documents had been discovered since 1611, and textual criticism had advanced greatly. However, Scofield manages to preserve the universally recognised beauty of the Authorized whilst enhancing the textual accuracy at vital points with in-line glosses (word or phrase substitutions), with the original King James text moved to the margin. These glosses are indicated by a pair of vertical line | like this |. A good example of this is found in John chapter 1, verse 12: the phrase 'sons of God' is rendered as 'children of God'. This had the double virtue of being a more accurate translation of the Greek 'tekna theou', and is also gender-neutral - politically correct before his time! An Old Testament example would be Ex. 20 v.13, the well known 'Thou shalt not kill'. Here 'kill' is footnoted, and there is a one sentence explanation that, while there are several Hebrew words for 'kill', this instance means 'murder' as it has our modern legal sense of unlawful premeditated killing.Other features include doctrinal summaries in the form of extended footnotes on the great themes of scripture, such as the section in John's gospel on grace. I think these are best described as conceptually rich and information dense. The coherence of the Old to New Testament sweep is such that several sermons or bible studies could be culled from any one of these summaries. Their usefulness in personal study is immense and sometimes saves the cost of a specialist reference book. The chain reference system enables one to follow a very extensive line of thought from the first bible occurrence of a word or concept through to the last. There are useful organised expositions of Judaistic culture, worldview, and thought habits. An excellent example of this would be the handling of the Hebraic habits of naming and word play (I don't call them 'puns'). One of the most potent of these is his analysis of the Names of God, from Elohim to 'Alpha and Omega'.Having said all I have to say in a laudatory vein, I have to add that sometimes Scofield's conciseness is too clipped for his own good. He gives cut-and-dried answers to things which would be better handled as 'maybe this, or maybe that', and this is guaranteed to irritate the true scholar at times. He can also make comments which are so text-critically controversial that he would be better off passing over them in silence, an example of this would be the four line footnote on the 'woman taken in adultery' in John chapter 8. But buy it and not regret it is my only advice."},{"Title":"The Old Scofield Study Bible, KJV, Standard Edition","review":"I got the New Scofield NIV pretty much the moment it came out. It was my first &quot;real&quot; bible. I had a couple of cheap $5.00 paperbacks, but not a true study bible. This was the first one I ever read cover-to-cover, Genesis 1:1 to Revelations 22:21. It was a tremendous benefit to me, and has become my favorite Study Bible once again recently (now that I'm entering Fuller TS).With that said, this is a better Study Bible for an advanced student than for a beginer. It's conservative in terms of footnoting. Many pages have no footnotes. However, each note provided contains a serious theological meat. Pure meat no filler. The cross-reference system is also the best and most advanced I've ever seen (I like it better than Thompson's).I don't agree completely with the classic dispensational theology, and I don't agree completely with the NIV translators, but with that said, this is probably the best overall study system on the market."},{"Title":"The Old Scofield Study Bible, KJV, Standard Edition","review":"Scofield's study notes were one of the few that late great J.Vernon McGee esteemed.

AsburyI own just about every KJV Study Bible available. I also study my Bible at least 3-5 hours everyday easy. Besides the King James Study Bible by Thomas Nelson, and the KJV Thompson Chain Bible, the Old Scofield Study Bible will always be the no-nonsense Study Bible with real meat and potatoes. So so so many others have tidbits of info that I could care a less about. Publishers fill up a big book full of boring stuff, that has very little spiritual information. That is also how you can tell the difference between the editor, and consulting editors that are lost, and the ones that aren't. Between true born again believers doing the editing, vs. a company just trying to make a product that will sell in the stores, and is attractive to prospective customers. Most times, stuff Bibles are for the people that love stuff, but don't know the deference between spiritual things, and just stuff. The buyers that do buy the OSSB, are usually serious studiers of God's Word.Personally, I take Psalms 1:1 very serious. Why on earth would I want to read some lost editor from Harvard explain, or define an important doctrine such as Salvation, when he might not even know the Lord Jesus Himself. With C.I. Scofield you can't go wrong. You know what you're getting. Hands down! It's the good stuff. Scofield was a Born Again Believer. If D.L. Moody hired him back in day, thats good enough for me. Plus his other books, like, \\"Rightly Dividing the Word of Truth\\", has helped millions of people around the globe.On the other hand, you could have 21 contributing editors, and all of them have more Ph'D's than Dr. Phil. Hey, how would you like to have a Study Bible with Dr. Phil as one of the contributing authors? Mix a little psychology, and power of positive thinking(New Age) with the Word. Create some apostate religion beside what God says is good enough. See where I'm going with this? A Dr. Phil Study Bible? The way this world is going, it could happen one day in the near future. Check out II Tim 4:3,4. And then look at some of the so called big shots on T.V. and you'll find plenty of cotton candy preaching, no scracth that, not preaching at all. Teaching of positive thinking, etc., and then maybe II Tim 4:3,4 will make more since to you. We need the kind of preaching like grand ma, and grand pa used to have! Something that we can build a solid foundation on, that will last, and last.Most of the people that buy big bibles with a bunch of stuff in it that you'll never use, also have closets in their house, or even attics, and garages filled with junk. Stuff they will never use again, but for some reason they can't throw it away. Just Stuff! Sometimes stuff that has no value. Just Stuff! So do you want the meat and potatoes, or just stuff?Some people think that because their Bible has more cool stuff,like the best maps, measuring charts, a special section on Greek and Hebrew, 5000 word concordance and on and on, until you need to put wheels on the bottom of your Bible just to pull it into the Church. And most of the info is regular, basic stuff including other trivial snacks, and stuff, stuff, and more stuff. Lots of stuff geeks like.By the way, the definition of stuff is: writing, talk, or ideas of very little or transitory worth. I got that definition from a Study Bible that I no longer use, other than the Old , not New, Scofield Study Bible. Oh, and if you really want a good side kick with extra solid Biblical information, then purchase Nelson's KJV Bible Commentary. You can order it online for around $20. It's a goldmine for that price.Enjoy studing the Word and God Bless. - CA - II Tim 2:15 -"},{"Title":"The Old Scofield Study Bible, KJV, Standard Edition","review":"While I have the KJV, the ASV, the Moffatt, and several others I've found the Scofield Reference Study Bible the most helpful.

This is the only way you are able to rightly divide the word, as Scofield would say.I also own a copy of the old Scofield 1909 edition as well as the NIV Scofield, and let me tell you that Scofield's notes and his essays helped open a whole new world of understanding God's word. Until I learned to stop mixing law and grace, the Old Testament (Covenant) with the New Testament (Covenant), the Gospels (part of the Old Covenant) with the Epistles (New Covenant), I didn't know exactly where I stood with God.--&quot;Was I still under the condemnations of the Old Testament?&quot; But praise God for CI Scofield and dispensationalists like him; he opened the door of understanding and knowledge of the whats, hows, whys, and wherefores, of how to rightly divide the Bible, and yet how it all fits together.I have to hand it to Oxford. I am impressed with the quality and workmanship of my Scofield (NIV). Mine is black genuine leather, and everything from the high quality handsewn (smyth sewn) binding to the excellent quality paper make this a top of the line Bible. And yet if I had chosen a Thompson or a Ryrie or even a Cambridge Bible of comparable quality they would cost quite a bit more; sometimes 20 dollars to even 50 dollars more.Something else: some people criticize the NIV--and unjustly. The NIV is a very accurate and faithful version that has relied on the earliest and best manuscripts of the Bible. Some critics (usually the KJV only crowd) have accused the NIV translators and editors of leaving out certain verses of the Bible that appear in earlier versions. The NIV editors are perfectly justified in doing so since these verses in question never appear in the most reliable and ancient manuscripts. These verses were probably inadvertantly added in translations over the centuries. BTW, I don't hear the NIV fans attack the KJV only people for having verses in their Bibles that were added and don't appear in the ancient Greek manuscripts."},{"Title":"The Old Scofield Study Bible, KJV, Standard Edition","review":"The only reason I gave it 2 stars is becuase Scofield gave it an honest try but, comes up short.

So if you into traditions this could be for you.

This Bible does not seem to suffer that."},{"Title":"The Old Scofield Study Bible, KJV, Standard Edition","review":"I own and use the NIV, NASB, NKJV, RSV and NRSV study Bibles and three Life Amplification Bibles. While each of these Study Bibles have their individual strengths and weaknesses, all are indeed helpful in understanding the everlasting messages given to us from God. It is not my intention to critique each version in detail. My purpose for this review is to, hopefully, add some information a first time Study Bible buyer might find useful.Of the Study and Life Amplification Bibles I own, Dr. Scofield's is my personal favorite for several reasons. I will briefly describe those reasons.A] Some Study Bibles somewhat overwhelm the reader with information while others are far too abbreviated. Since the foregoing statement is a personal opinion, I will not name the too much and too little Study Bibles. I do not want to add more confusion to a selection so important to one's spiritual growth. Dr. Scofield's essays, commentaries and explanations are an excellent middle ground to the above listed pros and cons.B] All study expositions are thoughtfully placed on the same page - bottom - of the passages they refer to. As way of example, Dr. Scofield lists the Greek, Aramaic and Hebrew words that can have more than one translation and tells the reader the possible meanings of the translations. However, Dr. Scofield does not restrict his commentary to semantics. He also explains difficult passages and gives details about customs and life in Biblical times. Other Study Bibles do this also but Dr. Scofield's approach is far more \\"down to earth\\" and in clear language.C] The center column cross-references are exceptional. The first to last listing of a particular word or idea is cross-referenced so the reader can easily go back or forward to see each reference. This is very useful in understanding the growth of God's plan for us.I own the NKJV and the KJV. The NKJV of Dr. Scofield' New Study Bible does not have his original notes and comments. I find the study notes in the NJKV scanty compared the original KJV.Finally, a comment about the various Bible versions. The NIV, NASB, RSV, NSRV, et al are in today's English. Some people find these versions easier to read and some say the KJV is difficult to read. Others claim the KJV is inaccurate. True, we now have more documents than the translators in the 1600s BUT the message is still the same. I, personally, prefer the KJV to all others. I will read a couple chapters in the today's versions and stop. That is not the case with the old KJV. I will read an entire chapter at one sitting. The reason is the beauty of the English of the time King James commissioned the translation. Yes, there are words we no longer use like thee, thou, art, and verb endings like dost and commeth. To me, that is the sheer poetic beauty of the language. The Old English has a lyrical flow that is a pleasure to read. I could compare the Old English to reading Italian opposed to Russian.The KJV Old Scofield Study Bible is an excellent choice for those beginning to study God's word and those who are more advanced. Oxford University Press does a superior job in printing and binding. My copy is genuine leather and indexed. I am very pleased with my purchase and would not hesitate to buy this Bible again."},{"Title":"The Old Scofield Study Bible, KJV, Standard Edition","review":"It took twenty six years, but my first copy is literally worn out, and another is the only acceptable replacement.

I have the same feelings for the Ryrie Study Bible. Scofield is the way to go and Oxford Press offers a high quality Bible at a good price.

C.I. Scofield died in 1921. The New Scofield was put together in 1967 by an independant committee. They added numerous notes that certainly would not have agreed with Dr. Scofield. Example: Acts 8:12- They talk about baptism being not only done by immersion, but by sprinking and pouring. The KJB explains that true water baptism is by immersion only. They also mess with the KJV text by adding double meanings that are different from the Old Scofield Bible.

Although text critical scholarship may have moved on, the basics of a book that has lasted millenia do not change in a mere century. As chief editor to the combined bible, commentary, and chain reference Scofield provides the basics - and more - very well indeed. I have found nothing quite so precise, so concise, and nothing displaying such moderation and common sense, all couched in a style with a minimal jargon.For the Old Testament there is a one-page introduction to the Pentateuch, the historical books, the poetic and wisdom books, and the prophetic books. For example, there is a description of the key technique of Hebrew poetry (parallelism of thought) in the introduction to the poetical and wisdom books. The basic variations on this technique are demonstrated with great clarity and economy. For the New Testament there is an introduction to the gospels, the epistles of Paul, and the general epistles.One of my most loved features is the concise concordance at the back, which is compiled with an eclectic brilliance. Some of the footnotes are small masterpieces of exposition, some push concepts such as typology much too far. But I do not suppose Scofield would have declared this work to be perfect, or incapable of being usefully updated."},{"Title":"The Old Scofield Study Bible, KJV, Standard Edition","review":"Just like his correspondence course administered by the Moody Bible Institute, Scofield, in this Bible, has proven to be a reliable source of bibilical interpretation and reference that is faithful to the fundamentals of Christianity.

In today's religious culture with every study Bible imaginable, Scofield still speaks to the serious theological student wanting to rightly divide the word of God. Be aware it is Dispensational [God working in time periods through history in different ways with different expectations] in approach, but not offensively. The quality of this Bible cannot be overstated: the paper, print, quality of materials, durability, binding and overall presentation [Oxford University Press]. Well worth twice the price. Scofield shines in his prophetic and historic commentaries. Evangelical churches in America anyway seem to be fading theologically in favor of programming and worship, so get this information while it is still easily available!"},{"Title":"The Old Scofield Study Bible, KJV, Standard Edition","review":"C.I. Scofield's notes are written from a dispensational approach to theology. It is based on a belief in a historical/gramatical approach to the Bible. Many would say it is a system helps make sense out of Scripture. I agree. Understanding the difference between Israel and the Church and that God administered His faith/grace relationship with people differently throughout human history is clearly taught in these wonderful notes. Some of the material is obviously outdated because of new discoveries in archeology and science. However, the basic notes on the biblical covenants and prophesy are as rich today as the day they were written.This is a wonderful Bible for people who are trying to make sense out of the Bible.Thank you Dr. Scofield, Oxford Press and Philadelphia College of Bible."},{"Title":"The Old Scofield Study Bible, KJV, Standard Edition","review":"While the above author tried to come from an intellectual standpont, he made his true intellect known by his comments. Being a serious bible student schooled in both the liberal and conservative schools I have found Scofield's notes to have passed the test of time. This cannot be said of liberal higher criticism, which has so enthralled itself in &quot;theology (if it may even be called that anymore)&quot; ,that it has smeared the name of Christ in the dirt. This bible presents a normal literal approach to interpreting the scriptures, and correctly exegetes the scriptures in comparison to the modern eisegesis of it's liberal counterparts. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Successful Coaching Manager","review":"I bought this book after hearing the author speak at a sales meeting. What drove me to buy it was the author's passion for coaching in management and within this book he really outlines how coaching can help managers to build and develop not only their direct reports but their teams as well.I am not a great book reader , and I detest large management or business books that are full of theory, so I was at first sceptical if this book would be any different. It is! Yes, there is theory but what I liked was that the author has backed this theory up with real life examples of where the theory can work and where there can be challenges. I actually found some of it quite humerous and also I liked the honesty with which the author writes particularly about his own management failings.Overall, a good book for all managers to have a look at. I know quite a few who could learn from it!"},{"Title":"The Art and Practice of Argumentation and Debate","review":"Debating is exciting, but the coaching or teaching of it is rather difficult to do. There are so many boring books on the subject, but Hill's book is not. It is straight forward, and while Canada does use a different format now, the basics are still basics. There are very few points that are completely NOT applicable to Canadian Debating, but in sharp contrast many points are fully applicable.fThis was a very good resource, but as you can see from another review, I do have a favourite. But, if you can afford a few books on debate in your library, this should be one as well."},{"Title":"I'll Grant You That: A Step-by-Step Guide to Finding Funds, Designing Winning Projects, and Writing Powerful Grant Proposals","review":"I read the reviews of so many books before I picked this one and I am so glad that I did!

The book follows a ficticious family thru the year 1843 and allows you to learn with your children what life on the homestead was like, including crafts, recipes, games and more. I would recommend it to homeschoolers especially as a good source for pioneer study. It has a good bibliography in the back for additional readings on the time period, including the LITTLE HOUSE ON THE PRAIRIE series. If you are hooked with this style of learning, there are other titles in this series (AMERICAN KIDS IN HISTORY) with which you may continue your study of American History."},{"Title":"Pioneer Days: Discover the Past with Fun Projects, Games, Activities, and Recipes","review":"Apologies--I haven't read this book yet, but I had to say something about this point. While Wiley & Son's activity & craft books are generally outstanding, there is a potentially serious problem with this one. The Hopi and Navajo activities included here should be handled with extreme care.Hopi kachina dolls and Navajo sand paintings are both sacred items in their cultural context. While they are commonly promoted as tourist items and (wrongly) as appropriate \\"multi-cultural\\" activities for children, a settler in the southwest in 1843 would most likely *not* have encountered them unless they were actively involved with the Hopi or Navajo to the extent of becoming tribal members active in the Hopi or Navajo religions.Kachinas are deities for the Hopi, interceding between humans and higher powers along the same lines as Catholic saints. Kachina dolls are representations of the kachinas, given to children to teach them about the different spirits, what they wear and how they act. The kachina spirits spend half of each year living among the Hopi villagers in the form of costumed dancers, in a cycle of often playful but still sacred festivals.Navajo sand paintings are sacred components of healing ceremonies, which can last several nights (the length depending on which ceremony it is). The painting is made near the beginning of the ceremony, as a map for the spiritual journey the person will undergo, and is erased at the end.White settlers in the Southwest might have seen Hopi kachina dolls held by children, and might have witnessed Hopi kachina dances (probably from a distance); but Navajo sand paintings they would *not* have seen unless they were part of a healing ceremony.If you use the Native American sections of this book, please do so only with the understanding of the sacred nature of these activities, with proper respect for their meaning. Do a little more research, and make sure both you and the children grasp the nature of the belief systems that Hopi kachinas and Navajo sand paintings represent. To do these activities with your kids is a little like playing at making Catholic communion bread and having a mock Eucharist ceremony.Thanks for reading!"},{"Title":"Pioneer Days: Discover the Past with Fun Projects, Games, Activities, and Recipes","review":"homeschooling about the west.

The meaning of the cards are well expressed in the pictures.Truly one of a kind. Most tarot decks have blaise borders and pale colors. Not this one. Each picture is artfully done. On top of that the picture dominates the entire card, there is no border, so the card really stands out.The only negative is the plain blue with white stars back. With such a beautiful face the backing is somewhat of a dissappointment."},{"Title":"Morgan Greer Tarot Deck English","review":"I have had this deck since its original date of publication (1988), and it's been the best set I've come across yet. The illustrations are poignant, beautiful, and rich with color. The cards are soul-inspiring and very appealing to both the beginner and the expert tarot reader. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Morgan Greer Tarot Deck English","review":"I reckon the Morgan-Greer is the best Rider-Waite clone ever published; even surpassing the latter in several respects. For starters, the cards are borderless which imparts a feeling of expansiveness, and of nothing being wasted. (Contrast this with the big, wasteful borders of the New Palladini deck!) Also, its people look like real people: the men are down-to-earth attractive, and the women - buxomly curvaceous. None of that pathetic waifish, pixie-ish, anorexic visages which plague many modern Tarot decks. The pip scenes are also very well done: several of them actually improve on their original Waite-predecessors; and the cards' lack of borders assist in this achievement.Some readers may complain that this deck looks \\"ugly\\", but they should re-evaluate it in the right context. not only does the Morgan-Greer capture the epoch of the 70s era succinctly, but also, its color schemes conform to a carefully-thought-out, esoteric plan. It is a nicely-executed memoir of a bygone Golden Era."},{"Title":"Morgan Greer Tarot Deck English","review":"I couldn't decide between this deck or Robin Wood....well....I got the Robin Wood first and was soooo disappointed. Everyone is super happy, dimpled and \\"too\\" pretty. The colours seem just washed out and weak, and some of the cards look downright silly and cheesy.7 of Wands spring to mind. The Wheel of Fortune is the worst I have seen in any deck, it's so bad it is hard to look at. I had high hopes, but when I got it in my hands, wow what a let down.Then I got the Morgan-Greer. WOW. From the minute I took it out I was in love and enraptured. The saturated colours, no borders and unusual classic artwork drew me into what seems a world of it's very own. When I take out this deck (just like Tarot of the Old Path) it is as if I am entering and being enveloped in a different world. The pictures seem simple, yet there is so much going on, much symbolism to find hidden. Laying the cards out side by side is powerful. A story naturally unfolds and blends one into another. And one thing I discovered a few days ago was how different the cards look in darker light. The use of colours and richness of them have a unique power in this deck, very mystical.I myself was worried that the star backs which recieve so many complaints were going to be a drawback, but upon seeing them I loved those as well. Random hand-drawn stars are much more enticing than just perfect ones. The only thing I can think of to improve the deck would be a different darker colour for the back. A rich purple or forest green.These cards must be seen in person too get the full impact of the deep, evocative colours and intense gorgeous artwork. This deck has been around 28 years for a reason....it's a classic that speaks to the inner, quiet center of a person and captures you in it's magic."},{"Title":"Morgan Greer Tarot Deck English","review":"This a true classic as far as tarot decks go. I worked with this deck for many years. It was also the first deck that I used to learn of the symbolism of the tarot. Many use the Rider-Waite for that purpose, but I have never been able to work with that deck much, because I do not like it's imagery - it doesn't speak to me psychically. Instead I love the imagery of the Margan-Greer deck: so bold, so passionate, the energy of the cards just jumps in your lap (and all the tarot symbols is still there). As an intuitive, I seem to work better with cards with either very dreamy or very bold imagery. These cards work very well for me.The cards' quality is very good. They shuffle well and they are very durable. The cards are printed on good quality materials that enhance the power of the artwork. If you a looking for a good quality and powerful tarot deck with all the traditional tarot symbolism in place, you will most certainly enjoy this deck!"},{"Title":"Morgan Greer Tarot Deck English","review":"I bought this deck, having used it for online readings. There are many wonderful qualities about it: the artwork is divine, the images are borderless, the cards are good quality. My beef is the color. As others have pointed out, it is saturated, which if the color balance is correct, is a good thing. However, the color balance is way off, veering drastically to a yellowish hue, accentuated even more by the saturation. For those not too particular on this point, these cards may be your perfect match. For my eyes, though, this imbalance in color is distracting. As much as I love the artwork, this unfortunate flaw keeps me from using this deck."},{"Title":"Morgan Greer Tarot Deck English","review":"I like the Morgan Greer Tarot Deck very much. The illustrations are rich in color and spread to the edges of the cards, giving it a very appealing look. The art is a little bit on the '70s end of things, but it's not too bad, and the imagery sticks pretty close to the RWS standard. Some images have been cropped from the traditional pictures, which works better in some cases than others. Several cards - the Tower, the Devil, the aces - are really attractive or gripping. The backs of these cards are dorky-looking though, and asymmetric so that you can tell whether a card is normal or inverted before using it, which may be a problem for some people."},{"Title":"Morgan Greer Tarot Deck English","review":"I ordered the Morgan Greer deck since it was an interesting clone of the Rider Waite. I got the package today morning by the courier. As soon as I opened the package and held the cards in my hands, I somehow knew that these cards were a lot more than just another Waite clone. I liked the fact that the illustrations on these cards did not have boundaries. These cards focus more on the essentials and do not dwell so much on the surrounding sceneries (as in the Rider Waite). However, when you do a reading with these cards (as I immediately did one for my boyfriend in the afternoon) they merge so beautifully into one another - making the flow of the story more potent. The reading flows easy.Since I have been using the Rider Waite to do readings for so many years, I did not have to spend so much time getting to know it and the reading came so beautifully to me, that it was amazing.Yet, there are some things that I noticed as soon as I was going through the cards: The five of pentacles gives a different feel (just by looking at the image) - it doesnt project the poverty and rejection as in the Waite, but it gave me a feeling of being accepted in a sanctuary.Also in the court cards the Knights are missing their horses (but even so convey so much through their poses) and the Kings and Queens may be sitting on thrones, but you do not see them.The colour schemes are also so \\"Mediterranean\\" like my boyfriend mentioned (he is an artist), and so so so sooting and loving. I just fell in love with this deck!"},{"Title":"Morgan Greer Tarot Deck English","review":"After more than 20 yrs the Morgan Greer is still one of the most beautiful tarots I have ever seen. Very thought provoking imagery, provides strong intuitive readings. The colors are so lush and deep, that its almost unreal. Whenever im doing a reading for clients, they often comment how beautiful theese cards are. Often reviewers cannot see where Bill Greer sais he got inspiration, from Paul Foster Case, for the colors he chose for his deck. The answer is very simple, Its all mentioned in his book Highlights of Tarot. This litttle book comes with the BOTA or BUILDERS OF THE ADYTUM Tarot, where one colors his own deck. (all cards are in b/w) There you will see for yourself, where Bill Greer chose his colors for his lovely tarot deck. This deck is amazingly populor cause it, has no borders. (many decks have since copied it) After laying out several cards it takes on the look of a beautiful picture. If you want somthing traditional,like the Rider-Waite, but something a little more colorful, and sassy , you will love this deck! And so will the people you read for."},{"Title":"Morgan Greer Tarot Deck English","review":"I received this deck from a very dear friend, who purchased it more than 20 years ago. After using the deck only a few times, it has become my ABSOLUTE FAVORITE deck that I own (over 30)!!!!! The colors are stunning. The lack of borders is the first thing I noticed about this deck, and I love it. Every card is full of beautiful imagery and symbolism. This has become my 'go-to' deck for readings."},{"Title":"Morgan Greer Tarot Deck English","review":"How nave I was! Nice card stock, no USG copyright on it. Very seventies. You're gonna love it or hate it."},{"Title":"Morgan Greer Tarot Deck English","review":"I decided to purchase the Morgan Greer Tarot Deck based of the wonderful reviews. The reason I gave the it only three stars is because of the way I see things.I have ADD. It affects me in many ways; one of which, is the way minor imperfections distract and irritate me. It's an ADD thing.I have uploaded some images of the deck, showing some of the images with little black specks. They look like black dust. When I look at these cards it drives me nuts.Please note, the majority of you reading this will not find these specks bothersome. However, if you perceive things the way I do, then these minor imperfections might irritate you.I must agree with the positive reviews, the images on the cards are very lovely. If a publisher were to release an updated version of this deck, without those specks, I would absolutely order the new deck.Please take my review with a grain of salt. If you are in the majority, these specks will not bother you. However, if you are one of the few, and find minor imperfections irritating, I thought an ADDER's point of view might be helpful. Not all of the images are speckled. I estimate that approximately 30% to 40% of the cards have this problem."},{"Title":"Morgan Greer Tarot Deck English","review":"Well I thought that these tarot cards came with a book. they don't they come with a set of instructions. So i think that is kind of lame especially because after shipping they were like twenty dollars. But they are still nice cards of good quality."},{"Title":"Morgan Greer Tarot Deck English","review":"The Morgan-Greer tarot deck is full of bright, yellow colour that is almost sickening. The paintings are quite nice themselves apart from the intense colours on many cards, but they are so plastic they slide all over the place and feel too smooth to the touch. The corners of the cards are too curved so that they get damaged from shuffling very easily. The dark blue cover of the deck looks quite appealing but I was unpleasantly surprised when I took out the cards."},{"Title":"Morgan Greer Tarot Deck English","review":"This is by far my favourite tarot deck and the one I use most often in readings. The drawings and symbolism are based on the Rider-Waite deck but all images are portraits/close-up instead of full-figured. This fact, along with the very expressive faces on the cards stimulate a much more intense emotional reaction when you look at them. The cards are good quality, the colours are beautiful and bright without being flashy, and I especially like the fact that the images take up all the space in each card, without any borders. Definitely one of the best variations of the Rider-Waite deck."},{"Title":"Morgan Greer Tarot Deck English","review":"This deck is in line with the rider/waite deck, and in this regards, it would be a great deck to have along with those lines of dipiction. There are so many Tarot decks on the market, and they do not seem to resonate with me comfortably. This deck has strong colors. The cards are \\"still\\" and uncomplicated, which allows for my intuition to be \\"busy\\" (not the cards). In so saying, this is not a \\"deep\\" Tarot deck, and it does not have an accompanying book (just a small pamphlet). Also, this is a small deck that fits easily in your hands. The back side is blue with stars, not particularly inventive. Because I thought this would make a good first deck, I sent it along to my daughter, who is learning Tarot. With the cards' simplicity I figured she would rely on her own intuitions. I have since ordered another deck for myself."},{"Title":"Morgan Greer Tarot Deck English","review":"I have a number of decks and was recently drawn to this one. I'm a professional Astrologer (new world astrology dot com) but I have a background in Tarot. It's interesting how different decks resonate with you at different times.These cards are even more beautiful in person - the colors are rich and many sites don't do them justice, as they come across as more faded and the yellow not as attractice. I just received them this morning and I am very happy and excited to begin using this. I agree that the bordeless card gives a whole new feel and also, the cards and thin - I always wanted a paper deck but this, even though it's plastic, comes very close. Thinner cards feel better in the hands and I think out of all my decks right now these feel more like a Tarot deck then just another reproduced deck of cards."},{"Title":"Morgan Greer Tarot Deck English","review":"I just love this deck it is beyond my expectations!

I read complaints about a yellow color cast but perhaps the quality control is off since mine, if anything, were a bit on the blue side. Love the fact that there are no borders and there is a feeling of calm about this deck. My major problem with the deck is that it has a strange smell to it. I recently purchased another deck with the same smell which was also made by US Games.

The cards are also bigger than I thought they would be. Great job."},{"Title":"Morgan Greer Tarot Deck English","review":"My first deck of Tarot cards and the images are beautiful. I read reviews of various Tarot decks and decided that this would be my choice. It was difficult because many reviews stated that the Rider deck was the most popular and many of the books dealing with Tarot refer to that deck. Since Morgan Greer is derived from Rider I thought it would work for me. Mostly it does. The images \\"zoom\\" in which is more like a painting. I do miss some of the detail on a few of the cards. The Hierophant, for example, does not have the priests nor does the Devil have the figures of the male and female. Still, I am glad I chose this deck. The colors are vivid and the perspective is close so I can appreciate the artistic quality. As for personal insight I would say that the deck and I are becoming friends."},{"Title":"Morgan Greer Tarot Deck English","review":"The colors and depictions contained in this deck are simply wonderful. The colors are saturated and the drawings themselves are beautiful and convey the meaning of the cards easily. I learned to read tarot on this deck and it is my favorite (although I really do love the Rider-Waite Radience deck too). I agree with the other reviewers: the borderless cards really do add a dimension of expansiveness and only add to the deck. I do wish the back of the deck were better done. In comparison to the depictions, the back of the cards look juvenile. Highly recommend this deck!"},{"Title":"Morgan Greer Tarot Deck English","review":"I looked at alot of different decks and this is the one I ended up buying. I will still probably make my own someday, but this one had a lot of nice qualities. There is no borders like some of the other customers mentioned, and I have to say that is one of things I didn't see in alot of other decks. In other decks, some times the border was very large and the actual image seemed much smaller by comparsion. I thought it made it more difficult to see all the details with a smaller image. I have since noticed a few differences between this and the r-w deck. How much one thinks those impact the cards, really depends on the one doing the seeking. Most books seem to be written off the r-w deck and this one is similar. That can be helpful, but also confusing. Take for instance the Knight of Wands(rods) in this deck he is not on horse back in the r-w deck he is on horse back. In some of the books I've come across when they are looking at meaning through symbols and the make a point about the knight being on a horse, if you are a beginner you might not know how to adjust to that. I don't understand why they chose to call them Rods instead of Wands. That is one thing that I found strange. Another customer mentioned the backside of the cards. Even though I don't agree with everything they said, I did think back of the cards fell a little sort when compared to how much time was spent on the faces of the cards. The back star pattern seemed almost like an after thought. But I will say, as someone who does plan on designing their own deck I might judge things differently, one could say alot more criticly. All in all this one of the only decks that I have found that I really liked untill I can get around to my own designs."},{"Title":"Morgan Greer Tarot Deck English","review":"As a sometimes Tarot user, I have still yet to find one that I've truly connected with. After going through Visconti, Aquarian, Medieval Scapini, Rider Waite (Classic and Original), and finally the Jean Noblet (one of my favorites for admiring, not for use..) I decided to look up this deck after seeing it on an Unsolved Mysteries episode.Upon first opening it, I had that immediate connection I had always felt was missing from the previous decks. I feel that you have to like everything about a deck, including the back of the cards, to make that connection and have more truthful readings. The Tartan backing on the Rider Wait, as an example, makes it difficult for me to use. However, I feel as if I need the actual cards to get the meanings properly. This deck is a clone of the Rider, but it's gorgeous and combines the Rider Wait with better illustrations and a funner background Lush, vibrant colors, and a much more personal feel with the close up of the people that populate the cards.Side note: I don't believe in any mystical qualities of Tarot. I do it soley for two reasons: entertainment for my friends over my \\"innate abilities\\", and for insight to issues in my life that I wouldn't normally come to.In any event, this is probably the best deck I've currently got in my collection. It can be in yours too!"},{"Title":"Morgan Greer Tarot Deck English","review":"I was really saddened to see the Artist write a review apologizing in some way for this STUNNING deck!! I absolutely LOVE the feeling of ROUNDNESS and appealing fullness to the characters and scenes and the artwork is EARTHY, RICH & RIPE. This is the one and only deck I've ever run across where all the cards really sit right (there's not a single card where one feels it was slapped together or is glaringly bad -- a frustrating issue in one's pursuit of the elusive perfect deck!) With the Morgan Greer I find every card is evocative and beautiful -- and the fact that they're borderless really gives the images a clean, complete feel. (Particularly outstanding are The High Priestess & The Devil -- WOW!!!!)If you're new to Tarot, and want to dive in deeply -- I recommend learning the esoteric symbolism from the Waite-Smith deck since many details are omitted in the Morgan Greer and rightly so -- it's not MEANT to be an exact copy. (BTW, I particularly recommend The Tarot School for building a solid foundation & having a LOT of fun along the way.)Once you know the esoteric framework, or if you don't care about that aspect, the Morgan-Greer deck is a DELIGHT -- and I MUCH prefer it to the Waite-Smith in tone & character."},{"Title":"Morgan Greer Tarot Deck English","review":"I adore this deck. I have only owned it for 1 month, but I haven't been able to put it down ever since. I feel a great connection with it and the images are truly amazing. The only thing I dislike about it is the quality of the paper..some of the cards are already peeling on the back (where the stars illustrations are). It's very sad because I love the images so much. I've only owned it for 1 month and it's already falling apart...otherwise I would have given it 5 stars."},{"Title":"Morgan Greer Tarot Deck English","review":"Definite 'clone' of the Rider-Waite-Smith deck. This is pretty much considered a 'Classic' amongst Tarot enthusiasts.The twist this deck has to offer is the up-close and personal feel of the cards. Some people love it for that aspect...I found that I would rather like to see what is going on around the characters, rather than just stare at their pretty faces.The artwork is very round, and the colours are very rich and deep. A little too cartoon-y. I read somewhere someone really likened this deck to the 70's Era.I purchased this deck to replace my Original Rider-Waite-Smith (as I did not connect with it at all), upon reading many recommendations for this deck as a \\"starter\\"/\\"beginner\\"/\\"RWS Alternative\\"... I found that I much rather connect with the Universal Waite."},{"Title":"Morgan Greer Tarot Deck English","review":"I have owned several decks over the past few years but this one is by far my favorite and the one that I have been using almost exclusively.The drawings are beautiful, but I think the colorfulness of the cards is what makes it my favorite. As someone who is self-taught, I spent a lot of time looking up and researching the meanings of the cards as I went along and I felt an almost emotional connection to the colors and the meaning of the card. For example, the nine of pentacles in this deck is mainly a vibrant purple color. I knew that purple is the color of royalty and wealth, so it \\"felt\\" like a luxurious card without even knowing the meaning. The bright colors can help trigger thoughts and emotions that revolve around the topic depicted on the card which is what I found the nicest - the emotional/psychological connection."},{"Title":"Morgan Greer Tarot Deck English","review":"I bought this deck because its illustrations were rich in color and filled the entire card. I received it in the mail today, and it does not disappoint! The images are very expressive, and drawn in a beautiful, timeless style. The cards are rich with Western symbolism, and I can't help but notice biblical symbolism in particular (which may be distracting to some, enriching to others). Greer's interest in and inspiration from Jungian archetypes also adds to the depth with which these cards can be interpreted.I enjoy the card backing, although it is asymmetrical (so you can tell if a card is inverted if you're paying attention). Some of the illustrations also appear very slightly blurry--a printing imperfection I have noticed in many decks. Despite all that I do think this is the best deck I've come across."},{"Title":"Morgan Greer Tarot Deck English","review":"The Rider-Waite deck has always been my favorite since the mid-70's, because of its beautiful and detailed symbolism. When I saw the Morgan-Greer's incredibly similar design, I was intrigued -- even more so when I read that Greer had used the same sources as the Rider-Waite deck, only his intent was to give them a \\"modern\\" interpretation. Almost all the Egyptian, Hebrew, and classical symbolism is gone, and there are no borders. This leaves fewer and larger images that are drawn in more life-like detail than the Rider-Waite. This in turn, at least for me, makes them easier to use for divination. (With the Rider-Waite, I sometimes get distracted by the details of the card, rather than focusing the oracular meaning.)There were some disappointments, primarily in the court cards. While I disagree with the practice of turning the Pages into Princesses, these were rather unequivocally masculine for my taste. (Except for the Page of Cups, which interestingly, Arthur Waite describes as \\"effeminate\\" in his Pictorial Key to the Tarot.) What really bothered me, however, was the depiction of the Queen of Swords, defined as the hardest and perhaps the strongest of the Queens. Greer's looked the youngest of them all, with no facial lines, rather wholesome and ingenuous. (The \\"piercing stare\\" effect described in the included paperback did not come across that way to me.) Oh, well.But the crux of the deck was the oracular meanings provided in the \\"mini-book\\" that came inside the card deck. So many of them were down-to-earth (and tersely applicable to today's mundane, materially-oriented world), even for the traditionally \\"cosmic\\" cards like The Fool and The Earth. It was startling at first, but after putting everything in context, it was a viewpoint that really worked."},{"Title":"Morgan Greer Tarot Deck English","review":"I just love this deck, the colors are so rich and pretty. If you are into the traditional things in tarot I absolutely recommend this deck. The images are very detailed and since the point of view from the Rider White Deck and this one changes as you notice in the images, it gives you a whole focus while not altering the original meanings."},{"Title":"Morgan Greer Tarot Deck English","review":"Gorgeous colors and attractive images, pip cards that tell their story clearly and cleanly. This a perfect deck for public readings. I've worked with it since the late 80's and adore its ability to reach out to people who are new to Tarot and may be nervous about it. This is the one I take to events and classes, the one I recommend to beginning readers."},{"Title":"Morgan Greer Tarot Deck English","review":"This is my favorite tarot deck due to the nice, clear bright colors. Some decks are so dark, even the positive cards have a shadow cast over them. This is a deck for the reader who wants to look foreward to better times ahead. I find the colors to be uplifting if anything. The symbolism is also clear."},{"Title":"Morgan Greer Tarot Deck English","review":"This was the first deck I ever had and I learned on this deck when I was 16. I totally agree that the back of the deck is a bit mundane and drab, but that is not where the power of the cards lay. The Morgan-Greer cards are the most intuitive and informative deck I have used. I have several other decks, but this one will always be my favorite. The R/W is nice, but this one, I feel is superior in several ways as far as detail and symbolism. Even in the reverse, M/G deck is easier to read. Get it, try it. I think you will love it as I.Merry met."},{"Title":"Morgan Greer Tarot Deck English","review":"This is a great deck. The cards are vivd and the people are memorable in the cards. The lack of a border gives the cards expansiveness and the bright, deep, and rich colors pop out at you. The cards also give great readings."},{"Title":"Morgan Greer Tarot Deck English","review":"When my Morgan Greer Tarot Deck arrived in the mail I fell in love with it immediately. The colors are gorgeous, the work beautiful, and I even kind of like the star backs that some of the other reviewers have criticized. It's a terrific deck and I use it all the time now."},{"Title":"Morgan Greer Tarot Deck English","review":"This is currently the only deck I work with. It has large pictures with no borders. It can be like looking at a television screen. The images speak to me, and I usually always get good readings out of this deck. Besides all that, the deck is absolutely beautiful! The colors are rich and the symbolism really sparks the powers of intuition, at least for me. I highly recommend this deck! 5 stars!"},{"Title":"Morgan Greer Tarot Deck English","review":"This tarot deck is absolutely awsome. The art is fantasic, no borders on the cards which helps add to the great images. This deck uses Paul Foster Case's work as the primer. Case was said to have improved and corrected the Rider-Waite tarot. Waite himself improved and corrected the tarot from Eliphas Levi. The only complaint I have with this deck is the back. I really dont care for the blue back and hand drawn stars, wish it would be updated."},{"Title":"Morgan Greer Tarot Deck English","review":"The Morgan Greer Tarot Deck was one of the first decks I'd acquired when I was in my twenties and in spite of collecting many Tarot decks over the years, remains my favorite. Why? I like the bold and vibrant colors used in the deck with it's unifying color schemes. I like the 70s retro look of the deck on a whole. The men in the deck are very masculine looking, many sporting beards. More than anything else I like the way the people in the scenes jump off the cards. Although essentially a RWS clone deck, the figures are prominent and in the foreground, and because they are more in your face you can identify with them more readily. If you're not fond of 70s style artwork and colors, then you should pass this by--but if you like that sort of thing and like a Tarot with vibrant colors and a distinctive personality I reccomend picking this one up. It is a good reading deck and I think you'll like it."},{"Title":"Morgan Greer Tarot Deck English","review":"My favorite thing about these cards is they have no boarders. The designs are very 70's, but I like the warmth in the colors. There's slight differences between these and the Rider-Waite and I'm curious to learn the symbolism differences and the subtle nuiances that Morgan-Greer uses. The package came quickly and was in perfect condition."},{"Title":"Morgan Greer Tarot Deck English","review":"I absolutely love the illustrations! The lack of borders makes them even more awesome, and they are so colorful and clear! This deck is the perfect alternative to the Rider-Waite-Smith deck. There is still some roughness to the illustrations because they were block prints, but it has a very hand-made feel to it, and the rich smooth colors are gorgeous! When you shuffle them face-up, it looks like a comic book! (In a very good way). The quality of the card stock is pretty good (it is published by US Games), but the waxy coating can make them kind of slippery if used on a wooden or metal tabletop. With a textured cloth they would be fine.You can see all of the card images here: [...]I really like the fact that there are a few people in the deck who aren't white (although, really, there could be a lot more), and that the Pages are kind of androgynous/gender-neutral.I've already played with them and done some readings for other people, and they work so well with me. They are always quite clear in their meanings and easy to interpret. If they came with a book they would be the perfect beginner's set because of the lovely illustrations (for beginners I highly recommend anything by Juliet Sharman-Burke or Rachel Pollack). I plan to use these for public readings because of their friendliness and clarity. The card backs are bright blue with white stars, and while the illustration isn't exactly reversible, it's just a pattern so at a glance you really can't tell if they're upright or not.All around, these cards are a classic deck, and really worth the price!"},{"Title":"Morgan Greer Tarot Deck English","review":"I've been reading Tarot and teaching Tarot for 25 years and probably own a dozen different Tarot decks. The Morgan-Greer is my all-time favorite. No matter how many other decks I try to work with, this is the one I always return to. The colors are so vibrant and the artwork so beautiful, this deck truly speaks to me. The people illustrated on these cards are handsome, extremely appealing, and reflect each aspect of life clearly. If your intuitive or psychic abilities are stimulated by visuals, this is the perfect deck for you!"},{"Title":"Morgan Greer Tarot Deck English","review":"This deck was the one I learned to read with. The graphics on the cards are bold and tend to jump out to your eye. I went from this deck to the Thoth deck but end up using this one regularly as I have a rapport with it.

And that's pretty sad, considering that I should be too old for that kind of stuff.THE 21 BALLOONS follows the adventures of Professor William Waterman Sherman as he tries to escape his old life of school days and bad kids. (He was a math teacher at an all-boys school. I pity him.)He sets out in a balloon, one that has a sort of mini-house as the basket. He spends a few days happily flying around the Pacific ocean, until one day a seagull makes a hole in his balloon. He throws everything overboard, and aims to land on a small island. The island's name? Krakatoa.He is received into the Krakatoan society, and given a share in the HUGE diamond mines that each of the twenty families on the island own. (By the way- I love the way that the society is described in the book. Very detailed. And the naming system, too... though I don't think that I would like to be called something like 'K-2'.)The families live in great wealth and comfort, and they have a society totally based on food. Each day of the month, a different family cooks, and they all have equal shares in the mines. But everything isn't perfect...There's a volcano on the island, one that is REALLY active. It causes the island's earth to continually move up and down in waves... a sort of blessing, and a curse, because it keeps the other people of the world away. Professor Sherman is the first person that had been to their island other than themselves, EVER.And, of course, while Sherman is on the island, the volcano erupts. Luckily, the families all have an escape plan; a huge platform with twenty balloons attached that lifts everyone up and away from the island. Again, problem; they only have 80 parachutes. So Sherman has to try and land the huge platform...As I said, I love this book. One of the best children's fiction stories that I've read, ever... and the magnificent sketches by Mr. du Bois that describe the island really make everything come together more."},{"Title":"The twenty-one balloons","review":"The 21 Balloons is a great story for young and old- about the round-the-world travels of a balloon enthusiast/explorer set in the 1880s.

Professor Sherman left his head quarters, The Explorers Club, with one balloon. Fully lavished with any basic home supplies that you would find in your very own house. Chairs, walls, doors, plates, and even clothes.The real mystery is that when Professor Sherman was found stranded in the Atlantic, he didn't just have 1 balloon but he had 20 of them. Throughout the story the professor gives his mysterious story of what happened; like all most becoming some sharks dinner and how he survived.He was stranded on an island called Krackatoa.

I went on to read several other stories by the same author, but they have gone out of print, and only this story has lived. It is a masterpiece that (as nobody seems to have noticed in their reviews) is based on Jules Verne's Five Weeks in a Balloon. I strongly recommend this story for all kids who love adventure and Verne's brand of science fiction.

His personally designed, luxury-style balloon crashes on the island of Krakatoa.There on the island, which seems completely isolated from the outside world, live a group of incredibly wealthy diamond speculators who have left western civilization behind and created a society of their own. Their world is occupied by terrific time-saving inventions and a unique system of communal living. One example of their lifestyle: the families, who were re-named A-Z when they moved to Krakatoa, alternate the hosting of meals each day. The cuisine matches their letter of the alphabet (the C's specialize in Chinese food, for example).The islanders, eager to keep their fabulous wealth to themselves, have vowed never to leave. That is, until a volcano erupts, forcing all to abandon the island in a contraption made of 21 air balloons. The eruption of Krakatoa was an actual historical event, though the island was thought to be uninhabited. The addition of history into this fantastical story is a pleasant touch.This imaginative adventure was a lot of fun."},{"Title":"The twenty-one balloons","review":"The twenty one ballons is written by William Pene du Bois. The main character is Professor William Waterman Sherman. Professor William Waterman Sherman wanted to be the first one to fly across the Pacific Ocean. He wanted a big balloon because he wanted to be on the air for a year or at least many months. On the big balloon there were chair and a table made out of balsa wood and bamboo. Professor Sherman had a library of paper bound books printed in small type. Professor Sherman's food and liquids were chosen with the idea of saving weight. Professor Sherman carried a strong shark fishing rod and he hoped to catch a few fish to increase his food supply.

It has been quite enjoyable!"},{"Title":"The twenty-one balloons","review":"Our story kicks off with the exciting discovery and rescue of a sophisticated professor named William Waterman Sherman, who is stranded in the North Atlantic amid the wreckage of twenty-one sadly deflated balloons. It's the first sighting of this adventurous professor since is departure from San Francisco three weeks earlier. But that day he'd floated off the pier in one large balloon, not twenty one. How did he come to be helplessly adrift in this odd array of debris?Sherman's fans in America are desperate for an explanation, and after some rest and pampering for the retired teacher, they get it. Thus the exciting tale of The Twenty-One Balloons is born, masterfully told from the perspective of this eccentric and imaginative old man.Apparently Sherman's change of plans is all thanks to a seagull who punctured his balloon whilst he floated, carefree, above the Pacific. But it was all for the best in the end; Sherman's necessary crash landing led to the discovery of a secret island called Krakatoa, inhabited only by twenty families...and one incredible treasure store of diamonds. The lifestyle on this almost-magical island takes wealth, invention, and ingenuity to unprecedented (and extremely humorous) heights. Sherman's riveted audience only encourages his far-fetched descriptions and elaborate tales of what took place on the enchanting island...until the next catastrophe that led to the discovery of Sherman and the balloon wreckage in the first place.The Twenty-One Balloons is one of my favorite humorous family novels. Bursting with creativity and comical descriptions, it's the perfect lazy-summer-afternoon read for kids of all ages.Recommended read-aloud age: all agesRecommended read-alone age: 8 and upTo read more of my children's book reviews, visit larsenreviews.org."},{"Title":"The twenty-one balloons","review":"The Twenty-One Balloons by William Pene du Bois has become one of my favorite Newbery Medal books. This book has so many things going for it, and I want to list a few:1. The Story: The author tells a story that mixes fiction and non-fiction. The setting for most of the story is an island in the Pacific called Krakatoa. The natural events that happen on Krakatoa really did happen. The volcanic island exploded in the late 1800s creating the loudest audible sound in recorded history. I enjoyed reading the authors fictional account of what might have happened to the community on the island while all the explosions were building and actually happening. I also thought the style of writing was excellent and kept my attention. After I read the first chapter I was in.2. The Audience: Sometimes I get the feeling that the author envisions a certain gender reading the book they write, and in the Newbery Medal books, for the most part they seem to be girls. That's certainly not always the case, and it is just my opinion, but I sense that girls enjoy reading many of the newbery books more than boys would. BUT, I would say this book is certainly Adventure and certainly for boys! The way he even tells the story is the way my 9 year old would today. This alone makes it worthy of much recognition. I also read somewhere that this could be a great introductory book to science-fiction for young readers.3. The Author: William Pene du Bois was an amazing man. He not only wrote the book but he illustrated it as well. While this is not unique to Newbery books or authors it is rare. I Pene du Bois is a very acclaimed in his illustrations apart from his writing. Two books he illustrated won Caldecott honors(1953, 7) This puts him in a small company of people that have won both honors in children's literature.There is also a little controversy around this book, and the author recognizes that in his book. It turns out that F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote a story in the 1920s on a very similar subject. At best this is an amazing coincidence at worst it's plagerism. Pene du Bois claimed that he had not heard of or read the Fitzgerald's work until after he had written his. Apparently the writing community accepted this and no one made a big deal about it. After all he did win the Newbery.Overall this book is Excellent! A great book for young readers, especially boys. For sure one of the better Newbery books."},{"Title":"The twenty-one balloons","review":"Bought this for my 9-year-old granddaughter and read it before bedtime when she is visiting. She has enjoyed it very much so far."},{"Title":"The twenty-one balloons","review":"O.K., 1947 isn't actually the Victorian era. But you get a whiff of that old Victorian air as you read this. Then add the inventions and marvels our hero discovers, and you have a sort of very gentle proto-steampunk kind of vibe. Add some whimsy that doesn't make your teeth hurt, a narrator who isn't channeling Rex Harrison's more manic turns as Dr. Doolittle, and some old-fashioned charm, and you really have something.Read a couple more reviews here and you will get a decent sense of this book. I think the most helpful observation is this: if the book really catches your young reader's fancy it could be a lifetime favorite read (my niece fits into that category). If the book doesn't grab the kid, it will still probably be counted as a decent or worthwhile read. It's very unlikely to be actively disliked, so as an experimental choice you sort of get a win/win."},{"Title":"The twenty-one balloons","review":"I first read this as a kid, which was -- ahem! -- more than a few years ago. I think it is at just the right level for a child in the 8 to 12 range. It has the relatively brief length and the right mix of adventure and humor to hold the interest of most preteens, although I have to admit to being far from an expert at what attracts preteens these days!One note: There is no doubt that this book bears a very strong resemblance in a number of ways to F. Scott Fitzgerald's story \\"A Diamond as Big as the Ritz.\\" Du Bois has a brief note at the beginning of the book indicating that the resemblance is pure coincidence. While I don't believe du Bois consciously stole from Fitzgerald -- who would be dumb enough to steal the plot of such a well known story? -- it strains credulity to believe that du Bois had not read Fitzgerald's story at some point. I will hazard a guess that du Bois had read Fitzgerald's story many years before but had forgotten it. When du Bois came to write this book, he unconsciously made use of the earlier story. At this late date, though, I doubt we will ever know."},{"Title":"The twenty-one balloons","review":"I read this book aloud to my daughters. It is the winner of the 1948 Newbery Medal.We loved it!

He also left from San Francisco and went over the Pacific Ocean not the Atlantic. This book includes the mystery of Krakotoa, where in this story it is populated. Also, it is loaded with diamonds, and when the Proffesor lands on the island he saw amazing things, like self cleaning sheets, a balloon merry-go-round, and more.

But best of all was the balloon merry-go-round that went around a pole and up into the air.

A couple of decades had passed since the last time I read it, when last year I chanced upon it -- and was startled at the degree to which so many peculiarities of my adult life owe their origin to this Utopian novel that I chanced upon at age 13. Amazed, I asked a friend to read it and tell me whether she noticed anything of me in it.

The wind blows him in to a flock of seagulls and sadly for him one of the seagulls pops his balloon and he comes crash landing down on to the Island Krakatoa. Professor Sherman meets odd civilized people. The main person that helps him is called Mr. F. Mr. F, shows him around the island, where there is a diamond mine. Professor Sherman is astonished by what he sees, diamonds everywhere, in the size of even a human. However, through out the Island there were a few shakings, kind of like an earthquake, but no damage done. The island also has incredible technology considering they have been on the island for over 5 years. Professor Sherman enjoys many good dinners. One day, there was a huge rumbling in the island. The volcano had started to erupt! They narrowly escape.This book is very good. It has many examples of foreshadowing, like when he landed on the island you could tell that something bad was going to happen. The 21 Balloons is also very unpredictable. Something that you think will happen will most likely not, such as the diamond mine in the middle of the island.

He is a former math teacher who has a love for balloons. He plans a balloon ride across the Pacific Ocean to get away from society. The book starts out when the Professor is found in the Atlantic Ocean. They eventually calculate that it took him 40 days to go across the world, breaking the old record in half. He crosses America to tell the Western Explorer's Club about his findings. He tells the people of San Francisco (where the club is) about his amazing voyage. He started out fine in the balloon trip until a flock of birds popped a hole in his balloon. He stumbles upon the island of Krakatoa. This is a legendary island of unimaginable wealth, eccentric inhabitants, and fantastic balloon inventions. Once he finds the secrets he must stay there forever.The main character, William Waterman Sherman, is a pretty old man with a moustache and a beard. He wants to get away from society in a balloon ride. He wears 18th century clothes, typical of his time. It took place around the turn of the century. The only way I resemble him is that I sometimes want to get away too.I particularly liked the book because it has action and adventure. My favorite part would be him going around the island.

Unlike many books from that time of my childhood, however, this one has remained with me. Perhaps it is in part because of the vividness of the illustrations. Perhaps it is because of the audacity of the story itself, which in some ways might seem more appealing to adults than to children. In any event, I'm glad to see that a new edition is available.The world here is a sort of mixture of Jules Verne and Indiana Jones. The new color cover seems to suggest Henri Rousseau, but the original b/w illustrations are more in the tradition of Dore.By the way, those who have seen the movie \\"UP\\" might know if there's any influence of this book upon that film.

Even though the introduction tells you the outcome of the story, you still have no idea what's going to happen next. To me, this is the true characteristic of what makes a good novel. You want to read it, even though you already know how it's going to end.Some Newbery winners I love and some I can't stand. Take a guess as to my opinion of this particular one. There are some parts that I would consider slow, but the emphasis on the importance of leisure actually heightens the slow-moving experience.

It never fails to delight, fascinate, amuse, and enthrall me.

OK...perhaps that last sentence was over the top, but when you're trying to describe a fantasy tale about the explosion of the Krakatoa volcano, you can get burned by using too many cute metaphors and adjectives. Look...let's keep it simple. This book rocks. It rolls. It even shakes and rattles. The story is funny, the scenes are well-choreographed, the premise is captivating, and the narrative is told in a splendidly droll manner.

Plastic accoutrements that somehow incorporate the word \\"jelly\\" into their titles. And while I am an ancient 26 years of age with only dim recollections of my idyllic midwestern youth, I think I can say with perfect certainty that there is one subject that very very few kids obsess over. Ballooning. When was the last time your child begged you for a lifetime subscription to (actual publications) \\"Ballooning Magazine\\" or \\"Aerostat Hot Air Balloon Magazine\\"? This isn't to say that when the local carnival comes to town, some kids wouldn't leap at the chance of hopping into one of those balloon rides that go up and down. But will they seriously seek out literature that feeds this all-consuming hunger for all things dirigible? William Pene du Bois apparently thought so. And so, with his 1948 Newbery Award winning, \\"The Twenty-One Balloons\\", Pene du Bois gives us a tale that is part Jules Verne part H.G. Wells with just a touch of Rube Goldberg for spice. And while I doubt that many children today will pore over the intricate technical aspects of this otherwise fun ride, they will at least be intrigued by its tale of a man, his dream, and his encounter with a truly original society.If there was one thing Professor William Waterman Sherman was tired of, it was teaching mathematics to little children. For years and years he'd done it and finally, once retired, he was given a chance to fulfill a lifelong dream. Sherman would outfit himself a fabulous balloon. It would be the second largest ever commissioned and would carry a small wicker house, in which Sherman would be able to sail in perfect peace and comfort. Containing a great deal of food, the hope on his part was to be able to sail around the world for at least a year without having to come into contact with another human being. On August 15, 1883 he sets out above the Pacific in a single balloon to live in the sky. On September 8, 1883 he is picked up by a passing American freighter in the Atlantic while, \\"clinging to the debris of twenty deflated balloons\\". How is this possible? Where did the balloons come from? How did he travel around the world so quickly? And what stories has he to tell? \\"The Twenty-One Balloons\\" is Sherman's wild, impossible, and truly original tale of his time spent on the island of Krakatoa, mere days before it exploded sky high. And what he found there will astound.Pene du Bois begins this book with a rather touching caveat. He points out that just prior to publication his publishers couldn't help but notice similarities between this story and F. Scott Fitzgerald's short story, \\"The Diamond As Big As the Ritz\\". Pene du Bois admits that some of the similar details are a bit striking, but that he really hadn't heard of Fitzgerald's version before. A quick perusal of the two stories is enough to convince me that Pene du Bois is certainly telling the truth. Though in both tales we view rich opulent societies that own a mountain filled with diamonds and use their wealth to maintain both secrecy and a higher standard of life, Fitzgerald's story is obviously a slyly clever critique of his contemporaries while Pene du Bois concocts a delightful confection of various \\"what ifs\\". Kids reading \\"The Twenty-One Balloons\\" will instantly wish to find themselves on Krakatoa (pre-volcanic eruption, of course) and to eat at a different restaurant establishment every night.The best word for this particular book is \\"innovative\\". When Sherman crash lands, nude, on Krakatoa, he meets its European inhabitants. Because they are so incredibly rich (all due to Krakatoa's diamond core) they spend their days inventing wild games and conveniences while indulging in delightful foods and expansions of the mind. Pene du Bois's original illustrations bring Krakatoa brilliantly to life while also explaining the technical aspects of everything from balloon merry-go-rounds to beds that change their own sheets. Though I sincerely doubt that any publisher has gone so far as to print this book without the original pictures, make absolutely certain that your book has them if you're going to purchase it. In some ways they brought to mind the delightful scribbles of Ronni Solbert in the equally amusing children's book, \\"The Pushcart War\\".Many kids find themselves saddled with the assignment of choosing and reading one Newbery Award winning book for school. And a child could do far worse than choose the charming, \\"The Twenty-One Balloons\\". I like to think that the book is as much fun to read as it was for William Pene du Bois to write. Brilliantly conceived and full of lovely little ideas, this is one award winner that's certain to remain much loved for years and years to come. A pip."},{"Title":"The twenty-one balloons","review":"I have just about every Newbery Award winning book on my bookshelf and I've read most of them. But not all. In particular, many of the ones written before 1950 or so still need my attention. So, periodically, I try to pick up one I haven't read and give it a go. Having just finished reading Simon Winchester's Krakatoa, where he gives such a glowing report of this book, I pulled it down from the shelf.This is a fun book. It tells the story of a retired math teacher, William Waterman Sherman, who builds a balloon to help him get away from it all by spending a year floating through the skies. Instead, he quickly finds himself downed on the island of Krakatoa where he finds a secret colony of people living quite comfortably. He joins them. Unfortunately, in a couple days, Krakatoa erupts, destroying the island almost completely. Fortunately, the colony had prepared for the chance of eruption and everyone is saved.Published in 1947, this book is filled with a little interesting science and a lot of fantasy. If it has a weakness, it is that this book feels a little more dated than some of the other older Newbery winners. It doesn't feel dated because of its content, however, just its prose style. Its a little formal and relates a post-Victorian view of the world which many young people probably will not understand very well.Still, I enjoyed this story and the drawings by Mr. DuBois very much. When it comes right down to it, you can hardly go wrong with a Newbery winner.

In all fairness, I seldom have ever read fiction, but this book has a unique plot about it and offers fascinating elements of a story. At 19, I'm tempted to pick it up again as a refreshing escape from Macroeconomics and Brief calculus.The Twenty-One Balloons is an excellent read at the surface. However, it also offers up serious literary excellence. Any middle school English teacher, who would have their students read this book, would talk endlessly about the merits of the book. Foreshadowing, dynamic characters... it all flows evenly to produce a work easily readable for younger crowds but intense while still somehow whimsical for older kids.Overall, you won't be able to put the book down, and that's a serious assertion."},{"Title":"The twenty-one balloons","review":"Wow--this is a book that I will never forget, but let me expand on that seemingly gratuitous comment. \\"I will never forget\\" this lovely tale in a variety of senses that most texts fail to entertain or touch upon that later come into my daily life. As a girl forced to read such dull societal \\"classics\\" as Little Women and the Laura Ingalls Wilder series, this book was the first that addressed my love of science, a blend of imagination and what the future can hold, and a modest suspension of disbelief while still fascinating and entertaining with every page! And the illustrations are quiet and beautiful, telling and spare, and lend a reality to the words as icing on the cake. I now bequeath this book often as a gift, since not many have heard of it, and every recipient has enjoyed it--truly! I highly recommend this book as an escape from prescribed reading at any age"},{"Title":"The twenty-one balloons","review":"William Pene du Bois creates a fantasy for all children in the Newbery medal book The Twenty-One Balloons. When Professor William Waterman Sherman, an old school teacher, is found drifting in the Atlantic Ocean among the wreckage of twenty-one balloons, America is struck with mystery. Only two to three weeks before, he had flown off over the Pacific Ocean, in a balloon from San Francisco, on a one year voyage to peace and quiet. Professor Sherman has an adventure of discovery, between his liftoff and crash , with people from his hometown. For this adventure, though, he won't need his survival skills. I liked the way William Pene du Bois gives you a very discriptive mental picture of everything that happens in this book. This makes it very easy to understand, but it also makes it a little slow for advanced readers. He combines a little adventure with a lot of fantasy to create this imaginative book. It is though, I think, more for children going into middle school because of the reading level. This book was first published in 1941 and I think that its popularity still now tells how good it is."},{"Title":"The twenty-one balloons","review":"The Twenty-One Balloons by William Pe'ne Du Bois is a very good book. It starts with W. Waterman Sherman, a schoolteacher in San Francisco, who wants to get away from it all for one full year in a hot air balloon. Just going any where the great winds took him. He thought he would have a nice long ride, and then something went (perfectly) for the better.Back to Sherman, in a heap of wood, barrels, and twenty large balloons almost drowning! But, his story starts when he goes in one huge balloon (the Globe, a huge one room apartment in the sky) across the ocean and is attacked by seagulls. With that, he lands on an island, not any ordinary island though. He lands on the island of Krakatoa, that island is a volcanic island.Though this book leaves you hanging a little too much, it describes this island place very well. This fiction book is set far back, for me, in time (1960's) and is funny. On Krakatoa there are lots of people like Mr. F, Mrs. F, F1, and F2. Every one is named that way on the island, from Mr. A to T2 every letter is there. Also on the island there is one thing that always helps the islanders, the largest and vastest diamond mines that are under the volcano!!!!This book is very good at pulling you in and never letting go. I would like to thank Mrs. Shaffer, the great teacher that told me that this is a great book and then made me read it, thanks. This book is great for kids 8-14 because it has a lot of neat things most people dream about. Also because it is kind of like a fairy tale but, a adventurous one. I would recommend this book to any one so, happy reading every one! KRAKATOA!!"},{"Title":"The twenty-one balloons","review":"What a peculiar story! William Sherman, tired of teaching ungrateful children, decides to travel around the world in a hot air balloon. Sherman succeeds, but not in the way he'd anticipated. Unexpectedly, Sherman crashes on the island of Krakatoa. Instead of finding a deserted island, however, he comes upon a strange community of people.The community has a source of wealth, a magnificent diamond mine, that allows the people to do anything they wish. The people have created a zany civilization founded upon the idea of restaurants, eating out at a different family's restaurant every night. Sherman is shown novel designs for homes and odd inventions that have come from the clever minds of the island's residents. Despite their apparent creativity and great wealth, the people choose to live on an island that, every hour of the day, threatens their lives. And, of course, as one might expect, the moment comes when Krakatoa blows. Somehow, the people are able to escape without harm and Sherman is able to return home to San Francisco.

I enjoyed the book's easy to understand descriptions of his life on the island. While reading it, I was never caught wondering why this book was written. It has was written for the enjoyment and pleasure of reading it. The compelling story makes you want to go out and try to ride around in a hot air ballon the rest of your life. Rich, but easy to understand details flow through a perfect plot. We learn that life is enjoyable even when you don't have something to do or somewhere to be and you are away from society.The 21 Balloons starts out with a man, Professor Sherman, who wishes to go around the world in a hot air balloon. He starts on his journey, but soon disaster strikes. A seagull tears his balloon forcing him to descend and crash land. He eventually wakes up on the island of volcanic Krakatoa where he is greeted by a man. The island is not thought to be inhabited, but it turns out that 20 families of four live there in a village that is situated far from a volcano that contains a secret. Under the volcano, there is a cave that is so full of diamonds that you have to wear sunglasses to look in it. This is the main reason the families stay on the island. Although they each own a share of the diamond mine, if they were to spend them diamonds would become equal to dirt, because diamonds would be so common. The families each run a restaurant that serves a certain type of food. For example, the F's serve French food and live in a French style home that they built by trading a few diamonds for materials in outside countries. Their life is simple. After their day of cooking they don't have to worry about cooking for another twenty days. The children and parents just relax and do nothing the entire day, that is until the volcano erupts.I enjoyed The 21 balloons. It shows how relaxing and enjoyable it would be to live on an island away from society with no worries or work. It illustrates the simplicity of spending a day doing nothing and not having to worry about it. The book describes a place were food is good and you never have to worry about money. I also enjoyed the fact that throughout the book there were scattered inventions that would still work well in today's society. As the characters are introduced we learn about them and their background which helps us understand the book better. The book is a simpler story, bursting with details, that is for all ages. The author points out many flaws of the outer world to make the island seem like a paradise, but if you read the story you will find out the island is not. If I could change anything about the book I would have had Professor Sherman live on the island longer and get to know the people better because I felt like we only know the main characters and all the other characters barely interacted with him.I found it interesting that it seems that the book could possibly be true. The island of Krakatoa did actually explode around the time of the story and it seems that there isn't anything mentioned that was not around at the time of the story. I think that people who enjoyed this book would also enjoy The Phantom Tollbooth because they are both books that are easy to understand but can be enjoyed by all ages. They also make the outside world seem different.The 21 Balloons by William Pene du Bois is a story for all ages. It is a set in a relaxing paradise but has a twist in the plot. It is easy to understand and I enjoyed it. It was written for enjoyment and was not meant to be a book that would be groaned at by a group of middle schoolers. It makes you want to relax and throw away your worries. The details are simple but flow together perfectly. I enjoyed the book and would recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"The twenty-one balloons","review":"I read this, plus other books written by the author, ~50 years ago.

But the book isn't really about the Krakatoans. It is about a man who goes on a trip on an air balloon to get away from the world but his trip doesn't last as long has he would like because a seagull dives down and pokes a hole in the air balloon.

Is this a good utopian society? What are the good and bad points of this type of life?

The main character is the professor by the name of William Waterman Sherman. The professor takes a hot air balloon from San Francisco, California. He intends to fly across the Pacific Ocean. Instead through a twist of fate, he lands on an island called Krakatoa.The theme of this book is the secrets of Krakatoa.Krakatoa is a tropical island apart of the Pacific Islands area. Krakatoa is a legendary island of unimaginable wealth, eccentric inhabitants and fantastic balloon inventions. When the professor finds out the secrets of Krakatoa he must stay there forever unless he can escape.In one part the professor falls on the ground because the earth's shaking and then Mr. F, another important character, says \\" You can now see why Kraktatoa was always considered unfit to live on\\". There are only eighty people who live on Kraktaroa. After arriving on Krakatoa the professor asked Mr. F, \\" Am I dead'. Then the professor asked \\"Is this heaven\\".

This book was about professor William Waterman Sherman and his adventures. He takes a balloon trip and crashes on the island Krakatoa. It's mostly about what he does on Krakatoa and the things he learns about the Krakatoa natives. The main plot is when Krakatoa erupts and they have to evacuate the island.I liked the book very much. The book was so exciting to read. The different ideas in the book were amazing. It was so creative. The information and how creative it was is the key of why the book is so great. I was also able to feel that I was \\"in\\" the book. I could feel this, because I was wishing that I was there and I could also feel and see what it would be like to be in their situations. The main conflict interested me, because I wanted to see how Professor Sherman got off the island. I also was curious about how he lived on the island, which was very exciting, because the island was so amazing and unique.The author's writing style would probably be very educated and informative. The vocabulary was very interesting or hard to understand, because many of the words were scientific and difficult. Even though I am sure everything he said was factual, it was also kind of boring and too informative at those parts. The author's ability with description was above and beyond. You would be reading about one of their balloon inventions in the book and he would describe how it works, what it looks like, and every other thing he could describe. All that description would take about 3-7 pages. Then when he was describing their restaurant calendar, he also went into that with great detail. So I think his writing style was descriptive, but maybe too descriptive, well at least for children.I would give this book 4 out of 5. I give the book this rating, because it was very descriptive and interesting. The plot wasn't the most exciting though. Also as I've said, it was a little too descriptive. This made it somewhat boring.This book seems great for anybody. It's really creative and most people will think most of the creativity is really cool and interesting.

He wanted to stay in the air for a year. But as time went on danger comes. He encounters numerous seagulls. He tried to get them away but it did not work. One of them thought the balloon was food so; he bit the balloon and popped it. Slowly Professor Sherman decreases altitude. He finds an island near by. It was at least two to three miles away. He knew he had to do something so he can live. Sherman tried to dump everything he had like the trash cans, dishes, clothes, food, and his own cloth he was wearing. Once he was about one kilometer away from the island he detached all the roped and use them as a parachute. The Professor was able to make it but he was butt naked. There a man came and gave him food, shelter, and cloth. In the island he learned many things. The island was called Krakatoa. There in the island he fined diamonds, millions of them. After about five to six month on the island he leaves the island and returned back to San Francisco.I liked the book because he made it kind of realistic. Except for one thing, the diamonds where the one that was not real. The book was also like an adventure movie. If you are really into an adventure book you'll like this book. I liked how Professor William Waterman Sherman acts because he likes to fly.I chose this book because I heard this book was GREAT! The person that told me that it is good is Eric Wynn (my brother). I also picked it because I had nothing read. Once I read a few pages just to check if its good; I thought it was pretty good because of all his inventions."},{"Title":"The twenty-one balloons","review":"This book was one of the greatest books I have ever read. It tells a fasinating tale of a secret island. The island of Krakatoa is thought to be complety unihabitable, but one group lives there anyways. When Proffesor Sherman stumbles upon the island on cross Pacific trip he must stay there for life. The island has many odd iventions and ideas. One of these is the restaurant government. The children have also built a ballon merry-go-round. This book had a great storyline, that left me unable to put it down. It makes you think, can there realy be a secret land right under our nose."},{"Title":"The twenty-one balloons","review":"The Twenty-one balloons is a very good book. I recomend it to all people, young and old. You really need to read the book. It is a book of adventure and curiosity with Professer Williams. I am going to read it again because it was such a good book. I liked the way that Williams responded to all the news in the book, when he was stranded on the island because his hot-air balloon popped becouse a sea-gull rammed into the balloon and made a hole. Read the book to find out what happens in the end of the book. It is a good ending and I liked how it ended."},{"Title":"The twenty-one balloons","review":"The Twenty-One BalloonsThe Twenty-One Balloons is about a man named Professor Sherman who was found in the Atlantic Ocean stranded in a Hot air balloon. Professor Sherman left his head quarters, The Explorers Club, with one balloon. Fully lavished with any basic home supplies that you would find in your very own house. Chairs, walls, doors, plates, and even clothes.The real mystery is that when Professor Sherman was found stranded in the Atlantic, he didn't just have 1 balloon but he had 20 of them. Throughout the story the professor gives his mysterious story of what happened; like all most becoming some sharks dinner and how he survived.He was stranded on an island called Krackatoa. Krackatoa was an island that was abandoned due to a volcanic eruption. Could it be that there are really people surviving on that island? Fooling the rest of the world so they could be in peace? Or can the island just be an abandoned island that the professor has to live on? Read the book to find out the real story of Professor Sherman's island.I thought that the overall book was very good!! At the start it is slow; but once two chapters pass the book is hard to put down. The book holds loads of details that make the book interesting and worthy of the Newberry Award that the book earned. The Twenty-One Balloons is a fast read that all most everyone enjoys.

He was also creative in the sense that he thought of all the neat inventions the Krakatoans have. See, an explorer,(former math teacher)was tired of the monotonous days of his busy life.Spit balls, gum, paper airplanes, the usual for every teacher. So, he constructs a large, grand, balloon and sets off to wherever the wind may take him. You see, his intention was not to land in a certain destination, but to simply drift around undisturbed for a year or so.But, alas, how could a creature as tiny as a seagull ruin this magnificent balloon? It tore a hole in it, and the balloon, unable to keep the helium in its curved dome, sank into the sea. But the professor woke up on the shores of the island of Krakatoa. Will he die? After all, this is a wild, desolate island isn't it? You will see after you read this book full of creativity, fantasy, and imagination.My thanks to Mr. William Pene du Bois for this wonderful masterpiece!!!!!!!!!!!!! :)"},{"Title":"The twenty-one balloons","review":"Anybody would love this book. There is a lot of humor and action. The best thing about it is the restaurant government; maybe we ought to have one."},{"Title":"The twenty-one balloons","review":"Professor Sherman of San Francisco has retired from teaching math in order to indulge his passion for Ballooning. He plans to fly across the Pacific, but is rescued (most curiously) in the Atlantic! He resists all efforts and bribes as well as a Presidential request to explain his story, for he has promised to keep mum until he addresses the San Francisco Explorers' Club.Most of this delightfully amusing book is his account of his misadventures in a balloon. There is very little plot actually; the narrative mainly consists of stories within stories, told by the Professor himself or Mr. F. But the book is fast reading and highly imaginative. We discover mind-blowing inventions and a hidden, American society on a volcanic island called Krakatoa. He finds a Gourmet Government, all financed by secret diamond mines of incredible abundance. Kids will love the wierd electric and aerodynamic inventions explained and diagrammed by the author, who must be a kid at heart. ! &quot;We are slaves of our own piggishness; we have locked ourselves in a diamond prison.&quot; Is the professor the man to set them free, even if they don't want to leave?"},{"Title":"The twenty-one balloons","review":"This book is about a man who travels around in a balloon and gets shot down by a man and lands on an island.

She creates the art I never thought I could get a way with, and she does it beautifully. This collection of photos and drawings focus on one man who supposedly looks like a painting of Napoleon. I suppose he does, but her view of him is what is important.She looks at him with more than a loving eye. She sees things in him that he obviously doesn't see in himself, and she shows those things to us. We are intimate partners in her adoration, never feeling voyeuristic or inappropriate. This feels natural and right, the way each of us should feel about someone.The informality of the settings and the casual drawings - often on hotel stationery - give an \\"of the moment\\", casual feeling that adds to the intimacy and the mystery. Has she been staring at him as he sleeps? Did she quickly dash off a sketch to remember a certain attitude or expression? This is a truly beautiful collection."},{"Title":"Christina Rossetti Eman Poet Lib #06 (Everyman Poetry)","review":"In the pre-raphaelite spirit of detailed craftsmanship this accomplished range of Christina Rossetti's poetry is illustrated by fine works of art that includes paintings by her brother and other pre-raphaelite painters, all contrasting with today's ugly, imitative fashions.(Please note: This book is not entitled Passion and Devastion but Passion and Devotion)"},{"Title":"Christina Rossetti Eman Poet Lib #06 (Everyman Poetry)","review":"I'm giving this book a 5 star rating (instead of a 4 star rating) because it IS well-researched and there just isn't that much available on Christina Rossetti by way of good biographies. And it is apparently difficult to separate her story from that of her brother, the artist Dante Gabriel Rossetti. Of the few biographies I have found so far for Christina this one is more complete and comprehensive. It's just hard to believe, with the variety and volume of poetry she wrote, that more personal, individual information cannot be unearthed about her. Perhaps this information simply isn't available--but its lack does make the reading about her life rather dry at times. Rossetti belongs in the same upper echelon as Emily Dickinson and Emily Bronte, in my view. It would be gratifying to be able to understand her personality a little better, given the volume of poetry she wrote. I feel I learned a great deal about the details of her life, but little about the woman, herself."},{"Title":"Simple Asset Allocation Strategies","review":"This very short book aims to explain Gibson's ideas about risk and return in investing. Essentially he suggests that investors can afford to put more money into equities if their &quot;time horizon&quot; is a long one.He has extracted a number of the earlier chapters from his longer work &quot; Asset Allocation&quot;. These chapters focus on the time horizon argument.There is no new material in the book.The book is a good one for the novice investor, worried about the short term volatility of the market. It would be an ideal book for financial advisers to give to intelligent clients nervous about the market."},{"Title":"Luftwaffe Secret Projects, Ground Attack & Special Purpose Aircraft","review":"Page 7 of this book contains a remarkable Publisher's Note, in which the publisher acknowledges the efforts of translator Ted Oliver (for this book was originally written in German) for his efforts to improve on the original version and the addition of \\"commentary on the author's erroneous text repeated from sources known to be incorrect or speculative.\\" It must be almost unique to have such a statement in the foreword of a book.There still is a lot of interesting material in this book, including many fascinating reproductions of original German drawings. But the text is took skimpy, and too much space is devoted to often speculative artwork. This book creates an appetite for more, but one is left feeling dissatisfied and in doubt about the validity of what one has just read.I don't regret buying this; it is a book worth having. But compared to Tony Buttler's really excellent series on British Secret Projects (which is, that is true, rather harder to digest) this is the work of a dilettante."},{"Title":"Luftwaffe Secret Projects, Ground Attack & Special Purpose Aircraft","review":"Mr's Herwig and Rode, an excellent work on the topic.

They spread themselves so wide that they, thankfully, overstepped their ability to produce. Without some focus on the tasks at hand, they were off in a hundred different directions. The authors have, with all three volumes, shown the advanced thinking coming out of Germany. But they also show the bureaus doing scattered if effective work. These are worth having not only to see what they had planned, but also to show a national leadership leaping and bounding here and there trying to solve problems by bringing new production as the solution. These books are worth having."},{"Title":"Luftwaffe Secret Projects, Ground Attack & Special Purpose Aircraft","review":"Number 3 in the Secret Projects Trilogy is just as good as Fighters and Bombers. The research is as good as it gets considering the subject matter but the authors have resisted the temptation to fill in the blanks with historical licence where the data is lacking. The artwork is inspiring and continues in the tradition of the previous volumes. Highly recommended to all aviation enthusiasts and particularly Luftwaffe 1946 modellers."},{"Title":"Luftwaffe Secret Projects, Ground Attack & Special Purpose Aircraft","review":"In this third book of their series on Luftwaffe Secret projects the authors have found some 140 aircraft that were proposed and/or developed for military use by the various German companies. The war years, for Germany were accompanied by great leaps in engine design. The engines of the ME-262 jet fighter, the rocket engine of the ME-163, the V-1 Buzz bombs pulse jet engine and improved traditional engines were all becoming available for new air frame designs.Further experience on the battlefield had also brought a greater understanding of the needs for new aircraft designs. The German companies responded with a series of designs. Many of these designs look surprisingly like the designs proposed by American and British companies during the early 1950's as these kinds of new engines were becoming available over here. In one case the comparison is so close that there is a picture of a Junkers 1941 ground attack aircraft and a photograph of an American A-10 Warthog on facing pages.Many of the other aircraft proposed, especially by Blohn and Voss are so goofy looking that I'm reminded of the old saying, \\"if it looks good it will fly good.\\" In the case of Blohm & Voss, it's apparently the other way around. Reports that I've seen say that their planes fly well, in spite of how goofy they look.A book to be read a couple of times and to serve as the basis for a lot of conversation with other airplane buffs."},{"Title":"Gourmet's Casual Entertaining: Easy Year-round Menus for Family and Friends","review":"Okay, say the editors, it's Saturday and some friends are coming over, and you decide to just \\"throw something on the grill, make a salad, and buy a pie at the bakery.\\" Hah!

Now, I'm a pretty fair cook, but this is not the sort of thing you can do with one hand tied behind your back.

The irony of dedicating these battalions to publishing a 200-page book is not lost on the anonymous copywriter responsible for the acknowledgments. In all the activity by all these people, no one person is identified as the author. The best the publishers could do is to associate various \`Gourmet' food editors with various chapters plus a credit to the wine editor's contribution of wine selections. All this chatter about the number of contributors to this volume is simply to highlight that after all this effort, the book does not succeed in attaining it's subtitled objective of \`Easy Year-Round Menus for Family and Friends'.Other reviewers have commented on this fact, but I was willing to give the good folks at Gourmet the benefit of the doubt, since the main title of the book is Casual ENTERTAINING, and one certainly does go a little out of the way when feeding guests.The five chapters with about seven menus per chapter and five or six recipes per menu are entitled \`Easy Saturday Nights', \`Lazy Sundays', \`Easy Celebrations', \`Easy Grills', and \`Easy Picnics'. It certainly seems to me like they had \`easy' recipes in mind when they created the concept for this book.Almost every recipe by itself is, indeed, fairly straightforward. The number of ingredients per recipe rarely exceeds nine and the very clearly written procedures rarely exceed three short paragraphs. As usual, the most detailed preparations are for the desserts, where special instructions are often needed to prepare something that can be prepared and refrigerated or frozen days in advance of the relaxing day of entertaining. As I noted above, the recipes are all written in an exceptionally clear manner, with each distinct step being put in its own paragraph with a clear emboldened verb at the start to make clear what it is that is being done. I would expect nothing less from the staff of Gourmet Magazine. Wherever appropriate, the recipe's \`Cook's Notes' specify how far in advance the recipe can be made.I think it is fair to say that many recipes are for dishes that fit casual situations. There are a lot of dips, finger foods, satays, salads, shish ka-bobs, and what have you. Even the somewhat toney dishes such as baked eggs in brioches allows that you will not make the brioche yourself, but buy it from you neighboring Boulangerie. One problem is that while you may not have any problem finding brioches in NYC, out here in the hinterlands, I have a problem finding any baker who even knows what brioche is, let alone being able to sell me some.Scattered throughout the book are general suggestions on entertaining, but taken all together, they certainly do not constitute a tutorial on entertaining, such as what you will find in Martha Stewart's classic book \`Entertaining'.If you consider the source of this volume, a magazine named \`Gourmet', you should really expect pretty toney content, and that is what you get in these menus. Each recipe taken individually is fairly straightforward, but all the recipes taken together plus classy wine recommendation requires a fairly sizable grocery bill and some pretty adept hands in the kitchen. This is much, much more work per menu than what you will find in an article in \`Parade' or \`Better Homes and Gardens'. So, the question to you dear reader, is how often you will refer to this book to do all or most of a set piece menu. This book is simply trying to meet two incompatible objectives, simplicity and flash.For purely family entertaining, I found Sheila Lukins book \`Celebrate' much more useful. Somewhat less complete but also good is \`The Family Table' by Christy Rost. For really easy entertaining, see Rachael Ray's \`Gettogethers' or any of Rachael Ray's \`Thirty Minute Meals' books for that matter. Patricia Weir's \`Cooking in the City' is a good resource for high end entertaining without breaking the budget.This volume would be more valuable if there were a complete table of recipes by course. The index is pretty good, but it is no substitute for a complete list of recipes.There are books I would not even buy if they were on the steeply discounted stacks. I would consider this if it were available for less than nine dollars."},{"Title":"The Long Range Plan","review":"I have to say that The Long Range Plan is by far the best book that I have read in years.

From the day they meet, the stage is set for tragedy, but our protagonist, now 26, has been rehearsing for it a long time. Since the high-water mark of his young life--graduating from college with honors--he has been in a downward spiral of wasted days and wasted nights fueled by prodigious drinking and promiscuous sex.The latest consequence of that lifestyle, being dumped by a fianc&eacute; who wants a sober, faithful husband, not a boozing philanderer, has brought Archer to a new low--but to no new understanding of himself. Otherwise as smart as they come, he somehow missed out on the cause-and-effect connection between behavior and consequences, and goes right on making the same mistakes, mainly because he lacks a moral rudder. This is his fatal flaw. Fully aware, for instance, that a student-teacher affair in high school is The Big No-No, he does it anyhow. After all, self-indulgence is his speed, and the sooner, the better in all things. A frustrated writer, he hates the nine-to-five world and, though an excellent teacher, he despises the bureaucratic sinkhole that his school district has become. So when he sees a chance to take the money and run, well, what else could an anti-hero do? Indeed, quoted right up front in the novel is the maxim: \\"Never underestimate the power of cash.\\"Archer does have redeeming qualities. He loves his cat, Brasco; he sympathizes with the weak; he's loyal to friends; he's grateful for favors; and he's squeamish about causing injury to others. Not squeamish enough not to do it, but squeamish nonetheless. But his chief redeeming quality is that we couldn't have this kind of story without this kind of character: a twenty-something man born to middle-class privilege in the Land of Opportunity who still can't win for losing--and has no idea why.

I've normally not been very happy with the books he's written with other main characters. So I was delighted to find myself enjoying this one immensely. He has done a good job of writing using women as main characters - I believed them and felt the plot flowed from the characters - one of my main criteria for a well-written mystery.I read it straight through and felt that James really had his hand on the wheel - a confident, strong, elegantly written (if quirky, which we expect from this writer) book. I love his style with Harpur and Iles - it's original and fits the atmosphere he's creating. This time out he's modified that style to suit this plot and these characters - and that is appropriate. There's still enough James here to keep his fans (and count me right in the front of this group) happy.A woman police detective on her way up, and a woman who comes to England to find out why and how her daughter was murdered, team up to get the real story, and then to make sure some sort of justice is done. Satisfying, I call it. I think this is a book any James fan will enjoy, and would be a fine introduction to a reader new to Bill James and his very original take on police procedurals."},{"Title":"Double Jeopardy","review":"Angela Sabat, a young black woman from Detroit, is killed in an English provincial town. Who did it? Suspicion points at Matthew Gain and at Peter Vincent Pethor, called Scout, the twin brother of P.D. Pethor. Both had been prosecuted for the murder but released due to lack of evidence. Double Jeopardy: The two can not be tried again for the same crime.For reasons not entirely clear, Detective Kerry Lake now goes fulltime after the perpetrators. Her road is not fascinating, surprising, or innovative. As a matter of fact, the whole procedure is extremely boring on the scale of \\"he said, she said, they all said\\", sprinkled with profound thoughts. The different players do not even manage to stay in character. The suspects never change.There is no new evidence. By the time the crime is solved - more or less without outside help - you could not care less about who did it.Forget it."},{"Title":"Double Jeopardy","review":"Scout Pethor and Matthew Gain have been cleared of the murder of beautiful black co-ed Angela Sabat--and the British police are intent to discover why, and to find a scapegoat. Because they believe Pethor and Gain are guilty as sin, and that only a police coverup could have brought about their acquittal. Vic Othen, Kerry Lake's sometimes lover, looks to be an appropriate fall guy. He did, after all, discover the body acting on a tip. Couldn't he have been called in to hide the evidence? Who else but the killers would have known where to send him?Kerry lives in a world where everyone seems to know everyone else's secrets. Her love affair with Vic, even her meeting with Pethor's brother become common knowledge among Pethor's criminal gang, his jailed competitor, her police chief, and even the victim's mother--a journalist intent on discovering the truth and just maybe creating a bit of justice. The British courts deny that justice is possible. Gain and Pethor can't be tried again under the rules of double jeopardy. But that doesn't mean that their lives need be pleasant. Unfortunately, they seem just smart enough to be able to stay ahead of justice, just as they've stayed ahead of the law.Author Bill James writes powerfully about the moral ambiguities and small victories of the modern police. In this short but complex novel, everyone is working an angle, everyone has more than one hidden agenda, and nothing is what it seems. Even when Kerry assures herself that she wouldn't continue to support Vic if she knew him corrupt, there is always a question mark at the end of her question. When the law holds a killer innocent, what moral rules can or should apply?As with James's Harpur and Iles novels, DOUBLE JEOPARDY deals with shades of gray. Killing a black woman is worse than beating one up. Giving a free ride to a criminal in prison might be better than a free ride to a killer who is free. And taking a bribe might not be so bad if the cop doing the taking doesn't really deliver what she promised. DOUBLE JEOPARDY left me feeling disturbed, dirty, and entertained."},{"Title":"Understanding Macroeconomics","review":"Robert Heilbroner is one of the better economic authors in the last 25 years.

'Shall I say this psalm?' she faltered. Overcome with emotion, the priest who had tried so hard to save Jane from this moment, could scarcely reply. After a moment's pause, he simply said, 'Yea.' Jane then began to repeat Psalm 51 in English, David's great prayer of contrition...A deep silence rested over the sad scene, nothing could be heard except for the quiet sobbing of her lady attendants. Hardened soliders who had witnessed brutality many times before stood without moving...Bracing her body to receive the impact of the blow, Lady Jane called out in a clear voice, 'Lord, into thy hands I commend my spirit.' With a stroke, swift, sharp and terrible, Jane's short life was ended\\" (page 200-201).So ended the life of a bright light in a particularly dark and strange period of English history. In a time when the Catholic powers were trying to exterminate the new Reformed teaching, the two potential rulers who seemed most likely to increase the Protestant faith both came to an early end. Edward VI, only a teenager, died following a long bout with tuberculosis. Edward was a strong Christian and committed to the expansion of Reformed Protestantism. He attempted to bypass his half-sister Mary, an ardent Catholic, who was next in line to the throne and hand it instead to Lady Jane Grey, a friend and sister in Christ who was committed to Protestantism. Lady Jane, under great pressure from her family agreed, but did so only with the greatest reluctance. The attempt quickly failed and Mary came to the throne, bringing with her a time of terrible persecution against Protestants. Lady Jane was one of those who died during this time of great conflict. Why God chose to allow this to happen - why he would allow two strong Christians to perish in order to usher in a reign of terror and persecution - is beyond our reckoning. Truly His ways are not our ways.&lt;em>Lady Jane Grey&lt;/em> by Faith Cook, is the story of Lady Jane, who is known as the nine day queen of England. The author seeks to portray Lady Jane as someone who was more than a mere pawn in the hands of powerful men, but was a young lady of starting intelligence and strong faith. Cook feels that Lady Jane's treatment in history has been unfair, and has assigned to her far too little credit. To understand her, we must first understand that dark period of British history, and the author provides the information necessary to properly see the tragedy unfold. The strength of this young woman's faith is incredible, that one so young could know so much.Even when offered a chance to save her life, she refused to accept Catholic teachings. Even when befriending a priest, the only person allowed to provide religious counsel during her final days, she did not hesitate to challenge him on his erroneous beliefs. Even when she had been thrust into a position which was not rightly hers, she accepted full responsibility for her sinful actions.Because this story cannot be separated from the period of history in which it happened, the author has to spend a fair amount of time teaching history. She does so with clarity and precision, never allowing the narrative to become broken. She successfully combines history with biography in telling the story of an admirable Christian woman. Cook aptly summarizes the importance of Lady Jane's death. \\"Like the apostle Paul, she had fought a good fight, finished the course and kept her faith. Henceforth there was laid up for her a crown of righteousness - a crown none could take from her\\" (page 201). Lady Jane stands as an inspiration for her strong stand for what she knew to be right. This book is informative, moving and most importantly, inspiring. I thoroughly enjoyed this biography and am more than happy to recommend it."},{"Title":"The Nine Day Queen of England","review":"If you are looking for a scholastic, historical account of the life of Lady Jane Grey, this is not the book for you. Simply put, book is a platform for the author's religious beliefs. Faith Cook does not write in the cool, unbiased voice of a true historian--in fact, the book is filled with anachronisms of modern day street-corner evangelical beliefs. The publisher, Evangelical Press, attests to this. Research into the author's background will show that she is not a true historian, rather pastor's wife (and former missionary) who has only before written books of religious historical fiction. Luckily the life of Lady Jane, although bookended by the author's own opinions and biases, is mostly extant (most of her primary/secondary sources are very good). The author does try to pass off the 'debate between Lady Jane & Feckham' at the end of the book as actual transcript but is only a modern day interpretation of events from the point of view of evangelical Christian."},{"Title":"The Practice of Wisdom: A Topical Guide to Proverbs","review":"Ron is to the Bible what Doctor Ruth is to sex.

(and bongos and poetry and black berets)&quot;maybe that's why the title of this book is &quot;memoirs of a beatnik,&quot; and not &quot;memoirs of a beat.&quot; major difference."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Beatnik","review":"Not for the faint of heart, Memoirs of a Beatnik was a written-for-hire erotica piece. Di Prima delivers on raunch, providing a wild tale of sexual exploration that begins with the main character (arguably Di Prima, who drew heavily from personal experience) losing her virginity and ends with the character's first pregnancy. Though sex is certainly the book's most prominent feature, Di Prima, a respected poet and one of the few female Beat writers to make a name for herself, also discusses her own artistic development and describes the life of a starving artist in New York in the fifties. Di Prima's no-holds-barred honesty (the sex is real, with all of the funky smells and personal quirks) and her joyful appreciation for the finer details in life (e.g., a good cup of coffee, well-sugared) separates this book from the murky sea of erotica"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Beatnik","review":"This is basically erotica, but with a beat generation edge. If you want to peer into a sexual encounter with Jack Kerouac or Allen Ginsberg this is for you, but you'd probably be better off reading Off the Road by Carolyn Cassidy. What I loved about this book was the theme of emerging femanism and sexual freedom. DiPrima did a great job giving a sex book a plot and a literary feel."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Beatnik","review":"Compelled to write after reading the other reviews-- I read this book when it was first published and found the sex (and feminism) secondary. This book read like a biography of most white women who chose to leave home and live on the Lower East Side in the 40s, 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s, and even 1990s. What blew me away was the quality of the prose and the parallels with the lives of women (usually White, Italian, or Jewish) I knew who moved there in the 1970s or 80s to recreate themselves. Side by side are Diane di Prima, Madonna di Ciccione (yes The Madonna), and countless women who have had 15 minutes or less of fame in the contemporary media. This book SINGS with the struggles and pain that many women put themselves through to break the yoke of suburbia. Read it and judge for yourself. Unfortunately, it is a tribute to how history repeats itself."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Beatnik","review":"No, it is not porn...but it is definitely not for prudes!This book gave me a gorgeous, ripe, sensual snapshot of the life and the times of Diane DiPrima and the subculture in which she existed.The writing sometimes lacked, but overall - it's a juicy peach with a bittersweet aftertase."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Beatnik","review":"This book is not only a wonderful window into the feminine side of the Beat movement - but also a wonderful way to experience (however vicariously) what Di Prima felt, all of the emotions involved in learning who you are as a woman.Of course there is sex, she gives a depiction of what truly mattered to her as a young woman: the poetry, the culture, the poverty, the sex. This book is not pornography, it's an experience unlike any you'll find in the literary world of today."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Beatnik","review":"I think it's funny that people have complained this book is all about sex. The Beats were all about sex, with drugs, art and music thrown in. (Writing is included in art.) So, I think di Prima is right on to spend so much of this book on sex. Casual sex was a lot less likely in the fifties and sixties. To the Beats, sex was intrinsic to the new world they wanted to create. That said, it would have been nice to hear more about her poetry."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Beatnik","review":"This book is important because it is arguably THE book that defined the role of the female beatnik during the 50s and 60s - free spirit, roaming, finding your own path, etcetera. Even though I have read it through a couple of times though, I must say that the actual structure of the book is lacking something. I would have liked to have read more about her mental interactions with people rather than simply her physical ones - After all, the Beat generation was so much more than simply the birth of the free love movement. Big thumbs up to di Prima for being so blaringly honest, though."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Beatnik","review":"First of all, this book is to the beatnik generation what reality TV is to reality. Reviewers who think this book has anything at all to say about beatniks or feminism have a serious reading comprehension problem.This book is erotica and absolutely nothing else. If believing the book has something to do with beatniks and feminism and coming of age makes you feel less guilty about reading it, that's your gig. But let's try to be real here. It's erotica. That's all.Also, reviewers who equate erotica with pornography need to get a grip. There is nothing destructive or demeaning about this book. It is about getting healthily aroused.So, with that context and understanding, how well does the book perform its intended purpose? For me, not too well. It's mildly arousing, but never reaches a decent level of intensity; each encounter seems interchangeable. I put the book away after about 40 pages and see no reason to return to it. But for someone who likes their erotica mild and not too intense (probably the majority of the population), this may really float their boat.Because the book's intention is \\"mainstream erotica for the masses,\\" both male and female, I think it pretty much achieves that purpose, and that's why I give it four stars. But if you prefer your erotica to have a bit of intensity and variety, you would do better to look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Beatnik","review":"Listen, if you're looking for a historic autobiography, this isn't the book. I read Carolyn Cassady's \\"Off the Road\\" and was expecting something like that. DiPrima is an incredible writer, and provides what might be a significant historical snapshot of sexual revolution, but it's in a completely different vein. She'd make \\"Penthouse letters\\" blush with this stuff. An awesome read. I read the whole thing in one sitting. Do not read in public. You'll feel like everyone is staring at you."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Beatnik","review":"I picked this book up because of my interest in the Beats, feminist literature, and the American immigrant experience. I was disappointed on all three counts. First, the only thing Beat about it is the era depicted, though I think it is far more about 1969, the year of its publication, than the '50s. Secondly, writing explicitly about sex does not make a writer a feminist just because she also happens to be female. It merely makes her a female pornographer. Thirdly, what little is mentioned of di Prima's heritage seems somehow pathetic and ashamed. Too bad. I doubt I will go on to read other di Prima work, but I suppose there must be something there in order for her to have been so highly regarded. This book is a waste of time and money. How was it picked up by such a major publisher as Penguin? Could it be that important an artifact of the '60s? It offers us nothing of the Beat Generation, and is an embarrassment to it."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Beatnik","review":"Diana Di Prima, an honest female voice in a literary landscape that was a man's world. She sprung from the words of a \\"beat\\" time. She was \\"beat\\" in the purest way. I cannot say I expected what I got when I bought this amazing book...but I was changed, transported, illuminated. She is an absolute heroine of her time. Her words are golden and they stick. Read this."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Beatnik","review":"When I ordered this book I expected it to be nothing more than a slightly cleaned up recital of the beat life. My uncles told me how it was growing up about this time. They didn't tell me about this aspect of the beat life. At first I thought, this book is mere porno until I realized that this was just one facet of the beat life. An aspect that every generation has to deal with. No different, no better or no worse in learning on the run.

Would that I had such awareness when I entered the physical realm! This is not a non-fiction account of a literary group, but rather a slice of sensual life in an era now known as &quot;beat.&quot; Any one book by an author should not be expected to stand alone as representational of a writer's life/work, and we should enjoy this volume for what it is, or what our imaginations can make of it. Read di Prima's poetry, her prose, immerse yourself in her word, before you judge. We don't have to like every book to know it's literary worth."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Beatnik","review":"I was disappointed with this book, but that could very well be my own fault because of the expectations I took with me when I first started it. I had picked up this book in hopes of finding the female version of On The Road. I wanted a female artistic rendering of the period and art and philosophy and what her thoughts were on what she went through. Instead I found a mediocre telling of sexual encounters. I understand that sexual freedom was a big part of the Beat experience and I certainly have no problem with reading about that aspect of Di Prima's life, I was just disappointed that she basically made it appear that her role in the whole Beat movement had nothing much to do with art or philosophy, but more to do with being a sexual object. Isn't that what women fight against these days?I'm willing to admit that my own prejudices and opinions and desires are a big part of what made me not like this book. I guess I would suggest that you read it with an open mind and without a lot of great expectations. The writing is ok but not great. The stories are a little on the boring side. There isn't a lot of introspection or thoughts on life and politics and poetry. It seems more to me that her editors told her sex would sell and they cut everything else of any interest or importance out of the book. So to me, the book is far too shallow to be something I'd recommend to anyone else."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Beatnik","review":"This book has been both torn apart and praised but I seem to view it as something other than what most others do and in that I find entertainment and an intersting (if somewhat oversexed) version of her life. But that is the crux of the matter...it is entertaining and well written. Keep this in mind and you will enjoy it."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Beatnik","review":"I should begin this review by stating that it is biased. I do not like Diane Di Prima's writing. I do not like Diane Di Prima. I spoke to her on the phone for about an hour and you know what? I still don't like her. I wish I did. I wish I could sit and read and enjoy the works of a woman who managed to pull off what no other woman really did as a woman of the beat generation. Most women of the beat generation are associated with it because, though they may be talented, they were married to Kerouac or Cassady or were some great feminine ideal or something like that. Not Di Prima. As she tells it, she had to give up most of her femininity in order to take her place as a Beat Gen author. That deserves respect.That said, \\"Memoirs of a Beatnik\\" was written to make money. Sex sells. If you are searching for the truth you won't find it here really. But it is worth reading. The reader must take into account the fact that it is not about truth, but about the exploitation of an image of a generation. I found it to be pretty insghtful as far as what people expected of a beatnik book (as this was already covered by another reviewer I will not go into the differences between beatnik and Beat, but suffice it to say, in my opinion, yes, this is a beatnik book). This is what people thought the beat lifestyle was about. This is what caused them to hire Beatniks for entertainment at parties. I think it is definitely worth reading if only to look at the whole thing through that sort of a light - what beatnik as an image meant. And most of all, we should not critisize Di Prima for wanting to make money. She saw how to do and she did. That's all right in my book. Overall she is a woman to be respected, even if I don't like her poetry and find her to be a rude and abrasive person (both of which are traits that I think made her able to succeed)."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Beatnik","review":"Sorry, but this is both an unimportant work, and pornographic (when every chapter revolves around one sex scene, I think it is safe to accuse a book of being pornographic). Understandably, it has been written that this book was intended to be exploitative, and di Prima wrote it because she needed money. Great. I hold nothing against writers doing what they need to do to make a living. If I recall correctly, Stephen King got his start writing articles for Playboy. With all that said, however, I think it is also important not to hold a book to unrealistic expectations, simply because of the author. Porn, porn, porn. Let's see: chapter 1, sex with Ivan. Chapter 2, recollection of the first time she had sex with Ivan. Chapter 3, sex with Robin (a man in love with Ivan). Chapter 4, Sex with Tomi (a female friend). Chapter 5, Tomi has sex with Tomi's brother. Chapter 6, Sex with 4 other women. Chapter 7, sex with Tomi's father Serge. Chapter 8, sex with young Jack and some guy with big ears while runaway girl watches. And so it goes, through all the chapters. So, if you're looking for a \\"spank\\" book, then check it out. If you're looking for a book about the beats from a woman's perspective (as it is boldly proclaimed on the front cover), look somewhere else."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Beatnik","review":"This book was loaned to me by a friend who swore that I would have to read it \\"with one hand free\\". While the story is very erotic, and the sex scenes are very real and compelling, I would not wholly agree with that statement. This, in part, is due to the fact that love scenes between men and women no longer do anything for me sexually. I prefer erotic writings between two women, and, though there were a few added to this book to spice things up (for me anyways) there were definitely not enough to arouse me to free one hand.The story, however, is well written. It was an easy, delightful read, one that I polished off in two sittings. It catalogues the life of a young writer coming into her own sexuality, seizing whatever moments of transient, sensual bliss that she comes across. This book is somewhat autobiographical, cultivated from Di Prima's own experiences as a college drop out who, annoyed with the system of 1950\`s education, decided to instead pursue writing full time. The main character in the story parallels her life to such a degree that the author had even named her heroine \\"Di Prima\\". The character Di Prima also flits about in the underworld of 1950's New York, inhabiting skeevy, infested pads with multiple people, coffee houses, book stores, parks, smoked out bar scenes, forests, fields, and (on one occasion) a country farm. Where the truth is obscured in this bohemian world of sex, drugs, and (pre) rock and roll is only up to the reader's decision. I know little about Di Prima myself, so I like to look at this as a fairly inventive, fictional piece of writing.This is definitely a worthwhile read. I must admit, were I more inclined to heterosexual love scenes, I would have, indeed, read this with one hand free, seeing as how in every single chapter is a different, vivid description of one of her many sexual encounters. If you are inclined to beat writing, this is a canon of that genre. If you are a fan of erotica, how have you not read this one yet? Read it in a room, alone, or with a partner.

Errors from previous editions were not fixed, information was withheld, and updates were not provided. Once this was the BIBLE of Hot Wheels collecting, now it's merely a book with decent (and old) pictures."},{"Title":"Tomart's Price Guide to Hot Wheels Collectibles","review":"How amazing that a toy such as Hot Wheels should create political dividing lines, pro or against Strauss. Like it or not, as Hot Wheels guides go, this one is the best of the bunch. While improvement in several areas could be accomplished, clearly this is the best &quot;one-stop&quot; source for Hot Wheels info. No book is ever going to give you the up-to-the-minute value of a collectible. That is impossible. Use the pictures to identify and the prices as a rough GUIDE and you will not be disappointed. Cudo's to the Strauss' for doing a third edition, flawed or not."},{"Title":"Tomart's Price Guide to Hot Wheels Collectibles","review":"It is amusing how many people have so much distaste for the Strauss' and their Hot Wheels book. As far as I am concerned, like it or not, this book is *the* guide for Hot Wheels. The Parker book is a paperweight, more suited for propping up a keyboard than pricing out cars, especially redlines.Granted, the pricing on cars in the Strauss book are many times not very accurate, and sometimes grossly mislisted, but it is the base for the market at this point in time. Use the book as a GUIDE, as it was meant to be used and not as a the do-all, end-all bible of market pricing, and you'll be fine. Bring it with you to shows and learn from it. It will give you a good reference point on pricing so that you will know the difference between a $3 car, a $30 car and a $300 car. Don't be upset to see cars selling for quite a bit more or much less than the book has them listed. It is only a base of reference and a tool to help learn and distinguish some of the cars you wouldn't normally get to see.Remember, it is just a guide."},{"Title":"Tomart's Price Guide to Hot Wheels Collectibles","review":"A good book to go to when collecting Hot Wheels.

Definatly a buyer for hot wheels collecters!!!"},{"Title":"Tomart's Price Guide to Hot Wheels Collectibles","review":"I found the third edition to be an improvement over the second edition in terms of the prices of cars listed, but still off in many instances. As a price guide, it allows the reader to see the relation of different colors and variations to others, but the prices themselves are not, and cannot be expected to be, current. If it takes about a year to revise and publish a book, how can that price guide have &quot;current values&quot; in it? Before criticizing this book, and it's author, I think Hot Wheels collectors should consider the huge effort of time and organization in producing a book of this type. It is a massive undertaking. As a general guide to the world of Hot Wheels, this stands as a great example of a fairly complete, authoritative manual to this ever-changing, (usually appreciating) toy collectible. No matter how you slice it, this is THE Book for Hot Wheels collectors. I like the layout, the photos, and the historical information that introduces the book. As a collector I am intrigued by the history of this legendary toy brand! It is easy to criticize, but I'd like to ask the collectors that are overly critical of this book: &quot;How knowledgable would you be WITHOUT the Tomart guide?&quot;"},{"Title":"Tomart's Price Guide to Hot Wheels Collectibles","review":"Two words describe this book: essential, and outstanding. Not only is it an invaluable resource for those sorted greedheads and bean-counters out there who like to know the value of their collections down to every dime, nickel and penny, but for the rest of us who engage in the collecting of Hot Wheels for the sheer LOVE of it, this book serves almost as a muse for the hobby . . .enticing us to continue the search in an all but impossible quest of obtaining every one. While frequently criticized for not being entirely &quot;accurate&quot; and &quot;current&quot; with listed prices, I have found through my own experience that the prices give you a fairly good &quot;ballpark&quot; figure to know whether or not you're getting ripped off. As with all collectibles, beauty and worth is in the eye of the beholder. On this note, this book is ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL if you use Ebay or other online marketplaces to look for cars.More than anything, this book is a superb gallery of Hot Wheels cars so that even if you'll never own them all, you can at least SEE what they look like. As all collectors know, there will never be enough Sky Show Deoras or rear surfboard Beach Bombs to satisfy us all, but with this book you can at least see what you're missing.My advice? Simple. Do not hesitate to buy this book. You will not regret it (unless of course you go over your credit limit and the bank hooks you with fees!), and you will be guaranteed with hour upon hour of satisfaction with the love of these little cars that only true collectors understand."},{"Title":"Tomart's Price Guide to Hot Wheels Collectibles","review":"After perusing the price guides at most major bookstores, I found Tomart's Price Guide to have the best pictures, most accurate pricing, and easiest reading. Most guides want you to find the car then have to find the price in the back of the book. Tomart's has the prices with the photos. The photos were also the best quality and in color. This was a big deciding factor for me when I decided to shell out my $29.95! There were a few model variations(i.e.Ambulance 1792-1991 with plastic siren) that wern't included but should have been. This is forgivable however, given the book's quality. Keep up the good work Tomart!

When the 1st book came out, it was the only game in town, so HotWheel collectors used it to identify cars, and the prices were also used as a starting point in negotiations for trades, sales etc. When the second book was printed, there was already some competition for Strauss, in the form of Bob Parkers book, The Complete Book of HotWheels. The 2cd edition of Tomarts was just a reprint of the first, with the new cars added BUT the prices had not been updated much, which was a major disappointment to me and thousands of other collectors I spoke with about the hobby. When the third edition was anticipated, we all hoped that the pricing would be updated to reflect more accurate &quot;Real World&quot; pricing. Guess what? BIG DISAPPOINTMENT! The prices in this edition are so far off base, that it should be a CRIME to call this a Price Guide! The book is adequate as an identification tool, but a price guide it is NOT! Mike Strauss portrays himself to be a collector, but how many collectors produce limited edition HotWheels cars and sell them for a profit? Look up his cars in his book and you will see the point I am trying to make. A dealer should not be an author of a book aimed at HotWheels collectors. Mike and his wife are in this hobby to make money, so how can he write an unbiased book on HotWheel collecting? I am very disillusioned by this 3rd edition, and as a HotWheel Collector since 1967, cannot recommend this book to my fellow collectors. If you want a good book on HW collecting, buy Bob Parkers book, ISBN: 076430612X which is much better and also available here on AMAZON.COM"},{"Title":"Tomart's Price Guide to Hot Wheels Collectibles","review":"It is really sad when a guide is published and does not contain all the Hot Wheels that have been produced through the years.

The book's editor, Albert N. Greco covers the book industry in the first chapter. Tables are included to serve as a reference for the discussion. Historically the industry is examined and the various genres are considered.In the second chapter the magazine industry is taken up. \\"Makhazhin\\" is the Arabic term from which the periodical derived its name, which originally meant a place where goods or supplies (especially ammunitions were stored)\\" (p. 29). To make the point that the information age has cause prolific output, a niche market is cited. There are an estimated 3,500 medical periodicals (p. 35). That was as of the publication date of this book. The number has probably grown signifcantly by now.Chapter three looks at the organizational structure of newspapers and how convergence is altering that. The discussion of emerging delivery platforms continues in chapter four as the recorded music industry is analyzed. Film is examined in chapter five and radio in the sixth chapter. Broadcast television and the cable industries are covered. John V. Pavlik writes a futuristic chapter on the new media. In that chapter, Ed Roberts observes, \\"A computer gives the average person, a high school freshman, the power to do things in a week that all the mathematicians who ever lived until 30 years ago couldn't do\\" (p. 214).The book concludes with Jeffrey H. Brody's projections about the Internet industry. One drawback of the book as a whole is that significant portions are outdated. Predictions are made about Y2K, 2001, 2007 et cetera. The historical aspects of the content is still valid. Overall the book's content will add to one's understanding of the subject matter."},{"Title":"Transcontinental Railway Strategy 1869-1893: A Study of Businessmen","review":"Julius Grodinsky is generally regarded as one of the best financial analysts of the boom period in America's economy (1869-70) which gave rise to the great transcontinentals. And with good reason: his writing is clear, his analysis succint, and his scholarship impeccable. Unfortunately, this, one of his best works on the subject, is trapped in a poorly offset paperback version. The maps, crucial to following his writing, are muddy and indistinct, photocopied into oblivion at 600 dpi. One bi-page mapsheet even has a gap where (apparently) the copier couldn't spread the binding of the original far enough apart to lay on the scanner and capture! Point size of the text is reduced to fit into the new format and at times is blurred. Paper quality is poor, and the cover is too light a weight to hold the book's shape after reading. Overall, a very poor quality reprint of a classic work, which does not merit it's high price. My recommendation is to pursue a copy of the earlier hardback edition from Univ. of Pennsylvania Press at a used bookstore instead, this unfortunately having gone out of print."},{"Title":"Handbook of Fiber Optic Data Communication","review":"This is one of the best books I have ever read on Fiber Optic communications. Very up-to-date and in-depth. It is a definite book for your fiber optics books library."},{"Title":"Handbook of Fiber Optic Data Communication","review":"This is a good book that goes beyone those intro to fiber optics books (that left out the equations and engineering technologies). It's basically a non-equation book for engineers, rather than techs or curious fans of fiber optics (it does get a wee bit complicated).This book goes into more detail on fiber optic components, applications (networks), manufacturing (packaging, semiconductor fab techniques etc) and touches on curring edge devices (well, the book is 2 years old...).I'd recommend it if you want to know what your engineers and boss are talking about. It's not the book to grab if you're going to start designing routers or waveguides (you'd probably know the stuff in the book if you're given the job to do such things...)"},{"Title":"The Splendor of the Temple","review":"This book has innumerable quality photographs. It has more information than Edersheim's, which also contains the temple services etc. Its a little hard to find things since the chapters don't have subtitles within them.

There is information on every court, internal gate, external gate, the Holy & Most Holy Places, etc. Well worth the price."},{"Title":"The Splendor of the Temple","review":"I cannot recommend this book too highly to readers intrigued by the decribed structure and functionality of the Herodian Temple in Jerusalem. The author has done two magnificent tasks:first, creating a scale model of Herod's Temple based upon descriptions from Flavius Josephus, the Midrash, and Scripture.second, writing a considered text to accompany excellent photos of his model, intelligible to anyone who can read English.His text and terrific color photos are unencumbered by \\"should-be\\" tradition, and the book makes a compact valucable addition to any Jerusalem scholar's library.Freemasons should note the shape of the main building from above. Tau for two?"},{"Title":"The Splendor of the Temple","review":"I do not have the ability to judge the acuracy of the written contents of this book but Alec Garrard's architectural model is simply amazing. Garrard spent three years on research and fourteen years constructing this twenty foot by twelve foot recreation of Herod's Temple. \\"The Splendor of the Temple\\" is beautifully photographed and it is a real joy to own. This book is tribute to one skilled craftsman's love of a subject. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Splendor of the Temple","review":"Mr. Garrard has done a labor of love and a remarkable service in constructing his 100:1 scale model of Herod's temple mount. The book is beautiful with many pictures of the model that make you feel as though you are helicoptering above Jerusalem in the time of Christ. There are also many helpful maps that show the layout of the temple itself as well as the Herodian extentions to the temple plaza. While on a recent trip to Israel, I found the book very helpful in visualizing what the old temple would have been like in pre-Dome-of-the-Rock times."},{"Title":"The Splendor of the Temple","review":"For those of you who are interested in old archeological times and histories, this books for you. Written by Mr. Alec Garrard, he gives you a backstory from the time of King Solomon's first temple and to the Babylonian destruction to the return of the Jews to Israel after the Persian victory. He gives you step by step time frames and a chronological timeline of it's entire history even up to muslim rule and finally to the rebirth of the state of Israel. Plenty of pictures on almost every page with closeups and his own miniature scale model of Herod's temple and temple mount built from years of research and investigation. The man constructed every tiny brick in his family's ceramic ovens to complete his rendition of Herod's temple.

This master of humor (esp of the Southern border state variety), makes the halls of Rosehaven Convalescent Home ring with laughter, debate, religious fervor, and general hilarity. Maudie Lowe and Beatrice Satterwhite can't agree on whether Clara removes her glass eyeball at night. Lil Olive won't give up her driving license. Period.I still think Walking Across Egypt and Raney are Edgerton's best ones ever, but Lunch at the Piccadilly is pushing at the gates, close on their heels.You'll love it. If by some bizarre chance you haven't read Edgerton before, you have a rare treat in store."},{"Title":"Lunch At The Piccadilly","review":"I cannot remember when I've gained so much wisdom from such a small novel. In his first book in several years, Clyde Edgerton tells a haunting tale of Aunt Lil, her nephew Carl and L. Ray Flowers along with several other memorable characters, several who &quot;live&quot; at Rosehaven Convalescence Center in Listre, North Carolina. The time is the present; the movie &quot;O Brother Where Art Thou&quot; is still playing at the local theatre. The themes are timeless, however: old age with all its problems and sorrows, missed opportunities, the ills of fundamentalist religion, the warehousing of those who can no longer look after themselves--and trite as it may seem-- the redeeming power of both music and love.Truth breaks through on every page. Homecooked, delicious meals have been replaced by cafeteria lunches and/or-- heaven help us-- fast food chains. On religion, Reverend L. Ray wonders why the local Baptist church sends missionaries to Alaska , England and South Africa. &quot;It seems like church members often have a desparate need to be unaware of the local needs of the local wrecks of local women stacked along the local grim halls of local nursing homes, places in conditions far sadder than merry Rosehaven--places like Shady Rest.&quot; (All too soon L. Ray will witness firsthand the awfulness of Shady Rest.) Then there is the sad truth of the lot of women like Aunt Lil, women who because of their age and community, had their entire lives determined by whom they selected for a husband. Neither Aunt Lil nor her friends got out of a bad marriages. &quot;Until death do us part&quot; was taken quite literally, often to women's great detriment. Edgerton with much grace and compassion depicts the truth of these women like Lil-- they always outlive their spouses-- who are in out and of nursing homes and often in and out of reality because of advancing dementia. Sure, the author makes much gentle humor of Aunt Lil's driving skills or lack thereof. But she also says on a rare visit to her old apartment, &quot;I used to come home. . . Now I visit home.&quot; She describes life in a nursing home as &quot;life after life.&quot; Finally it is no accident that the novel ends with Carl, who is an altogether decent man, feeding the words to L. Ray of one of the saddest bluegrass songs ever written, &quot;Rank Stranger.&quot;This gem of a novel with make you smile, even laugh out loud in places, but be careful. It will ultimately break your heart, particularly if you have just spoken to a parent who isn't sure what day of the week it is or who talks to you about you in the third person.One final note: Mr. Edgerton has Reverend Flowers come up with the plan to unite churches and nursing homes as one where &quot;The First Breakfast&quot; would be served instead of &quot;The Last Supper.&quot; While this may be a novel idea, Messers Edgerton and Flowers have been trumped by a progressive thinking Presbyterian congregation in Atlanta that has turned their sanctuary into a dormitory for homeless men during the week. On Sundays volunteers come in and remove the beds and install the pews for the morning service. Sometimes churches do really wonderful things."},{"Title":"Lunch At The Piccadilly","review":"If you're a fan of literature that captures dialogue, settings, and people (think McCrae's BARK OF THE DOGWOOD or Flagg's FRIED GREEN TOMATOES) then this is the book for you. Edgerton's ear for dialect and inflection is unsurpassed and this funny, charming, irreverant, and wonderful look at human nature is not to be missed. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Lunch At The Piccadilly","review":"So again we find ourselves in (imaginary) Listre, North Carolina where a new cache of characters keep popping up in Edgerton's world. In this (his most recent) novel, Edgerton in about 250 pages expresses the humor residing in having the audacity to be relieved that an elderly family member has passed on.Carl's Aunt Lil must stop driving--she runs red lights, is overcome with brief spells of aphasia (&quot;Which one is he?&quot; she wonders at her nephew), and can't really see over the dashboard. However, since the government saw fit to give her a license and hadn't taken it away yet, she would keep driving until they did. Fortunately for Carl she passes before he can put his foot down.Is that what we all fear? Having to be the one to snatches away what independence the elderly have left? Although making a point was unlikely to be the purpose of this book, Edgerton softly compares which way is better to go: falling from the toilet pulling a call cord for help, or in a car with old friends running red lights--laughing.The crop of secondary characters tend to outshine the primaries in Edgerton books and this one is no different. I found the eloquent, yet grating, Reverend L. Ray to be an absolutely brilliant addition to the storyline. He reminded me of a ill-conceived cross between Al Sharpton, Jesse Jackson, and...well, Colonel Sanders:&quot;O God in us all, may we embrace the rooms of refuge food. Real food, cheap food, food served by people with wet rags under their arms. I eat; I cheat. I forge; I gorge. I taste; I waste. Waffle House, Huddle House, Puddle House, Muddle House...&quot; he begins his blessing.The cursing one-eyed Beatrice, little Maudie, and Clara that spend their time on the front porch of the &quot;convalescent&quot; home with Lil evoked for me memories of Huck Finn and Mark Twain. How they yearned for adventure and ended up finding it when they least expected it!I found the theme to be soothing rather than morbid: relief comes from death. Edgerton did a good job of finding humor in old age and seemingly in the process comes to terms with his own aging.I liked it--it was a good quick read. I believe it to be yet another Edgerton book that would be better viewed onscreen rather than in absorbed through print."},{"Title":"Lunch At The Piccadilly","review":"What a wonderful idea! Those of us with aged parents know how often loneliness is mentioned as a component of their lives. L.Ray Flowers and Lil and friends come up with an idea to cure that loneliness-unite the churches and nursing homes-think globally, act locally.Edgerton has created a group of old people with spunk and humor and love of life. He has given Lil's nephew, Carl, the patience and kindness to truly spend real time with his aunt and her friends. The description of Carl bringing his Aunt back from &quot;jail in South Carolina&quot; should be read by everyone who is called upon to care for an elderly person. It is a model of humor, creativeness and love."},{"Title":"Lunch At The Piccadilly","review":"I have every Edgerton book and each is a delicious little gem to be enjoyed over and over - except &quot;Lunch at the Piccadilly.&quot; I was shocked and disappointed with this book as I found it meanders at an incredible slow and directionless pace. Reminds me of an assignment I had in a college writing class to write a descriptive paper about watching someone eat a sandwich. It might be a good writing exercise, but to the reader, it's pretty dang boring. In fact, I found &quot;Lunch at the Piccadilly&quot; so boring I quit reading two thirds of the way into the book. Life is too short to read boring books! I highly recommend Edgerton's other books, but this one is not worth the time or money. Sorry, Clyde."},{"Title":"Lunch At The Piccadilly","review":"The title for my review epitomizes Edgerton's writing style and story in \\"Lunch at the Picadilly.\\"This is a story of the subtle relationships that emerge as we all go through the different stages of our life.Edgerton once again manages to create inventive characters and throws them together for humor and thought provoking moments. There is a little mystery, a little love, a bit of saddness but most of all truth.You don't have to be from the south to enjoy this novel (but it definitely helps)! This particular edition is great with question and answers from the author at the back and questions designed for book club reading.I think you will find a little of yourself or someone you love when you pick up this book. A great short read. Perfect for lunchtime."},{"Title":"Lunch At The Piccadilly","review":"I enjoyed every page of this novel, but found the ending was flat. The main character, Carl, doesn't seem to have changed or learned anything in particular about life. He has a few insights along the way that are interesting and I liked his relationship with his aunt and the other old ladies. I'm just not sure what the point of the novel was."},{"Title":"Lunch At The Piccadilly","review":"I can totally see this as a Hallmark film presentation, because all the qualities of their brand of entertainment are there. I used to visit my grandparents in nursing homes with my mother when I was younger, but the author of this book reminded me of everything I tried desperately to forget during those visits: the undeniable, inescapable truth that a lot of us soon come to know at some point in our lives. Clyde Edgerton paints a painful and very often whimsical verbal portrait of senior citizens and the many plights they are burdened with. Full of sometimes annoying characters (such as Reverend L. Ray) and lovable ones like sweet Aunt Lil and her loyal nephew Carl, this book will have you laughing, crying, and thinking all at once. It may also remind you of someone you know all too well in this bevy of colorfully delightful characters. This was my first Clyde Edgerton novel, and surely not my last. He made me see the retirement home set in a new and respectful light. :-)"},{"Title":"Lunch At The Piccadilly","review":"Really I give it a 3 1/2What I enjoyed about this novel were all the funny, quirky (many true)comments from Aunt Lil, Maudie, Mr. Flowers, Beatrice, and Clara. The tangents and the out of no where questions kept the topics (aging, nursing homes, and loss of independence and functions) from being too depressing. Some of my favorite moments was the initial driving scene (why are my feet outside?), stealing the car and wanting to buy a flag for Mr. Flower's movement, the escalator, William and Lee, and the crow tattos.Altough at some points these comments/scenes crossed the humor side and sadded me b/c they showed readers instances of dementia. Like when Lil did not know who Carl was and when she insisted she was in a jail in South Carolina that looked exactly like her room at Rosehaven. Carl handled this situation so beautifully and sweetly. He never belittled her, always made time for her, and treated her with respect and kindness. At times Carl did feel burdened and felt guilty for thinking these thoughts, but the author and readers understand these are natural feelings.What I did not like about this novel was there were too many loose ends and characters. I didn't really understand Mr. Flower's mysterious and criminal past, what was true, especially with Mr. Flowers and Darla as a young teenagers. And I didn't understand how eventually he was kicked out. I also did not understand what was the point of bringing up conversations with Carrie and Latricia. I saw some interactions with Carrie and the residents but not enough for me to care about her. Same with the physical therapist and Darla. I felt like these extra scenes distracted from the main part of the novel. I would have preferred it if the author had dropped these characters and focused more on the main group of characters in the novel.What I found uplifting about this book is this strong desire for these women to live life. All wanted adventure. As soon as Carl let Aunt Lil drive in the initial scene, she said \\"Where's the exit?.....I've got to get on the highway.\\" She didn't want to play it safe and just drive around the parking deck. That's boring and it leads nowhere. She wanted adventure. When the women and Mr. Flowers were talking on the porch about his movement, the women all wanted to know when they would be traveling. Aunt Lil pictured herself going on an adventure to the Everglades. What I found thought provoking was these women wanted this excitement and adventure but were physcially unable to go, yet characters like Carl and Annie could go on these adventures yet were too scared to try and led these unfulfilled lives."},{"Title":"Lunch At The Piccadilly","review":"Well... it was okay. It was a real *nice* story, and made me want to do what the protagonist did, which is go hang out in a nursing home, and only partly because of the good karma :)The characters were interesting and I would have liked to learn more about *most* of them... but I often got confused about who was who. There could have been more detail.There were some minor conflicts, which IMO didn't get resolved, and if this book is character- rather than plot-driven, the characters should really have been explored in more depth.It made me laugh, but really didn't make me think."},{"Title":"Lunch At The Piccadilly","review":"This book was my book club's selection for the month. It was one month I wished I would have skipped. Where the book is well-written, the story itself is very sad. There is a saying....\\"don't judge a book by its cover\\"...The cover is very misleading. The lives of the elderly women are far from quaint lunches and a wild joy ride. For someone with an elderly relative with declining health and who knows the toll that it has on caregivers, this was too much realism."},{"Title":"Lunch At The Piccadilly","review":"Carl Turnage's lot in life seems to be caring for the old people in his family. His Aunt Lil is the only one alive from his mother's generation and now he is tending to her while she's in a nursing home, trying to recover from a fall. The home is inhabited by a bunch of quirky people, including a foul-mouthed old lady with a glass eye and a preacher who wishes to turn churches into nursing homes (nurches). Some of the book is hilarious, such as a joyride that Aunt Lil takes, and some of it is achingly sad. The ending kind of fizzled for me, and left me with an empty, unsatisfied feeling."},{"Title":"Lunch At The Piccadilly","review":"Sometimes hilarious, sometimes painful, usually both, Edgerton's affectionate portrait of old age charms the reader with Southern cornpone humor and quirky, but subtle characterizations. Carl Turnage, bachelor awning salesman, on the doorstep of middle age, and self-conscious about his lack of height and high voice, has always taken care of the women in his family.He was an only child, doted on by his mother and her two childless sisters, but now Aunt Lil is all that's left. Lil has had a bad fall and landed in the Rosehaven Convalescence Home, a pleasant convivial place, as such places go. Though many get around in wheelchairs, the patients are at least mobile (sicker ones are shipped out).Carl is shocked at his favorite aunt's rapid decline since her fall, but Lil still enjoys planning - and executing - outings, and talks of going home. After one particularly harrowing experience, Carl resolves to speak to her about giving up driving, but somehow Lil evades this conversation. When not lunching out with Carl, Lil likes to sit on the porch, smoke a cigarette, and hatch schemes with fellow residents.One of these - a delightful plan to make churches and nursing homes interchangeable - inspires the excitable L. Ray Flowers, an itinerant preacher in temporary residence recovering from an injury. Though put-off by the preacher's volubility, Carl, too, is inspired by the man. He takes up the country music he's always loved and joins the preacher in weekly performances. But time brings decline in a place like Rosehaven and the playful interlude can't last.Edgerton (\\"Raney,\\" \\"Walking Across Egypt,\\" \\"Where Trouble Sleeps\\"), switches points of view to reveal inner turmoil - Lil's sad secret, Carl's insecurities, dreams, and brief lapses from sainthood. The strong ending is both sad and heart-warming. As usual, Edgerton's touch is deft."},{"Title":"Lunch At The Piccadilly","review":"This book is a wonderful story about the devotion of a young man, Carl Turnage, to his Aunt Lil, who has been put into a convalescent home called Rosehaven. It is full of interesting characters who for one reason or another are her fellow residents. One resident in particular, L. Ray Flowers, a former preacher, decides to begin a movement to make churches and nursing homes interchangeable. Aunt Lil and her lady friends are taken in by Mr. Flowers' idea and decide to help him.Carl is a nice young man who tries to both help and protect his aunt. She still feels she can do all the things she did before, including driving her car. Carl just can't find a way to tell her that her driving days are over. In the end, she has a stoke and dies.This is a brief peek into the lives of those who are confined to a convalescent/nursing home. It shows the different ways by which they cope with a situation which is not ever what they'd imagined would be the end of their lives.Alma Winters, Author-Once Upon a Time Tales"},{"Title":"Lunch At The Piccadilly","review":"Finding gentle humor in a nursing home setting is a gift Clyde Edgerton has utilized beautifully and lovingly in this book. Amusingly outr&eacute; characters (always an Edgerton watermark) thrive at life's end in an all-too-real warehouse for the elderly and infirm. There's even a quirky preacher (not at all in the southern fundamentalist tradition) with a mildly sordid past and the grand idea of combining churches and nursing homes into one institution and inviting all faiths to participate. His small sermons throughout the novel are a definite high point as are the songs he composes with protagonist Carl during visits to his dying aunt. Again as with all Edgerton tales, the dialogue and descriptions redole Southern grace and charm. Readers of earlier Edgerton such as RANEY, WALKING ACROSS EGYPT, and THE FLOATPLANE NOTEBOOKS know what to expect and will delight in this work, which to new readers, will serve splendidly as an introduction. If you enjoy gentle humor, well-written, such as is found in the novels of Miss Read, Philip Gulley, and Jan Karon, you'll like Edgerton too."},{"Title":"Lunch At The Piccadilly","review":"Gentle story of folks in a nursing home.

It gives a believable techno-plot without descending into techno-babble. The background of TV (digital and otherwise) with all its technological, societal and cultural &quot;glory&quot; is observed and argued well. The plot zips along for the most part. Silicon Valley is represented realistically and fun to read about if you're at all familiar with it (I live around there and work there).Unfortunately, the book's shortcomings are made all the more painful in light of its good qualities. While the author valiantly tries to breathe life and individuality into his characters (such as Armenian heritage, Silicon Valley foibles and a folio artist as one of the main characters), the characters ultimately remain fairly flat. Story lines are picked up and discarded haphazardly (such as the protagonist's budding romance as well as his wife's &quot;love&quot; interest). Family dynamics enter into the plot without ever being developed sufficiently. And, please please please, dear author, never ever again try to write another sex scene. Yours are flat, unappealing and, worst of all, unintentionally comical.All told, the author seems more at home with things than with people. He does much better with plot than with characters. But even so, the plot seems to get away from him in the last 75 pages or so, relying too much on often unrealistic escalation for thrills and stereotypes and cliches for plot resolution.Coming from a novice author, this is an admirable effort. I hope he tries again. On balance, a pretty good read."},{"Title":"Blackout","review":"Every once and a while a whale of a thriller plot combines difficult technological issues and doesn't fall flat on its face. Blackout not only passes that test it gets straight A's both in its coverage of technical details and in drawing the reading in to its plot. Digital TV, which I know more than anyone wants to know about, is a complex issue - so far mainly a technical, political and economic disaster. In Ward's book, just like real life, American's are addicted to their good old analog TV, until - unlike real life - Ward's TVs begin to blow up. While this may sound fantastic, Ward manages to weave in accurate details without leaving the reader behind. Indeed, once he establishes his characters and the technology background, the pages turn faster and faster until the reader slams into the conclusion. In sum, an easy to read beginning that draws the reader into an exciting techno-thriller plot."},{"Title":"Blackout","review":"This book grabs you from the beginning and doesn't let go.

This is a plus for those who are still learning the math and the programming skills necessary to solve astronomy problems, because Meeus spends some effort making sure the reader is aware of common beginner's mistakes. Otherwise, the text is packed full of practical details on the computation of planetary and lunar positions, calendar and time problems, and various miscellaneous good-to-know methods, like interpolation and curve fitting. He introduces the older Ephemeris Time system, which is easier to deal with than the new relativity-based time systems currently used by the big Almanacs. Most of the formulae for converting coordinates from one system to another, precession, planetary abberations, calendars, and similar, which do not change much over time, are perfectly accurate and useful. The planetary orbital models he gives are the older theories of Newcomb, Leverrier, and Gaillot of about a century ago, truncated to keep them short enough for publication, and to fit into the memories of those programmable calculators. The lunar model is, I think, Brown's of the same time frame. The truncation is severe enough that the positions produced by the formulae are only good to a few arcseconds accuracy, worse for the outer planets, and he gives no orbit for Pluto at all. The book is relatively small in size, which is nice.

Why? Here's what she had to say on her website.\\"The Time Has Come, the Walrus Said......to talk about Little House. Many of you have written to ask when my next Martha or Charlotte book will be published. Plans have been in flux for over a year now, but it's time to address your questions.As I mentioned here recently, HarperCollins has launched new paperback editions of Laura's books which feature photographic covers and no longer contain the Garth Williams illustrations. (The Garth Williams art will remain in the hardcover editions and the colorized paperback editions.)There are also going to be some changes in the other Little House series. The Martha, Charlotte, Caroline, and Rose books are being reissued in abridged editions. If you wish to read these books in their original, complete forms, you'll want to pick them up now before the unabridged editions go out of print. In at least one case ( On Top of Concord Hill, a Caroline book), the original is already out of print and is hard to find. (A reader recently told me copies are selling for hundreds of dollars on eBay.)The abridged editions of my books and the Caroline and Rose books will be released with new covers this summer. They are significantly shorter; in some cases more than a hundred pages have been cut from the original edition.In light of these changes, I have decided not to continue writing Martha and Charlotte books. Although it is indeed strange to know that I will not tell the rest of their stories (especially the story of Martha and Lew's romance, for which I have been sowing seeds since the first books), I do not think it is such a bad thing to end my part of the story with Beyond the Heather Hills and Across the Puddingstone Dam. In both of those books, I had the opportunity to say something about what is good and true and enduring in this world. Martha glimpsed it, looking into the eyes of her infant niece. Charlotte glimpsed it in the eyes of her mother, the grown-up Martha, who endured the worst kind of loss but, through faith, managed to keep hold of--and share--her joy.It will be difficult to say goodbye to these girls who have been to me like my own children. I have loved watching them grow. I am deeply honored to have had the opportunity to, in the words of Gail Godwin, \\"respectfully imagine\\" them and chronicle their stories.As I said, my decision to leave the series has been in the works for quite some time. Meanwhile, I've been working on new projects and am quite excited about my current novel, which is about neither a Scottish lass nor a New England villager, but something completely different. Stay tuned...You Guys Are GreatThank you so much for the outpouring of support and well wishes you have given in the comments from yesterday's post. You all are wonderful, and it's a blessing to have such passionate readers!Some questions naturally arose in the comments, and I thought I'd tackle a few of them here. One important point is that HarperCollins doesn't think of the abridgements as dumbed-down. I do, and that I am strongly opposed to the dumbing-down of children's literature must be obvious from my decision to walk away from a series of books that has been my heart's work for the past decade. Although I came to the decision many months ago, the shock of it still takes my breath away sometimes. I love Martha and Charlotte, really love them. Like daughters. I have written certain scenes between Martha and Lew in my mind a hundred times. I'm sorry that I will not be sharing them with you, more sorry than I can express.My decision to quit also had serious ramifications for my family. Had I continued with the series, we would still be living in Virginia; Scott would still be a work-at-home freelancer. So quitting was not a decision I made lightly; it had teeth.And yet, if you read this blog then you know my stance on giving children the highest caliber of literature--not a slimmed-down version of what had been a carefully crafted novel. And so, when it became clear that my publishers were committed to their decision to abridge, I made what I believe to be the right decision--the only decision I could have made. Doing the right thing, I tell my children, is almost never the easy thing.Certainly, this was a very hard thing to do.But as I said, while I see the abridgement as dumbing-down, I must say in all fairness that I don't believe my publishers see it that way at all. They see this as an opportunity to bring the books to a younger audience, a way to keep the series in print. The decision was presented to me with excitement and enthusiasm; I really think they were surprised that I was dismayed by it.I bear them no ill will; indeed, I shall be sorry not to be working with my wonderful HarperCollins editor anymore. She is a gem. I simply disagree, quite gravely, with this publishing decision. I do think children deserve the very best books we can give them. The books I wrote, the books that were carefully and lovingly edited by not one, but two top-notch editors (the great Alix Reid, who edited all eight of my novels, not to mention Newbery winner Ella Enchanted, has since left the publishing world for other pursuits), are, I truly believe, literature of high quality. And I don't think they are too hard, or too long, for young readers. I have heard from too many enthusiastic young readers to believe otherwise.HarperCollins has made a business decision, and I disagree with it on principle, as an author, a reader, and a mother. I think chopping up the books is a mistake. But--and this is very important--publishers respond to trends in the marketplace. They make decisions based upon what sells. If you, as consumers (readers, parents, booklovers), want to influence publishing trends, you must do it (I am sorry to say) with your pocketbooks. The big publishing houses don't read our blogs; they don't know how we feel about literature versus twaddle. They only know what sells.I see both sides of this coin, because I live on both sides. I'm a homeschooling mom with a modest household income, and frugality is a must. I'm also a writer whose livelihood depends on people spending money on books. Years ago, Scott and I made a conscious decision to strike a balance between these two competing identities: we resolved not to buy used if the book is still in print and the author is still alive. We buy new books in hardcover as often as possible, because that too sends a message to a publisher. And if we read a book at the library and truly love it, we try to buy a copy of it too.(Now you know why I have cheap furniture and don't dress well. All the discretionary income goes to books.)So. I'm deeply gratified that you are ordering copies of my unabridged novels while you can still get them. Deeply gratified--yesterday was a goosebumpy day as the comments and emails came pouring in. But if you really want to show your support for the principles on which I stand, go out and buy a new copy of The Penderwicks. In hardcover, if possible! \\"Pretty sad. Don't say you weren't warned. You will want to know how Martha ends up and none of us will ever find out.UPDATE: Still no hope, Melissa Wiley now says in her blog that even the dumbed down versions of the books have been discontinued.

This particular one is not the first in the \\"Martha\\" series, so be sure and start at the beginning."},{"Title":"Beyond the Heather Hills (Little House)","review":".but the opening 2/3 of the book, as another reviewer has pointed out, is nothing but bad news - literally. Even several of the chapter names are as grim as the events they foretell.Martha's beloved father disconnects emotionally from her on their carriage trip to Perth, where at least in ONE conversation between father and daughter we might have learned some history of the town. An overnight stop at an inn (though no doubt accurate of the times) provides the reader no respite, as the rooms are filthy, the food loathsome, and 10 year old Martha seems virtually deserted by Dad again. The only saving grace for Martha in her sister's new home might have been meeting Grisie's gentle mother-in-law, who lives, alas, elsewhere. The servants are distant or cold, Martha's room plagued by memories of a deceased daughter, the father-in-law a beast (leaving you to decide whether or not it's a blessing when his character is terminated by a graphically described brain accident). Indeed, a dinner party, the only social event anticipated in the first part of this book is aborted for Martha by yet another mishap. And most disappointing - though Martha is being sent on this first trip out of her district to learn about the Scotland beyond her valley, Wiley does not use this device to describe a day tour of Perth - which means Martha (and readers) learn almost nothing of the background, landmarks, or descriptions of this historic Scottish town.I loved sharing all of Ms. Wiley's other great contributions to the Little House literature with my granddaughters. She is obviously one of the better versed novelists of the series, and knows much of the lore and culture of highland Scotland in the 1700's. And I would not want Little House fans to bypass this volume; the ending was done well, and Wiley keeps her promise of showing through the protagonist's eyes a broader vision and scope of ongoing life. But this final book seems to have missed several good opportunities to educate young readers of the series, instead taking a less informative, family focused, narrowly compassed path. It is actually a measure of my respect for this important children's series and for Ms Wiley's writing craft that I share my disappointment here. Given Ms Wiley's talent, I can't help but wonder if this book's failings were in some way connected to the disastrous decisions which deprived us of the final tales in the LH saga."},{"Title":"Beyond the Heather Hills (Little House)","review":"My daughter has already read the Laure Ingle Wilder series and loved them so much she wanted to read more from the series.

(and I really like the martha years!!)

Wow. Unbelievably shallow plot, characters that have all the depth of a mud puddle. Mostly, woman meets a man or already has a man/falls in love or stays in love. I've read books for fourth graders with more depth, developed characters and plot than this one. The only interesting point of this book was the disappearance of a woman's husband and that plot line was left off as a cliffhanger. Too bad, cause I'd have given it two stars otherwise."},{"Title":"16 Lighthouse Road (Cedar Cove, Book 1)","review":"This is a wonderful new series by Debbie. I love the characters and Cedar Cove.

Cedar Cove, Washington, is a quirky blend of old-time Main Street and 21-st century real-life modern problems, in a combination that makes \\"16 Lighthouse Road\\" impossible to put down.In this book, we meet family court judge Olivia -- whose unexpected ruling in the divorce trial of young navy couple Cecilia and Ian draws the reader right into the heart of the town. Then there is Olivia's irrascible mother Charlotte, who likes to sit in the courtroom and knit, and Olivia's dear friend Grace, whose husband is acting extremely strangely.Just put up your feet, make a cup of tea, and try not to wish that real life had such easy solutions.

Would make a wonderful movie. Lots of emotion but not melodramatic. Great dialogue but not too much. Wonderful book. Highly reccomended."},{"Title":"16 Lighthouse Road (Cedar Cove, Book 1)","review":"I read the very few 1 star reviews there were and they all reiterated the same thing: no character development.I somewhat agree with that. There IS some background weaved through the book which I felt was adequate. But in this particular book, I didn't feel like extreme character development was really necessary. It wouldn't make the book any better or any worse. This isn't a masterpiece, and I think these things can be overlooked.When I started reading, it was like I was already in the middle of their life goings-on, and I enjoyed it. When I initially picked this book up I thought it was going to be a piece of forgettable, unsubstantial fluff. I was delighted to come away after finishing it with a satisfied feeling. It was a lovely little book. I liked her characters (except for Cecilia - she annoyed the sh-t out of me. Her relationship with Ian annoyed the sh-t out of me too, but that's okay - I enjoyed her other characters) and the way she wrote some of the scenes. I especially liked the scene with Grace having a melt down that night. I thought it was well written and I feel Debbie really does at some points capture the true human emotion/reaction that I don't see in most other books (especially the part with the ring and her fury). I enjoyed the character of Justine and her maturity and relationship with Seth. Granted, it's no Forever Amber and isn't one of the great masterpieces, but I enjoyed getting lost in this little community for a few days that I will definitely continue the series.Debbie Macomber is an easy writer. I usually read more 'proper' (can't think of a better word right now) literature in terms of writing style but I very much enjoyed her easy to read style of writing. There were a couple of sentences that I felt were a bit stupid, i.e. \\"Cecilia literally flew into Ian's arms\\". Literally flew? But there were only a couple. But, and I'm still getting over the fact that I actually really enjoyed this book, that didn't put me off and I will definitely continue to pick up Debbie's novels.

I am looking forward to reading the others in this series."},{"Title":"16 Lighthouse Road (Cedar Cove, Book 1)","review":"16 Lighthouse Road is a unique compilation of stories about friends and acquaintances of Olivia Lockhart, Family Court judge, in the Pacific Northwest town of Cedar Cove, Washington. With her usual writing skill, Debbie Macomber takes chords of real life circumstances (divorce, a child's death, alcoholism, strained familial relationships, disappearing spouses, and military service separation) and entwines them with love, hope, and reconciliation. Unfortunately, all of them can't be fully developed in one 377 page paperback.Macomber paints wonderful and evocative word pictures of the Washington landscape and the personalities of her characters. The dialogue and honest interaction of the characters draws you immediately into the storylines and keeps you reading in spite of the fragmented structure of the book.Ian and Cecilia Randall, the young newlyweds struggling with the death of a child and separation because of his Navy career, appear in her courtroom. Jack Griffin, newly arrived editor of the Cedar Cove Chronicle, and love interest. Her busybody mother Charlotte Jefferson, who collects recipes at funeral wake. Tom Harding, stoke victim and mysterious new resident of Cedar Cove Convalescent Home, who gives a key to her mother. Grace Sherman, the best friend whose husband keeps disappearing; and Justine, her daughter, in a relationship with a man twenty years her senior. All endearing characters that capture your heart.Switches between the stories and her believable, engaging characters will keep you turning the pages to see how each saga ends, but you do long to spend more time with them. Or, perhaps re-visit with them in a sequel. After all, we never do learn what happened to Grace's husband!"},{"Title":"16 Lighthouse Road (Cedar Cove, Book 1)","review":"16 LIGHTHOUSE ROAD satisfies the soap-opera lover in us with a charming little town peopled with problem-ridden residents. If I had not known ahead of time this was a continuing series, I would have been disappointed that so many storylines were left dangling at the end, but knowing there are more books, I am eagerly anticipating the rest of the series.Judge Olivia Lockhart resides in the title address and we first meet her as she denies the divorce of Cecilia and Ian Randall. The young couple, obviously deeply in love, has not dealt with their grief over losing their infant daughter and has rushed headlong into divorce proceedings. The Judge herself is a divorcee who knows what it means to lose a child and still love your ex-husband. Meanwhile, the town's new newspaper editor, a man with a secret to hide, is hotly pursuing her.The lustiest part of the story involves Olivia's daughter Justine who is dating a man old enough to be her father while having deeply sexual feelings for a high school friend she becomes reacquainted with while planning their tenth reunion.Olivia's friend, Grace Sherman, plays a pivotal role in the book, as the deserted wife who endures grief and humiliation before deciding life on her own is really quite pleasant.Olivia's mother, Charlotte Jefferson, provides many comedic moments as she attempts to track down the grandson of a stroke victim she befriends.All together, an inviting look into a friendly town where problems are encountered and overcome with the help of good neighbors and good friends."},{"Title":"16 Lighthouse Road (Cedar Cove, Book 1)","review":"I've been reading lots of romances lately. Some have been so awful that after 50 pages, they go to the used bookshop. So it is was pleasure to find one that was so readable and enjoyable. Of course, with Debbie at the keys, this is not surprising.While there is some fragmented areas, like the transition between characters, it didn't matter. I just could not stop. The little town of Cedar Cove is charming and the people are real people, doing things that most of us do each day. Work, workout with a friend, shop and run to the cleaners. And none of us live in a fairy tale world. These women don't either. However, Jack's friend Bob does seem to have the one stable marriage in the book. And at least Olivia and Stan have a civil relationship.The approach to the solution for Cecilia's and Ian's marriage allows for much growth in their maturity level. Actually we see alot of growth in the book. The grandson of Tom Harding overcoming his reluctance to take his grandfather's mementos, Grace developing some independence and Justine, looking past the glitter of a superficial relationship and finding true love in someone crystal clear and wholesome.I think that some loose ends were left at the end intentionally and that in the next book ( which is hinted at), we will probably find out what happened to Grace's husband and see Jack and Olivia weather some ups and downs. Of course, I am just guessing, but that is what I would like to see.This one is a keeper and I will read it again."},{"Title":"16 Lighthouse Road (Cedar Cove, Book 1)","review":"16 Lighthouse Road by Debbie Macomber16 Lighthouse Road is a series of subplots within one book, where not one single subplot takes the lead. There are several stories found in this Macomber title. Olivia is a 50-something judge who presides over a divorce hearing and refuses to grant the divorce. The couple in question is Cecilia and Ian Randall, who have gone through their own private hell - loss of a baby which leads to their mess of a marriage.Olivia herself is the focus of a subplot. She has been divorced for many years but has not remarried as her ex-husband has. Then, she meets Jack Griffin, newspaper editor of the local paper, and she finds herself interested. The feeling is mutual.Another subplot is Charlotte, Olivia's mother, who is involved with many social groups including helping out at the hospital, where she meets an elderly man who cannot speak, because of a stroke.Yet another subplot is the story of Justine, who is dating a much older man, and her mother is Olivia. She has no desire to settle down, but then starts to have conflicting emotions when she meets up again with an old high school mate, Seth.There is nothing wrong with having several subplots in one book. The problem was that there was no main story, and the book reads like a soap opera. Debbie Macomber can write, but I have a feeling the fault here is her editor. There are repeated passages all over the book, where things could have been nicely condensed. Transitions from one scene to another are not very smooth. I would have enjoyed this book a lot better if someone had taken the time to proof read the book and do it right!I have the second book in this series of books, 204 Rosewood Lane. I am hoping to find this book a much better edited book. There was nothing wrong with the story content of 16 Lighthouse Road. It kept my interest despite the irritating problems with the writing. Because of these problems, I will have to give the book only Three stars."},{"Title":"16 Lighthouse Road (Cedar Cove, Book 1)","review":"In this new series, Ms. Macomber introduces us to a new series. The series takes place in Cedar Cove, Washington, a scenic little town where the people are interesting and their stories could be real. The series follows the people who live in the title address and the characters they interact with. In this book we meet Olivia Lockhart, who lives at 16 Lighthouse Road. Olivia is a family court judge who makes news when she denies a prenuptial agreement dissolution for a couple, Cecilia and Ian Randall, who are seeking a divorce after the tragic death of their newborn daughter. We also meet Olivia's mother, Charlotte who makes friends with a stroke victim, Olivia's daughter Justine who is in a relationship with a much older man who is also drawn to an old schoolmate. We meet Grace, Olivia's best friend, who is dealing with the disappearance of her husband and the newly arrived newspaper editor Jack Griffin. Olivia finds herself drawn to Jack and they start to see one another. As they work through their relationship, we also get an inside view to many other relationships at work through the town.Ms. Macomber draws us into a wonderful new world where the people jump off the page at you and are extremely likeable. I enjoyed the first book to the series and enjoyed meeting all the new characters. As Ms. Macomber leaves us wanting more with the other storylines, I am quite glad to say that Ms. Macomber continues with many more books in the series, including 74 Seaside Avenue, which releases in August of 2007.

Macomber doesn't sacrifice her values for the sake of popularity. Five stars to Judge Lockhart for standing up for the sanctity of marriage! While some parts of the storyline can seem a bit pollyanna, Macomber deals with some serious real life issues, such as marriage, separation/divorce, abandonment, death, just to name a few.

This was a story about life and struggles of its characters. I had a hard time with how the character's Grace and Dan's story played out with Dan leaving Grace after 30 some years of marriage. Dan doesn't keep in touch with his daughter's even though the one daughter was pregnant and having a baby, his grandchild. I can understand not seeing or communicating with his wife but not his children. I felt he should have come around to see his daughter when she had the baby. I would have written this story a little differently.

Cecilia and Ian Randall are a young, married couple having problems. They are in court seeking a divorce. Here we are introduced to Olivia, the judge. She doesn't grant them their divorce. Jack Griffin, the new editor of the local paper is in court that day writing an article for the paper. An article that will get people talking. There is also Charlotte, Olivia's mother. She is a busybody to say the least. Yet a very charming character. We also meet Grace and her husband Dan who seem to have a good marriage but then he just disappears. 16 Lighthouse Road was a good book except it jumped around to too many characters. It would have been better if it would have just focused on a few characters, like Cecilia and Ian, Olivia and Jack for instance. Instead the reader is introduced to many of the townspeople and it begins to get a little overwhelming. The storylines were good they just didn't get to develop because there were too many. I really like Ms. Macombers books but this book just seemed to focus on too many people and didn't build a good solid story around any two characters. The story of Cecilia and Ian was good but again it would be nice if more time had been spent on them. The storyline with Grace and her husband was excellent. I would liked to have seen one whole book dedicated to their story. Ms. Macombers other books, such as the Texas series and Buffalo Valley series, are better in that one book is dedicated primarily to one or two sets of characters and their stories. The other townspeople are in the story but they don't play such a big part like these in Cedar Cove. This book had a lot of potential but didn't expand on it. The characters were all people one could like and were again everyday people that everyone can relate to. There were just too many of them. Still, this was still a good book and passed away the hours in an entertaining way."},{"Title":"16 Lighthouse Road (Cedar Cove, Book 1)","review":"I should have known, by reading the blurb on the backcover, that this book was more into events happening rather than characters developing. In fact, Olivia, who I think may be the main character, but can't say for sure, is never described. You never know what she looks like! Her daughter Justine, whom is never developed either, is so irrational and selfish you have to wonder why she is like that. Give me a break - she keeps saying she wants to marry Warren - 20 yrs older than her, and impotent - over Seth who is gorgeous and loves her very much. Where's the reasoning in this? Because she thinks she will have to live in a boat? Isn't she the manager of the bank, I am sure she can afford a house. I also felt Grace and Dan's story needed closure, how is she supposed to get a divorce and get on with life if he never shows up again. I honestly believe he wouldn't have left all of his clothes. He seems too stingy to spend money on a new wardrobe, or let his girfriend do so. Charlotte would have been a nice character, in fact we know more about her - the way she looks and acts and why - than anyone else in the story, however she was too much of a busybody for me. I don't enjoy reading about busybodies. All in all, I felt like I was reading an article out the Star newspaper rather than a book. Books are supposed to draw you in, develop characters, make you feel what they feel and move you towards a conclusion that make sense, not give just the events. This author must have gotten good grades in her newswriting class."},{"Title":"16 Lighthouse Road (Cedar Cove, Book 1)","review":"I am an avid reader and the cove series of books are very well written, and make you want to read them quickly."},{"Title":"16 Lighthouse Road (Cedar Cove, Book 1)","review":"This is the first book I have read in the Cedar Cove Novels and it was very enjoyable.

The characters seemed to be a little too perfect and successful. Not true to life."},{"Title":"16 Lighthouse Road (Cedar Cove, Book 1)","review":"16 Lighthouse Road is another great read for Debbie Macomber fans. It follows the lives of five different woment at different stages of their lives, which I find refreshing as all too often romances focus on twenty-somethings. Admittedly, at times I had trouble remembering who was who. (Perhaps 5 different characters is too many to keep up with.) It is however, a very good read. The characters are realistic and easy to relate to. There is just a hint of mystery, comedy, and of course romance that involves women of almost every stage of life. All Debbie Macomber fans will enjoy this book, and if you've never tried her before, this is a good place to start!"},{"Title":"16 Lighthouse Road (Cedar Cove, Book 1)","review":"I was going to say romance but there isn't really a lot of romance in this book. No passionate scenes, hardly more than a bit of chaste kissing. Oh, well.The book revolves around the lives of five women who are related, one only tangentially, to each other and who each face crises related to a love relationship. The characters are well written and the plots evolve to logical, predictable conclusions. There is nothing unique or memorable about them.If you are looking for a light read for when you are sitting in the doctor's waiting room or on the train commuting to work, this book is a good choice. If you want excitement, characters you are passionate about and a story where you can't wait to see what happens next, this isn't it."},{"Title":"16 Lighthouse Road (Cedar Cove, Book 1)","review":"A great beginning to the series. Judge Olivia Lockhart denies Ian and Cecelia Randall their divorce because she feels they're still in love and are making a terrible decision in haste she's also attracted to newspaper man Jack Griffin. Ian and Cecelia met and married quickly due to Cecelia's pregnancy but their baby girl died a few hours after being born. Cecelia was left to handle the birth and death alone Ian was away in the Navy and wasn't told of anything after their daughter was dead and buried.

Olivia's worries over her daughter Justine who's dating a man who's much older then her as much as Olivia tries to support her daughter living her own life Olivia feels Justine's making a mistake. The end left you wanting to read more."},{"Title":"16 Lighthouse Road (Cedar Cove, Book 1)","review":"\\"16 Lighthouse Road\\" is the first book in Debbie Macomber's Cedar Cove series and it focuses on the lives of several people living there. Cecelia and Ian Randall married when Cecelia became pregnant, but their baby died while Navy man Ian was at sea. Now they want to divorce because Cecelia can't forgive Ian for not being there when she needed him the most. Judge Olivia Lockhart catches newspaper editor Jack Griffin's attention when she is reluctant to grant the divorce until the Randall's try to work things out. Olivia is attracted to Jack, but is concerned about her daughter Justine who is dating a much older man. Olivia's friend Grace Sherman is having problems with her husband Dan - after thirty-five years of marriage he has walked out and disappeared without any explanation. Finally, there is Olivia's mother, Charlotte Jefferson, who befriended an elderly man shortly before he died and is trying to track down his family to return the few possessions he left behind.I really enjoyed \\"16 Lighthouse Road\\" and bought the rest of the books in the series as soon as I finished reading it. Debbie Macomber's writing can be awkward at times and the book often sounds like a soap opera. She can be melodramatic to a fault, saying one character will never be a grandfather because his son is sterile - has she never heard of adoption? But despite her writing flaws, Macomber is a great storyteller and she creates characters that readers will care about. The book doesn't focus on any one character but tells each character's story equally. Some of the stories, such as Ian and Cecelia's come to a close, but others, such as Grace and Dan's are left open. This can be frustrating and feel like a cheat to readers who want everything tied up neatly at the end, but Macomber had me caring enough about the characters to make me want to read the other books in the series to find out what happens to them. That's the mark of a truly gifted storyteller.\\"16 Lighthouse Road\\" is a well-done soap opera in book form."},{"Title":"16 Lighthouse Road (Cedar Cove, Book 1)","review":"My husband is in the Navy and we live in the area where the book is based. I recognized so many of the things that she talked about so I know how special and great they are, especially the views of the mountains that surround us.

I have read nearly all of the Cedar Cove series and am still longing for more. Debbie Macomber knows how to spin a tale. I never tire of the Cedar Cove characters and their lives. Although I have loved every book in this series, 16 Lighthouse Road is still my favorite. If you haven't read it yet, do it. It is a real page turner and well worth your time."},{"Title":"16 Lighthouse Road (Cedar Cove, Book 1)","review":"I have always wanted to read this series and have just started.

I love it!"},{"Title":"16 Lighthouse Road (Cedar Cove, Book 1)","review":"As a long time Debbie Macomber fan, I suppose I came into reading this series with a certain level of expectation. First, the reason why I love Debbie Macomber is because she makes you feel good when you read her books. It's not that they are always happy from beginning to end, but rather that they grab you from the first page and tend to make you forget about your problems, even if only for a brief while. When I began reading this book, I was taken aback slightly by the depressing nature of the subject matter in the first chapter and felt it took away from what may have been a better entrance into such a long series.The writing, as usual, was charming and tight, although I wasn't hooked on this book as I usually am within the first chapter or two of her books. I found myself on occasion, wondering what all the excitement over this series was about if this was what it was going to be like. There were some characters in the book that I liked immediately and others that I found I didn't care much for, which made it difficult for me to continue reading when the chapter was all about them. I respect that it takes a lot of concentration and effort to write a series and I respect this author for her dedication to the craft. That being said, I wouldn't say this was one of my favorite Macomber titles. I encourage you to read it for yourself and check out the rest of the series."},{"Title":"16 Lighthouse Road (Cedar Cove, Book 1)","review":"This book is the first of Debbie Macomber's Cedar Cove series. Some might say that this series is a written soap opera, but it is so well written that I find myself wondering what will happen to her main characters in the next book each time I finish one. Debbie says on her web page that, in many ways, the town she lives in is much like Cedar Cove, so there is definitely an element of fiction imitating real life in these books. (The people in the books are not real people, just some of the places.) Check out her web sight to understand better because I am probably not doing it justice. At any rate, the people in these books seem like real people!Unlike some books, although each of the Cedar Cove books can stand alone, they are much more enjoyable if you read them in sequence. Since this is the first book, it definitely stands alone and is a good book to read to see if Cedar Cove is \\"your cup of tea.\\" Please try it out and see the creative way that Judge Olivia deals with one divorce."},{"Title":"16 Lighthouse Road (Cedar Cove, Book 1)","review":"This is an ok book, decent storylines, though there are many going on at once and you can kind of forget who the characters are. This is the first I have read from this author and I can't say I loved the writing style. It's kind of stumbling at times or forced or maybe awkward? Definitely overly simplistic. Overall though if you are looking for a very easy quick read that is entertaining and lighthearted, this is nice. I guess that's the best description of the book-it's nice.

If you love the Pacific Northwest, not necessarily Seattle, but Puget Sound and the small hamlets that surround it, this series is for you. The larger world is just outside, and her characters like to visit the bigger cities, they just dont want to live there. The characters,on the face of it, are every day people, but as you get to know them, the details of their lives draw you in. The characters range in age from misunderstood pre adolescents to senior citizens, trying to deal with the changes that chapter of their lives bring. They are all from different walks of life and socio-economic backgrounds, but somehow their lives intermesh and they find a common thread. As a result, you want to know them too.I love that the characters are complicated, but not 'dark'. That's why I called it a 'comfortable' read. In the midst of all the 'noise' on television and radio, its a respite. Your imagination is sparked, but your senses aren't fried.

Reading the book first is a must for me. Once again, Macomber serves up a compelling woman's relationship book that introduces us new 'friends'.Olivia lives at 16 Lighthouse Road, and centered the story as a judge who makes an interesting ruling. A young military couple is seeking a divorce after their baby daughter is born prematurely and dies shortly thereafter. Olivia made a bold decision by requiring them to try working through their issues even though both people wanted the divorce.Olivia' Mom, daughter, and best friend are also involved in difficult and/or interesting life situations. As these different woman share their lives in this book, the reader becomes more and more emotionally involved with their loves, problems, and real-life situations. The books becomes more like a letter from a friend than novel. Thank goodness, Macomber has already written more 'letters' from Cedar Cove.

The writing was emotional and compelling. When I opened the novel, I got sucked into the situation with Cecilia and Ian a young married couple having to deal with the loss of their child, their new marriage, and Ian's military career. I think those two resonated with me the most because when I was a Sergeant in the Army, I saw a lot of young couples going through the same thing (not exactly the death of a child, but all the others) while trying to adjust and fit into a military life. Even when Cecilia was annoying to me, blaming Ian for things, he couldn't change and her lack of maturity annoyed me, I still got her. I saw girls exactly like her (heck I had soldiers under me who were like her) when I was in the military.16 LIGHTHOUSE ROAD has an interesting cast of characters. From Olivia, the judge who denied a petition from the divorcing Ian and Cecilia forcing them to work out their problems, her love interest Jack who has a murky past, her best friend Grace whose husband walks out on her after thirty-five years of marriage, her mother Charlotte, and her daughter Justine. All these stories were layered and I had a hard time trying to figure out where she was going with each storyline because it was so nuanced.Yet, despite all my praise, I had issues with 16 LIGHTHOUSE ROAD. My main issue, is because there were so many characters (the story is step up as a soap opera minus the millionaires and the implausible plot lines), it was hard for me to really focus on and root for the characters. I don't know if this will be addressed in later books, but 16 LIGHTHOUSE ROAD didn't seem to have an ending so you didn't get that satisfying happily ever after feel. It also took me a long time to read this book (about two weeks), because there were too many characters to focus on. 16 LIGHTHOUSE ROAD was the book I picked up when I didn't have another book handy to read.While I loved the writing and characters, I missed not having a main character or plot thread to focus on. However, since I did love the writing and characters, I will continue the series (through my library) but it's not something that I must read, nor am I interested in re-reading them.LYNETTE'S TWO CENTS BLOG SPOT"},{"Title":"16 Lighthouse Road (Cedar Cove, Book 1)","review":"I won't reiterate the plot line, but this book was a real disappointment.

Usually I read mysteries or Historical Novels and try not to read too many romance novels. But I loved her book. Her characters are real, they have depth and they feel like they are your friends. This is the type of book I enjoy. I love to read a book where the characters become alive. They are real people they could even be living in your town or neighborhood. You can relate to their issues. I loved how she brought the characters with their issues together, and that there will be other books in the series that deal with other characters. It was smart for Amazon to put this book on their sale or free. That is why I read it, the price was on sale or it was a free offer, so I decided well it is time to read a new author.I belong to a book club where we each read books and then come together and share the author and the book with each other.

Olivia is convinced they aren't giving their love a chance and decides they need to remember why they married in the first place.Olivia has a lot going on in her life outside of the courtroom as well. Her relationship with her daughter Justine is more strained than ever and Olivia doesn't know how to reach her. Olivia's mother Charlotte is playing amateur sleuth trying to track down family of a man recently deceased she used to visit at the senior citizens home. Olivia's best friend Grace's husband has disappeared and no one knows why. Then there is the added fact that Jack Griffin, editor of the local newspaper would like to build a more than friendly relationship with Olivia.Welcome to Cedar Cove. In this small town, everyone knows everybody else's business, and they love it that way. Relationships between all of the characters are strong and deeply rooted, to the point when something unfortunate happens, it is a guarantee everyone will rally behind them, just as they will cheer them on when things are going well.While Olivia's story is given a touch more focus here, I love that 16 Lighthouse Road (Olivia's address) does not really revolve around her. The catalyst for the story is Olivia's decision at the hearing of Ian and Cecilia so they play a significant role in the story as well. Their story is so sad and it was a joy to experience the healing and recovery from their loss that actually makes their love all the stronger.I love the chatty tone of the Cedar Cove series. When I started listening to 16 Lighthouse Road, I felt as though I was sitting down with everyone as they shared with me what was happening around town. Sandra Burr does that good of a job bringing everyone to life. There is a reason she is one of my favorite audio book performers.The more I read of Debbie Macomber's books, the more I like her. She knows how to get to the hearts of her readers and tell an emotional story that has quite an impact on the reader. Macomber truly understands what makes women's friendships work and shares the wisdom with us through her books.Kelley A. Hartsell, May 2008.

The central character is Olivia, a family court judge whose marriage ended in divorce when one of their children died. Her mother Charlotte is constantly dropping in on her daughter's courtroom and gathering new recipes which she tries out on other people. The younger generation is represented by Justine, Olivia's daughter, who has her own ideas about love and marriage. A fourth important character is Olivia's friend Grace, whose husband Dan has a penchant for disappearing without warning. Lastly, is Cecilia who married a young Navy man rather impusively and now regrets it. Macomber moves her plot from one character to another, which keeps things interesting.

I found out in the third book what happened to Dan. I am enjoying Pelican Court."},{"Title":"16 Lighthouse Road (Cedar Cove, Book 1)","review":"Many reviewers have written about the content (characters) of the book so I won't delve too much into it for my review. I haven't read too many of Ms. Macomber's books but was interested in this first book in the Cedar Cove series. 16 LIGHTHOUSE ROAD introduces the reader to the town of Cedar Cove, Washington and some of its citizens. The mix of characters keeps the book interesting and although it has been mentioned as fragmented this type of writing is necessary to keep the storylines active. This is not just a romance. It does include some mystery that is not solved in this first book. As any series of books should be, 16 LIGHTHOUSE ROAD leaves you wanting more. This reviewer hopes that this is more than a trilogy. Thanks Debbie for a wonderful read."},{"Title":"16 Lighthouse Road (Cedar Cove, Book 1)","review":"I usually really enjoy Debbie Macomber's books but this book was not as enjoyable as her others. This book seemed to be missing something from her usual writing style, although I can't say exactly what it is. I believe the problem may have been that there were too many characters and not enough attention was given to each of the characters. I didn't feel as though I knew these characters when I finished this book. I would recommend the Dakota trilogy over this book."},{"Title":"16 Lighthouse Road (Cedar Cove, Book 1)","review":"Ian Randall was out at sea when his young wife Cecilia gave birth to a baby with a defective heart. Not long afterward, Cecilia stands alone burying their daughter. Unable to cope, Cecilia and Ian agree to divorce, but Cedar Cove, Washington Family Court Judge Olivia Lockheart denies their petition. She believes the grief is coloring their decisions and both remain in love with one another.The new Cedar Cove Chronicle editor Jack Griffin attended the court on the day that Olivia issued her surprising ruling in the Randall case. He writes a laudatory editorial praising the decision. Jack wants to start seeing Olivia, who he admires for her courage and conviction to avoid the easy road of granting the divorce decree. However, he has quite a road to travel, as she never recovered from her divorce. Meanwhile her mother interferes in her cases and her daughter drives her crazy while her son joins the navy. This is a normal scenario for Judge Lockheart.16 LIGHTHOUSE ROAD is an enjoyable relationship cozy that looks at life in a small town, mostly through the women. When God created Eve, he must have asked Debbie Macomber for advice because no one does female characters any better than this author. The story line is somewhat fragmented between the several different subplots whose link is Olivia. Still, the cast is superb and the town seems so real that the audience will stroll through the pages of this novel and want more Cedar Cove books in the future.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"16 Lighthouse Road (Cedar Cove, Book 1)","review":"Didn't like this book...too many characters to follow.

He asserts that Eberhorst was an incompetent designer (!) partly responsible for Rosemeyer's death.2. He asserts that Hitler (!) somehow orchestrated Rosemeyer's death, and goes to great length to explain how Rosemeyer, knowing of the plot, bravely and stoicly went to his death to avoid bringing the wrath of the Nazis down on his wife and young child.3. He postulates that had Rosemeyer lived, his popularity would soon have eclipse Hitler's, and that Rosemeyer would somehow wrench the Reich away from Hitler and lead Germany to avoid the carnage of WWII.It would be impossible to fabricate more ludicrous theories about the events of this fascinating period. I bought this book because I was starved for more reading material about the subject, and couldn't bring myself to spend the money for the excellent (but expensive) Chris Nixon works. Do yourself a favor, skip straight to Nixon's efforts and leave this sort of bizarre revisionism on the shelf."},{"Title":"DRIVING FORCES","review":"I found Driving Forces to be a educational, entertaining and comprehensive look at the little known world of early Grand Prix racing.

Nora dismisses her unease after her daughter's wedding and the disagreement between her two grown children. When her husband abruptly leaves her and their farm for an old flame, the basis for her whole life shifts. While struggling to grasp his defection and reassemble her life, an even greater loss threatens. She discovers that her son has leukemia.It's a moving story that speaks to any woman who's suffered the defection of a spouse or a major family illness. It has some quirky characters, some sad scenes, some hopeful scenes, even some romance and overall is an engaging read. It takes place in Winnipeg and Manitoba.For those who like Nancy Thayer, Luanne Rice or Anne Tyler, this will suit you."},{"Title":"Essential French Phrase Book (Essential Phrasebook Series)","review":"Great beginner french book.

Unlike the books in his earlier vagabonding years, Franck was married with children by the time he wrote this book, and he took his wife and the youngest two of their children with him on this tour of Hawaii. The journey was made with the specific purpose of describing what could be seen and experienced in Hawaii. Thus, Franck methodically describes each island and what he and his wife saw and did there during the visit. Franck also relates some facts of local history or mythology, some statistics, and a few character sketches of his hosts or other people whom he met. The book is illustrated with plates of black-and-white photographs that Franck took during his travels.The book provides some interesting insights about daily life and living conditions in Hawaii during the 1930s. Documentation of such details is not easy to come by, so Franck's text makes a useful contribution to the historical literature of the region. Nevertheless, his racism is far too extensive to make the book acceptable by modern standards. Franck repeatedly reminds readers that the Asians that he met and photographed are indeed American citizens, and he seemed to find this astonishing, although he is careful not to express any negative opinions on the matter. Without coming out and saying so directly, Franck comes across as being against granting statehood to the islands because of the size of the Asian population. Such attitudes may have been regarded normal in Franck's time, but they are hard to overlook now, despite the overall quality of his descriptions."},{"Title":"Around The Bend","review":"This larger reader is 333 pages with a Glossary, Vocabulary Facts page and Vocabulary List - It has 6 topical groups (Brave Together, True Enough, Along Every Road, Some Tall Tales, Teamwork, and Paths to Adventure) with 11 to 14 stories in each - The illustrations are not as colorful as the 1950's readers, as at least half of them are two-color, but on the other hand, the other half are in wonderful colors!"},{"Title":"Boy","review":"This is not one of these soppy novels, I have read it a hundred times and still get real emotion every time.

You may know him from www.SelfGrowth.com or from any of his several other Web sites and newsletters.For The Top 101 Experts Who Help Us Improve Our Lives, he looked into which self-help experts are most often searched for on the Web. Having identified who they are, he devised an ingenious format for briefly describing how each one got their start, what their key message is, how to find out more about them on-line and where to start in investigating their work.It's that last point that makes this book special. Many of these experts have written lots of books, created many audio and video products and deliver many seminars and courses. Without someone to guide you where to enter that maze of material, you would quickly become confused by starting with something that's too advanced for you.The experts include classic self-help gurus like Tony Robbins, Dale Carnegie and Stephen Covey; business improvement experts like Ken Blanchard, Brian Tracy and Jim Collins; psychologists like Dr. Phil McGraw; spiritual healers like Deepak Chopra and Caroline Myss; personal finance teachers like Robert Allen, Robert Kiyosaki and Bruce Wilkinson; and relationship counselors like John Gray and Barbara De Angelis. There's no attempt to separate out the \\"serious\\" from the \\"popular\\".

The introductory chapter describes the methods the author used--maybe that's all the further the negative revier ever read!

While mainly exploring mechanical, it also is a good concise introduction to the other engineering disciplines: civil, electrical, etc. As a reference work it shines in its thorough depictions of drafting standards and conventions. Of special interest, but often overlooked elsewhere, is the book's coverage of Third Angle projection verses First Angle projection... very important in today's global economy and in the need for clear exchange of design ideas across borders. Befitting a book concerning graphics and design, it is generously illustrated and the many color images are particularly welcome. This is one reference work that has served me well and I keep it handy at my desk."},{"Title":"Restructuring Hainan's international trade and finance: currency, foreign exchange, and trade (Rand note)","review":"Mary Wollstonecraft was an excessively unsympathetic character - she was a user( in modern parlance anyway), she manipulated, she was deliberately obstructive and astonishingly naive and yet Tomalin's biography of this most irritating of women kept me completely enthralled from beginning to end. Wollstonecraft certainly was neither deified or demonised here - simply left to tell her own story through her actions.There is very little quoted material in her, it is pretty much a narrative of her life from childhood through to her death. Tomalin has done enormous research on her life, the pieces tie in together seamlessly.Wollstonecraft was (of course) the woman who wrote that seminal work on the Rights of Women - and that really seems to be her predominant claim to fame although her lifestyle was very unusual for her times - having open relationships with men (including married men such as the artist Fuseli). I was mostly struck by how little success she really acheived in her lifetime despite her driving attitude to work and enormous energy - it seems although it was all misdirected or perhaps that was a good thing considering her beliefs (odd for her time) and her resentments (numerous and very often unfounded)Very very enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Restructuring Hainan's international trade and finance: currency, foreign exchange, and trade (Rand note)","review":"I do not think I have ever seen a biographical piece of writing that was less objective. I downloaded the Kindle free sample and I have seen enough not to continue with the purchase. The author very evidently has some small-minded interpretations of Mary Wollstonecraft's psychology which colors the way in which facts are presented - some crucial factors are minimalized, such as her father's violence and the intra-family biases, which a cursory reading of Wollstonecraft's work would help to shed more light on.Aspersions on Wollstonecraft's personality because of her just and rational critiques is rather ironic - this is precisely evidence the mind-boggling inequality that insists on polite conformity at all costs for women - exactly the point which Wollstonecraft was trying to make and it only serves to lower my opinion of this author's intelligence.Moreover, most of the construction of Wollstonecraft's early character are built - not on facts or witness accounts - but on baseless and sly innuendo - for example - she cites an account that little Mary went to visit an old lady \\"contrary to her will\\" (who - by the way, committed suicide in delirium and Mary's image of the corpse would haunt her for the rest of her life) as evidence that Mary was ill-tempered and imperious - allegations which hardly match the numerous factual occasions of her self-sacrificing generosity - let alone the sensitive, critical and reflective temper of her moral writings. There is no evidence of any attempts to be \\"objective\\" or \\"critical\\" or to address different perspectives or interpretations. The author of this text is the sort of person who could join the spiteful peanut gallery that immediately followed in this daring and brilliant woman's wake and tried to minimize her massive creative and critical contributions to the literature and moral and political philosophy of her day and ours."},{"Title":"Adobe Photoshop 7.0 for Photographers: A professional image editor's guide to the creative use of Photoshop for the Macintosh and PC","review":"A simply superb book for learning how to use Photoshop 7.0 with images from your digital camera or scanner. I've been using Photoshop since before Adobe purchased it from the Knoll brothers and would assert that this book ranks among the two or three best works ever published on Photoshop, even when compared with Adobe's own excellent Classroom-in-a-Book series.The book is designed to address the issues that pro photographers face in reproducing and manipulating digital imagery with Photoshop 7.0, but contains a wealth of info and shortcuts that are valuable to anyone using Photoshop with the current generation of digital cameras and scanners. The author also is to be commended for the clarity of his writing, and his ability to explain the more complex concepts of digital manipulation of imagery.I especially like the inclusion of examples generated by pro photographers using professional models, instead of the poorly lit examples that fill most books covering the use of Photoshop. The CD tutorials included with the book are excellent, as well. The information on color space and calibration in the book can be a bit daunting for new users, but they are well worth the effort to read. The example projects included in the book are very useful and cover nearly all the practical situations that most photographers might face in their work with Photoshop.The actual book is beautifully printed on fine quality paper and the example photos are reproduced quite nicely by the folks at Focal Press. I would love a bit more on using third-party plug-ins in the next edition, but that is a minor criticism of this wonderful volume. This book represents the current state-of-the-art for improving your work with Adobe's flagship application.While most certainly geared towards pros, the book is great for those users who aspire to those heights. Even though I've worked with digital imagery for almost twenty years, I still learned an amazing amount from this book, and consider it to be a bargain. Very highly recommended."},{"Title":"Adobe Photoshop 7.0 for Photographers: A professional image editor's guide to the creative use of Photoshop for the Macintosh and PC","review":"I've used Photoshop for several years and never felt that I knew how to get the best results as a photographer.

After the first six chapters, I was finally getting a handle on what I'd been puzzled by for years. By the end of the book, I had learned more than my money's worth!If you need to learn Photoshop, get the \\"Classroom\\" book. If you want your photos to literally come alive in Photoshop and have that translated to your prints, get this book. You'll also pick up all of those handy keyboard shortcuts that make the process fly.The book is physically a little heavy for bedtime reading, but that's a good excuse to go back to the computer and play with the new ideas and solutions, even at 3 AM.Enjoy."},{"Title":"Adobe Photoshop 7.0 for Photographers: A professional image editor's guide to the creative use of Photoshop for the Macintosh and PC","review":"Im a novice with photoshop but this book is a &quot;keeper&quot;.

I have experience developing film and paper-based photos, providing me with comprehension of photo lab techniques as well as the associated dark-room lingo. Combining this background with an intermediate-level understanding of Photoshop, I was quite keen on diving into this book.While most of the content I found to be very useful, in many instances the editing was so poor that the book suddenly resembled a cloak-and-dagger mystery. Quality of instruction, it would appear, is sacrificed for speed of publication (admittedly, not uncommon in application books these days). If one combines the print instructions with the enclosed CD, the &quot;Aha!&quot; moment comes across much more easily; however, there just aren't enough of these print/CD combinations available for the reader's enjoyment. It's a real missed opportunity. What's more, (I have no idea if this is true or false) it appears that the publisher of the book and the publisher of the CD might be from two completely different companies; no doubt separated by the Atlantic Ocean. I must agree with a previous comment on the CD content: The narration speeds along at lightning pace, often ahead of the visuals, while the poor cursor has difficulty just keeping up (even on a fast G4 with all content saved on hard drive). It's nearly impossible to follow the narrator's cursor, unless one knows Photoshop well enough to listen for audio clues.Still, there's a lot to be had between the covers, and it's worth scrumming through the content despite the bruising editorial."},{"Title":"Adobe Photoshop 7.0 for Photographers: A professional image editor's guide to the creative use of Photoshop for the Macintosh and PC","review":"No, this book isn't quite for beginners - I wouldn't use it as a photoshop primer.

Rather, it is just what the title says--&quot;for photographers.&quot; If you already know the basics of Photoshop and the elements of photography, I think you will find this is the most valuable Photoshop book in print today.The book is divided into short (2 to 4-page) sections, each dealing with a common photographic problem (too dark, too much highlight, eyebrows too thin, waist too thick, facial blemishes and wrinkles, red eye, yellow teeth, color casts--you name it) and step-by-step remedies for each, including specific numerical values to plug into dialog boxes for filters. The book is useful for all sorts of photography, but I have found it most useful for pictures of people.

Nothing could be further from the truth.I am 'picking' on Evening's book because it is good. It does 'sell' the idea that any grandma can add a little cheek blush to the grand-kids and think of herself as a photographer. What Evening does not do is say, in very plain language, the digital, programmed, and limited features of Photoshop 7.0 (considering all available plug-ins, does not add up to photography.Evening is also caught between those who would invest in a high end software program and their ability to use it as a CGI generator; as a 'quick and easy' means of becoming a 'photograper.' In other words, if one is so stupid to buy PS 7.0, then why would one be doubly stupid in buying this book because Adobe makes the software so simple to use a monkey can create an image?The answer is as clear as our opposing thumbs: PS 7.0 comes with a manual a high school drop-out who hangs out on sexually-oriented websites and chatrooms can understand, and, Adobe is very good with customer support.This leaves the consumer with options. One can buy this book and read it. While the consumer reads this book they aren't making pictures. If one has PS 7.0 just use the program and teach yourself. This book is of absolutely no help to a cave dweller who magically wants to become a 'photographer' via PS 7.0.Evening's work is really condescending to Adobe users since the Adobe website (for FREE) answers all the issues contained in this volume. This volume is overly verbose to be helpful as a cheat sheet and quick fix for those without creativity and a willingness to work through the PS program.It just might be, for many, the best way to make a photograph is to avoid PS, this book, and just buy a camera and use it. Readers read and photographers photograph. Evening misses the point and has probably done nothing more than familiarize himself, through this tedious, boring, volume with PS7. He's not telling any of use who have used this program and it's support anything new.The only thing 'photographic' about computer generated images is the micro litho means by which the motherboard and circuitry of the processor is manufactured. Evening is perpetrating a fraud not of his making."},{"Title":"The Soviet impact on the western world,","review":"This work studies the Soviet Union's impact on the western world. Chapter 1 looks at its political impact, Chapter 2 at its economic impact, Chapter 3 at its social impact, Chapter 4 at its impact on international relations, Chapter 5 at its ideological impact, and Chapter 6 takes some historical perspectives.In Chapter 1, Carr notes that the Soviet Union charged that Western democracy is purely formal, that it ignores states' class contents, that it is just political, not extending to social and economic matters, that it is too tolerant of fascist opposition, and that it opposes involving the masses in the work of government. In sum, that parliamentary democracy is not so much democracy as plutocracy. He observes that in both the British and French revolutions, revolutionary dictatorships gave birth to bourgeois democracy.In Chapter 2, he describes Soviet planning for national efficiency in production and for social justice in distribution. He writes, Keynes' \\"\`comprehensive socialisation of investment' is the essence of planning.\\" He notes, \\"the planning policies of the Soviet Union provide so many precedents for British practice during the second world war.\\"In Chapter 3, Carr describes the retreat from laissez-faire ideology. Soviet social philosophy combined material and moral appeals (especially to equality), on collective terms, pursuing social aims, and recognised equal social obligations as well as equal social rights.In Chapter 4, Carr shows how its foreign trade monopoly enabled the Soviet Union to safeguard its vital national industries and protect its infant industries. He relates how its propaganda was aimed at the workers of the world. He describes its influence on political and diplomatic relations, its greater frankness and realism exposing the idealistic humbug of bourgeois diplomacy.In Chapter 5, he describes Marxism-Leninism as a coherent and consistent set of principles, based on materialism, a revolt against all idealism, which held that spirit and ideas were the ultimate reality.In Chapter 6, he shows how Soviet nationalism was progressive, \`based not on racial or nationalist prejudices' (Stalin), not on the assumption of the superior rights of the white man. Finally, he argues that the revolution heralded the end of the West-East movement of European history, and the start of an East-West movement, not through armed aggression or military conquest, but by the peaceful influence of ideas."},{"Title":"Llama and Alpaca Neonatal Care","review":"As an alpaca breeder for seven years, I still use this book as a reference guide and highly recommend it to folks who might be interested in breeding alpacas. It covers a wide range of topics with great illustrations and facts, from what signs of labor to look for to how to care for the newborn cria and don't forget the dam, after she delivers. Know that everything listed and described might not happen, but is a nice presentation and helpful resource to have besides your vet.

Kennan's brand of realism, and the implications of this for his views on US diplomacy.One of the major themes that emerges here: Kennan's skepticism that the U.S. tends to over-moralize in its foreign policy, at the expense of being able to appreciate power realities, to the detriment of our national interest.For example, Kennan argues that had the U.S. given more credence to European political concerns prior to WWI, and recognized that these impacted U.S. security, then America might have been able to bring its influence to bear on Europe and help bring the senseless destruction of WWI to an earlier end. Kennan believes that a proper appraisal of U.S. interests at stake would have involved raising a large army before WWI, which could have backed up U.S. diplomacy.Whether or not one agrees with Kennan's observations and assertions, this text prompts deeper reflection about the major impulses that have shaped, and continue to shape, U.S. foreign policy.Readers should buy the later version of this book, which includes lectures from 1984, where Kennan discusses how his views evolved over the years. The book I am reviewing here is only a series of 1950 lectures, plus Kennan's famous \\"Sources of Soviet Conduct\\" article in Foreign Affairs, and another one, \\"America and the Russian Future.\\""},{"Title":"American Diplomacy, 1900-1950","review":"George F. Kennan, \\"American Diplomacy\\" (1951)The United States is in a precarious position. Since WW II its security has been threatened as never before. George F. Kennan, in his book \\"American Diplomacy\\" (1951) examines American foreign policy during the past fifty years to explain the diminished security of the United States. He looks into the American policy during the Spanish American War, the \\"Open Door\\" in the Orient, WWI, and WWII. Presented as a series of lectures, Kennan concludes that United States foreign relations should return to a concept of neither a legalistic nor a moralistic approach to diplomacy, but rather an approach as a problem in positive power relationships with a workable balance of power as its objective.The book is significant for its influence on the major United States policy of containment during the nineteen-fifties and the present. As a policy to combat communist aggression, containment was recently under attack by Senator Fulbright.(a George Washington U. alumnus) who believes that the United States is over extended. With the crisis in Vietnam, one must consider whether there is credence to Fulbright's view and whether Kennan's policy is now out of date and inadvisable to continue. None-the-less the significance of Kennan's book \\"American Diplomacy\\" remains. Whether containment continues as a strong American policy or not, it will have served as a bulwark against communism for many years.Kennan admits he is \\"a novice in the field of diplomatic history,\\" but many years of personal experience are brought to bear. He is a former United States ambassador to the Soviet Union and to Yugoslavia, and has been at the Princeton Institute for Advanced Study. He is a winner of the Pulitzer and Bancroft prizes for history and also the National Book award. In his book \\"American Diplomacy 1900-1950, Kennan presents an argument - an analysis of the past and a conclusion based on this analysis. The author suggests rather than demands. \\"To avoid destruction the United States need only to measure up to its own best traditions and prove itself worthy of preservation as a great nation.\\"Kennan discusses the major issues, but does not omit detail. A good argument is all inclusive, and his is a good argument! In mentioning territorial acquisitions of the year 1898 as the first extensions of United States sovereignty beyond the continent of North America, Kennan is carefull to mention Samoa, where the United States only shared control, as a possible exception. A book of argument relies on the presentation of facts and the inferences drawn from them. Succeeding in this, the author's organization is such that the reader is taken from the beginning of the twentieth century to the middle with a continuing appraisal of United States foreign relations. In concluding his discussion on the Spanish American War, Kennan states the issues and problems of that time are the ones of today, \\"...and that, whereas the men of 1898 could afford to be mistaken in their answers to them, our generation longer has this luxury.\\"This is true. By the year 1900 the United States had become power with world-wide significance and one which could he affected by distant events. But at no previous time did the threat of complete annihilation face the United States as it does today. Circumstances have changed. When the United States emerged as a great power it was one among many: today it is one of two.The reader is given a well thought out and precisely stated delivery. The book is compact, well written, and direct in presentation. American Diplomacy is a book invaluable for training in diplomacy. We remember, however, that while it was copyrighted in 1951, it is still timely in that the cold war continues and American security is still threatened. Important. lessons can be learned which have a bearing on past and present United States policy.[Presented as originally written while a student at George Washington University.

His long career in academia and legal background are reflected in the statistical information, heavy footnoting, and extensive use of case laws. He discusses such issues as corporate compliance, consumerism, government regulation, and accountable management more than most management books. The book has 17 chapters about the U. S. Health System and health care industry including specific information about setting objectives, board of directors, structure and staffing, financial management, legal imperatives, and strategic planning. He does discuss the traditional theories of motivation and a fairly extensive discussion of Machiavelli. Many chapters end with a case study and discussion questions. An instructors manual and online tools are also available. This book is excellent for students in health administration programs and health care executives. It also makes a good companion to a leadership and management book that discusses the related theories in more traditional detail for health related disciplines."},{"Title":"Mondrian Cameo (Great Modern Masters)","review":"I think I like this book on Mondrian more than any other that I have. The reproductions are all quite good and plentiful. The text is fine, I learned a good deal. However it could have been a bit more insightful when bridging the seemingly different periods of his work. Look at his early paintings and see all that they have in common with everything else he did. Notice his reoccurring primary palette, his interest in outlines, how a turning windmill could perhaps have some connection to his decision to turn a canvas on end, and his love of nature and quest to understand everything as a vertical and horizontal mark. There are very few artists as open and brave as he who let his work truly evolve to such an ideal state."},{"Title":"Mondrian Cameo (Great Modern Masters)","review":"Reading this is a must for any artist .What can I say but I was told to read this and am so glad I was.

It has gone through many subsequent reprints due to the author's writing talent, and the timeless, universal love story set in Australia.Upon their mother's death, 18-year-old Angela Burns travels to Australia, with her 13-year-old sister Nellie. They are to live with a friend of their mother's. Upon their arrival in Australia, they find she has died. Angela, looking out for her younger sister's welfare, immediately gets a job. Unknown to Angela, Nellie has been spreading rumors that Angela has come to marry the rich cattle station owner, Gilbert Lawrence. Gilbert insists on marrying Angela to preserve his reputation, but only as a \\"marriage of convenience.\\" We continually admire both Angela and Giles privately, and root for both of them to get together. There is also a beautiful and rich, but conniving neighbor, who attempts to break up the couple before they can work out the mutual misunderstandings about what type of person the other one truly is. As in all romances, things work out happily in the end, and very satisfactorily.Having read hundreds of romance novels, I found \\"The Distant Hills\\" to be one of the best romances I have ever read. Having read this book at least twice before, in past years, I still could not put down the book reading a third or fourth time! Unlike many romance novels, where the reader feels like, \\"why don't they just TALK to each other, and everything would be resolved,\\" the characters in this book DO talk to each other. But the writing is strong, and OTHER characters create the misunderstandings between the two main characters, making good reasons for them to behave as they do. Both the main characters are people we highly admire, and that is what makes the end so satisfying when they finally do get together.I now intend to search out all the other books of Lucy Walker I can find (who I understand is the \\"romance queen\\" of Australia, according to one internet site). Do not hesitate to get this book. You will definitely enjoy both the story, and the authentic life in Australia. This author was born in the West Australian desert, and grew up living on sheep stations."},{"Title":"Baptism in the New Testament (Studies in Biblical theology)","review":"Oscar Cullman has the extraordinary ability to stay focussed on the New Testament core of the matter.

Problems.I've not long completed lesson 6 of 11 chapters of this book and I have to write I am not impressed.Errors in this book are too numerous and far from acceptable especially when one considers the price paid.!Lesson 6, a task which involves producing a disc clamp part for a project which is intended to culminate into a vice assembly was found to be totally impossible to produce based on the information given both pictorially and dimensionally.Male and female cone locators have no dimension location. They just float about a common axis.Pockets are not dimensionally defined by form or location. What happened to the radiuses and depth?In the first pictorial view, there are two webbed or cut rounded like forms within a revolved concentric recess that conflict with an adjacent view depicting its opposite side.In the initial view one wonders if they could be through cuts. Then when one looks at the proceeding view one wonders if they are in fact webs since no through cuts are shown.However, my final interpretation has resulted in these being similar through cuts as a result of a half cylindrically revolved recess, intended to mate and secure to a shaft (incidentally, this lacked a centre line axis to define position and had to be assumed central, based on neighbouring features).I believe a section view is needed here and perhaps a more consistent drawing form design intent. Ideally two pictorial views supported by 3rd angle elevation views to help reduce the dimensional clutter and convey the form more accurately and clearly. I had to call on judgement and design intuition to complete this to a credible standard.This is shoddy and totally unacceptable, since this task is essential for completion of the final vice assembly task. Confidence is not inspired it is merely weakened. I now ask myself, \\"Are there going to be further omissions fudges and errors?\\"There is no substitute for correctly presented and communicated drawings (as the author acknowledges to a degree somewhere in his text), ideally to BS308 standard or similarly recognised drawing standard (for example adhering to the use of a common datum/s for dimensions, which seems to be lacking here).In terms of a complete training package, apart from needing huge reserves of patience and time, one cannot effectively get through this book without reference to its companion CD. Its use is essential (especially for partially assisting with navigating legacy Pro-Engineer menu features, which I still find somewhat irksome since there is no info on how to respond when one gets into an odd seemingly inescapable command \`wont cancel' kind of loop).This aspect of the software is far from intuitive. It does not act or respond to user inputs in ways the unfamiliar would expect and needs explanation. The author seems to have hoped or assumed that either the reader has previous exposure to an earlier version/s of Pro-Engineer - which I don't - or that a suitable software upgrade at further expense to the reader should patch this instructional omission. Again this is not good enough!Looking back, beware of chapter 3 exercise task 4. The 'Loop' Sketcher command was needed here to eliminate what was a by-product of a chamfer profile (your approach might be different to mine). The 'loop' command was not mentioned in this chapter nor do I recall in previous ones. Took way to long to find it and identify its use. Trial and error was called upon to achieve it.Based on my progress to date, I believe most uninitiated users of Pro-Engineer reliant on this tutorial as their primary source of instruction would need at least 'three' months to complete it successfully, without additional guidance support either by means of another book/CD combo or a knowledgeable Pro-Engineer tutor to help clarify and fill in the gaps and I think that's quite optimistic.I'm in search of another book!Views and experiences expressed by a practicing design engineer."},{"Title":"Pro/ENGINEER Wildfire Tutorial and Multimedia CD","review":"The book is just bad. Most exercises have no dimensions on them so you are really estimating dimensions and remembering them as u go along developing the part. This is OK with simple parts but with complex parts it would be nice to have dimensions. With dimensions one can compare the the part with the pictorial provided in the book - that gives the user an idea whether he/she modelled the part right. Sometimes it is possible to do the wrong thing and still get something that looks similar but is wrong. Dimensions quantize the end result and the user can know for SURE if the work done was right. In CAD its either a 100% right or 100% wrong especially if the error is in a key feature that is going to be mated with another part.Even the few exercises which have dimensions are confusing. Some dimensions are vague and the user can misunderstand a dimension and only after working halfway does one realise that the part does not work! This is due to poor dimensioning and even poorer graphic quality of the book.All this would still be OK if the book did a good job in letting you know how to use Pro/E. It does not. Its too wordy, vague, explaining things in a roundabout manner. How about having 2 pages to explain a concept like mirroring. Something which should take no more than 1 paragraph. They should separate the how-to-do-it and what-it-means aspects of the software. Its ludicrous to expect someone to read 3-4 pages to get to know something simple like modifying feature dimensions or setting references.Lastly I have had this book for 1 month and I use all books very carefully yet the spine is coming unglued. I will be happy if the book lasts the rest of the semester."},{"Title":"Pro/ENGINEER Wildfire Tutorial and Multimedia CD","review":"Pro/ENGINEER Wildfire Tutorial and no Multimedia CD.

The text portion is tutorial in style and is designed to illustrate the features of Pro/ENGINEER Wildfire. The MultiMedia CD, that is included with the book, contains an audio/visual presentation of the tutorial exercises contained in the book. A good approach to this book is to first view the CD to get a feel for how the software looks, then work through the tutorial exercises.This book contains eleven tutorial lessons as follows:1. User Interface, View Controls and Model Structure2. Creating a Simple Object: Datum Planes, Sketcher3. Creating a Simple Object: Holes, Chamfer, Rounds, Model Trees, Dimensions, etc.4. Revolved Protrusions, Mirror Copies, Rounds, and Chamfers5. Modeling Utilities and the 3 R's6. Datums and Sketcher Tools7. Patterns and Copies8. Engineering Drawings9. Assembly Fundamentals10. Assembly Operations11. Sweeps and BlendsThe Appendix contains information on interface customization.This book is, without a doubt, the best selling Pro/ENGINEER book available. It is widely used throughout the United States and Canada by colleges and universities that want to introduce their students to Pro/ENGINEER. If a school close to you teaches Pro/ENGINEER, contact the professor in charge of the course and ask what textbook he is using. More often than not, it will be this book. Before teachers adopt a book, they have the opportunity to examine all Pro/ENGINEER books that are available.

The author had the wonderful idea of writing basically one book and selling 30. Genius.The book is structured as follows:- A running-specific introduction- Generic advice about gym workouts: basic stuff like the necessity of warming up and cooling down and making sure you don't lift more weight than you can- Tons of (generic) exercises- Two pseudo-scientific articles (one about technique and another about nutrition). These were the only remotely useful bits of the book, and they were written by other specialists.From the above, it doesn't sound so bad. You could even thing this book was worthwhile. This is why it is not:- The only running-specific advice is contained in the introduction (and the two articles), which is just 9 pages long (with huge font and big tables!)). All the rest of the book is totally generic, addressed to runners, racquetball players and golfers alike. Seriously, there is no other running-specific advice anywhere else, meaning around 85% of the book.- The explanations to the exercises are pretty basic, similar to what you'll find printed in most decent gym machines. No value added there.- Even worse, not even the selection of the exercises seemed to be really thought for runners. Only 20% (12 out of 60) of the exercises are for legs. I'm totally for a balanced work-out and training the core muscles, but you'd think runners would want to focus just a little bit more that 20% on the legs, right?- There is no distinction between sprinters, hurdlers, marathoners, ultramarathoners, etc., which you'd assume would require \\"slightly\\" different training routines. You are left wondering whether the author even knows that there are several kinds of runners.- Most annoyingly, the text is full of ads inviting the reader to join the author's (paid) website.

Tyanna reacts by beating up her alleged culprit until she realizes the man lying at her feet is her former boyfriend Sheldon Ford. About a year ago, Sheldon vanished without a word when Tyanna thought she finally had found the love of her life. He tries to explain but she tells him to go write a novel, as his claim is way out.However, Tyanna follows up on Sheldon insisting that a former acquaintance at a different gym where he and she met had mob ties and wanted him dead for snooping. Sheldon believes that the now deceased Dino Benedetto killed his brother while dealing in illegal steroids. With Dino dead, Sheldon wants a second chance as he insists he ran to keep her and his mother safe. When bad things happen to Tyanna and Sheldon while they fall in love all over again, he wants to run again, but this time his beloved serves as the bait.TELL ME YOU LOVE ME is an exciting romantic suspense that is at its best when Sheldon pleads his case. The story line is loaded with a wide gamut of emotions including remorse and regret, and a charming secondary duet enhancing the romantic elements. A subplot involving Dino's cousin provides action, intrigue, and a personal dilemma, but also takes the reader away from the key theme of trust. Fans still will appreciate this well written exhilarating tale starring two delightful lead protagonists.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Tell Me You Love Me","review":"I've read other books by this author and again I wasn't disappointed.

For example, he leaves out many details about pond construction because he believes it should be made from concrete, and should be left to a professional along with electrical wiring, surveying, and landscaping.As far as a reference book on koi, I found it to be excellent, and it certainly gives a different perspective on pond setups."},{"Title":"Koi Kichi","review":"Koi Kichi is a tremendous contribution to the hobby. It is also a beautiful book of commanding size and weight. This is a complete guide for beginning koi keepers and old hands alike. Waddington's recommedations are helpful and his koi stories are entertaining for the koi-keeper and non-koi-keeper.While the Tetra Encyclopedia of Koi may be more affordable and has been basic to the hobby for many years, the extra money for Koi Kichi will be well spent. And, after all, the price is not so outrageous if you ever had a subscription to Nichiren. In fact, very good-looking koi cost much more than Koi Kichi! Yes, sometimes, thousands of times more than the retail price.If you aren't in the koi hobby, this book also makes a fascinating and handsome coffee table book. Waddington's photographs of koi ponds and some of the most stunning and prize-winning koi ever to be photographed will be sure to make for interesting tea time conversations for years to come. You will be sure to hear, the delighted question: &quot;What are Koi!?&quot;You don't know what koi are? Check out the Koi Unlimited Homepage at (http://www.koi-unlimited.com/).

I enjoy Koumunyakaa and his choices for this years best poetry. I especially enjoyed his introduction talking about the lack of content in many poems today. As with most books in this series, there are many familiar names such as Merwin, Williams, Kizer, Levine, Philips, but also some new and hopefully upcoming poets, such as Joy Katz. There are a few September 11th poems, but most of them are readable. This is one of the best in the series that I have read."},{"Title":"The Best American Poetry 2003","review":"Thank you, David Lehman, for having chosen Yusef Komunyakaa to edit THE BEST AMERICAN POETRY 2003, the most interesting since Adrienne Rich edited THE BEST AMERICAN POETRY 1996.

He is the author of The Daily Mirror, a wonderful and well penned selection of poems.I believe his perspective and talent for finding the best poets lies in his experience. Mr.Lehman is a great editor and any reader who chooses to pick up and read this book will be thankful.One can learn so much from the writers and makers of The Best American Poetry books.

The city of Yangzhou lies in the delta of the Yangzi River in eastern China. It was once the center of the salt trade and was a hub of the canal networks that connected north and south China in imperial times. Professional storytellers have been active in the area for several hundred years and a local style of storytelling known as Yangzhou pinghua gradually developed. Similar styles are found in other regional cities, particularly Suzhou and Shanghai. Stories are told in story houses where patrons, usually older men, gather daily to listen to episodes of the lengthy tales, often stories of heroes from Chinese history. A popular story is that of Wu Song, who killed a tiger with his bare hands after drinking in a local tavern at the foot of a mountain. Such tales often take weeks or even months to complete and are a mixture of conflict, humor, and interesting asides. Bordahl has thoroughly researched the Yangzhou tradition and supplies the reader with a historical overview of Chinese storytelling, an analysis of the speaking styles in Yangzhou storytelling, and a number of careful translations of select episodes in the Wu Song story cycle. Book-length studies of local styles of Chinese oral tradition are still rarities and the attention given the Yangzhou style is well-deserved and well-executed. While written primarily as a scholarly study, certain parts of the work could inform classroom studies of Chinese folklore and oral performance for younger students. The volume is very well printed on glossy paper with excellent black and white photos of contemporary storytellers."},{"Title":"Die Kreuzer der US-Navy: 1942-1975 (German Edition)","review":"Covers 1920s (Omaha-class), up to WWII cruisers and anything built from cruiser hulls.

Really. His lighting and use of color make these images more sophisticated and impactful than even his earlier black and white photographs - which are amazing. On Form isn't just the display of beautful bodies, it is highly acomplished art from a photographer who shows what it means to become a master of the human form."},{"Title":"On Form","review":"These are wonderful photos of the most important shape in the human worlds - the human shape itself.These are all studio photos, and share the same sense of composition. The figure is there, sometimes multiple figures, and always represented in an utterly literal way. As the cover suggests, however, the models often seem like some kind of raw material. Bitesnich uses that material in improbable sculptural ways - Ingrid (the cover model), Zuzana, and Bernhard make me stop for just a moment, wondering what I'm looking at. Kika makes me stop, too.This is an enjoyable, thought-provoking collection of figures. They're all young, strong adults, at the height of their handsomeness. They are beautiful people, but skip over the possibilities of older forms. Perhaps the next collection will show more of the different ages of man, but this is a good set anyway.//wiredweird"},{"Title":"On Form","review":"If you are looking for nude photos of typical people -- look elsewhere. The book is filled with beautiful people, with a few rare exceptions. Many photos are of bodies sculpted in unnatural poses. Large full page photos and nicely bound - a nice production and a model for other books. One of my favorites."},{"Title":"On Form","review":"This is not just a book, nor is it just a packaged portfolio of images - this is a true work of art. On Form is such a grand example of perfection that describing it as anything less than a work of art is criminal. From the flawless ensemble put together by te Neus to the larger-than-life photography contained within, this is easily one of the best books of 2003 and may be Bitesnich's greatest book yet. It's huge at 11x14\\" and most images flood the page from edge-to-edge. There are over 200 pages of nude photography that is so powerful it's almost impossible to take it all in during one sitting. This requires a double espresso, a giant Jamaican spliff and/or a pack of Marlboro's, maybe even lunch. This is less a book and more a museum visit.Bitesnich covers the form of both sexes here, and if ever the human body were portrayed as a work of art, it's here. The lighting, the composition, the flowing muscularity, the shape, and form of all within are possessed of a god-like perfection never so exquisitely rendered by a photographic artist."},{"Title":"On Form","review":"I was misguided by this book, the quality of the book, the paper, the design, etc. all superb.now looking into the photographers subjects. Well, they are perfect, they are beautiful, they are in great shape and physique, Not to mention that the women are extremely attractive and sensual.so where's the challenge, where's the passion, where's the desire to push into new boundaries that go beyond making the subject mold into different shapes. I must be missing this, so I shared the book with some other friends and photographers and we all agreed that the book falls into fashion and glamour and not into art and form analyisis.Now I know that I'm more traditional, but when thinking about shape I think of other photographers who have with little effort pushed us into looking at the human body in a different light and in a different angle, making us redefine beauty and finding sensuality in the mundane.I can't catalogue this as anything outside of a bathing suit issue or a fashion shoot with supermodels"},{"Title":"The Moon Over Crete","review":"This book is a good idea that didn't make it. The author leaves so many loose ends hanging there unexplained! For example, it is never said, anywhere in the book, that they can't go back to exactly the same time twice, but just accepted as a matter of course.The historical theories, however, are very interesting."},{"Title":"The Moon Over Crete","review":"This is a beautifully-written book that was also gripping from the first page to the last. I actually shed a tear towards the end -- but it is not a sad book. It is an inspiring book that teaches children about an unusual subject: gender equality.

When conjuring up images of this precise phenomenon, no name rings louder than that of James Jesus Angleton, who himself was enveloped and ultimately destroyed by his obsession with uncovering a \\"mole\\" within the CIA.Martin's brief account of the CIA's largely unsuccessful efforts to spy on the Soviet Union during the Cold War alternates between the stories of \\"Jim\\" Angleton and \\"Bill\\" Harvey, two CIA trailblazers who undoubtedly left their marks in their profession. What's unfortunate is that while they may have scored some early successes, they spent the latter parts of their careers in shambles, with both resigning under hostile circumstances. Especially in Angleton's case, it is tough to objectively determine whether he did more good than bad.For a more detailed account of the CI fiasco involving Angleton, Golitsin, and Nosenko, check out David Wise's \\"Molehunt.\\""},{"Title":"Wilderness of Mirrors: Intrigue, Deception, and the Secrets that Destroyed Two of the Cold War's Most Important Agents","review":"This book, which relates the ongoing war between the CIA and the KGB, focuses on the activities of William K. Harvey, a gun-totin' ex-FBI agent (who does not seem to have entirely evolved in a social sense), and James Jesus Angleton, a Yale graduate who lived first in Italy and then in England, where he learned the fine arts of counter-espionage at the knees, as it were, of Kim Philby, and was in charge of counter-espionage at the CIA. The revelation that the latter was a KGB penetration agent in British Intelligence seems to have engendered extreme paranoia in the former, who was ever after on the lookout for moles in the Agency (and was even suspected by some of his colleagues of being one himself).The tales of covert operations range from the amusing (an agent loitering in a park to make a dead-letter drop being arrested as a potential child molester) to the appalling (the dastardly enticement of the Soviet defector Yuri Nosenko with promises of a salaried job and then keeping him in what was tantamount to a cage for 1277 days (292 of which were devoted to interrogation) [p, 171], all because of the dubious word of Anatoli Golitsin, a previous defector--living high off the hog at taxpayer expense--who warned that the next defector would be a KGB plant.). Angleton placed his faith unstintingly in Golitsin, whose wild scenarios had Averell Harriman, a former United States ambassador to the Soviet Union, cast as a KGB agent. It never seems to have occurred to Angleton that Golitsin may have been the KGB plant, intent on making mischief.The title, \\"Wilderness of Mirrors,\\" was apparently coined by Angleton, who was a poet in his spare time. It refers to the labyrinthine world of espionage into which one is \\"lured deeper and deeper ... pursuing the traces of Soviet plots, both real and imagined, each step taking [one] farther into a bewildering world of intrigue ... [p. 10].The author notes the justification of the battle between the CIA and the KGB, but he also cites the absurdity of its reality. \\"The careers of Angleton and Harvey were mired in absurdities, not the least of which was that they habitually violated the democratic freedoms they were sworn to defend . . . Immersed in duplicity and insulated by secrecy, they developed survival mechanisms and behavior patterns that by any rational standard were bizarre. The forced inbreeding of secrecy spawned mutant deeds and thoughts. Loyalty demanded dishonesty, and duty was a thieves' game. The game attracted strange men and slowly twisted them until something snapped. There were no winners or losers in this game, only victims\\" [p. 226]."},{"Title":"Wilderness of Mirrors: Intrigue, Deception, and the Secrets that Destroyed Two of the Cold War's Most Important Agents","review":"Since its establishment in 1947, CIA has enjoyed some modest successes as an agent for regime change, but does not to appear to have been a very effective intelligence agency. Yet during the first 25 years of its existence under the freewheeling influence of the many WWII Office of Strategic Services (OSS) veterans who formed its original cadre, it certainly seems to have been an interesting place to work. Indeed its halls were apparently filled with interesting and colorful characters who may or may not have been very good intelligence officers, but who were never boring. This very good book provides the story of two such characters who were at the heart of the CIA counterintelligence program.James Jesus Angleton was clearly CIA material with his WWII OSS experience, Ivy League education, and international background. Yet he was also by all accounts one the strangest intelligence officers CIA ever recruited. An orchid growing intellectual, Angleton began his long involvement with counterintelligence with the OSS under the tutorship of Kim Philby, who even then was a Soviet mole. He appeared to thrive on the intellectual challenges presented by convoluted and complex work that was counterintelligence. From the first he applied himself to seeking out Soviet agents within CIA with the passion and zealotry of a Jesuit converting a heretic. In the end his efforts failed to find real evidence of Soviet penetration of CIA, but in the notorious \`mole' search he initiated succeeded in virtually destroying its ability to run clandestine operations against the Soviets. Ironically for all his zeal, Angleton was unable to recognize that his mentor and friend Philby was a Soviet plant in heart of the delicate U.S. and UK intelligence relationship.William King Harvey was Angleton's complete opposite in every respect. He was a small town lawyer turned FBI agent who was sacked because his behavior came too close to breaking the number one rule of the FBI in the post war period, don't embarrasses Mr. Hoover. Somewhat like Angleton however, Harvey had developed a passion for counterintelligence work and when he was sacked was probably the FBI's leading expert in this arcane subject. The newly created CIA was struggling to create a counterintelligence program and was happy to take Harvey on board. He and Angleton quickly learned to loathe each other. The hard drinking, womanizing Harvey tended to shoot from the hip, while the aesthetic Angleton tended to move carefully and intellectually. Fortunately Harvey decided that he would like the rough and tumble of overseas work and got a plume assignment in the then divided city of Berlin where he was clearly at home. Prior to taking this assignment however, Harvey presented CIA with what in the end was an accurate argument that Philby was indeed a Soviet plant.In the end the careers of both men were destroyed by the very things that made them effective counterintelligence agents and the sea changes that shook CIA in the 1970's"},{"Title":"Wilderness of Mirrors: Intrigue, Deception, and the Secrets that Destroyed Two of the Cold War's Most Important Agents","review":"I found myself wanting to know more about the beginnings of the CIA as well as their cold war exploits. This book was recommended to me by a friend and is a good starting point to find out about some of the key players in the US intelligence of previous years. There is much about background or the beginnings of the CIA, this book is more of a character study of two men, James Jesus Angelton, who most people are familiar with and William Harvey, who most people seem not to know. It is an interesting tale of how two men got so wrapped up in their own ego's as well as paranoia that they brought CIA intelligence operations to a halt. It also paints the CIA as an agency without a clear direction and poorly managed. This book had the effect that all good non-fiction books have on me, it casued me to do more research on the events and people in the book. Great read if you want to see the effect 2 men can have on an agency but don't expect a broad history of the CIA."},{"Title":"Wilderness of Mirrors: Intrigue, Deception, and the Secrets that Destroyed Two of the Cold War's Most Important Agents","review":"Definitely a classic.
