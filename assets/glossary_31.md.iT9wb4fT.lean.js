Giger (1940ndash;2014) reigned as one of the leading exponents of fantastic art. After he studied interior and industrial design for eight years at the School of Commercial Art in Zurich, Switzerland, from 1962 till 1970, he was soon gaining attention as an independent artist, with endeavors ranging from surrealistic dream landscapes created with a spray gun and stencils, to album cover designs for famous pop stars, and sculptures.

The time is the decade before the plague of AIDS. Thousands of gay men were living a free-wheeling lifestyle of club hopping, score hunting, sex without fear, and upward mobility. To none did The Big Apple offer greater rewards than to those young men who had the envied male model look. Author James Melson belonged to this exclusive clique: he was tall, blond, muscular, and very straight-looking. He was a model at 19, and by 25, was a successful Wall Street banker. His good looks offered him immediate entry into exclusive clubs and onto the sexual fast track with actors, male models, and other members of the Clique. In The Golden Boy, the author brings you behind the scenes into the lifestyle of the handsome Cliqueproviding vivid details of the vigorous and entertaining excitement of the times. He exposesfor one of the few times in printthe lesser-known attitudes of the Clique and their disdain for ugly faggots, their obsession with strictly the chic and glamorous, and the fast lane life of partying and sex.

This is the absorbing story of Neil deGrasse Tyson s lifelong fascination with the night sky, a restless wonder that began some thirty years ago on the roof of his Bronx apartment building and eventually led him to become the director of the Hayden Planetarium. A unique chronicle of a young man who at one time was both nerd and jock, Tyson s memoir could well inspire other similarly curious youngsters to pursue their dreams. Like many athletic kids he played baseball, won medals in track and swimming, and was captain of his high school wrestling team. But at the same time he was setting up a telescope on winter nights, taking an advanced astronomy course at the Hayden Planetarium, and spending a summer vacation at an astronomy camp in the Mojave Desert. Eventually, his scientific curiosity prevailed, and he went on to graduate in physics from Harvard and to earn a Ph.D. in astrophysics from Columbia. There followed postdoctoral research at Princeton. In 1996, he became the director of the Hayden Planetarium, where some twenty-five years earlier he had been awed by the spectacular vista in the sky theater. Tyson pays tribute to the key teachers and mentors who recognized his precocious interests and abilities, and helped him succeed. He intersperses personal reminiscences with thoughts on scientific literacy, careful science vs. media hype, the possibility that a meteor could someday hit the Earth, dealing with society s racial stereotypes, what science can and cannot say about the existence of God, and many other interesting insights about science, society, and the nature of the universe. Now available in paperback with a new preface and other additions, this engaging memoir will enlighten and inspire an appreciation of astronomy and the wonders of our universe.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=aOwWoZyvUV8C&dq=The+Sky+Is+Not+the+Limit:+Adventures+of+an+Urban+Astrophysicist&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cooking without looking: Food preparation methods and techniques for visually handicapped homemakers","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=EVSbngEACAAJ&dq=Cooking+without+looking:+Food+preparation+methods+and+techniques+for+visually+handicapped+homemakers&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Circling the Sacred Mountain : A Spiritual Adventure Through the Himalayas","description":"This true story of spiritual mountain adventure is told by a trekking group's leader, a teacher of Tibetan Buddhism, and one of its members, a student struggling to acclimate both physically and emotionally to his surroundings.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=YdcGAAAAYAAJ&dq=Circling+the+Sacred+Mountain+:+A+Spiritual+Adventure+Through+the+Himalayas&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The history of Quakerism,","description":"*Includes pictures *Includes quotes from George Fox and other Quakers *Includes online resources and a bibliography for further reading \\"I was plain, and would have all things done plainly; for I did not seek any outward advantage to myself.\\" - George Fox Since its fruition, Christianity has faced an unremitting string of conflicts, critics, and challenges. As the number of Christian converts grew, the growth in clashes on ideologies and control was only natural. In the same vein, more and more of those who called themselves Christians seemed to be straying further and further away from God's light. Drunkenness, heresy, and immorality were on the rise. The Middle Ages was especially rife with rape, incest, adultery, and other obscene sexual behaviors, which were well-recorded by medieval chroniclers. The English scholar, Alcuin, lamented that civilization had become \\"absolutely submerged under flood of fornication, adultery, and incest, so that the very semblance of modesty is entirely absent.\\" Towards the 17th century, the Puritan-raised George Fox became increasingly discouraged by the worsening moral conditions of society. George was unable to fill the spiritual void inside of him, until one day, he discovered his inner \\"Light.\\" Next came the godly visions. George began to preach about the \\"true\\" Word of God, and soon, amassed a following - the Religious Society of Friends, later known as the \\"Quakers.\\" Few today know much about the Quakers. Whenever the subject of Quakerism slips into conversation, most picture a rosy-cheeked fellow in a simple black overcoat, and a wide brim hat atop his thick, cloud-white hair, inspired by the famous logo of the Quaker Oats company. In spite of the stereotype, Quakers today come in all colors, shapes, and sizes, with the more liberal folk sporting trendy haircuts, tattoos, and various piercings. They call themselves \\"Friends,\\" a starkly different but very devout following of God. They strive for a world empowered by peace and acceptance, an ambitious mission fueled by diversity, blind to race, gender, or creed. As amicably harmless as the Friends might appear, there was once a time when being a Quaker was at the very best an instant conviction, and at the very worst a death sentence. Their unorthodox ideals were considered poisonous and potentially dangerous by authorities, who would fight time and time again to stamp out the flames of their movement, but still, they weathered storm after storm. And while the peace-loving followers of Christ were famed for their views of harmony, by no means were they feeble opponents. Not only would they persevere in the face of persecution, theirs is a movement that is so powerful, it stands strong centuries later, with a following more rich and diverse than ever before. The Quakers: The History and Legacy of the Religious Society of Friends profiles the life of George Fox, examines the origins of Quakerism, and looks at the Quaker utopia the community attempted to establish in Pennsylvania. This book also covers both the praise and criticism the unusually liberal Christian order has attracted over the centuries. Along with pictures of important people, places, and events, you will learn about the Quakers like never before.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=y_buAQAACAAJ&dq=The+history+of+Quakerism,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Creative Guitar 2: Advanced Techniques (Vol 2)","description":"Contains a learning programme designed to develop each individual's unique playing style Detailed analysis of the most influential rock guitarists Includes a free 60-minute CD of guitar examples.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=wGWKQgAACAAJ&dq=Creative+Guitar+2:+Advanced+Techniques+(Vol+2)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The expanding circle: Ethics and sociobiology (A Meridian book)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=nl_uAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+expanding+circle:+Ethics+and+sociobiology+(A+Meridian+book)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Companion to Wittgenstein's Tractatus (Cornell Classics in Philosophy)","description":"'It is one of the merits of Max Black's Companion to the Tractatus that he emphasizes the continuity of Wittgenstein's philosophical development by frequent quotation from his later writings.'?New York Review of Books ?Black's book is, in effect, two books in one, and each of them is very good.

Old models of investigation that artificially isolated \\"folk medicine,\\" \\"complementary and alternative medicine,\\" and \\"biomedicine\\" as mutually exclusive have proven too limited in exploring the real-life complexities of health belief systems as they observably exist and are applied by contemporary Americans. Recent research strongly suggests that individuals construct their health belief systmes from diverse sources of authority, including community and ethnic tradition, education, spiritual beliefs, personal experience, the influence of popular media, and perception of the goals and means of formal medicine. Healing Logics explores the diversity of these belief systems and how they interact in competing, conflicting, and sometimes remarkably congruent ways.

Controversial, passionate, audacious. Frank Hurley was an extraordinary Australian, possibly most famous for his Antarctic photographs captured alongside expeditioners Sir Douglas Mawson and Sir Ernest Shackleton. From the early twentieth century until his death in 1962 Hurley created a stunning visual archive that chronicled the major events of the twentieth century, and Australia's achievements both home and overseas. This book and the Hurley Collection in the National Library of Australia make clear this outstanding contribution and the lengths to which the man would go in order to convey the gravity of events. For Hurley, image-making and exploration went hand-in-hand and he sought out experiences as a pioneer documentary film-maker, official photographer in two world wars, early aviator, and adventure and story-seeker in both the natural environment and in rapidly disappearing non-western worlds. In this readable, definitive and wonderfully illustrated re-issued biography, Alasdair McGregor describes Hurley's life and character in all its richness.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=YXyODwAAQBAJ&dq=Frank+Hurley:+A+Photographer%27s+Life&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"New Women of the New South : The Leaders of the Woman Suffrage Movement in the Southern States","description":"There is currently a great deal of interest in the Southern suffrage movement, but until now historians have had no comprehensive history of the woman suffrage movement in the South, the region where suffragists had the hardest fight and the least success. This important new book focuses on eleven of the movement's most prominent leaders at the regional and national levels, exploring the range of opinions within this group, with particular emphasis on race and states' rights. Wheeler insists that the suffragists were motivated primarily by the desire to secure public affirmation of female equality and to protect the interests of women, children, and the poor in the tradition of noblesse oblige in a New South they perceived as misgoverned by crass and materialistic men. A vigorous suffrage movement began in the South in the 1890s, however, because suffragists believed offering woman suffrage as a way of countering black voting strength gave them an \\"expediency\\" argument that would succeed--even make the South lead the nation in the adoption of woman suffrage. When this strategy failed, the movement flagged, until the Progressive Movement provided a new rationale for female enfranchisement. Wheeler also emphasizes the relationship between the Northern and Southern leaders, which was one of mutual influence. This pioneering study of the Southern suffrage movement will be essential to students of the history of woman suffrage, American women, the South, the Progressive Era, and American reform movements.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=kE6lZpmLmK0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"G.

It is, after all, that stratum of history that touches our lives most closely. Madison answers the basic questions of when, where, why, how, and by whom Madison, Wisconsin was developed. The book is richly detailed, fully documented, inclusive in coverage, and delightfully readable. More than 300 illustrations provide a vivid feeling for what life was like in Madison during the formative years. David Mollenhoff's unique interpretive framework emphasizing public policies and community values, gives the book a consistent interpretive quality and reveals major themes that flow through time. This combination will allow you to see the city's growth and development with unusual clarity and coherence--almost as if you were watching time-lapse photography. When Mollenhoff began to study Madison's history, he was delighted by his early discoveries but frustrated because no one had written a book-length history of Madison since 1876. Finally, in 1972 he decided to write that book. His research required him to read five miles of microfilm, piles of theses and dissertations, shelves of reports, boxes of manuscripts and letters, and to study thousands of photographs. Soon after the first edition was published in 1982, readers declared it to be a classic. For this second edition Madison has been extensively revised and updated with new maps and photos. If you want to know the fascinating story of how Madison got to be the way it is, this book belongs on your bookshelf. It will change the way you see the city and your role in it.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2Nl5AAAAMAAJ&dq=Complete+Madison,+The&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Poems of Patriotism","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BgUPAAAAIAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Citadelle (French Edition)","description":"Identifies and summarizes thousands of books, article, exhibition catalogues, government publications, and theses published in many countries and in several languages from the early nineteenth century to 1981.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=gquqnLOBH9gC&dq=Citadelle+(French+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The case of the haunted husband","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=fJMIAQAAIAAJ&dq=The+case+of+the+haunted+husband&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Battle of Gettysburg; (Sentry edition)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=YbxDoAEACAAJ&dq=The+Battle+of+Gettysburg%3B+(Sentry+edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Bon Vivant's Companion or How to Mix Drinks","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=QDUEAAAAYAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Africa Explored: Europeans in the Dark Continent, 1769-1889","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=a2-BQgAACAAJ&dq=Africa+Explored:+Europeans+in+the+Dark+Continent,+1769-1889&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Triple Jeopardy (A Nero Wolfe Threesome)","description":"Don't tempt Nero Wolfe to find the culprit.

Keenan thus finds that Aquinas's earlier writings do not permit the possibility of such a distinction. But in his mature works, specifically the Summa Theologiae, Thomas describes the human act of moral intentionality, and even the virtues in a way analogous to our use of the term moral rightness. To Thomas, only the virtue of charity expresses moral goodness. And, although Thomas describes vices and sin as wrong conduct, he never really develops a description for moral badness.Keenan compels us to carefully examine Thomas's central moral concepts and to measure them against contemporary standards for meaning and correctness. As a result, any student of Thomas will find here a forceful argument that his notion of the good is considerably different from ours. Similarly, ethicists and moral theologians will find in the Thomas presented here a consistent-virtue ethicist concerned with descriptions for right living. Any student of theology will also find here a Thomas whose critical and concrete thinking enabled him to develop and even abandon earlier positions as his comprehension of the Good evolved. This analysis prompts a re-examination of our own concepts. Measuring Thomas's standards against our own, Keenan obliges us to ask whether we sufficiently understand rightness and moral intentionality. He also asks whether we correctly describe what it means to will or to desire something. He further questions whether we have surrendered our understanding of the virtues to the voluntarism and subjectivism which Thomas relentlessly critiqued. This historically sophisticated reading of the Summa Thologiae both allows Thomas to speak again as he once did, and affords us the chance to evaluate the way we describe ourselves and one another as being good and living rightly.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=HeQBouaVMNMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The September Apocalypse: An Eyewitness Account of the September 11th Disaster","description":"On September 11th, 2001, Dennis sinneD was late for work at the World Trade Center.

Entre esta version y la que se imprimio en 1791 (esto si, en cambio, se sa be con seguridad gracias a una carta del propio Sade a su mujer) hay diferencias notables, entre otras la de extension. Es probable que Sade perdiera de vista los manuscritos que fueron encontrados en su celda despues del 4 de julio de 1789, cuando fue liberado de la bastilla al triunfar la Revolucion. Esto induce a pensar que el habia entregado ya clandestinamente a su mujer el manuscrito de Justine durante una de sus visitas, como todos los demas manuscritos escritos en prision, que, gracias a este sistema, han llegado hasta nosotros. Ahora bien, en mayo de 1790, Madame de Sade decide separarse legalmente de su marido reteniendo todos sus papeles. Tan solo a finales de ese ano llegan a un acuerdo de divorcio mediante el cual se presume que Sade recupera, entre otras cosas, sus manuscritos. De modo que es licito deducir que Sade habra redactado la version definitiva de 1791, o bien entre enero y junio de 1789, o bien entre la primavera de 1790 y la de 1791. Dejemos al propio Divino Marques comentarle su libro a su mujer Constance: [El objetivo de esta novela es el de]presentar por todas partes al Vicio triunfante y a la Virtud como victima de sus sacrificios; a una desgraciada vagando de desventura en desventura cual juguete en manos de la maldad, entregada a todos los desenfrenos, al albur de los gustos mas barbaros y mas monstruosos, aturdida por los sofismas mas atrevidos y mas perversos, presa de las seducciones mas habiles, de las sumisiones mas irresistibles; () atreverse en resumen a las descripciones mas osadas, a las situaciones mas extraordinarias, a los pensamientos mas espantosos, () con el unico fin de obtener de todo ello una de las mas sublimes lecciones de moral que el hombre haya recibido jamas: era, habra de convenir, alcanzar el objetivo por un camino hasta ahora jamas hollado por el.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=wZcAswEACAAJ&dq=Justine+(Spanish+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Career","description":"A Career in Books is a graphic novel for everyone who's wanted to \\"work with books\\" and had NO idea what it entailed.

And it's . . . great?  \\\\_( )_/  They know they're paying their dues and the challenges they meet (Shirin's boss just assumes she knows Cantonese, Nina cannot get promoted by sheer force of will, and Silvia has to deal with daily microaggressions) are just part of  a career in books.

The common disdain in this secular age for impassioned religious emotion and language is merely symptomatic of the shift in values that has shunted revivals to the sidelines. The very magnitude of the previous revivals is one indication of their importance. Between 1740 and 1745 literally thousands were converted. From New England to the southern colonies, people of all ages and all ranks of society underwent the New Birth. Virtually every New England congregation was touched. It is safe to say that most of the colonists in the 1740s, if not converted themselves, knew someone who was, or at least heard revival preaching. The Awakening was a critical event in the intellectual and ecclesiastical life of the colonies. The colonists' view of the world placed much importance on conversion. Particularly, Calvinist theology viewed the bestowal of divine grace as the most crucial occurrence in human life. Besides assuring admission to God's presence in the hereafter, divine grace prepared a person for a fullness of life on earth. In the 1740s the colonists, in overwhelming numbers, laid claim to the divine power which their theology offered them. Many experienced the moral transformatoin as promised. In the Awakening the clergy's pleas of half a century came to dramatic fulfillment. Not everyone agreed that God was working in the Awakening. Many believed preachers to be demagogues, stirring up animal spirits. The revival was looked on as an emotional orgy that needlessly disturbed the churches and frustrated the true work of God. But from 1740 to 1745 no other subject received more attention in books and pamphlets. Through the stirring rhetoric of the sermons, theological treatises, and correspondence presented in this collection, readers can vicariously participate in the ecstasy as well as in the rage generated by America's first national revival.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7F_qCQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Methods of Logic","description":"Provides comprehensive coverage of logical structure as well as the techniques of formal reasoning","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=liHivlUYWcUC&dq=Methods+of+Logic&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Morningquest (Ulverscroft Large Print)","description":"A Pandora Crumbe a young artist, learns about life and love through her relationships with the fascinating Morningquest family and a Czech painter.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=hpjtOwAACAAJ&dq=Morningquest+(Ulverscroft+Large+Print)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Margin for error, none","description":"*THIS IS THE REPUBLISHED VERSION. THE ORIGINAL VERSION WAS PUBLISHED IN 1980. THIS VERSION DOES NOT CONTAIN NEW OR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. When was the last time you heard the name Air Traffic Controller? Most likely it was to berate him because his job action caused you to miss an important meeting. You may have been caught in a \\"by the book\\" slow down. Perhaps you spent an extra hour flying in endless circles awaiting clearance to land. There are far more to these delays than meets the eye. When negotiations between controller and government grind to a halt there is little that a controller can do. He is forbidden by law to strike. His only recourse is to slow the traffic. This they occasionally do in order to get better equipment, working conditions, and pay. This book, written by an active airline captain, will take you behind the scenes in the life of an air traffic controller. A person who guides the destiny of more people in one hour than an airline pilot does in a month, a person who controls all the departures and arrivals out of the three busiest airports in New York and does it with radar that isn't half as reliable as the radar used in a small country airport, a person who must think in three dimensions and be ready when their scope goes blank to remember name, position, heading and altitude of 18 aircrafts, a person who can never be allowed the luxury of a single mistake, a person who would rather control traffic than do anything else, in spite of the fears and anxieties that it entails. Hopefully after reading this book you will agree that all the glory and skill should not be confined to the cockpit, but shared equally by the men and women whose skill make a faulty system work. ********** \\"Captain Brian Power-Waters is intimately knowledgeable concerning the air traffic control system. As an airline captain, he brings the knowledge associated with his twenty-six years as a line pilot.

As they are our nearest relatives, there has been much research devoted to investigating the similarities and differences between them. This book offers an extensive review of the most recent observations to come from field studies on the diversity of Pan social behaviour, with contributions from many of the world's leading experts in this field. A wide range of social behaviours is discussed including tool use, hunting, reproductive strategies and conflict management as well as demographic variables and ecological constraints. In addition to interspecies behavioural diversity, this text describes exciting new research into variations between different populations of the same species. Researchers and students working in the fields of primatology, anthropology and zoology will find this a fascinating read.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-E7QdC6Q8cIC&dq=Behavioural+Diversity+in+Chimpanzees+and+Bonobos&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Powder","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=OjfEAQAACAAJ&dq=Powder&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Lonely Passion of Judith Hearne","description":"The Lonely Passion of Judith Hearne is an unflinching and deeply sympathetic portrait of a woman destroyed by self and circumstance.

Set in England and France during the darkest days of World War II, Charlotte Gray, like Birdsong, depicts a complex love affair that is both shaped and thwarted by war. It is 1942. London is blacked out, but France is under a greater darkness, as the occupying Nazi forces encroach ever closer in a tense waiting game. Charlotte Gray, a volatile but determined young woman, travels south from Edinburgh. Working in London, she has a brief but intense love affair with an RAF pilot. When his plane is lost over France, she contrives to go there herself to work in the Resistance and to search for him--but then is unwilling to leave as she finds that the struggle for the country's fate is intimately linked to her own battle to take control of her life. Faulks's novel is an examination of lost paradises, politics without belief, the limits of memory, the redemptive power of art and the existence of hope beyond reason. It is also a brilliant evocation of life in Occupied France and, more significantly, a revelation of the appalling price many Frenchmen paid to survive in unoccupied, so-called Free France. As the men, women and children of Charlotte's small town prepare to meet their terrible destiny, the truth of what took place in wartime France is finally exposed. When private lives and public events fatally collide, the roots of the characters' lives are torn up and exposed. These harrowing scenes are presented with the passion and narrative force that readers will recall from Birdsong. Charlotte Gray will attract even more readers to Faulks's remarkable fiction.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=un0sCQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Falun Gong in the United States: An Ethnographic Study","description":"Falun Gong, also known as Falun Dafa, has been described in many ways. It has been called qigong, one of many schools of physical exercises that aim at improving health and developing supernatural abilities. Scholars and mainstream media have referred it to as a spiritual movement or religion, although practitioners claim it is not a religion. It has been called a cult, in the pejorative sense rather than in a sociological context, by the Chinese government and by some Western critics. In the writings of Li Hongzhi, the founder of Falun Gong, it is referred to in different ways, though primarily as a cultivation practice. The question of how to define Falun Gong is not just an academic issue; the use of the cult label has been used to justify the persecution of practitioners in China. To a limited degree, the Chinese Government is able to extend the persecution overseas. How society defines Falun Gong has implications for action on the level of policy, as well as the shaping of social, cultural, and personal attitudes. This research project addresses what Falun Gong is through ethnography. Research methods included participant-observation, semi-structured ethnographic interviews (both in-person and on-line), and content analysis of text and visual data from Falun Gong books, pamphlets, and websites. Research sites included Tampa, Washington D.C., and cyberspace. In order to keep my research relevant to the issues and concerns of the Falun Gong community, I was in regular contact with the Tampa practitioners, keeping them abreast of my progress and asking for their input. My findings are contrary to the allegations made by the Chinese Government and Western anti-cultists in many ways. Practitioners are not encouraged to rely on Western medicine, but are not prohibited from using it. Child practitioners are not put at risk. Their organizational structure is very loose. Finally, the Internet has played a vital role in Falun Gong's growth and continuation after the crackdown.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-vyOdnwW7ukC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Good Fight: Declare Your Independence and Close the Democracy Gap","description":"A revealing look at how independent voters have been upending the political establishment for thirty years  and how they'll decide the future of American politics. In a political system where two parties reign supreme, 40% of Americans consider themselves neither Democrats nor Republicans, but independents. Independents elected President Barack Obama in 2008 and then, in a seeming reversal, gave control of Congress to the Republicans in 2010. But who are these independents? Angry moderates? Frustrated ideologues? The base for the third party? Reformers or revolutionaries? Jacqueline Salit has spent 30 years as an insider in this growing movement of outsiders. She recounts the little-known history of this volatile force as old political institutions and categories are becoming irrelevant  even repugnant  to many Americans. An architect of unorthodox left/right coalitions within the Perot movement and Reform Party, and manager of Michael Bloomberg's three New York mayoral campaigns on the Independence Party line, Salit explores how these unclaimed voters are not only deciding elections, but reshaping the political landscape. With a surprising cast of characters  from the famous to the unknown  Salit argues that the failure to heed this movement against partisanship (and even parties) puts political careers at risk and damages essential features of American democracy. She reveals how independents underestimate their own power and how they can make the most of their newfound moment in the sun.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=azCtpb6w0-8C&dq=The+Good+Fight:+Declare+Your+Independence+and+Close+the+Democracy+Gap&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Battletech Technical Blueprints: Marauder, BattleMaster, Wasp, WarHammer, Locust (five 22\\" x 34\\" rolled blueprints on heavy poster stock) Stock #1615","description":"With his friends and family dead and his father's regiment destroyed, Grayson Death Carlyle, a MechWarrior, must learn to fight for justice in a world turned hostile.

Untersuchungen zum Neuen Testament)","description":"Kimberly B. Stratton investigates the cultural and ideological motivations behind early imaginings of the magician, the sorceress, and the witch in the ancient world. Accusations of magic could carry the death penalty or, at the very least, marginalize the person or group they targeted. But Stratton moves beyond the popular view of these accusations as mere slander. In her view, representations and accusations of sorcery mirror the complex struggle of ancient societies to define authority, legitimacy, and Otherness. Stratton argues that the concept \\"magic\\" first emerged as a discourse in ancient Athens where it operated part and parcel of the struggle to define Greek identity in opposition to the uncivilized \\"barbarian\\" following the Persian Wars. The idea of magic then spread throughout the Hellenized world and Rome, reflecting and adapting to political forces, values, and social concerns in each society. Stratton considers the portrayal of witches and magicians in the literature of four related periods and cultures: classical Athens, early imperial Rome, pre-Constantine Christianity, and rabbinic Judaism. She compares patterns in their representations of magic and analyzes the relationship between these stereotypes and the social factors that shaped them. Stratton's comparative approach illuminates the degree to which magic was (and still is) a cultural construct that depended upon and reflected particular social contexts. Unlike most previous studies of magic, which treated the classical world separately from antique Judaism, Naming the Witch highlights the degree to which these ancient cultures shared ideas about power and legitimate authority, even while constructing and deploying those ideas in different ways. The book also interrogates the common association of women with magic, denaturalizing the gendered stereotype in the process. Drawing on Michel Foucault's notion of discourse as well as the work of other contemporary theorists, such as Homi K. Bhabha and Bruce Lincoln, Stratton's bewitching study presents a more nuanced, ideologically sensitive approach to understanding the witch in Western history.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=mfC_9hK0GvMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Extreme Programming Applied: Playing to Win","description":"Extreme Programming (XP) is a significant departure from traditional software development methods, one that is ushering in a change for both developers and business people.

That may have been true in the past, but there are opportunities that can substantially reduce your tax burden, and, in some cases, relieve you of it entirely. Several countries and jurisdictions throughout the world offer impressive incentives and plans through which you can greatly minimize your tax burden. Some have passed legislation that supports a business friendly environment providing a host of tax advantages, a minimization of red tape, and a variety of grants and special plans that are designed to increase a company?s edge in an increasingly competitive economic climate. Other places offer various tax incentives to individuals. Indeed, there are places where you can live virtually tax-free. In the following pages, the most advantageous of these countries and jurisdictions will be examined. These are by no means backwater enclaves or small municipalities; they are highly desirable places to live, work, and invest. Some prefer to remain reticent about the financial benefits they offer, while others openly promote their tax and investment plans and incentives. If you genuinely desire to reduce your tax burden, all deserve careful consideration. You might be wondering why a place would offer tax benefits to both its citizens and foreigners. By offering major tax incentives to investors, tax haven countries and jurisdictions increase the amount of money that flows into the tax haven. This money can then be used to stimulate the tax haven?s economy. The underlying principal here is that low taxes result in economic growth. To take full advantage of some of these opportunities, you may need to satisfy residency requirements. Some countries require that you remain in the country for a particular length of time to benefit from tax incentives; others have few or negligible conditions that you must meet. In some, to fully take advantage of their tax laws, you must become a citizen. This is often not as daunting as it sounds, because in most cases, you will be able to carry dual citizenship. Thus, if you are a citizen of the United States, you may also become a citizen of another nation. Of course, this can become tricky under some circumstances, and you should always research your situation carefully, assessing your plans and goals in the light of each country?s laws. For some people, it is quite beneficial to change their citizenship if it results in major tax savings.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=JT6xVRdYP18C&dq=Where+to+Legally+Invest,+Live&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Navigation Rules","description":"33 CFR 83.01(g) requires: \\" The operator of each self-propelled vessel 12 meters or more in length shall carry, on board and maintain for ready reference, a copy of these Rules.\\" Navigation Rules & Regulations HandbookSupersedes Commandant Instruction M16672.2D The Official USCG Navigation Rules book is now called, Navigation Rules & Regulations Handbook.

A common explanation for all of the discussed phenomena is proposed: If and only if the features for  person  are distinctively marked by the agreement morphology, the agreement affixes are listed separately in the lexicon and project phrases of their own in syntax where they attract the verb to the head positions and allow the specifier positions to be filled by various phonologically (un)realized elements.

What do you do, exactly? I have no idea.   I reify,  he answered.  It's a serious job,  I added.  Yes, it is,  he said.  I see,  Carol observed with admiration.  Serious work, with big books and a big table cluttered with papers.   No,  said Gilles.  I walk. Mostly I walk.  from All the King's Horses Mich le Bernstein's novel, All the King's Horses (1960), is one of the odder and more elusive, entertaining, and revealing documents of the Situationist International. At the instigation of her first husband, Guy Debord, Bernstein agreed to write a potboiler to help swell the Situationist International's coffers. When she objected to the idea of practicing a  dead art,  Debord suggested that it would be instead be d tournement the Situationist reuse of media toward different, subversive, ends. Inspired by the pseudo-scandalous success of Roger Vadim's filmed version of Choderlos de Laclos's Les Liaisons dangereuses and the adolescent Fran?oise Sagan's bestselling novel Bonjour tristesse, Bernstein lampooned and borrowed from both Sagan and de Laclos, concocting a roman   clef that succeeded on several levels. A moneymaker for the most radical front of the French avant-garde, the novel (by its very success) demonstrated the bankruptcy of contemporary French letters and the Situationist contempt for the psychological novel, while (perhaps unintentionally) holding up a playful mirror to the private lives of two of the Situationist International's most important members.All the King's Horses is a slippery rewrite of Dangerous Liaisons with Debord playing the role of cold libertine, Bernstein as his cohort, and disguised walk-on roles by the likes of the painter Asger Jorn and others. Though Greil Marcus sparked interest in this novel in his 1989 book Lipstick Traces, All the King's Horses remained unavailable until its 2004 republication in France.

In March of 1848, Kate and Maggie Fox  sisters aged 11 and 14  anxiously reported to a neighbor that they had been hearing strange, unidentified sounds in their house. From a sequence of knocks and rattles translated by the young girls as a \\"voice from beyond,\\" the Modern Spiritualism movement was born. Talking to the Dead follows the fascinating story of the two girls who were catapulted into an odd limelight after communicating with spirits that March night. Within a few years, tens of thousands of Americans were flocking to seances. An international movement followed. Yet thirty years after those first knocks, the sisters shocked the country by denying they had ever contacted spirits. Shortly after, the sisters once again changed their story and reaffirmed their belief in the spirit world. Weisberg traces not only the lives of the Fox sisters and their family (including their mysterious Svengalilike sister Leah) but also the social, religious, economic and political climates that provided the breeding ground for the movement. While this is a thorough, compelling overview of a potent time in US history, it is also an incredible ghost story. An entertaining read  a story of spirits and conjurors, skeptics and converts  Talking to the Dead is full of emotion and surprise. Yet it will also provoke questions that were being asked in the 19th century, and are still being asked today  how do we know what we know, and how secure are we in our knowledge?","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=IlH7jgEACAAJ&dq=Talking+to+the+Dead:+Kate+and+Maggie+Fox+and+the+Rise+of+Spiritualism&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hot Issues: Jesus Confronts Today's Controversies","description":"The Reality Check series makes just one assumption: that you re serious enough about your spiritual journey to investigate Christianity with an open mind.

How have its therapeutic properties been conceptualized and explained? Which cultures have used music therapy? What were their aims and techniques, and how much continuity is there between ancient, medieval and modern practice? These are the questions addressed by the essays in this volume. They focus on the place of music therapy in European intellectual, medical and musical traditions, from their classical roots to the development of the music therapy profession since the Second World War. Chapters covering the Judaic, Islamic, Indian and South-East Asian traditions add global, comparative perspectives. Music as Medicine is the first book to establish the whole shape of the history of music therapy in a systematic and scholarly way. It addresses the problem of defining what music therapy has meant in different cultures and periods, and sets the agenda for future research in the subject. It will appeal to a diverse readership of historians, musicologists, anthropologists, and practitioners.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=CS8rDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Women and Writing","description":"\\"Throughout her life, Virginia Woolf wrote extensively and persuasively about the lack of professional and educational opportunities for women.

Only the rescue turns into an abduction, and Rhapsody soon finds herself dragged along on an epic voyage, one that spans centuries and ranges across a wonder-filled fantasy world-- a world so real you can hear the sweet music of Rhapsody's aubade and smell the smoldering forges deep within the Cauldron.

Boasting a fascinating heritage of architectural, cultural, and political activity and diversity, the Dupont Circle neighborhood has played a part in the great story of the capital city and has witnessed many of the people and events that have challenged our national community. Following the area's use as a Civil War encampment, Dupont Circle slowly began to develop a more urban character. At the neighborhood's social zenith in the early 1900s, gracious mansions surrounding the circle hosted lavish parties attended by diplomats, presidents, and wealthy socialites. The photographs in this informative visual history capture the elegant homes that were later replaced by office buildings and the fashionable era that was soon to fade. Rare World War II images of former mansions used as rooming houses bring readers into the 20th century, along with the early 1960s photographs of gay activists who gathered at the circle and began the modern restoration of the neighborhood.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=OS8YA3M01Q0C&dq=Dupont+Circle:+A+Novel&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Studies in Ephesians, Bible Studies Related to the Church His Body","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=YHzSGwAACAAJ&dq=Studies+in+Ephesians,+Bible+Studies+Related+to+the+Church+His+Body&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Jake & Mimi","description":"Jake is a Zen master and expert bicycle repairman who fixes flats and teaches meditation out of a shop in Bar Harbor, Maine.

Ferreyra discusses the most devastating effects correlated to drug trafficking such as high murder rates, gruesome violence, disappearances, and mass graves to emphasize how Mexican society bears the brunt of this phenomenon while the United States insists on the futility of drug prohibition. Unlike other publications, this book provides an interdisciplinary social science approach where drug trafficking is conceptualized as a multifaceted social, political, economic, and cultural problem, rather than just a criminal justice issue. Drug Trafficking in Mexico and the United States also revisits the war on drugs and provides an argument how drug control is the primary force behind drug trafficking. In that respect, there is an analysis on how the DEA has reinforced the war on drugs model and why it became a reactionary agency that opposes any comprehensive alternative to the American drug problem besides drug control. The author concludes with recommendations to implement forward-thinking measures such as decriminalization, reclassification, and legalization of drugs to effectively address the illicit drug trade.--Guadalupe Correa-Cabrera, Associate Professor, Schar School of Policy and Government, George Mason University","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=CWvsDwAAQBAJ&dq=El+Amante+De+Janis+Joplin+/+The+Lover+of+Janis+Joplin+(Spanish+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Toward the Decolonization of African Literature, Vol. 1: African Fiction and Poetry and Their Critics","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=yIkHAQAAIAAJ&dq=Toward+the+Decolonization+of+African+Literature,+Vol.+1:+African+Fiction+and+Poetry+and+Their+Critics&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Creative Expressive Activities and Asperger's Syndrome: Social and Emotional Skills and Positive Life Goals for Adolescents and Young Adults","description":"Martinovich combines activities such as art making, drama, music, puppetry, yoga and photography with conventional cognitive behavioural interventions to support individuals with AS.

Born to an aristocratic family on an estate outside of Dublin, Alexander Moore feels the constraints of his position most acutely in his friendship with Jerry Crowe, a Catholic laborer in town. Jerry is one of the few bright spots in Alec s otherwise troubled life. The boys bond over their love of swimming and horses, despite the admonitions of Alec s cold and overbearing mother, who scolds her son for venturing outside of his class. When the Great War begins, he seizes the opportunity to escape his overbearing mother and taciturn father, and enlists in the British army. Jerry, too, enlists not out of loyalty to Britain, but to prepare himself for the Republican cause. Stationed in Flanders, the young men are reunited and find that, while encamped in the trenches, their commonalities are what help them survive. Now a lieutenant and an officer, Alec and Jerry again find their friendship under assault, this time from the rigid Major Glendinning, whose unyielding adherence to rank leads the two men toward a harrowing impasse that will change their lives forever.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=CNK1AwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fire Along the Sky","description":"In 1812, Elizabeth and Nathaniel Bonner mark the return of Nathaniel's daughter Hannah, while her half-brother Daniel joins the militia and his twin, Lily, falls in love with a dark and dangerous stranger, in a continuation of the saga of the Bonner family in early America.

Nobody knows Texas's history, people, beauty, and dangers as well as this greatest of Western writers. Barbed Wire, the first novel in this omnibus, is the story of one-time cowboy Doug Monahan, who runs a fencing crew outside the town of Twin Wells. Monahan, a likeable, hard-working Irishman, and his workers dig post-holes and string red painted barb wire for ranchers as protection against wandering stock, rustlers, and land hungry cattle barons. Their fencing operation is opposed by Captain Andrew Rinehart, a former Confederate officer and an old-school open range cowman of the huge R Cross spread. With his brutal foreman, Archer Spann who does the violent work of chasing squatters off the range Rinehart wages a barb wire war against Doug Monahan. A second colorful tale of the brush country is Llano River. Dundee, a onetime cowboy, one of Monahan's fencing crew in Barbed Wire, wanders into the town of Titusville, broke, tired, and itching for a fight. Town patriarch John Titus hires Dundee to find out who is rustling his cattle, but he already has a culprit in mind Blue Roan Hardesty. Once a friend, now a sworn enemy of the powerful Titus clan, Hardesty is Titus's choice for villain but Dundee is determined to find out the truth, even if it costs him his job.

Highlighting the close relationship between linguistic explanation and learnability, Bruce Tesar and Paul Smolensky examine the implications of Optimality Theory (OT) for language learnability. They show how the core principles of OT lead to the learning principle of constraint demotion, the basis for a family of algorithms that infer constraint rankings from linguistic forms. Of primary concern to the authors are the ambiguity of the data received by the learner and the resulting interdependence of the core grammar and the structural analysis of overt linguistic forms. The authors argue that iterative approaches to interdependencies, inspired by work in statistical learning theory, can be successfully adapted to address the interdependencies of language learning. Both OT and Constraint Demotion play critical roles in their adaptation. The authors support their findings both formally and through simulations. They also illustrate how their approach could be extended to other language learning issues, including subset relations and the learning of phonological underlying forms.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=e-GP7AGYoFEC&dq=Learnability+in+Optimality+Theory&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Horrible Harry's Secret","description":"Harry's in love, and his best friend, Doug, is disgusted -- Harry won't even throw snowballs at girls anymore.

Its introduction of a feminist perspective into this largely male-oriented discipline made shockwaves that are still felt forcefully today. Drawing upon rich resources of feminist cultural analysis hitherto little applied to the visual arts, Griselda Pollock offers concrete historical analyses of key moments in the formation of modern culture to reveal the sexual politics at the heart of modernist art. Crucially, she not only provides a feminist re-reading of the work of canonical male Impressionist and Pre-Raphaelite artists including Edgar Degas and Dante Gabriel Rossetti, but also re-inserts into art history their female contemporaries - women artists such as Berthe Morisot and Mary Cassatt. Casting her critical eye over the contemporary art scene, Pollock discusses the work of women artists such as Mary Kelly and Yve Lomax, highlighting the problems of working in a culture where the feminine is still defined as the object of the male gaze. Now published with a new introduction by Griselda Pollock, Vision and Difference remains as powerful and as essential reading as ever for all those seeking not only to understand the history of the feminine in art but also to develop new strategies for representation for the future.\\" -- Back cover.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=XXSIo0jGC88C&dq=Vision+and+Difference:+Femininity,+Feminism+and+Histories+of+Art+(Routledge+Classics)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Myth and Meaning, Myth and Order","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=iDnN1ObXhy4C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Great Dane: Model of Nobility (Howell's Best of Breed Library)","description":"This all-new book about the popular canine giant is the first in-depth work on the breed for Howell Book House since 1981.

Back then daily life was dramatic enough that storytellers didn't have to exaggerate, but tales have a way of growing taller in a place where you have to be larger than life just to survive. In retelling these classic tales handed down by a master storyteller, Dick Hammond explores the shadowy territory between truth and myth: the handlogger who rows up to a dock in Egmont on evening with part of his leg - still in its boot - lying next to him on the stern seat; the deer tracks that mysteriously disappear in the middle of a snow-covered field; the mountain-shrouded homestead where a beautiful woman with eyes lika a cougar speaks of friends and family who may or may not be alive, or even real, all of whose voices can be heard in the Talking Falls. . . or can they? Dense with coastal lore, these captivating tales bear witness to a pioneer culture that mastered the art of wilderness survival, then faded away, leaving only ghosts and stories.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=mwJbAAAACAAJ&dq=Haunted+Waters:+Tales+of+the+Old+Coast&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Clifford And The Grouchy Neighbors Book & Cassette","description":"For use in schools and libraries only.

As leadership coaches, they have observed that once someone knows what their passions and values are, everything else falls into place. As a result, they developed an approach called 4-Dimensional Thinking, which they have been using for the past twenty-five years with life-changing results. Each dimension offers a series of thought-provoking questions to help guide the reader to their own conclusions. By the end of the process the reader will experience a dramatic transformation: their life will be renewed and their relationships at home and work will be vastly improved. The First Dimension asks: \\"Who are you and what do you want?\\" Your answer can take you to the core of your personal strengths, passions and aspirations. You will see through any imagination gridlock that keeps you from going after your authentic goals. The Second Dimension asks: \\"Where are you and why are you there?\\" You can create your own life map once you understand how you have arrived where you are right now. You will review your past choices, identify any faulty assumptions that have gone undetected and clarify positive approaches that are worth repeating. The Third Dimension asks: \\"What will you do and how will you do it?\\" It's great to dream, but whenever dreams collide with reality, reality always wins. This dimension offers you practical advice on goal-setting to ensure a more successful journey. The Fourth Dimension asks: \\"Who are your allies and how can they help?\\" The relationships with family, loved ones, friends and co-workers arekey in accomplishing your life goals. No one does anything leading to lasting satisfaction by him or herself.

From the marvel of seeing inside cloudy liquids as a result of his own cutting-edge research to reproducing and examining an unusual diffraction pattern first witnessed by Isaac Newton 300 years ago, he has studied aspects of light that have inspired and puzzled humans for hundreds of years. In this book, he draws on his many experiences as an optical and atomic physicist--and on his consummate skills as a teacher and writer about the mysteries of physics--to present a remarkable tour of the world of light. He explores theoretical, experimental, and historical themes, showing a keen eye for curious and neglected corners of the study of light and a fascination with the human side of scientific discovery. In the course of the book, he covers such questions as how it is possible to achieve magnifications of a millionfold without a single lens or mirror. He asks what all living things have in common that might one day allow the development of a \\"life-form scanner\\" like the one in Star Trek. He considers whether more light can reflect from a surface than strikes it, and explores the origin of the strange hyperpolic diffraction pattern Newton originally produced with sunlight and knives. Silverman also discusses his new and ground-breaking experiments to see into murky substances such as fog or blood--a finding with potential applications as diverse as noninvasive medical testing and remote sensing of the environment. His wide-ranging reflections cover virtually all elements of physical optics, including propagation, reflection, refraction, diffraction, interference, polarization, and scattering. Throughout, Silverman makes extensive reference to both modern research and the original works of giants such as Newton, Fresnel, and Maxwell. In a more personal section about physics and learning, Silverman argues for self-directed learning and discusses the central importance of stimulating scientific curiosity in students. Waves and Grains will encourage a spirit of wonder and inquiry in anyone with scientific interests.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=6_1ZDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"MusicHound World: The Essential Album Guide.","description":"Provides short biographies of artists from around the world, including Selena, Bob Marley, and Ravi Shankar, and includes reviews of thousands of compact discs.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BOsTPwAACAAJ&dq=MusicHound+World:+The+Essential+Album+Guide.&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Summer of Deliverance: A Memoir of Father and Son","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The WITCHES Of WORM.","description":"Cats.

Based on precise measured drawings done at the sites of the ancient ruins between 1751 and 1754, these books set a new standard for archaeological investigation in the eighteenth century. In doing so, they also transformed our understanding of Greek architecture and by pointing up differences between Greek and Roman examples fundamentally challenged prevailing notions about a universal classical ideal and fueled the Greek Revival movement that dominated British, European, and American architecture and design for over a century. Originally published in four volumes that appeared between 1762 and 1816, Stuart and Revett's masterwork is presented here in its entirety as part of our Classic Reprint series and features a new introduction by scholar Frank Salmon. With its many images of buildings, plans, sculpture, friezes, and decorative objects such as vases, it remains the logical starting point for anyone interested in Athens, Greece, and its influence on the history of Western architecture.

E. Van vogt and Roger Zelazny, with perhaps a bit of Cordwainer Smith enriching the style. It is an astounding story of super science, a thrilling wonder story that recaptures the excitements of SF's golden age writers. The Golden Age takes place 10,000 years in the future in our solar system, an interplanetary utopian society filled with immortal humans. Within the frame of a traditional tale-the one rebel who is unhappy in utopia-Wright spins an elaborate plot web filled with suspense and passion. Phaethon, of Radamanthus House, is attending a glorious party at his family mansion to celebrate the thousand-year anniversary of the High Transcendence. There he meets first an old man who accuses him of being an impostor and then a being from Neptune who claims to be an old friend. The Neptunian tells him that essential parts of his memory were removed and stored by the very government that Phaethon believes to be wholly honorable. It shakes his faith. He is an exile from himself. And so Phaethon embarks upon a quest across the transformed solar system--Jupiter is now a second sun, Mars and Venus terraformed, humanity immortal--among humans, intelligent machines, and bizarre life forms that are partly both, to recover his memory, and to learn what crime he planned that warranted such preemptive punishment. His quest is to regain his true identity. The Golden Age is one of the major, ambitious SF novels of the year and the international launch of an important new writer in the genre.

Essentially, all information reaching the cerebral cortex and thus consciousness is relayed through the thalamus.

This book provides an in-depth look at the function of the thalamus and its role as relayer of information to the cerebral cortex. The authors explore how the thalamus controls messages that are passed to the cortex and they introduce the novel suggestion that the thalamus serves a critical role in controlling how messages pass from one part of the cortex to another. Exploring the Thalamus is a comprehensive, up-to-date reference for researchers.

But in One Nation Under God, historian Kevin M. Kruse reveals that the belief that America is fundamentally and formally Christian originated in the 1930s. To fight the \\"slavery\\" of FDR's New Deal, businessmen enlisted religious activists in a campaign for \\"freedom under God\\" that culminated in the election of their ally Dwight Eisenhower in 1952. The new president revolutionized the role of religion in American politics. He inaugurated new traditions like the National Prayer Breakfast, as Congress added the phrase \\"under God\\" to the Pledge of Allegiance and made \\"In God We Trust\\" the country's first official motto. Church membership soon soared to an all-time high of 69 percent. Americans across the religious and political spectrum agreed that their country was \\"one nation under God.\\" Provocative and authoritative, One Nation Under God reveals how an unholy alliance of money, religion, and politics created a false origin story that continues to define and divide American politics to this day.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=jwGCBgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Behind Bars: Surviving Prison","description":"A judge hands down a stretch in a local, state, or federal prison.

In this operational history of a period that proved to be a turning point for one of the world's great naval powers, David Syrett presents a saga of battles, blockades, great fleet cruises, and, above all, failures and lost opportunities. He explains that the British government severely underestimated the Americans' maritime strength and how that error led to devastating consequences. The seemingly invincible navy failed to muster even one decisive victory during the extensive naval conflict. Noting the complex reasons for British failure in European waters, Syrett lays primary blame at the feet of Britain's political leadership. He describes how Lord North, the first lord of the Treasury and head of government, abdicated control of Britain's military to individual members of the cabinet. Syrett suggests that constant vacillations in policy and strategy, which resulted from power shifts among the cabinet ministers, prevented North's government from formulating a comprehensive wartime strategy or providing the Royal Navy with the strategic guidance to launch a successful campaign. Syrett concludes that Britain's inability to gain naval superiority in European waters had a profound effect on the outcome of the American Revolutionary War. He demonstrates how the Royal Navy's failure to hunt down and destroy American blockade runners allowed Yankee rebels easy access to European arms and munitions. He also shows that the inability of the British to defeat French and Spanish naval power off the Continent gave Bourbon monarchies the means to aid American naval forces and to conduct naval operations against the British in such areas as the West Indies and the Indian Ocean.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=eEfsS5QKeFQC&dq=The+Royal+Navy+in+European+Waters+during+the+American+Revolutionary+War+(Studies+in+Maritime+History)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Encouraging Your Child's Spiritual Intelligence","description":"More and more children are expressing spiritual qualities, and parents, caregivers, pediatricians, teachers, and therapists are increasingly taking notice of children's spiritual lives.

Volpone, which was first performed in 1606, dramatizes the corrupting nature of greed in an exuberant satire set in contemporary Venice. The first production of Epicene marked the end of a year long closure of the theatres because of an epidemic of the plague in 1609; its comedy affirms the consolatory power of laughter at such a time. The Alchemist (1610) deploys the metaphors of alchemical transformation to emphasize the mutability of the characters and their relationships. In Bartholomew Fair (1614) Jonson embroils the visitors to the fair in its myriad tempations, exposing the materialistic impulses beneath the apparent godliness of Jacobean Puritans. Under the General Editorship of Michael Cordner of the University of York the texts of the plays have been newly edited and are presented with modernized spelling and punctuation.

It is also a definitive portrait of the atmosphere in which psychoanalytic creativity has emerged and flourished. Going beyond mere biographical description, the contributors elucidate the contributions of various psychoanalysts to the evolution of psychoanalytic thought, and evaluate their roles in the development of psychoanalysis as a science, as a method of investigation, as a treatment technique, and as an organization. The editors have assembled profiles of Karl Abraham, Sandor Ferenczi, Otto Rank, Carl Jung, Alfred Adler, Ernest Jones, Paul Federn, Oskar Pfister, Harms Sachs, A.A. Brill, Sandor Rado, Theodor Reik, Melanie Klein, Otto Fenichel, Karen Horney, Heinz Hartmann, Ernst Kris, and twenty-four other pioneers, whose influence on psychoanalysis reverberates to this day. In a new introduction, Eisenstein maintains that while man and his unconscious have not changed much since Freud's time, today psychoanalysis is full of many different clinical and theoretical viewpoints. Among the ideas being debated are object theory, drive theory, the oedipal concept, intersubjectivity, and self-psychology. Eisenstein also discusses the contributions of psychohistory, a recent and significant development in psychoanalysis in which psychological study is applied to historical periods and personalities. \\"Psychoanalytic Pioneers \\"will be an important addition to the libraries of psychoanalysts, psychologists, psychiatrists, sociologists, historians, and anyone interested in the influence of psychoanalysis in our lives.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Fro5MZry5FcC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Apologetics and Catholic Doctrine","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=OmtrAQAACAAJ&dq=Apologetics+and+Catholic+Doctrine&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Wasted: The Story of My Son's Drug Addiction","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2IwxAQAAIAAJ&dq=Wasted:+The+Story+of+My+Son%27s+Drug+Addiction&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Brothers Neville","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=JJ16AQAACAAJ&dq=The+Brothers+Neville&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Brandywine: A Legacy of Tradition in Du Pont-Wyeth Country","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=MxpvAAAAMAAJ&dq=Brandywine:+A+Legacy+of+Tradition+in+Du+Pont-Wyeth+Country&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Transitions : Making Sense of Life's Changes","description":"The best-selling guide for coping with changes in life and work, named one of the 50 all-time best books in self-help and personal development Whether you choose it or it is thrust upon you, change brings both opportunities and turmoil.

Building on Jungian theory, Jerome Bernstein argues that a greater openness to transrational reality experienced by Borderland personalities allows new possibilities for understanding and healing confounding clinical and developmental enigmas. There are many people whose experiences of reality is outside the mainstream of Western culture; often they see themselves as abnormal because they have no articulated frame of reference for their experience. The concept of the Borderland personality explains much of their experience. In three sections, this book examines the psychological and clinical implications of the evolution of consciousness and looks at how the new Borderland consciousness bridges the mind-body divide. Subjects covered include:   Genesis: Evolution of the Western Ego   Transrational Data in a Western Clinical Context: Synchronicity   Trauma and Borderland Transcendence   Environmental Illness Complex   Integration of Navajo and Western healing approaches for Borderland Personalities. Living in the Borderland challenges the standard clinical model, which views normality as an absence of pathology and which equates normality with the rational. Jerome S. Bernstein describes how psychotherapy itself often contributes to the alienation of Borderland personalities by misperceiving the difference between the pathological and the sacred. The case studies included illustrate the potential this has for causing serious psychic and emotional damage to the patient. This challenge to the orthodoxies and complacencies of Western medicine s concept of pathology will interest Jungian Analysts, Psychotherapists, Psychiatrists and other physicians, as well as educators of children. Jerome S. Bernstein is a Jungian Analyst in private practice in Santa Fe, New Mexico","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=r_SOAgAAQBAJ&dq=Living+in+the+Borderland:The+Evolution+of+Consciousness+and+the+Challenge+of+Healing+Trauma&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Macrocyclic Compounds in Analytical Chemistry","description":"Discusses the analytical applications of the rapidly growing field of macrocyclic chemistry in a comprehensive, full-length manner.

In the 1980s, a strange emerging epidemic baffled doctors in Incline Village, Nevada. Dismissed by the media as  The Yuppie Flu,  Chronic Fatigue Immune Dysfunction Syndrome (CFIDS) turned out to be neither a faddish disease of the wealthy nor a passing trend, but rather a growing worldwide epidemic of devastating proportions. In the voices of a South African journalist, a former marathon runner, a teenage girl, a public health activist living on the edge of race and gender, a cancer patient neglected by doctors because of disdain for her chronic illness, and a theologian relearning the art of spiritual empathy, the people who share their stories in Stricken: Voices from the Hidden Epidemic of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome defy cultural stereotypes and explore the complex social and political dynamics of this hidden epidemic. Through their distinct points of view, we feel the grief and hope of those stricken with CFIDS and learn of the complex nature of this misunderstood disorder. These are compelling stories about a quiet and baffling epidemic. The first American anthology to contain stories from a diverse range of people with CFIDS, Stricken offers an intimate look at the political and social issues surrounding CFIDS, as told by those who are living through this ordeal. Stricken addresses several issues, such as: why some doctors still do not believe CFIDS is real how the disease is mocked in the media myths about this illness the personal fight for medical or public recognition the skepticism and hope that is felt by the ever-growing number of CFIDS sufferers Stricken confronts fascinating CFIDS issues such as the Kevorkian suicides, accusations of Munchausen Syndrome By Proxy, Gulf War Syndrome, the role of storytelling in a memory-impaired patient movement, and the feasibility of mass activism in a disabled population.

Based on conversations over a seven-year period (19871994), between Wang Fucheng and Peter Seybolt the book unfolds as a continuous first-person narrative, framed by the author's overview and chapter introductions.Born in 1923, Wang Fucheng rose under the Communists from extreme poverty to a position of power and prestige in his village. His account provides a fascinating illustration of the process of social mobility during the Maoist era, the interaction between central and local leaders, and the way central policies were adapted at the village level. The book's compelling and evocative picture of life in rural China will appeal to scholars, students, and general readers alike.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Gg29tAEACAAJ&dq=Throwing+The+Emperor+From+His+Horse:+Portrait+Of+A+Village+Leader+In+China,+1923-1995&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"English synonyms and antonyms, (Standard educational series)","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=jGoPAAAAYAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Entrepreneurship","description":"Explains how to develop a concept, draft a business plan, research the market, design products, develop a marketing and distribution system, manage growth, and locate financing and legal advice.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ZF1EAAAAYAAJ&dq=Entrepreneurship&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"LECTURES ON DIVINE HUMANITY","description":"These lectures, given by Solovyov in St. Petersburg in 1878, mark a seminal moment not only in Russian but also in world philosophy. Dostoyevsky, Tolstoy, and other luminaries were in the audience. It was recognized by everyone that something astonishing had occurred.The young philosopher, mystic, and visionary, Solovyov, had given unexpectedly concise, intellectual expression to the reality of the evolution of consciousness and religion. He had spoken movingly of the actualization of Divine Humanity in eternity and time, of the divine world and the fall of spiritual beings into sin, of the origin and meaning of the natural world, and the incarnation of Christ, leading to the redemption of the visible and invisible worlds in the full revelation of Divine Humanity. Sophia, whom Solovyov experienced three times in his life, inspires this great work. He conceives Sophia in a variety of ways: as the eternal ideal prototype of humanity, as the world soul actively engaged in actualizing this idea, and as the fully developed divine-human being. This Sophia is both the active principle in the process of creation and its realized goal: the kingdom of God.

He was the first to use the term \\"Renaissance\\" (rinascita) in print, though an awareness of the ongoing \\"rebirth\\" in the arts had been in the air since the time of Alberti, and he was responsible for our use of the term Gothic Art, though he only used the word Goth which he associated with the \\"barbaric\\" German style. The Lives also included a novel treatise on the technical methods employed in the arts. The book was partly rewritten and enlarged in 1568, with the addition of woodcut portraits of artists (some conjectural). The work has a consistent and notorious bias in favour of Florentines, and tends to attribute to them all the developments in Renaissance art   for example, the invention of engraving. Venetian art in particular (along with arts from other parts of Europe), is systematically ignored in the first edition. Between the first and second editions, Vasari visited Venice and while the second edition gave more attention to Venetian art (finally including Titian) it did so without achieving a neutral point of view. Vasari's biographies are interspersed with amusing gossip. Many of his anecdotes have the ring of truth, while others are inventions or generic fictions, such as the tale of young Giotto painting a fly on the surface of a painting by Cimabue that the older master repeatedly tried to brush away, a genre tale that echoes anecdotes told of the Greek painter Apelles. With a few exceptions, however, Vasari's aesthetic judgement was acute and unbiased. He did not research archives for exact dates, as modern art historians do, and naturally his biographies are most dependable for the painters of his own generation and those of the immediate past. Modern criticism  with new materials opened up by research  has corrected many of his traditional dates and attributions. Vasari includes a sketch of his own biography at the end of the Lives, and adds further details about himself and his family in his lives of Lazzaro Vasari and Francesco Salviati. According to the historian Richard Goldthwaite, Vasari was one of the earliest authors to use the term \\"competition\\" (or \\"concorrenza\\" in Italian) in its economic sense. He used it repeatedly, and stressed the concept in his introduction to the life of Pietro Perugino, in explaining the reasons for Florentine artistic preeminence. In Vasari's view, Florentine artists excelled because they were hungry, and they were hungry because their fierce competition amongst themselves for commissions kept them so. Competition, he said, is \\"one of the nourishments that maintain them.\\"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Pk8gCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Optical Fiber Communications (2nd Edition)","description":"Offering many worked examples and end of chapter problems, this new edition is a comprehensive introduction to optical fiber communications and single mode fiber properties and types.

In some respects, there is no other way to understand it, or at least to avoid seriously misunderstanding it. Every other approach tends to be static, one-sided or unbalanced.\\"\\" \\"Draper correctly notes that the formative period of the American Communist movement has remained a largely untold and even unknown story. In part, the reasons for this are that the Communist movement, although a child of the West, grew to power in the Soviet East. But Draper rescues this chapter with deep appreciation for the fact that communism was not something that happened just in Russia, but also in the United States.

Ritvo md is an internationally recognized medical expert, researcher and pioneer in the field of autism and Asperger's disorder and co-author of the official diagnostic criteria in the DSM (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders). Much of what is known about these disorders today is based on his painstaking research and groundbreaking discoveries. In this book he shares his forty years' experience and opens his extensive UCLA casebook to the reader. Understanding the Nature of Autism and Asperger's Disorder is 'a consultation with Prof. Ritvo' - a thoroughly accessible introduction for professionals, families, spouses and individuals with autism and Asperger's Disorder. Prof. Ritvo traces the historical development of understanding about autism and Asperger's Disorder, from the centuries of misdiagnoses and the first recognition of the characteristics of the disorders to his own highly-regarded methods for making a diagnosis. Drawing on case histories from forty years' of clinical practice, he explains their basic nature, what the causes are, what is different in the brain, treatments that work (and those that don't), what a child with a diagnosis might be like when he or she grows up, and what future research may hold. This book will be an absolute must-read for anyone with an interest in autism and Asperger's Disorder, whether a practitioner, a parent, a student, or an affected individual.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Tii3BpNFmAMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Alethea","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=6RgCAAAAQAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Business Statistics I Essentials (Essentials Study Guides)","description":"REA s Essentials provide quick and easy access to critical information in a variety of different fields, ranging from the most basic to the most advanced.

Scott Wolven is such a talent, and his raw, blistering tales of hard-bitten convicts, dodgy informers, and men running from the law make for \\"the most exciting, authentic collection of short stories I have read in years,\\" says George Pelecanos. Brooding, edgy, and sometimes violent, Controlled Burn's loosely linked stories are each in some way a distillation of hard time -- spent either in prison, the backwoods of Vermont, or the badlands of the American West. Peopled by boxers, drunks, truck drivers, murderers, bounty hunters, drifters traveling under assumed names, and men whose luck ran out a thousand miles ago, these stories feel hard-won from life, and if they are moody and stark, so too are they filled with human longing. Controlled Burn is divided into two sections: \\"The Northeast Kingdom\\" and \\"The Fugitive West.\\" In each, Scott Wolven reveals a broken world where there is no bottom left to hit. In the haunting \\"Outside Work Detail,\\" convicts stoically dig graves for their fellow prisoners yet reserve their deepest grief for the senseless death of a deer. \\"Crank\\" introduces Red Green, a maniacally brilliant addict who brews his own crystal meth in a backwoods lab, and whose high-energy antics inspire both cautious admiration and mortal fear in his business associates. In \\"Ball Lightning Reported,\\" Red Green's ultimate fate is revealed. In \\"Atomic Supernova,\\" a revenge-obsessed sheriff deputizes a known cop-killer to help him hunt down a counterfeiter and drug lord. The unexpectedly tender and heartbreaking \\"The Copper Kings\\" concerns a father facing the dark truth behind his son's disappearance. And in \\"Vigilance,\\" a hunted man struggles to escape his past, always yearning for an honorable yet perhaps unreachable future. Powered by a spare, ruminative prose style that recalls the best of Denis Johnson and Thom Jones, Controlled Burn is an unforgettable debut.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=jJxqVU8MqxUC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Will Anyone Search for Danny?","description":"During the winter of 1936, twenty-one-year-old Danny Corcoran of the Newfoundland Ranger Force set out on a routine wildlife patrol from Great Harbour Deep.

Danny was inexperienced in travelling on the open country of the Great Northern Peninsula, and what was intended to be a two-day trek to find and waylay poachers in the area turned out to be a gruelling two-week journey that would push Ranger Corcoran to the very limits of his endurance. Frightened, crippled, and alone, young Danny Corcoran faced his biggest challenge yet . . . and prayed that a search party would find him in time.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=bSU9PQAACAAJ&dq=Will+Anyone+Search+for+Danny%3F&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The American Motel","description":"Indian Americans own about half of all the motels in the United States.

Most of these motel owners arrived in the United States with few resources and, broadly speaking, they are self-employed, self-sufficient immigrants who have become successful they live the American dream. However, framing this group as embodying the American dream has profound implications. It perpetuates the idea of American exceptionalism that this nation creates opportunities for newcomers unattainable elsewhere and also downplays the inequalities of race, gender, culture, and globalization immigrants continue to face. Despite their dominance in the motel industry, Indian American moteliers are concentrated in lower- and mid-budget markets.

Chances are, if you go to law school you're someone who would be considered a \\"nontraditional\\" student. Or you're a \\"traditional\\" student (i.e., a student planning to go straight from college to law school) who is looking for a different perspective on the law school game. Either way, you'll find this book to be a valuable resource from the initial stages of planning for law school through admissions, the first year, and right up to graduation and the bar exam. Other law school books focus on largely irrelevant factors such as rankings and employment in \\"prestigious\\" law firms. In short, while a large fraction of law students today would be considered nontraditional, there is little accurate, relevant material to help nontraditional students navigate the admissions process and ultimately succeed in law school. That's where this guide steps in. This book is a distillation of the collective wisdom and experience of thousands of law students (including, yes, law review editors). With hundreds of excerpts, the information in this book is applicable to all law students... traditional and nontraditional alike.

Delany s epic fantasy the first in a series explores power, gender, and the nature of civilization. A boy of the bustling, colorful docks of port Kolhari, during a political coup, fifteen-year-old Gorgik, once his parents are killed, is taken a slave and transported to the government obsidian mines at the foot of the Faltha mountains. When, in the savagely primitive land of Nev r?on, finally he wins his freedom, Gorgik is ready to lead a rebellion against the rulers of this barely civilized land. His is the through-story that, now in the background, now in the foreground, connects these first five stories, in Tales of Nev r?on and, indeed, all the eleven stories, novellas, and novels that comprise Delany s epic fantasy series, Return to Nev r?on, where we can watch civilization first develop money, writing, labor, and that grounding of all civilizations since: capital itself. In these sagas of barbarism, new knowledge, and sex, you ll find far more than in most sword-and-sorcery. They are an epic feat of language, an ironic analysis of the foundations of civilization, and a reminder that no weapon is more powerful than a well-honed legend. This  eminently readable and gorgeously entertaining  (The Washington Post Book World) novel reads  as if Umberto Eco had written about Conan the Barbarian  (USA Today). This ebook features an illustrated biography of Samuel R. Delany including rare images from his early career.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Eu9cAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Capitalism, Democracy, and Ralph's Pretty Good Grocery.","description":"Democracy is overrated. Capitalism, on the other hand, doesn't get enough credit. In this provocative and engaging book, John Mueller argues that these mismatches between image and reality create significant political and economic problems--inspiring instability, inefficiency, and widespread cynicism. We would be far better off, he writes, if we recognized that neither system is ideal or disastrous and accepted instead the humdrum truth that both are \\"pretty good.\\" And, to Mueller, that means good enough. He declares that what is true of Garrison Keillor's fictional store \\"Ralph's Pretty Good Grocery\\" is also true of democracy and capitalism: if you can't get what you want there, \\"you can probably get along without it.\\" Mueller begins by noting that capitalism is commonly thought to celebrate greed and to require discourtesy, deceit, and callousness. However, with examples that range from car dealerships and corporate boardrooms to the shop of an eighteenth-century silk merchant, Mueller shows that capitalism in fact tends to reward behavior that is honest, fair, civil, and compassionate. He argues that this gap between image and reality hampers economic development by encouraging people to behave dishonestly, unfairly, and discourteously to try to get ahead and to neglect the virtuous behavior that is an important source of efficiency and gain. The problem with democracy's image, by contrast, is that our expectations are too high. We are too often led by theorists, reformers, and romantics to believe that democracy should consist of egalitarianism and avid civic participation. In fact, democracy will always be chaotic, unequal, and marked by apathy. It offers reasonable freedom and security, but not political paradise. To idealize democracy, Mueller writes, is to undermine it, since the inevitable contrast with reality creates public cynicism and can hamper democracy's growth and development. Mueller presents these arguments with sophistication, wit, and erudition. He combines mastery of current political and economic literature with references to figures ranging from Plato to P. T. Barnum, from Immanuel Kant to Ronald Reagan, from Shakespeare to Frank Capra. Broad in scope and rich in detail, the book will provoke debate among economists, political scientists, and anyone interested in the problems (or non-problems) of modern democracy and capitalism.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=MHCyoBveovcC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hydrodynamic and hydromagnetic stability (The International series of monographs on physics)","description":"The Nobel Laureate's monumental study surveys hydrodynamic and hydromagnetic stability as a branch of experimental physics, surveying thermal instability of a layer of fluid heated from below, Benard problem, more.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Mg3CAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Millennium; Winners and Losers in the Coming Order","description":"A look at the future world order forecasts a dramatic reordering of geopolitical and economic forces, high-tech economies, and a world of privileged elites surrounded by a vast array of impoverished nomads","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=wSkVbS_VRT0C&dq=Millennium%3B+Winners+and+Losers+in+the+Coming+Order&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Structure and Reactivity in Organic Chemistry","description":"The jump from an understanding of organic chemistry at lower undergraduate level to that required at postgraduate level or in industry can be difficult. Many advanced textbooks contain a level of detail which can obscure the essential mechanistic framework that unites the huge range of facts of organic chemistry. Understanding this underlying order is essential in any advanced study or application of organic chemistry. Structure and Reactivity in Organic Chemistry aims to bridge that gap. The text opens with a short overview of the way chemists understand chemical structure, and how that understanding is essential in developing a good knowledge of chemical reactivity and mechanism. The remainder of the text presents a mechanistic classification of modern organic chemistry, developed in the context of synthetic organic chemistry and exemplified by reference to stereoselective synthesis and protecting group chemistry. This approach is intended to illustrate the importance and value of a good grasp of organic reaction mechanisms, which is a prerequisite for a broader understanding of organic chemistry. Written by an expert educator with a sound understanding of the needs of different audiences, the subject is presented with clarity and precision, and in a highly practical manner. It is relevant to undergraduates, postgraduates and industrial organic chemists.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=HQbwAAAAMAAJ&dq=Structure+and+Reactivity+in+Organic+Chemistry&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Plate tectonics (Science concepts)","description":"Discusses plate tectonics, the theory that the surface of the earth is always moving, and the connection of this phenomenon to earthquakes and volcanoes.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=th5iDsd0cvEC&dq=Plate+tectonics+(Science+concepts)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Eating Pavlova","description":"A grieving Anna Freud, who has devoted her life to fit the needs of her famous father, reads his shocking diaries where his secrets are exposed, is unsure of his motives for writing them, and explores his conscious and unconscious world","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=z5ErHAAACAAJ&dq=Eating+Pavlova&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cavalier King Charles Spaniel Hb (World of Dogs S.)","description":"This is a comprehensive guide to the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel.

This study of learning in autonomous agents offers a bracing intellectual adventure. Chris Thornton makes the compelling claim that learning is not a passive discovery operation but an active process involving creativity on the part of the learner. Although theorists of machine learning tell us that all learning methods contribute some form of bias and thus involve a degree of creativity, Thornton carries the idea much further. He describes an incremental process, recursive relational learning, in which the results of one learning step serve as the basis for the next. Very high-level recodings are then substantially the creative artifacts of the learner's own processing. Lower-level recodings are more \\"objective\\" in that their properties are more severely constrained by the source data. Thornton sees consciousness as a process at the outer fringe of relational learning, just prior to the onset of creativity. According to this view, we cannot assume consciousness to be an exclusively human phenomenon, but rather the expected feature of any cognitive mechanism able to engage in extended flights of relational learning. Thornton presents key background material in an entertaining manner, using extensive mental imagery and a minimum of mathematics. Anecdotes and dialogue add to the text's informality.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=NUBvKDckcdMC&dq=Truth+from+Trash:+How+Learning+Makes+Sense+(Complex+Adaptive+Systems)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Time, Change and Freedom: An Introduction to Metaphysics","description":"First published in 1995.

Her name first appeared on the second edition, published in France in 1823.Frankenstein is infused with elements of the Gothic novel and the Romantic movement. At the same time, it is an early example of science fiction. Brian Aldiss has argued that it should be considered the first true science fiction story because, in contrast to previous stories with fantastical elements resembling those of later science fiction, the central character \\"makes a deliberate decision\\" and \\"turns to modern experiments in the laboratory\\" to achieve fantastic results.

They begin their dance trying to understand why the rationally scientific and the emotionally creative are always in mortal combat. Their serpentine route leads them to startling discoveries: that emotion is the most sophisticated of our mental processes; that creativity is the most primal emotion after self-preservation; that intuition is the foundation of creativity; that the creative self is not singular but plural; that the creativity that all humans possess can be accessed at will. Having drawn their road map of mental processing, the speakers then create methods for becoming intentionally creative whenever and wherever they choose to be. They are awed by the implications of their dialogic dance; however sophisticated the evolution of these methods, they can be used by anyone of high school age or older. The implications stagger them as they envision a society in which creativity is a useful everyday tool taught throughout the educational system.

Their colors and color patterns, along with their diverse shapes and associations, have assured their role as exqui site showpieces. Their workability and durability have, in addition, made them favorites among connoisseurs of colored gemstones. Tourmalines, however, are much more than exquisite showpieces and beautiful gemstones. Their diverse crystal forms and unique structure, their variable chemical compositions, their intriguing physical properties, and their widespread occurrence in nearly all kinds of rocks have long attracted the attention of scientists from several disciplines.

Point by point, he systematically builds his case by articulating who needs salvation and why, the role of the law, Gods response to the sin problem, resolution of the legal issues presented by sin, and the effect each has on the Christians life.This devotional commentary divides the entire text into short passages that are followed by a detailed, user-friendly exegetical explanation and practical application to everyday life.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=MieoCJ_4_psC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"An essay on metaphysics","description":"This early work by Robin G.

So different that phsyicists frequently lack words to describe it. Quantum mechanics had to create new conceptions for the world of the ultrasmall, bizarre conceptions beyond the scope of pictorial imagery. Customary physical laws cease to operate in the new world.

Electrons and the other building stones of matter can pass through impenetrable barriers, or they can vanish altogether leaving only photons in their place.

Analysis of popular and scholarly readings of the Apocalypse, complemented by autobiographical reflection, reveals that authority is a critical issue for contemporary interpreters. As John articulates his own authority, he must also silence competing voices from the empire, the larger society, local Jewish communities, and even some members of his audience. Carey proposes narrative ethos as a model for evaluating John's rhetoric. Taken together, the resources of classical rhetoric, modern literary analysis, and postcolonial criticisms elucidate how ancient apocalyptic visionaries like John legitimated their radical claims.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=nz7orJvZRfYC&dq=ELUSIVE+APOCALYPSE+(Studies+in+American+Biblical+Hermeneutics)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The giant cat;: Or, The quest of Aoun and Zouhr,","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BnhEAAAAIAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Shape Magazine's Ultimate Body Book: 4 Weeks to Your Best Abs, Butt, Thighs, and More!","description":"Shape Magazine's Ultimate Body Book, the follow-up to the bestseller, Shape Your Life.

His findings cause him to question many traditional assumptions about the \\"primitive\\" East, and he suggests that, in contrast to pre-colonial Africa, kinship practice in Asia has much in common with that prevailing in parts of pre-industrial Europe. Goody examines the transmission of productive and other property in relation both to the prevailing political economy and to family and ideological structures, and explores the distribution of mechanisms and strategies of management across cultures. The book concludes that notions of western \\"uniqueness\\" are often misplaced, and that much previous work on Asian kinship has been unwittingly distorted by the application of concepts and approaches derived from other, inappropriate, social formations.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Tdgos7fWazIC&dq=The+Oriental,+the+Ancient+and+the+Primitive:+Systems+of+Marriage+and+the+Family+in+the+Pre-Industrial+Societies+of+Eurasia+(Studies+in+Literacy,+the+Family,+Culture+and+the+State)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Houghton Mifflin Invitations to Literature: Rd Pback+ Julian Dream 3.2 -Imp JULIAN DREAM","description":"When Julian finds out that his dad has always wanted snakes for a birthday present, he realizes he'll need more than good intentions--he'll need courage.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ezownfD2E5cC&dq=Houghton+Mifflin+Invitations+to+Literature:+Rd+Pback++Julian+Dream+3.2+-Imp+JULIAN+DREAM&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Wedding of the Year (Sonnet Books)","description":"Victoria Malvey requests the honor of your presence... at a madcap, merry celebration of love's unpredictable ways!

Why does this ghost of the southern swamps arouse such an obsessive level of passion in its devotees, who range from respected researchers to the flakiest Loch Ness monster fanatics and Elvis chasers? Since the early twentieth century, scientists have been trying their best to prove that the ivory-bill is extinct. But every time they think they've finally closed the door, the bird makes an unexpected appearance. To unravel the mystery, author Tim Gallagher heads south, deep into the eerie swamps and bayous of the vast Mississippi Delta, searching for people who claim to have seen this rarest of birds and following up sometimes more than thirty years after the fact on their sightings. What follows is his own Eureka moment with his buddy Bobby Harrison, a true son of the South from Alabama. A huge woodpecker flies in front of their canoe, and they both cry out,  Ivory-bill!  This sighting the first time since 1944 that two qualified observers positively identify an ivory-billed woodpecker in the United States quickly leads to the largest search ever launched to find a rare bird, as researchers fan out across the bayou, hoping to document the existence of this most iconic of birds.

Their sobering assessment of job training programs willenlighten a debate too often dominated by wishful thinking and political rhetoric. Look for their findings to be cited for many years to come.  Douglas Besharov, American Enterprise Institute A methodologically astute study that sheds considerable light on the potential for and limits to raising the employment and earnings of welfare recipients and provides benchmarks against which the impacts of later programs can be compared.  Journal of Economic Literature With welfare reforms tested in almost every state and plans for a comprehensive federal overall on the horizon, it is increasingly important for Americans to understand how policy changes are likely to affect the lives of welfare recipients. Five Years After tells the story of what happened to the welfare recipients who participated in the influential welfare-to-work experiments conducted by several states in the mid-1980s.The authors review the distinctive goals and procedures of evaluations performed in Arkansas, Baltimore, San Diego, and Virginia, and then examine five years of follow-up data to determine whether the initial positive impact on employment, earnings, and welfare costs held up over time. The results were surprisingly consistent. Low-cost programs that saved money by getting individuals into jobs quickly did little to reduce poverty in the long run. Only higher-cost educational programs enabled welfare recipients to hold down jobs successfully and stay off welfare. Five Years After ends speculation about the viability of the first generation of employment programs for welfare recipients, delineates the hard choices that must be made among competing approaches, and provides a well-documented foundation for building more comprehensive programs for the next generation. A sobering tale for welfare reformers of all political persuasions, this book poses a serious challenge to anyone who promises to end welfare dependency by cutting welfare budgets.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Lu8WAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Escape To Witch Mountain","description":"A sci-fi classic returns to print in its true, best, and original form!

Her choice led her family on a journey through despair, acceptance, and then hope. Her mother, Jill Ririe, wrote I Can Only Imagine to touch the hearts of people worldwide; both those who have considered suicide as an option, and those who have experienced it as a survivor or experienced the loss of a child. This book is also intended to create awareness about the experience of survivors. Suicide is an epidemic in our world, especially among the young. In our nation alone, more people die from suicide than from homicide. For young people 15-24 years old, suicide is the second leading cause of death, behind unintentional injury and homicide. Unfortunately, it is a topic not often acknowledged nor discussed. I Can Only Imagine challenges the societal problem of teen suicide, as well as provides proof of God's unfailing love for us; helping us to conquer our fear of death. Jill Ririe has already influenced thousands internationally through her website www.mollisgarden.com which she completed the year following her daughter's sudden passing. On October 24, 2002, Jill was featured on James Van Praagh's show Beyond and has gained international attention with her unique story. It is an important story, for awareness and for hope in the unknown. Jill has taken a tremendous emotional and spiritual journey initiated by her grief; a journey that has led her to know peace and strength in Christ. I Can Only Imagine provides a unique perspective in that it reveals the pain of grief as well as joy in life after death. It differs from other books in that it contains conversations between not only between the author and herdaughter through the Holy Spirit since her passing but also with the Lord. It includes a message from Molli to the World. Mrs. Ririe's book is based on God's love for us and addresses many common questions that people have. This book contains true-life miracles that have occurred and shows how to heal from grief and how to experience hope and a sense of normalcy. Overall, it should leave the reader with a new understanding of death, as well as a new outlook on God's love. This is the first book in a series that Jill is writing. The second is projected for early 2005. Her work will concentrate on helping others through their grief, ending the plague of suicide among our youth, and spreading the news of God's joyous miracles. This book will certainly touch your heart and your spirit.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=wT7fwAEACAAJ&dq=I+Can+Only+Imagine...:+An+Amazing+Journey+Through+Grief,+Faith,+and+Love&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Groundwork for the Metaphysics of Morals (Oxford Philosophical Texts)","description":"Immanuel Kant's Groundwork for the Metaphysics of Morals is one of the most important texts in the history of ethics.

How can he allow evil and suffering in the world? Have miracles ceased? Sir Robert Anderson, one of the most popular lay preachers at the turn of the 20th century, devoutly believed that the Bible was the inerrant word of God, and in this classic of Christian apologetics, first published in 1907, he attempts to answer these conundrums for the faithful through appeal to Scripture. Seekers after spiritual succor will find comfort in Anderson's arguments, while anyone interested in the rise of fundamentalist Christianity in the 21st century will find a fascinating illustration of the movement's beliefs. While at Scotland Yard, Irish police official and religious scholar SIR ROBERT ANDERSON (1841-1918) helped investigate the Jack the Ripper murders, but he is best remembered for his works of Bible study, including Forgotten Truths, Daniel in the Critics' Den, and The Coming Prince.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=rq6vqzdOwFwC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"William Shakespeare.

It provides a solid background of the core statistical concepts taught in most introductory statistics textbooks. Mathematical proofs are deemphasized in favor of careful explanations of statistical constructs. The text begins with coverage of descriptive statistics such as measures of central tendency and variability, then moves on to inferential statistics. Transitional chapters on z-scores, probability, and sampling distributions pave the way to understanding the logic of hypothesis testing and the inferential tests that follow. Hypothesis testing is taught through a four-step process. These same four steps are used throughout the text for the other statistical tests presented including t tests, one- and two-way ANOVAs, chi-square, and correlation. A chapter on nonparametric tests is also provided as an alternative when the requirements cannot be met for parametric tests. Because the same logical framework and sequential steps are used throughout the text, a consistency is provided that allows students to gradually master the concepts. Their learning is enhanced further with the inclusion of \\"thought questions\\" and practice problems integrated throughout the chapters.

In this way, readers are supplied with almost anything they want to know about color outside their own area of expertise. Thus, the color measurement expert, as well as the general reader, can find here information on the perception, causes, and uses of color. For the artist there are details on the causes, measurement, perception, and reproduction of color. Within each chapter, authors were requested to indicate directions of future efforts, where applicable. One might reasonably expect that all would have been learned about color in the more than three hundred years since Newton established the fundamentals of color science. This is not true because: ? the measurement of color still has unresolved complexities (Chapter 2) ? many of the fine details of color vision remain unknown (Chapter 3) ? every few decades a new movement in art discovers original ways to use new pigments, and dyes continue to be discovered (Chapter 5) ? the philosophical approach to color has not yet crystallized (Chapter 7) ? new pigments and dyes continue to be discovered (Chapters 10 and 11) ? the study of the biological and therapeutic effects of color is still in its infancy (Chapter 2). Color continues to develop towards maturity and the editor believes that there is much common ground between the sciences and the arts and that color is a major connecting bridge.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ptpXbW1NaeMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Knitting Counterpanes: Traditional Coverlet Patterns for Contemporary Knitters","description":"Mary Walker Phillips nearly single-handedly brought 19th-century American counterpanes   bed coverings   to the attention of modern knitters.

Truth be told, monochrome is a contrivance. Human experience is always colourful' The Times. The epic, harrowing and world-changing story  in words and colourized images  of global conflict from the assassination of the Archduke Franz Ferdinand to the obliteration of Hiroshima by the dropping of the first atom bomb. The World Aflame will embrace not only the total conflagrations of 1914-18 and 1939-45 and the international tensions, conflicting ideologies and malign economic forces that set them in train, but also the civil wars of the interwar period in Ireland and Spain, wars in Latin America, Britain's imperial travails in such places as Ireland, Somalia and Palestine, and events on the domestic 'fronts' of the belligerent nations. Like The Colour of Time, The World Aflame is a collaboration between the gifted Brazilian artist Marina Amaral, and the leading British historian Dan Jones. Marina has created 200 stunning images, using contemporary photographs as the basis for her full-colour digital renditions. The accompanying narrative anchors each image in its context, weaving them into a vivid account of four decades of conflict that shaped the world we live in today. A fusion of amazing pictures and well-chosen and informative words, The World Aflame offers a moving  and often terrifying  perspective on the bloodiest century in human history. ************************************************************** Reviews for THE COLOUR OF TIME: 'The most breathtakingly colourised black-and-white pictures ever' Daily Mail. 'I have long considered colourisation sacrilege ... after reading this book, I've changed my mind' The Times. '[The Colour of Time] does something simple yet extraordinary. It takes black-and-white photos of historic events and colours them in. The effect is transformative' Daily Telegraph. 'A stunning book ... Quite extraordinary' The Bookseller. 'There is something of The Wizard of Oz about Marina Amaral's photographs. She whisks us from black-and-white Kansas to shimmering Technicolor Oz ... When you see Amaral's coloured portraits, you think: phwoar! ... She changes the way we see a period or a person' Spectator. 'The effect of colour is far more transformative than you might imagine ... [Amaral's] touched-up photographs look even more realistic, and closer to life, than a photograph taken yesterday ... Extraordinary' Mail on Sunday. 'Pictures brought to life as you've never seen them before' Sunday Post. '[Amaral] breathes new life, immediacy and human connection into black-and-white pictures. Even familiar shots are transformed in a breathtaking way ... Even the casual reader leafing through these pages will be stopped in their tracks, connected to people from the past like never before  at last, in living colour' Irish News. 'Jones sketches with wry economy not only the historical context but the purpose of the photograph, from documented reality to shameless propaganda, from official portrait to candid snap ... There is much to enjoy here. As a history book, it acts as a fleeting guide to a tumultuous century. But as an aesthetic experiment it is remarkably successful' Daily Express. 'What also elevates The Colour of Time above regular coffee table fare is the startling vivacity and impact of the photographs chosen, and the concise but focused and gripping texts by Jones, making the book a worthwhile cover-to-cover read as much as it serves as a showcase book to dip into at will' All About History.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=aQ2FDwAAQBAJ&dq=World+Aflame&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Police Women: Life with the Badge","description":"Examines what it takes to survive when a woman enters the \\"biggest boys' club in America\\"--the police forces.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Bd1GbzIr270C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Eco-Socialism or Eco-Capitalism?: A Critical Analysis of Humanity's Fundamental Choices","description":"This synoptic work explores some of the most important questions facing humanity in the coming generations.

So when Ol' Rosie and the other horses run off, somebody has to go catch them. But Wart's ma is having a baby. His pa needs to stay with her and to watch his little brother Danny. That leaves twelve-year-old Wart with the dangerous and critical charge of rounding up their runaway horses by himself. Struggling through the rugged wilderness and facing almost overwhelming peril, Wart must keep his wits about him. \\"I stood there for another minute trying to think.

Likening himself to a white bull on Love's tapestry, he pursues his romantic vision in a primitive Mediterranean landscape. There two couples Cyril and Fiona, Hugh and Catherine mingle their loves in an \\"lllyria\\" that brings to mind the equally timeless countryside of Shakespeare's Twelfth Night.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ANL5MXikzYsC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Victorian Suicide: Mad Crimes and Sad Histories","description":"When Viscount Castlereagh, leader of the House of Commons and architect of the Grand Alliance, committed suicide in 1822, the coroner's inquest could consider only two legal verdicts: insanity or self-murder. Public outrage greeted his burial in Westminster Abbey; the tradition lingered that a suicide's burial place be at a crossroads, with a stake through the heart to keep the lost soul from wandering. Probing a remarkable variety of sources and individual cases, Barbara Gates shows how attitudes toward suicide changed between Castlereagh's death and the end of the century. By 1900 the Victorians' moral censure of suicide and the accompanying denial that it was a widespread problem had been replaced by a more compassionate response--and also by an unfounded belief in a \\"suicide epidemic,\\" which Thomas Hardy described as a \\"coming universal wish not to live.\\". Exposing a rich area of interaction between history and literature, and utilizing the methodology of the new historicism, Gates discusses topics ranging from the plot for Wuthering Heights to Victorian shilling shockers. Among other findings she includes evidence that Victorian middle-class men, particularly, tended to make suicide the province of other selves--of men belonging to other times or places, of \\"monsters,\\" or of women.

Now a successful, middle-aged New York City writer, he is still searching for that elusive man of his dreams. Unfortunately, Curtis has already formed a self-destructive pattern of choosing all the wrong men in all the wrong places. After a bizarre yet comical attempt at suicide, Curtis becomes a reluctant patient of the aging and eccentric psychiatrist Dr. Magda Tunick. Her gruff and unethical approach to therapy relentlessly pushes him to explore the real reasons why he hasn't found love and helps him to discover the important qualities he desires in a man. Eager to help Curtis on his quest to find his true soul mate is his irreverent and unpredictable mother, Mrs. J., and his incorrigible best friend and soap opera writer, Quinn Larkin.

Twenty-three voluntarily childfree, sterilized women, aged 22 to 51 years, tell their stories, revealing the struggles they faced in being women without children in a society which expects women to be mothers. They describe the many barriers encountered on the way to being sterilized, including prejudice from those around them as well as hostility and refusal from the medical profession. The women recall how their reasons and decisions were ignored or pathologized by doctors who held unquestioned assumptions about how women should be. Feminist and sociological perspectives are employed to highlight that voluntarily childfree women are perceived as abnormal, not \\"real\\" women, and are often the target of negative and critical comment.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zpXtwUYQYfcC&dq=Childfree+and+Sterilized&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"I Love You, Let's Work It Out","description":"Shows couples how to overcome the obstacles that can destroy love and how to develop the self-understanding that leads to true intimacy","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=uRNAApMO5Z0C&dq=I+Love+You,+Let%27s+Work+It+Out&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Helping the Grieving Student: A Guide for Teachers","description":"This guidebook was written for school personnel who come in direct, daily contact with the grieving student.

ME/CFS can cause significant impairment and disability. Despite substantial efforts by researchers to better understand ME/CFS, there is no known cause or effective treatment. Diagnosing the disease remains a challenge, and patients often struggle with their illness for years before an identification is made. Some health care providers have been skeptical about the serious physiological - rather than psychological - nature of the illness. Once diagnosed, patients often complain of receiving hostility from their health care provider as well as being subjected to treatment strategies that exacerbate their symptoms. Beyond Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome proposes new diagnostic clinical criteria for ME/CFS and a new term for the illness - systemic exertion intolerance disease(SEID). According to this report, the term myalgic encephalomyelitis does not accurately describe this illness, and the term chronic fatigue syndrome can result in trivialization and stigmatization for patients afflicted with this illness. Beyond Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome stresses that SEID is a medical - not a psychiatric or psychological - illness. This report lists the major symptoms of SEID and recommends a diagnostic process.One of the report's most important conclusions is that a thorough history, physical examination, and targeted work-up are necessary and often sufficient for diagnosis. The new criteria will allow a large percentage of undiagnosed patients to receive an accurate diagnosis and appropriate care. Beyond Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome will be a valuable resource to promote the prompt diagnosis of patients with this complex, multisystem, and often devastating disorder; enhance public understanding; and provide a firm foundation for future improvements in diagnosis and treatment.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=EXH2BwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Weather forecasting; Illustrated by Diagrams, Charts and Photographs","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=lrAXMwEACAAJ&dq=Weather+forecasting%3B+Illustrated+by+Diagrams,+Charts+and+Photographs&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Story of a Mosque in America","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0KUbAgAACAAJ&dq=Story+of+a+Mosque+in+America&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"I Wouldn't Have Missed It: Selected Poems of Ogden Nash","description":"Gathers together over four hundred poems from sixteen irrepressible volumes, providing a representative and invigorating sampling of Nash's unique view and handling of the inanities, sanities, and humanities of his times","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=FJp5tQEACAAJ&dq=I+Wouldn%27t+Have+Missed+It:+Selected+Poems+of+Ogden+Nash&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Spirit Matters","description":"This book acts as a supplement to a traditional textbook in international business.

Many have written about Billy Graham, the evangelist. This is the first book about Billy Graham, the father, written from the perspective of a son who knew him best. As a beloved evangelist and a respected man of God, Billy Graham s stated purpose in life never wavered: to help people find a personal relationship with God through a saving knowledge of Jesus Christ. This was a calling that only increased over time, and Billy embraced it fully throughout his active ministry and beyond. Yet Billy pursued his life s work, as many men do, amid a similarly significant calling to be a loving husband and father. While most people knew Billy Graham as America s pastor, Franklin Graham knew him in a different way, as a dad. And while present and future generations will come to their own conclusions about Billy Graham and the legacy that his commitment to Christ has left behind, no one can speak more insightfully or authoritatively on that subject than a son who grew up in the shadow of his father s life and the examples of his father s love. This vulnerable book is a look at both Billy Graham the evangelist and Billy Graham the father, and the impact he had on a son who walked in his father s steps while also becoming his own man, leading ministries around the world, all of it based on the foundational lessons his father taught him.  My father left behind a testimony to God,  says Franklin,  a legacy not buried in a grave but still pointing people to a heaven-bound destiny. The Lord will say to my father, and to all who served Him obediently,  Well done, good and faithful servant  [Matthew 25:21].

She is a child of the Seventies who feels misled by the rebellious \\"boomer\\" generation and disappointed with life in 1980s New Jersey. Spurred by the tale of her pioneering grandparents, who immigrated to Montana, and following her friend Madeleine, who has all the answers, Lori quits her job, loosens her ties, and sets off into a wild frontier. Lori's story is one of love for people and for places that are more mythic than real. Her pursuit is as painfully familiar as it is impossible: she seeks meaning in life while working dead-end jobs, falls in love with uninterested partners, and plans a future that seems doomed from the start. Somehow, though, she persists and ultimately finds her place as a twenty-first-century pioneer.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Iz6gNvyaS60C&dq=Chasing+Montana:+A+Love+Story&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"In war time","description":"Winner of both the National Book Award for Arts and Letters and the National Book Critics Circle Award for Criticism, Paul Fussell's The Great War and Modern Memory was one of the most original and gripping volumes ever written about the First World War. Frank Kermode, in The New York Times Book Review, hailed it as \\"an important contribution to our understanding of how we came to make World War I part of our minds,\\" and Lionel Trilling called it simply \\"one of the most deeply moving books I have read in a long time.\\" In its panaramic scope and poetic intensity, it illuminated a war that changed a generation and revolutionized the way we see the world. Now, in Wartime, Fussell turns to the Second World War, the conflict he himself fought in, to weave a narrative that is both more intensely personal and more wide-ranging. Whereas his former book focused primarily on literary figures, on the image of the Great War in literature, here Fussell examines the immediate impact of the war on common soldiers and civilians. He describes the psychological and emotional atmosphere of World War II. He analyzes the euphemisms people needed to deal with unacceptable reality (the early belief, for instance, that the war could be won by \\"precision bombing,\\" that is, by long distance); he describes the abnormally intense frustration of desire and some of the means by which desire was satisfied; and, most important, he emphasizes the damage the war did to intellect, discrimination, honesty, individuality, complexity, ambiguity and wit. Of course, no Fussell book would be complete without some serious discussion of the literature of the time. He examines, for instance, how the great privations of wartime (when oranges would be raffled off as valued prizes) resulted in roccoco prose styles that dwelt longingly on lavish dinners, and how the \\"high-mindedness\\" of the era and the almost pathological need to \\"accentuate the positive\\" led to the downfall of the acerbic H.L. Mencken and the ascent of E.B. White. He also offers astute commentary on Edmund Wilson's argument with Archibald MacLeish, Cyril Connolly's Horizon magazine, the war poetry of Randall Jarrell and Louis Simpson, and many other aspects of the wartime literary world. Fussell conveys the essence of that wartime as no other writer before him. For the past fifty years, the Allied War has been sanitized and romanticized almost beyond recognition by \\"the sentimental, the loony patriotic, the ignorant, and the bloodthirsty.\\" Americans, he says, have never understood what the Second World War was really like. In this stunning volume, he offers such an understanding.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ThdwAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Creative Brooding: Readings to Provoke Thought and Trigger Action","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=XdgDAQAAIAAJ&dq=Creative+Brooding:+Readings+to+Provoke+Thought+and+Trigger+Action&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Darkroom","description":"Darkroom: A Memoir in Black and White is an arresting and moving personal story about childhood, race, and identity in the American South, rendered in stunning illustrations by the author, Lila Quintero Weaver. In 1961, when Lila was five, she and her family emigrated from Buenos Aires, Argentina, to Marion, Alabama, in the heart of Alabama s Black Belt. As educated, middle-class Latino immigrants in a region that was defined by segregation, the Quinteros occupied a privileged vantage from which to view the racially charged culture they inhabited. Weaver and her family were firsthand witnesses to key moments in the civil rights movement. But Darkroom is her personal story as well: chronicling what it was like being a Latina girl in the Jim Crow South, struggling to understand both a foreign country and the horrors of our nation s race relations. Weaver, who was neither black nor white, observed very early on the inequalities in the American culture, with its blonde and blue-eyed feminine ideal.

These players, however, represented much more than mere pleasure-seekers. In this lively narrative, Zeiler explores the ways in which the Spalding World Baseball Tour drew on elements of cultural diplomacy to inject American values and power into the international arena. Through his chronicle of baseball history, games, and experiences, Zeiler explores expressions of imperial dreams through globalization's instruments of free enterprise, webs of modern communication and transport, cultural ordering of races and societies, and a strident nationalism that galvanized notions of American uniqueness. Spalding linked baseball to a U.S. presence overseas, viewing the world as a market ripe for the infusion of American ideas, products and energy. Through globalization during the Gilded Age, he and other Americans penetrated the globe and laid the foundation for an empire formally acquired just a decade after their tour.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=q8M7svZ-ibQC&dq=Pinstripes&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Reason and revelation in the middle ages (The Richards lectures in the University of Virginia [1937])","description":"Now how would things be intelligible if they did not proceed from an intelligence?

By examining the nature, organization, and transformation of authority over time, Dabashi conveys both continuities and disruptions inherent in the development of a new political culture. It is this process, he argues, that accounts for the fundamental patterns of authority in Islam that ultimately shaped, in dialectical interaction with external historical factors, the course of Islamic civilization. The book begins by examining the principal characteristics of authority in pre-Islamic Arab society. Dabashi describes the imposition of the Muhammadan charismatic movement on pre-Islamic Arab culture, tracing the changes it introduced in the fabric of pre-Islamic Arabia. He examines the continuities and changes that followed, focusing on the concept of authority, and the formation of the Sunnite, Shiite, and Karajite branches of Islam as political expressions of deep cultural cleavages. For Dabashi, the formation of these branches was the inevitable outcome of the clash between pre-Islamic patterns of authority and those of the Muhammadan charismatic movement. In turn, they molded both the unity and the diversity of the emerging Islamic culture. Authority in Islam explains how this came to be. Dabashi employs Weber's concept of charismatic authority in describing Muhammad and his mode of authority as both a model and a point of departure. His purpose is not to offer critical verification or opposition to interpretation of historical events, but to suggest a new approach to the existing literature. The book is an important contribution to political sociology as well as the study of Islamic culture and civilization. Sociologists, political scientists, and Middle Eastern specialists will find this analysis of particular value.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=wKs0DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Establishment of the Han Empire and Imperial China (Greenwood Guides to Historic Events of the Ancient World)","description":"Examines the Han empire from political, geographical, material, and cultural perspectives.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=LqoScufvff0C&dq=The+Establishment+of+the+Han+Empire+and+Imperial+China+(Greenwood+Guides+to+Historic+Events+of+the+Ancient+World)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Psychology of Thinking","description":"Instructors - Electronic inspection copies are available or contact your local sales representative for an inspection copy of the print version.

Divided into three key sections, there are chapters on the organization of human thought, general reasoning and thinking and behavioural outcomes of thinking. These three overarching themes provide a broad theoretical framework with which to explore wider issues in cognition and cognitive psychology and there are chapters on motivation and language plus a strong focus on problem solving, reasoning and decision making  all of which are central to a solid understanding of this field.

Life s losses were sharp and deeply-felt, but the hope carried by the beings that survived sets the stage for the world as we know it now. Picture yourself in the Cretaceous period. It s a sunny afternoon in the Hell Creek of ancient Montana 66 million years ago. A Triceratops horridus ambles along the edge of the forest. In a matter of hours, everything here will be wiped away. Lush verdure will be replaced with fire. Tyrannosaurus rex will be toppled from their throne, along with every other species of non-avian dinosaur no matter their size, diet, or disposition. They just don t know it yet. The cause of this disaster was identified decades ago. An asteroid some seven miles across slammed into the Earth, leaving a geologic wound over 50 miles in diameter. In the terrible mass extinction that followed, more than half of known species vanished seemingly overnight. But this worst single day in the history of life on Earth was as critical for us as it was for the dinosaurs, as it allowed for evolutionary opportunities that were closed for the previous 100 million years.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=6CtBEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Principles of dynamics","description":"An exploration of the principles of dynamics.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=j_RQAAAAMAAJ&dq=Principles+of+dynamics&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Night Photography","description":"Night photographers have one big thing in common: a true love of the dark. Rather than looking at night photography as an extension of daytime shooting with added complications, they embrace the unique challenges of nocturnal photography for the tremendous wealth of creative opportunities it offers. That's just what this book does. But if the idea of setting out into the deep, dark night with just your camera (and maybe a cup of coffee) gets your creative juices flowing, dive right in. Lance Keimig, one of the premier experts on night photography, has put together a comprehensive reference that will show you ways to capture images you never thought possible. If you have some experience with photography and have always wanted to try shooting at night, you'll learn the basics for film or digital shooting. If you're already a seasoned pro, you'll learn to use sophisticated techniques such as light painting and drawing, stacking images to create long star trails, and more. A chapter on the history of night photography describes the materials and processes that made night photography possible, and introduces the photographers who have defined night photography as an artistic medium. A chapter on how to use popular software packages such as Lightroom and Photoshop specifically with night time shots shows you how to make the final adjustments to your nocturnal creations. In this book you'll find history, theory, and lots of practical instruction on technique, all illustrated with clear, concise examples, diagrams and charts that reinforce the text, and inspiring color and black and white images from the author and other luminaries in the field, including Scott Martin, Dan Burkholder, Tom Paiva, Troy Paiva, Christian Waeber, Jens Warnecke and Cenci Goepel, with Foreword by Steve Harper.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=VpmWRRCwEIcC&dq=Night+Photography&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Transylvanian Desserts: My Mom's Recipes","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Pcp8O5NJvpsC&dq=Transylvanian+Desserts:+My+Mom%27s+Recipes&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Intermediate Algebra second edition-Student Solutions (10 Chapters) 0534383467 ISBN","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Eros in Pompeii: The Erotic Art Collection of the Museum of Naples","description":"Along with an extensive historical and social background text, this book provides a fully documented description and history of the collection, accompanied by nearly 160 full colour photographs.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=12IwAQAAIAAJ&dq=Eros+in+Pompeii:+The+Erotic+Art+Collection+of+the+Museum+of+Naples&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Jumble Joan (Creepies)","description":"Four scary tales children will love!The Creepies series shines a light on those dark corners for every child who has wondered if there is something lurking there.

A daring, gifted, remarkably successful military leader, General Kenney pioneered the tactics and strategy of a new kind of warfare in a dozen brilliant ways, perfecting the dangerous skills of skip-bombing, low-altitude strafing, and parafrag bombing. He improvised breathtaking feats of airborne war and executed them flawlessly. Enormously readable and unmistakably authentic, his story began in the dark days of July 1942 when the Japanese were at Australia's threshold.

Halperin revisits and refines the argument he put forward in his classic One Hundred Years of Homosexuality: that hetero- and homosexuality are not biologically constituted but are, instead, historically and culturally produced. How to Do the History of Homosexuality expands on this view, updates it, answers its critics, and makes greater allowance for continuities in the history of sexuality. Above all, Halperin offers a vigorous defense of the historicist approach to the construction of sexuality, an approach that sets a premium on the description of other societies in all their irreducible specificity and does not force them to fit our own conceptions of what sexuality is or ought to be. Dealing both with male homosexuality and with lesbianism, this study imparts to the history of sexuality a renewed sense of adventure and daring. It recovers the radical design of Michel Foucault's epochal work, salvaging Foucault's insights from common misapprehensions and making them newly available to historians, so that they can once again provide a powerful impetus for innovation in the field. Far from having exhausted Foucault's revolutionary ideas, Halperin maintains that we have yet to come to terms with their startling implications. Exploring the broader significance of historicizing desire, Halperin questions the tendency among scholars to reduce the history of sexuality to a mere history of sexual classifications instead of a history of human subjectivity itself. Finally, in a theoretical tour de force, Halperin offers an altogether new strategy for approaching the history of homosexuality one that can accommodate both ruptures and continuities, both identity and difference in sexual experiences across time and space. Impassioned but judicious, controversial but deeply informed, How to Do the History of Homosexuality is a book rich in suggestive propositions as well as eye-opening details. It will prove to be essential reading for anyone interested in the history of sexuality.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=4aCsv-E3joEC&dq=How+to+Do+the+History+of+Homosexuality&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Education of Lieutenant Kerrey","description":"On the night of February 25, 1969, an inexperienced, 25-year-old lieutenant, Bob Kerrey, led a commando raid on an isolated hamlet called Thanh Phong in Vietnam's Mekong Delta. While witnesses and official records give varying accounts, one thing is certain: around midnight, Kerrey and his men killed nearly two dozen unarmed women and children. What happened that night and why? It's a terrible secret that Kerrey has borne for more than thirty years. Kerrey went on to do heroic things in Vietnam and later as a politician. Since World War II, he is only Medal of Honor winner to sit as a member of Congress. In many ways, Kerrey's life following that tragic mission has been a struggle for redemption. So is Bob Kerrey a war hero or war criminal? Gregory L. Vistica, who uncovered the Thanh Phong atrocities in a widely-praised cover story for The New York Times Magazine, searches the entire span of Kerrey's life to answer that question.. From his rural boyhood in Nebraska, to his gut wrenching Navy SEAL training, to his aborted run for President, Kerrey's life will become a vehicle for understanding the Vietnam generation shaped in the 50s and sharpened by the tumultuous 60s. The Education of Lieutenant Kerrey is an incredible story and a modern morality tale about a man of compassion and promise trapped by a horrible secret.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=i9Fwghz5jbIC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dilemmas: The Tarner Lectures 1953","description":"This book shows that the conflicts that arise from everyday ways of thinking are not dilemmas as they appear to be.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=95yNCgAAQBAJ&dq=Dilemmas:+The+Tarner+Lectures+1953&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Bell Jar, a Novel of the Fifties (Twayne's Masterwork Studies)","description":"\\"Though her life was brief, the American poet and novelist Sylvia Plath (1932-63) exerted a profound influence on contemporary writers, particularly women writers of the sixties and seventies. Just as to her Pulitzer Prize-winning poetry Plath brought a decidedly feminist perspective, so too did she etch in her novel The Bell Jar a disturbing vision of life for young women in America at midcentury. The Bell Jar - based on Plath's own experiences as a student at Smith College, an intern at Mademoiselle, and a young woman battling for her own sanity amid societal mores of the times - was initially published in England under a pseudonym, its American publication stifled for years by the writer's family. When, however, the 1963 novel was finally released to U.S. audiences in 1971, it achieved both critical and popular success, and has since become a classic of feminist literature and a unique vehicle for better appreciating Plath's gifts.\\" \\"It is through a multifaceted lens that Linda Wagner-Martin examines The Bell Jar in this new study. Whereas past critical attention has centered on The Bell Jar as autobiography, Wagner-Martin transcends that approach, looking as well at the novel in its larger context of the social and historical forces shaping women's lives in America during the fifties and sixties. Thus eschewing a simplistic reading of the novel, the author plumbs issues of gender, genre, and narrative voice. Arguing that Plath's troubled personal history was the product of her struggle against contemporary social forces, Wagner-Martin reviews the writer's prior work and inspects earlier, partial versions of the novel; explores Plath's use of humor and sarcasm; traces the writer's representation of patriarchal structures in the novel; and ultimately places the novel squarely in the tradition of works about women at odds with a society dominated by patriarchal values. A brilliantly argued, eminently readable approach to this masterpiece, The Bell Jar: A Novel of the Fifties is certain to be lauded by scholars and students alike.\\"--BOOK JACKET.Title Summary field provided by Blackwell North America, Inc.

But when aviation took off and scenes of the Midwest were no longer earthbound, the Midwestern landscape was transformed and with it, Jason Weems suggests in this book, the very idea of the Midwest itself. Barnstorming the Prairies offers a panoramic vista of the transformative nature and power of the aerial vision that remade the Midwest in the wake of the airplane. This new perspective from above enabled Americans to conceptualize the region as something other than isolated and unchanging, and to see it instead as a dynamic space where people worked to harmonize the core traditions of America s agrarian character with the more abstract forms of twentieth-century modernity. In the maps and aerial survey photography of the Midwest, as well as the painting, cinema, animation, and suburban landscapes that arose through flight, Weems also finds a different and provocative view of modernity in the making. In representations of the Midwest, from Grant Wood s iconic images to the Prairie style of Frank Lloyd Wright to the design of greenbelt suburbs, Weems reveals aerial vision s fundamental contribution to regional identity to Midwesternness as we understand it. Reading comparatively across these images, Weems explores how the cognitive and perceptual practices of aerial vision helped to resymbolize the Midwestern landscape amid the technological change and social uncertainty of the early twentieth century.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=zyt0DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Abigail Adams: Witness to a Revolution","description":"Abigail Adams was an extraordinary woman who witnessed the gathering storm of the American Revolution and saw the battle of Bunker Hill from a hilltop near her home.

From George Orwell's Jura, where he wrote '1984', to the beautiful (but slowly sinking) Maldives in the Indian Ocean, this is a book about some of the most curious and evocative places on earth. And over every island falls the shadow of Crusoe, persuading us that islands are more liberating than confining, more contemplative than lonely, more holy than barbaric . . .","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=M4dZHQAACAAJ&dq=Islomania&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Utah Ghost Rails","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=tdMTAQAACAAJ&dq=Utah+Ghost+Rails&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Treasure of Stonewycke (The Stonewycke Legacy, Book 3)","description":"Allison and Logan Macintyre's marriage has flourished in the intervening years since World War II.

It's in that place that Deborah Meier has been working all these years. Her voice conveys a life of struggle in the front lines-victories and losses, hopes and disappointments. . . . It's a voice our nation needs to hear. --Jonathan Kozol, from the Foreword Acclaimed educator Deborah Meier offers a fresh take on standardized tests. While others have criticized standards and what they measure, Meier rejects the very idea of a centralized authority that dictates how and what teachers teach. Standardization, she argues, prevents citizens-including teachers-from emerging as thoughtful, responsible adults, seriously engaged with shaping their own schools, classrooms, and communities. As a result, young people can't learn from them how to be thoughtful, responsible adults and good citizens, the primary goal of public education in a democracy. The New Democracy Forum is a series of short paperback originals exploring creative solutions to our most urgent national concerns. \\"A civic treasure. . . .

Gass (Literary Conversations)","description":"Biography -- Literary Criticism--> Conversations with William H. Gass captures the imagination and philosophical acumen of one of America's most important aestheticians, critical theorists, fiction writers, and essayists. From his first major novel, Omensetter's Luck (1966), to his numerous collections of essays and philosophical inquiries, to his controversial novel The Tunnel (1995), Gass (b. 1924) has proved himself a meticulous craftsman. Throughout these interviews, he reveals an aesthetic that combines ideas from sources as disparate as Ludwig Wittgenstein, Rainer Maria Rilke, Gertrude Stein, and Plato. The interviews make clear the unity behind Gass's views is by his own design. Conversations retrace his undergraduate years at Kenyon College and his subsequent philosophical investigation of metaphor at Cornell University. Gass has never strayed from his belief that metaphor is central and fundamental to thought and to aesthetics. In these interviews he reiterates time and again his belief that the ultimate understanding of the relationship of language to the world pivots on one's understanding of metaphor. In interviews, in profiles, and in his own essays, Gass does not hide from questions about his art and personal motivations, no matter how frequently they are asked, nor does he toy with his interviewers. Revealing how he never shies from an intellectual joust, this collection includes a rousing, contentious debate with John Gardner, fellow literary pundit and fiction writer. The distinction of Gass's prose is matched by the clarity and brilliance of the mind behind it. These talks allow an unobstructed view. Anyone interested in Gass's writing will delight in hearing the brutally honest voice of the mind that produced it. Theodore G. Ammon is chair of the philosophy department at Millsaps College in Jackson, Miss. His work has appeared in such publications as Romance Notes, Arachne, College Mathematics, and the Journal of Aesthetic Education.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=fNd92Y_YC30C&dq=Conversations+With+William+H.+Gass+(Literary+Conversations)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Bit Of Heaven From The Soul","description":"This book gives detailed information about spirits and the other side.

In simple but powerful prose, the deeply moving Drama of the Gifted Child showed how parents unconsciously form and deform the emotional lives of their children. Alice Miller's stories about the roots of suffering in childhood resonated with readers, and her book soon became a backlist best seller.In The Truth Will Set You Free Miller returns to the intensely personal tone and themes of her best-loved work. Only by embracing the truth of our past histories can any of us hope to be free of pain in the present, she argues. Miller uses vivid true stories to reveal the perils of early-childhood mistreatment and the dangers of mindless obedience to parental will. Drawing on the latest research on brain development, she shows how spanking and humiliation produce dangerous levels of denial, which leads in turn to emotional blindness and to mental barriers that cut off awareness and the ability to learn new ways of acting. If this cycle repeats itself, the grown child will perpetrate the same abuse on later generations--a message vitally important, especially given the increasing popularity of programs like Tough Love and of \\"child disciplinarians\\" like James Dobson. The Truth Will Set You Free will provoke and inform all readers who want to know Alice Miller's latest thinking on this important subject.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3u7Ew5uzQ2IC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Guns of the Gunfighters, Lawmen, Outlaws & Hollywood Cowboys","description":"These are the guns of legendary lawmen, outlaws, and TV heroes.

The main one lies in their extraordinary interdisciplinarity: anthropologists, folklorists, historians, and more have contributed to build a body of work of extreme variety and consistence. Of course, this also means that the subjects themselves are not easy to assess. In a very general way, we can define witchcraft as a supernatural means to cause harm, death, or misfortune, while magic also belongs to the field of supernatural, or at least esoteric knowledge, but can be used to less dangerous effects (e.g., divination and astrology). In Western civilization, however, the witch hunt has set a very peculiar perspective in which diabolical witchcraft, the invention of the Sabbat, the persecution of many thousands of (mostly) female and (sometimes) male presumed witches gave way to a phenomenon that is fundamentally different from traditional witchcraft. This Special Issue of Religions dedicated to Witchcraft, Demonology, and Magic features nine articles that deal with four different regions of Europe (England, Germany, Hungary, and Italy) between Late Medieval and Modern times in different contexts and social milieus. Far from pretending to offer a complete picture, they focus on some topics that are central to the research in those fields and fit well in the current  cumulative concept of Western witchcraft  that rules out all mono-causality theories, investigating a plurality of causes.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=SsvlDwAAQBAJ&dq=Salt+Power+For+Bringing+Love,+Luck+and+Wealth:+The+Only+Book+In+The+World+On+The+Ritualistic+Uses+Of+Salt%3B+Finbarr+Book+No.+75&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Loop's Progress","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=sEhbAAAAMAAJ&dq=Loop%27s+Progress&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Vanishing Species: Saving the Fish, Sacrificing the Fisherman","description":"The story of the ongoing debate between the New England communities of fishermen, federal regulators, scientists and environmentalists.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=rIzhITav4uEC&dq=Vanishing+Species:+Saving+the+Fish,+Sacrificing+the+Fisherman&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Oracle Dba Survival Guide","description":"This hands-on, step-by-step guide provide the detailed information necessary to run your Oracle database smoothly and efficiently.

First published in 1940, The Man Who Loved Children was rediscovered in 1965 thanks to the poet Randall Jarrell s eloquent introduction (included in this ebook edition), which compares Christina Stead to Leo Tolstoy. Today, it stands as a masterpiece of dysfunctional family life. In a country crippled by the Great Depression, Sam and Henny Pollit have too much too much contempt for one another, too many children, too much strain under endless obligation. Flush with ego and chilling charisma, Sam torments and manipulates his children in an esoteric world of his own imagining. Henny looks on desperately, all too aware of the madness at the root of her husband s behavior. And Louie, the damaged, precocious adolescent girl at the center of their clashes, is the  ugly duckling  whose struggle will transfix contemporary readers. Named one of the best novels of the twentieth century by Newsweek, Stead s semiautobiographical work reads like a Depression-era The Glass Castle. In the New York Times, Jonathan Franzen wrote of this classic,  I carry it in my head the way I carry childhood memories; the scenes are of such precise horror and comedy that I feel I didn t read the book so much as live it.

In this no-holds-barred treatise, Donald Shoup argues that free parking has contributed to auto dependence, rapid urban sprawl, extravagant energy use, and a host of other problems. Planners mandate free parking to alleviate congestion but end up distorting transportation choices, debasing urban design, damaging the economy, and degrading the environment. Ubiquitous free parking helps explain why our cities sprawl on a scale fit more for cars than for people, and why American motor vehicles now consume one-eighth of the world's total oil production. But it doesn't have to be this way. Shoup proposes new ways for cities to regulate parking  namely, charge fair market prices for curb parking, use the resulting revenue to pay for services in the neighborhoods that generate it, and remove zoning requirements for off-street parking. Such measures, according to the Yale-trained economist and UCLA planning professor, will make parking easier and driving less necessary. Join the swelling ranks of Shoupistas by picking up this book today. You'll never look at a parking spot the same way again.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=J_w6DwAAQBAJ&dq=Free+Parking&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"High Performance Concrete (Modern Concrete Technology)","description":"A complete review of the fast-developing topic of high performance concrete (HPC) by one of the leading researchers in the field.

Statements about what is good or bad, fair or unfair, legitimate or illegitimate, express clear beliefs about human existence. The fact that values differ from culture to culture and century to century opens many questions. In The Origin of Values, Raymond Boudon offers empirical, data-based analysis of existing theories about values, while developing his own perspective as to why people accept or reject value statements. Boudon classifies the main theories of value, including those based on firm belief, social or biological factors, and rational or utilitarian attitudes. He discusses the popular and widely influential Rational Choice Model and critiques the postmodernist approach. Boudon investigates why relativism has become so powerful and contrasts it with the naturalism represented by the work of James Q. Wilson on moral sensibility. He follows with a constructive attempt to develop a new theory, beginning with Weber's idea of non-instrumental rationality as the basis for a more complex idea of rationality. Applying Boudon's own and existing theories of value to political issues and social ideas?the end of apartheid, the death penalty, multiculturalism, communitarianism?The Origin of Values is a significant work. Boudon fulfills a major task of social science: explanation of collective belief. His book will be of interest to sociologists, philosophers, psychologists, and political scientists.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=puWoswEACAAJ&dq=The+Origin+of+Values:+Sociology+and+Philosophy+of+Beliefs&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hawaiian Petroglyphs (Bernice P.

Here is the first combat history of the war in Europe in the words of the men themselves, and perhaps the most honest and brutal account of combat possible on the printed page. For more than fifty years the individual stories that make up this narrative -- shockingly frank reflections of sacrifice and courage -- have been bottled up, buried, or circulated privately. Now, nearing the ends of their lives, our WWII soldiers have at last unburdened themselves. Beyond Valor recaptures their hidden history. A pioneering oral historian, Patrick O'Donnell used his award-winning website, The Drop Zone, to solicit oral- and \\"e-histories\\" from individual soldiers. Gradually, working from within the community, O'Donnell convinced some of the war's most battle-hardened soldiers to tell their stories. The result is WWII seen through the eyes of the men who saw the most intense of its action. O'Donnell focuses on the elite units of the war -- the Rangers, Airborne, and 1st Special Service Force -- troops that spearheaded the most dangerous operations and often made the difference between victory and defeat. From more than 650 interviews O'Donnell has chosen oral- and e-histories that form a seamless story line, a pointillistic history of the war in Europe from the first parachute drops in North Africa through the final battles in Germany and the long trip home. It is the story of the war not discussed in polite company. O'Donnell presents the wreckage of entire battalions nearly annihilated, invisible personal scars, and haunting revelations of wartime atrocities. But more important are the men who recount lives risked without hesitation for comrades and cause, and those who did not return: the friends who died in their arms. Their stories remind all of us that victory came only at the highest price. Remembering the infamous cliffs at Pointe-du-Hoc, bloody Omaha Beach, the bitter fighting at the Battle of the Bulge, and Hill 400 in the H rtgen Forest, the soldiers reveal war as seen, heard, and smelled by the GIs on the front line. Also included is the unique story of the 555th Parachute Infantry Battalion, and the trailblazing African-American \\"Experimental\\" Test Platoon that had to fight its own battle behind the lines. Beyond Valor captures the truths that exist among soldiers. It is one of the most inspiring accounts of the war ever produced.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7RWptKs3lc8C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Superpigs and Wondercorn: The Brave New World of Biotechnology and Where It All May Lead","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=QOkCywEACAAJ&dq=Superpigs+and+Wondercorn:+The+Brave+New+World+of+Biotechnology+and+Where+It+All+May+Lead&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Lives of Birds: The Birds of the World and Their Behavior","description":"Offers a glimpse inside the world of avian behavior at different times of the year, capturing such activities as courting mates, nesting, raising young, preening, feeding, and defending territories.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_8xFAAAAYAAJ&dq=The+Lives+of+Birds:+The+Birds+of+the+World+and+Their+Behavior&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"New York's Bravest","description":"In the 1840s, there was a real vounteer firefighter named Mose Humphreys whose bravery was reknown throughout New York City. Plays about him began being performed on Broadway in 1848 and over the years his strength and heroics took on larger-than-life proportions, much like those of Paul Bunyan. Mary Pope Osborne has honed down the legends about him to a brief, dramatic, sometimes comical, but ultimately moving text of picture book length. Steve Johnson and Lou Fancher s stunning paintings capture this 8-foot-tall superhero rushing into burning buildings, saving babies and bankers, and wolfing down the feasts bestowed upon him by the grateful citizens of old New Yorkuntil the one big hotel fire after which he was never seen again. The author has included a historical note about the origins of this tall tale, and the book is dedicated to the 343 New York City firefighters who gave their lives to save others on September 11, 2001. Mary Pope Osborne included a longer, different version of this legend in her distinguished collection American Tall Tales.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=rXw4DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Joy - Eucharistic Minister","description":"Offers tips and insights on spirituality for Eucharistic Ministers, at the heart of which is love for God and neighbor.

It is the story of numbers so vast, it might take days for one herd of buffalo to pass a particular point on the prairie. It is the story of a harmonious, balanced relationship with Native Americans who revered and even worshiped the huge animals that gave them almost everything they needed to survive. And it is the sad story of how, in as little as twenty-five years, reckless and wasteful slaughter at the hands of newly-arrived settlers drove the buffalo to the very brink of extinction. But luckily the story has a somewhat happy ending. The destruction was halted and the number of buffalo has risen again, although the days when a stampeding herd made a sound like thunder on the plains are probably gone forever.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=GUWKPwAACAAJ&dq=Thunder+on+the+Plains:+The+Story+of+the+American+Buffalo&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Reformed Worship","description":"Twenty-six liturgies, including historical introductions that provide fresh analysis into their origins, are invaluable tools for pastors and worship leaders as they seek to craft public worship services in the great tradition of the early Reformers. The structure of the liturgies, language, and rhythm continue to communicate the gospel in word and sacrament today. They provide a deep sense of Gods call to worship and an appreciation for the Reformers as, first and foremost, men who wanted to help Gods people worship. This book will also be of great interest to theological scholars and students who wish to understand early Reformation leaders. A useful tool for individuals, Reformation Worship, can be used as a powerful devotional to guide daily prayer and reflection. Christians learn to worship from the generations of God's people who have worshipped before them. We sing psalms, because thousands of years ago, God's people sang them. Five hundred years ago, the leaders of the Reformation transformed Christian worship by encouraging the active participation and understanding of the individual worshiper. Christian worship today is built on this foundation. Jonathan Gibson and Mark Earngey have made worship resources from the Reformation era accessible by compiling the most comprehensive collection of liturgies from that era into newly translated modern English from the original German, Dutch, French, Latin, and early English. By providing a connection to Reformation worship, Gibson and Earngey hope that through their work readers will experience what John Calvin described to be the purpose of all church worship: To what end is the preaching of the Word, the sacraments, the holy congregations themselves, and indeed the whole external government of the church, except th","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=QpDNswEACAAJ&dq=Reformed+Worship&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Macmillan Visual Dictionary (Unabridged Compact Edition)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=1JKIwwEACAAJ&dq=The+Macmillan+Visual+Dictionary+(Unabridged+Compact+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"READY READERS, STAGE 1, BOOK 50, LET'S GO MARCHING, SINGLE COPY (Celebration Press Ready Readers)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Mainsprings of civilization (A Mentor book)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=EmwGzgEACAAJ&dq=Mainsprings+of+civilization+(A+Mentor+book)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Stops on the Way to Eden and Beyond","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=MH7xAAAACAAJ&dq=Stops+on+the+Way+to+Eden+and+Beyond&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Irish Hunger: Personal Reflections on the Legacy of the Famine","description":"In Irish Hunger, renowned Irish and Irish-American contributors-actors and activists, poets and journalists, politician and historian-offer moving commentaries and modern perspectives on the events of such tragic proportions that it continues to shape the Irish psyche on both sides of the Atlantic.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6gdaPQAACAAJ&dq=Irish+Hunger:+Personal+Reflections+on+the+Legacy+of+the+Famine&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament: Based on Semantic Domains (2 Volume Set)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=4bGAPgAACAAJ&dq=Greek-English+Lexicon+of+the+New+Testament:+Based+on+Semantic+Domains+(2+Volume+Set)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Archko volume =: Or, The archeological writings of the Sanhedrim and Talmuds of the Jews (intra secus).

This easy-to-understand, down-to-earth book moves beyond parenting theories and techniques to get to the heart of parenting. If parents know how to look within their hearts to find the answers they need, parenting techniques are not necessary. If parents know how to find a loving connection with their children at most times, discipline and consequences are rarely necessary. All parents have it within them to bring out the best in their children. Approaching parents in this way makes parenting a true pleasure instead of the battle and chore it often becomes. Many so-called experts say that raising kids is the toughest job any of us will ever do, but it does not have to be that way. It can be the most joyful thing any of us will ever do. \\"Parenting from the Heart\\" is a must resource for anyone who cares about parenting and raising children.

So it was with some suspicion that the shy, sweet, San Francisco heiress woke one morning with a tall, dark, dangerously handsome husband she couldn't recall marrying. Lydia had lost her memory, and was desperate to discover if there was truly a love to remember. For as she looked at Nathan Hunter's lean, muscular frame, she longed to abandon herself to the sensual stranger, and believe if only for a little while that the possessive passion in his smoky gray eyes was really for her. Business and pleasure weren't supposed to mix, but in this case Nathan Hunter was willing to make an exception. After all, it was in his best interests to keep his new bride's mind off the secrets of her past and her hatred for him. Keeping focused on his goals proved difficult as Lydia's sweet surrender wove a seductive spell around Nathan's heart, arousing emotions he had thought forever buried. But past transgressions have a way of catching up to the future. When Nathan's former friend and rival, Brigham More, seemingly returns from the dead, he stands to ruin Lydia and Nathan by unleashing an unspeakable secret.

The book is presented in the form of an ongoing dialogue between a new principal and his experienced, female mentor to illustrate the use of these frames in practical onsite situations. The four subsequent chapters are each built around a specific challenge facing the new principal. For each problem, the mentor uses ideas from one of the frames to help the beginning principal understand the situation and respond appropriately. Chapters 6 and 7 show how all four frames can be applied to the same issue--to create a Total Quality Management program and to understand ethics in school leadership. In the final chapter, the principal becomes a mentor to another generation of school leaders. The epilogue recaps the book's lessons: (1) map the school politics and follow the map; (2) empower your people; (3) align the structure with the job at hand; (4) celebrate your culture; and (5) reframe (use multiple perspectives to understand the situation).

Known as the First Patriarch, Bodhidharma brought Zen from South India into China in 500 CE, changing the country forever. In Tracking Bodhidharma, Andrew Ferguson recreates the path of Bodhidharma, traveling through China to the places where the First Patriarch lived and taught. This sacred trail takes Ferguson deep into ancient China, and allows him to explore the origins of Chan [Zen] Buddhism, the cultural aftermath that Bodhidharma left in his wake, and the stories of a man who shaped a civilization. Tracking Bodhidharma offers a previously unheard perspective on the life of Zen's most important religious leader, while simultaneously showing how that history is relevant to the rapidly developing superpower that is presentday China. By placing Zen Buddhism within the country's political landscape, Ferguson presents the religion as a counterpoint to other Buddhist sects, a catalyst for some of the most revolutionary moments in China's history, and as the ancient spiritual core of a country that is every day becoming more an emblem of the modern era.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Dt0REAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Casket and the Sword","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=XIo_AQAAIAAJ&dq=The+Casket+and+the+Sword&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Almost Home","description":"Newbery Honor winner Joan Bauer's new novel will touch your heart When twelve-year-old Sugar's grandfather dies and her gambling father takes off yet again, Sugar and her mother lose their home in Missouri.

Sherry Ortner is the first to integrate social scientific and historical modes of analysis in a study of the Sherpa monasteries and one of the very few to attempt such an account for Buddhist monasteries anywhere. Combining ethnographic and oral-historical methods, she scrutinizes the interplay of political and cultural factors in the events culminating in the foundings. Her work constitutes a major advance both in our knowledge of Sherpa Buddhism and in the integration of anthropological and historical modes of analysis. At the theoretical level, the book contributes to an emerging theory of \\"practice,\\" an explanation of the relationship between human intentions and actions on the one hand, and the structures of society and culture that emerge from and feed back upon those intentions and actions on the other. It will appeal not only to the increasing number of anthropologists working on similar problems but also to historians anxious to discover what anthropology has to offer to historical analysis. In addition, it will be essential reading for those interested in Nepal, Tibet, the Sherpa, or Buddhism in general.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Pc3xDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Best Test Preparation for the AP United States History Test Preparations)","description":"PREMIUM PRACTICE FOR A PERFECT 5 WITH THE MOST PRACTICE ON THE MARKET!

In Japan, the generic term for these kinds of impurities is kegare and death impurity, a sub-type of kegare, is known as shi-e. The major topic of this book is death impurity. The definition and genesis of shi-e are explained. In addition, details of the influence shi-e had on ancient Japanese society as well as its continuing influence on modern Japanese society are given. Three hypotheses are stated and supported: (1) the shi-e concept began in Japan during the Yayoi period (300 BC - 300 AD) rather than at a later date as previously hypothesized; (2) the basis for the aversion to dead bodies, i.e. shi-e, is that corpses remind people of the fact that they will soon die; (3) Buddhism and Shintoism merged in Japan because of the impact of shi-e on Shintoism.

We are really enthusiastic about working with it. From their experiences from very different customers with very different requirements to their Windows infrastructure environment, they have gained a tremendous deal of experience and in-depth knowledge with Remote Installation Services that other people can benefit from. This includes basic understanding, a lot of theory and best-practices, but also how you can stretch Remote Installation Services to really do what any system or network administrator would require. This information is essential for anyone wishing to implement Remote Installation Services and use the advanced features and tools it contains.

This edition is an exact facsimile of the original, featuring delightful period art and several enlightening personal letters from the author, Raymond Bernard, Ph.D to Barker - rare correspondence not found in other editions. In these pages, Bernard claims that flying saucers not only exist, but that they are the vehicles of a super-race that lives in a huge, underground world, whose entrance is at the earth's north and south poles. In essence, the earth is really a fat donut, with little holes at the top and bottom. The seawater and geographical forms stays in place as the surface of the donut curves inward and upside down, held in place by gravity. (Not so kooky when you think about it.) These \\"extraterrestrials\\" are actually our ancestors, and they are from the Inner Earth or Agharta. Admiral Byrd's epic 1700-mile flight into the North Polar opening startled those privy to the information, leading to an official naval \\"hush up\\" of anyone knowing the truth. Those who \\"know too much\\" about flying saucers have been targeted ever since.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=MSJVjwEACAAJ&dq=The+Hollow+Earth+The+Greatest+Geographical+Discovery+in+History&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"WWII Quiz and Fact Book","description":"When was the last time someone around you brought up World War Two?

It includes an introduction to the history and philosophy of the Ri-me movement; a biography of the movement's leader, the meditation master and philosopher known as Jamg?n Kongtrul the Great; helpful summaries of the eight lineages' practice-and-study systems, which point out the different emphases of the schools; an explanation of the most hotly disputed concepts; and an overview of the old and new tantras. Jamg?n Kongtrul the Great (18131899) is a giant in Tibetan history, renowned for his scholarly and meditative achievements, but also for his energetic yet evenhanded work to unify and strengthen the different lineages of Buddhism. The Ri-me movement, led by Kongtrul and several other leading scholars of the time, was a unifying effort to cut through interscholastic divisions and disputes that were occurring between the different lineages. These leaders sought appreciation of the differences and acknowledgment of the importance of variety in benefiting practitioners with different needs. The Ri-me teachers also took great care that the teachings and practices of the different schools and lineages, and their unique styles, did not become confused with one another. This lucid survey of the Ri-me movement will be of interest to serious scholars and practitioners of Tibetan Buddhism.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=p8l0Qwl9gdcC&dq=The+Ri-me+Philosophy+of+Jamgon+Kongtrul+the+Great:+A+Study+of+the+Buddhist+Lineages+of+Tibet&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Internet Today","description":"For undergraduate courses on the Internet.

Students planning to attend college take the SAT II: Math Level IC Subject Test for one of two reasons: (1) Because it is an admission requirement of the college or university to which they are applying; OR (2) To demonstrate proficiency in Mathematics. The SAT II: Math Level IC exam is designed for students who have taken more than three years of college preparatory mathematics (two years of algebra and one year of geometry). Who Administers The Test? The SAT II: Math Level IC Subject Test is developed by the College Board and administered by Educational Testing Service (ETS). The test development process involves the assistance of educators throughout the country, and is designed and implemented to ensure that the content and difficulty level of the test are appropriate. When Should the SAT II: Math Level IC be Taken? If you are applying to a college that requires Subject Test scores as part of the admissions process, you should take the SAT II: Math Level IC Subject Test by November or January of your senior year. If your scores are being used only for placement purposes, you may be able to take the test in the spring. For more information, be sure to contact the colleges to which you are applying. When and Where is the Test Given? The SAT II: Math Level IC Subject Test is administered five times a year at many locations throughout the country; mostly high schools. The test is given in November, December, January, May, and June. To receive information on upcoming administrations of the exam, consult the publication Taking the SAT II: Subject Tests, which may be obtained from your guidance counselor or by contacting: College Board SAT Program P.O.

Consult the publication Taking the SAT II: Subject Tests for information on the fee structure. Financial assistance may be granted in certain situations. To find out if you qualify and to register for assistance, contact your academic advisor. What Kind of Calculator Can I Use? Your calculator should be, at the minimum, a scientific calculator. It can be programmable or non-programmable. Bear in mind, however, that for perhaps 60 percent of the test items, the calculator will afford you no advantage and, moreover, may actually work against you. No pocket organizers, hand-held minicomputers, paper tape, or noisy calculators may be used. In addition, no calculator requiring an external power source will be allowed. Finally, no sharing of calculators will be permitted - you must bring your own. Make sure you are thoroughly familiar with the operation of your calculator before the test. Your performance on the test could suffer if you spend too much time searching for the correct function on your calculator. HOW TO USE THIS BOOK What Do I Study First?

Neither an Appalachian hamlet nor a company town, Kingsport developed as a self-proclaimed \\"All-American City.\\" Produced by the marriage of New South philosophy and Progressivism, born of a passing historical moment when capitalists turned their attention to Southern Appalachia, and nurtured by the Protestant work ethic, Kingsport today reflects its heritage. From flaunting its patriotism with grandiose Fourth of July parades to being defensive about its pollution, the city exhibits values almost stereotypically those of middle-class America. But loss of vision and a decline in the quality of leadership plague contemporary Kingsport, and, like other American industrial strongholds, it is buffeted by the winds of the high-tech revolution and the changing world economy. This first full-length biography of Kingsport challenges interpretations of regional history that promote the colonial and poverty models. Margaret Ripley Wolfe brings to it the advantage of an insider's perspective. In considering the special roles of capital, labor, industry, and government over seven decades, she neither patronizes Appalachian workers nor treats developers and industrialists as villains. Her book will interest scholars of urbanization, city planning, landscape architecture, and industrialization, as well as local history enthusiasts.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=G-QzEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Scarlet Riders","description":"This engaging collection of verse captures the history and experience of the Mounties from the 1800s to the present day.

For example, readers will learn about the pronghorn antelope's supercharged cardiovascular system, a brine shrimp-powered shorebird that each year flies nonstop from the Great Salt Lake to Central Argentina, and a rare mustard plant recently discovered on Mount Ogden. Emphasizing how increasing loss and degradation of habitat hinders native species' survival, Mark Gerard Hengesbaugh discusses what is happening to wildlife and wild places and what is being done about it. Well illustrated, this book has habitat maps, pen-and-ink illustrations, and fifty photos of wildlife and wild places selected by photo editor Dan Miller.

It shows how such errors are preventable because they result from defective systems within a company. From real incidents, you will be able to identify common causes of human error and typical system deficiencies that have led to these errors. On a larger scale, you will be able to see where, in the organisational or management systems, failure occurred so that you can avoid them. The book also describes the existence of a 'blame culture' in many organisations, which focuses on individual human error whilst ignoring the system failures that caused it. The book shows how this 'blame culture' has, in the case of a number of past accidents, dominated the accident enquiry process hampering a proper investigation of the underlying causes. Suggestions are made about how progress can be made to develop a more open culture in organisations, both through better understanding of human error by managers and through increased public awareness of the issues. The book brings together documentary evidence from recent major incidents from all around the world and within the Rail, Water, Aviation, Shipping, Chemical and Nuclear industries. Barry Whittingham has worked as a senior manager, design engineer and consultant for the chemical, nuclear, offshore oil and gas, railway and aviation sectors. He developed a career as a safety consultant specializing in the human factors aspects of accident causation. He is a member of the Human Factors in Reliability Group, and a Fellow of the Safety and Reliability Society. * Increases safety by showing how to remove blame and how to develop foolproof safety systems * Draws together documentary evidence of real accidents to demonstrate the different types of human error, and preventative actions * Covers a range of disciplines - occupational psychology, engineering, safety of major installations","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=SaSwqPqTkycC&dq=The+Blame+Machine:+Why+Human+Error+Causes+Accidents&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Research Design and Methods: A Process Approach","description":"\\"We take students through research process, from getting and developing a research idea, to designing and conducting a study, through analyzing and reporting data.

In this bracing study of American sexual culture and the politics of acquaintance rape, anthropologist Peggy Reeves Sanday identifies the sexual stereotypes that continue to obstruct justice and diminish women. Beginning with a harrowing account of the St. John's rape case, Sanday reaches back through British and American landmark rape cases to explain how, with the exception of earliest colonial times, rape has been a crime notable for placing the woman on trial. Whether she is charged as a false accuser, gold digger, loose or scorned woman, stereotypes prevail. American jurisprudence and the public at large remain divided on acquaintance rape. With the passage of the Violence Against Women Act one of the most important legislation for women a new breed of antifeminists stepped up to the plate to subordinate women's bid for sexual autonomy and freedom. A groundbreaking, classic work of scholarship that coherently challenges the anti-rape backlash and its rhetoric, A Woman Scorned continues to bring a broad perspective to our understanding of acquaintance rape, even if its original vision of a new paradigm for female sexual equality awaits implementation.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=KIfYPQal_4MC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dyeing To Quilt : Quick, Direct Dye Methods for Quilt Makers","description":"Teaches methods of dyeing both solid and mottled colors, creating a range of shades between two colors, and working with color formulas and charts, and includes patterns for six original quilt designs","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Y2TZOwAACAAJ&dq=Dyeing+To+Quilt+:+Quick,+Direct+Dye+Methods+for+Quilt+Makers&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"On Becoming Nuyoricans (PB) (Counterpoints: Studies in the Postmodern Theory of Education)","description":"Spanning 25 years of serious writing on hip-hop by noted scholars and mainstream journalists, this comprehensive anthology includes observations and critiques on groundbreaking hip-hop recordings.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=VvYv0Sr05FAC&dq=On+Becoming+Nuyoricans+(PB)+(Counterpoints:+Studies+in+the+Postmodern+Theory+of+Education)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Masculine Desire: The Sexual Politics of Victorian Aestheticism","description":"Beginning with Tennyson's In Memoriam and continuing by way of Hopkins and Swinburne to the novels of Oscar Wilde and Thomas Hardy, Richard Dellamora draws on journals, letters, censored texts, and pornography to examine the cultural construction o","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0DInEnIOGJoC&dq=Masculine+Desire:+The+Sexual+Politics+of+Victorian+Aestheticism&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Daring to be Different: 25 Tips for A Life of Success","description":"I first wrote this book when I was 18 years old.

Through extensive interviews with residents as well as Dr. Mills, his staff and other professionals, a very compelling and moving portrait is painted of how two low-income, inner-city housing projects replete with violence, crack, drug gangs, abuse, welfare dependency and hopelessness were completely turned around within two-and-a-half years. This book shows how people who lived in the most difficult circumstances were reached, came to find hope and changed their lives. \\"In all my years in prevention I have never seen this level of change in people \\" It is a truly inspirational story. The lives of people on whom society has given up were completely turned around. At the same time it is a sociological study. It shows how a new and different inside-out, spiritual paradigm, which on the surface seems too simple and backwards to possibly work in such overwhelming conditions, can produce incredible results and create changes in people's lives that stand head and shoulders above the traditional outside-in paradigm for prevention, human services, social work, community development and education. It has vast implications for improving humanity's social ills. About the Author: Jack Pransky, Ph.D. is founder/director of the Center for Inside-Out Understanding. He authored the books, \\"Somebody Should Have Told Us : Simple Truths for Living Well, Parenting from the Heart, Prevention from the Inside-Out; Prevention: The Critical Need\\" and co-authored \\"Healthy Thinking/ Feeling/Doing from the Inside-Out\\" prevention curriculum for middle school students. Pransky has worked in the field of prevention since 1968 in a wide variety of capacities and now provides consultation, training, counseling and coaching from the inside-out, throughout the U.S. and internationally. He is also cofounder/director of the nonprofit consulting organization, Prevention Unlimited, which created the Spirituality of Prevention Conference.

John Foley here examines the artistic implications that oral tradition holds for the understanding of the Iliad and Odyssey in order to establish a context for their original performance and modern-day reception. In Homer's Traditional Art, Foley addresses three crucially interlocking areas that lead us to a fuller appreciation of the Homeric poems. He first explores the reality of Homer as their actual author, examining historical and comparative evidence to propose that \\"Homer\\" is a legendary and anthropomorphic figure rather than a real-life author. He next presents the poetic tradition as a specialized and highly resonant language bristling with idiomatic implication. Finally, he looks at Homer's overall artistic achievement, showing that it is best evaluated via a poetics aimed specifically at works that emerge from oral tradition. Along the way, Foley offers new perspectives on such topics as characterization and personal interaction in the epics, the nature of Penelope's heroism, the implications of feasting and lament, and the problematic ending of the Odyssey. His comparative references to the South Slavic oral epic open up new vistas on Homer's language, narrative patterning, and identity. Homer's Traditional Art represents a disentangling of the interwoven strands of orality, textuality, and verbal art. It shows how we can learn to appreciate how Homer's art succeeds not in spite of the oral tradition in which it was composed but rather through its unique agency.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-MlWCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"L.

By examining a broad range of theories about trade's impact on interstate relations and undertaking a set of empirical analyses of the trade-conflict puzzle, Katherine Barbieri provides a comprehensive assessment of the liberal view that trade promotes peace. Barbieri's stunning conclusions depart from conventional wisdom in international relations. Consequently, The Liberal Illusion serves as an important counterargument and a warning call to policymakers who rely upon trade-based strategies to promote peace, strategies that appear to offer little hope of achieving their goals.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=GrGVzNiJgSwC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Next Generation Real Estate","description":"Die Digitalisierungswelle hat die Immobilienbranche erfasst und kaum ein Bereich wird davon unber hrt bleiben.

In the early 1900s, social reform seemed to offer a veritable religion of redemption, but by the century's end, while socialism remained a vibrant force in European society, a culture of extreme individualism and consumption all but squeezed the welfare state out of existence. Documenting this historic change, After Progress: European Socialism and American Social Reform in the 20th Century is the first truly comprehensive look at the course of social reform and Western politics after Communism, brilliantly explained by a major social thinker of our time. Norman Birnbaum traces in fascinating detail the forces that have shifted social concern over the course of a century, from the devastation of two world wars, to the post-war golden age of economic growth and democracy, to the ever-increasing dominance of the market. He makes sense of the historical trends that have created a climate in which politicians proclaim the arrival of a new historical epoch but rarely offer solutions to social problems that get beyond cost-benefit analyses. Birnbaum goes one step further and proposes a strategy for bringing the market back into balance with the social needs of the people. He advocates a reconsideration of the notion of work, urges that market forces be brought under political control, and stresses the need for education that teaches the rights and responsibilities of citizenship. Both a sweeping historical survey and a sharp-edged commentary on current political posturing, After Progress examines the state of social reform past, present and future.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=eM_QCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dangerous Company: The Consulting Powerhouses and the Businesses They Save and Ruin","description":"Reveals the enormous power exercised by the biggest, most secretive firms in the consulting industry, detailing their successes and failures","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=g1K1AAAAIAAJ&dq=Dangerous+Company:+The+Consulting+Powerhouses+and+the+Businesses+They+Save+and+Ruin&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Barbarian in Asia","description":"A wild journey to the East narrated by a writer who is  without equal in the literature of our time  (Jorge Luis Borges) Henri Michaux (18991984), the great French poet and painter, set out as a young man to see the Far East.

It was so much better than any other USAF fighter at the time that Air Force generals were happy to comply with the US government's 'commonality' policy and purchase a naval aircraft. As an interceptor it was superior to the existing F-106A Delta Dart and it combined outstanding fighter characteristics with the ability to carry more ordnance than many WW II bombers and offered the possibility of a sophisticated reconnaissance variant. McDonnell had provided the USAF with both fighter-bomber and reconnaissance versions of its successful F-101 Voodoo and the Phantom offered the same twin-engined reliability, sturdy engineering and reliability but with the clear advantage of multiple missile armament and long-range radar. Its introduction to USAF squadrons happened just in time for the Vietnam conflict where USAF F-4Cs took over MiG-fighting duties from the F-100 Super Sabre, freeing it and the F-105 Thunderchief to fly attack sorties instead. Although the F-4 was never intended as a dog-fighter to tangle with light, nimble, gun-armed MiGs it was responsible for destroying 109 MiGs in aerial combat. More often, Phantoms deterred MiGs from attacking US bombers, or delivered ordnance themselves. Reconnaissance RF-4Cs replaced RF-101C Voodoos, offering far more advanced data-gathering devices. Elsewhere, F-4C and F-4D Phantoms re-equipped Tactical Air Command squadrons in Europe, Japan and the USA and they were joined by later models. In Vietnam numerous MiGs had also been destroyed by gun-armed F-105 and F-8 fighters and even by Phantoms with 'strap-on' gun-pods, lending weight to the argument that the Phantom should also have an internal gun. In its original naval interceptor role this had been considered unnecessary but the USAF sponsored development of the F-4E with the same built-in gun as the F-105 in addition to its existing missiles and other ordnance. In the early 1970s further funding added wing slats to improve the F-4E's manoeuvrability, an updated cockpit and a television-based, long-range visual sighting system to identify possible enemy aircraft. USAF Phantoms also took over the nuclear alert role combining this with air defence or conventional ordnance delivery as required. For a very different scenario some F-4Es were modified as replacements for the F-105G Wild Weasel. With sophisticated radar detection equipment and anti-radiation missiles these F-4Gs were still in service in 1991 and they provided invaluable service during Operation Desert Storm, as did the remaining RF-4C reconnaissance Phantoms. At the end of their careers many of the survivors from the 3,380 'land-based' Phantoms were converted into target drones for training purposes. Others were passed on to Air National Guard or Reserve units before becoming drones or joining five air forces in other countries. New aircraft were also built for West Germany, Iran and Israel while 140 F-4EJs were assembled or entirely built under licence in Japan. With the Israeli Air Force F-4s achieved notable success in combat. The USAF's experience with the Phantom showed clearly that the air-to-air fighter was still a necessity and its decision to fund its successor, the McDonnell-Douglas F-15 Eagle (as well as the F-16 Fighting Falcon and F-22A Raptor) was heavily influenced by the lessons of US and other Phantom pilots in combat.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Pr5mswEACAAJ&dq=McDonnell+Douglas+F-4+Phantom+II&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Word became flesh.","description":"This updated classic contains 364 daily devotionals revolving around \\"And the Word became flesh\\" (John 1:14) and its meaning for a transformed life.

The task of the Christian, writes Tony Campolo, is not to worship nature, but to join with nature in worshiping God. \\"Being concerned about the environment is a biblically mandated command, and acting to rescue creation ... is a Christian obligation,\\" Campolo says. Using the Bible and other Christian writings, Campolo builds a case for Christian environmentalism. He calls upon Christians to work for a \\"peaceable kingdom\\" of ecological harmony. \\"What must be made clear is that each of us has a responsibility to do something about our polluted and trashed creation right now. In anticipation of His coming, we must go to work today and contribute to the work which He will complete on the day of His coming.\\" The consequences of Christian inaction are devastating. Few realize, for example, that more than half of all remedies in our pharmacies come from plants grown in tropical rain forests, rapidly being destroyed. So what can Christians who want to rescue the earth do? Plenty. Campolo outlines a practical way for churches and individuals to tackle environmental issues. He recommends taking an \\"environmental audit\\" to measure each church's response to conservation. He suggests turning church camps into ecological camps. And rather than membership pledges that stress only personal morality, he proposes a new covenant that includes commitment to environmental responsibility. Campolo also identifies key Christian outreach organizations that work to preserve the environment.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=YoJFAAAACAAJ&dq=How+to+Rescue+the+Earth+-+Without+Worshipping+Nature&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Magnolia Ball: A Southern Novel","description":"It's time to select the young ladies of Dorchester County, South Carolina, who will make their debuts to society in 1991.

The last thing his foggy perceptions recollected from his fragmented memory was finishing a supper at the CafA(c) Escoffier.

Hazily, he recalled small knots of people pressing upon him to shake his hand, bits and pieces of his eloquent speech on computer programming, a hazy surrealistic glut of out-of-sync chaos and sensory flashbacks. He was gripped by the stark terror of three unmistakable fears.

The SAT II: Math Level IC exam is designed for students who have taken more than three years of college preparatory mathematics (two years of algebra and one year of geometry). Who Administers The Test? The SAT II: Math Level IC Subject Test is developed by the College Board and administered by Educational Testing Service (ETS). The test development process involves the assistance of educators throughout the country, and is designed and implemented to ensure that the content and difficulty level of the test are appropriate. When Should the SAT II: Math Level IC be Taken? If you are applying to a college that requires Subject Test scores as part of the admissions process, you should take the SAT II: Math Level IC Subject Test by November or January of your senior year.

Bear in mind, however, that for perhaps 60 percent of the test items, the calculator will afford you no advantage and, moreover, may actually work against you. No pocket organizers, hand-held minicomputers, paper tape, or noisy calculators may be used. In addition, no calculator requiring an external power source will be allowed. Finally, no sharing of calculators will be permitted - you must bring your own. Make sure you are thoroughly familiar with the operation of your calculator before the test. Your performance on the test could suffer if you spend too much time searching for the correct function on your calculator. HOW TO USE THIS BOOK What Do I Study First?

Using Jane Jacobs' critique of postwar city-building as a starting point, Edmund Fowler shows that recent North American urban development has been characterized by development projects on a massive scale, on indiscriminate use of vast areas of land, and an increasingly evident homogeneity. These are characteristics, he argues, of a perverse and unnatural way of building that is wrecking the planet and enfeebling our social and political networks. In monetary terms this kind of development costs us billions of dollars for transportation, utilities, and other municipal services--the ecological costs are incalculable. Land use patterns have not only helped to undermine community cohesiveness, they have also discouraged block-level democracy and the development of a sense of responsibility for one's locality. Children grow up without proper socialization and contribute to a thriving subculture of vandalism and other street crime. In answering the question of why we began developing cities in this way, Fowler used Toronto as a case study, conducting extensive field work in nineteen areas of the city. He shows not only that postwar building was the result of conscious public policy but goes further, arguing that our cities reflect deep-seated insecurities and cultural malaise in surprisingly direct ways. Tower concludes on a positive note, with many examples of how people have rethought their values and, in cooperation with their neighbours, have organized their physical and social environments on a small, ecologically friendly scale.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=AjHmcrANUgAC&dq=Building+Cities+That+Work&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Landforms and landscapes (Brown foundations of earth science series)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"My Losing Season","description":"NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER ? A deeply affecting coming-of-age memoir about family, love, loss, basketball and life itself by the beloved author of The Prince of Tides and The Great Santini During one unforgettable season as a Citadel cadet, Pat Conroy becomes part of a basketball team that is ultimately destined to fail. And yet for a military kid who grew up on the move, the Bulldogs provide a sanctuary from the cold, abrasive father who dominates his life and a crucible for becoming his own man. With all the drama and incandescence of his bestselling fiction, Conroy re-creates his pivotal senior year as captain of the Citadel Bulldogs. He chronicles the highs and lows of that fateful 196667 season, his tough disciplinarian coach, the joys of winning, and the hard-won lessons of losing. Most of all, he recounts how a group of boys came together as a team, playing a sport that would become a metaphor for a man whose spirit could never be defeated.

For a week, the couple skied every day to the pole, pitched their tent and drifted away from it as they slept.Between his five trips to the pole, Pala used his journalistic skills to peel away the layers of myth surrounding its discovery and capture the untold story of the first men who indisputably stood there.Pala is the first to chronicle the transformation of one of the most remote places on earth into a new Mecca for adventure travelers. Flying in every April on Russian jets, he joined risk-lovers to parachute over it, balloon across it, attain it on skis and scuba-dive under it.But as he discovers, man s presence at the pole is still ephemeral and there is plenty of opportunity to enjoy the escape from ordinary constraints of time and space provided by this breathtakingly gorgeous place that is not a place.Excerpts of the book have appeared in Cond  Nast Traveler, Blue Adventure, Polar Record and other publications.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=NRc7h5gisY8C&dq=The+Oddest+Place+on+Earth:+Rediscovering+the+North+Pole&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Authentic Art Nouveau Lettering and Design in Full Color","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=z4NuQgAACAAJ&dq=Authentic+Art+Nouveau+Lettering+and+Design+in+Full+Color&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The gladiator","description":"He won his fame and his freedom in the gory pits of Rome's Colosseum.

Stating that it is impossible to split a cube into two cubes, or a fourth power into two fourth powers, or any higher power into two like powers, but not leaving behind the marvelous proof he claimed to have had, Fermat prompted three and a half centuries of mathematical inquiry which culminated only recently with the proof of the theorem by Andrew Wiles. This book offers the first serious treatment of Fermat's Last Theorem since Wiles's proof. It is based on a series of lectures given by the author to celebrate Wiles's achievement, with each chapter explaining a separate area of number theory as it pertains to Fermat's Last Theorem. Together, they provide a concise history of the theorem as well as a brief discussion of Wiles's proof and its implications. Requiring little more than one year of university mathematics and some interest in formulas, this overview provides many useful tips and cites numerous references for those who desire more mathematical detail. The book's most distinctive feature is its easy-to-read, humorous style, complete with examples, anecdotes, and some of the lesser-known mathematics underlying the newly discovered proof. In the author's own words, the book deals with \\"serious mathematics without being too serious about it.\\" Alf van der Poorten demystifies mathematical research, offers an intuitive approach to the subject-loosely suggesting various definitions and unexplained facts-and invites the reader to fill in the missing links in some of the mathematical claims. Entertaining, controversial, even outrageous, this book not only tells us why, in all likelihood, Fermat did not have the proof for his last theorem, it also takes us through historical attempts to crack the theorem, the prizes that were offered along the way, and the consequent motivation for the development of other areas of mathematics. Notes on Fermat's Last Theorem is invaluable for students of mathematics, and of real interest to those in the physical sciences, engineering, and computer sciences-indeed for anyone who craves a glimpse at this fascinating piece of mathematical history. An exciting introduction to modern number theory as reflected by the history of Fermat's Last Theorem This book displays the unique talents of author Alf van der Poorten in mathematical exposition for mathematicians. Here, mathematics' most famous question and the ideas underlying its recent solution are presented in a way that appeals to the imagination and leads the reader through related areas of number theory. The first book to focus on Fermat's Last Theorem since Andrew Wiles presented his celebrated proof, Notes on Fermat's Last Theorem surveys 350 years of mathematical history in an amusing and intriguing collection of tidbits, anecdotes, footnotes, exercises, references, illustrations, and more. Proving that mathematics can make for lively reading as well as intriguing thought, this thoroughly accessible treatment Helps students and professionals develop a background in number theory and provides introductions to the various fields of theory that are touched upon * Offers insight into the exciting world of mathematical research * Covers a number of areas appropriate for classroom use * Assumes only one year of university mathematics background even for the more advanced topics * Explains why Fermat surely did not have the proof to his theorem * Examines the efforts of mathematicians over the centuries to solve the problem * Shows how the pursuit of the theorem contributed to the greater development of mathematics","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=vg7vAAAAMAAJ&dq=Notes+on+Fermat%27s+Last+Theorem+(Canadian+Mathematical+Society+Series+of+Monographs+and+Advanced+Texts)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Real Life, Here I Come!: A Survival Guide to the World After Graduation","description":"Congratulations, graduate!

Thus began their extraordinary journey to Java. Covering 4,162 miles, the small boat was battered by continuous storms, and the men on board suffered crippling illness, near starvation, and attacks by islanders. The journey was one of the greatest achievements in the history of European seafaring and a personal triumph for a man who has been misjudged by history. Captain Bligh's Portable Nightmare reveals Bligh?s great mapmaking skills, used to particular effect while he was exploring with Captain Cook. We discover his guilt over Cook's death at Kealakekua Bay. We learn of the failure of the Bounty expedition and the myths that surround the mutiny led by Lieutenant Fletcher Christian, the trials and retributions that followed Bligh's return to England, his successes as a navigator and as a vice admiral fighting next to Nelson at the Battle of Copenhagen. Combining extensive research with dazzling storytelling, John Toohey tells a gripping tale of seafaring, exploration, and mutiny on the high seas, while also dismissing the black legend of the cruel and foulmouthed Captain William Bligh and reinstating him not just as a man of his times but as a true hero.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=X9osDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The First Commando Knives","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3WmbPQAACAAJ&dq=The+First+Commando+Knives&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Jemima Parry-Jones' Falconry","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=iodKAAAAYAAJ&dq=Jemima+Parry-Jones%27+Falconry&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Merciful God of Prophecy: His Loving Plan for You in the End Times [Large Print]","description":"Through Scripture the preeminent scholar on prophecy reveals that God has a wonderful plan for a new heaven and a new earth, as well as a plan for each individual in the new millennium.

The state tournament was so popular-regularly drawing fifteen thousand fans, more than the boys' tourney-that officials declined a lucrative broadcasting offer from ABC's Wide World of Sports rather than forfeit the Iowa Girls' High School Athletic Union's control of the game. The Only Dance in Iowa chronicles the one-hundred-year history of this Iowa tradition, long a symbol of the state's independence and the people's rural pride. Max McElwain shows how, well before the passage of Title IX in 1972, Iowa six-player girls' basketball was, as Sports Illustrated gushed, \\"a utopia for girls' athletics.\\" He also demonstrates how, ironically enough, the fallout from Title IX in many ways led to six-girl basketball's demise. Through interviews, careful ethnography, and detailed historical analysis, McElwain exposes the intricate political, sociological, and historical dynamics of this cultural phenomenon. His book reveals how six-girl basketball, flourishing with the passionate support of Iowa's small towns, school districts, and media, came to represent the state's strong traditional beliefs and the public school system's determination to maintain its identity in the face of national educational trends. The Only Dance in Iowa is as much a study of this disappearing culture as of the game it claimed as its own. Max McElwain, an assistant professor of communication arts at Wayne State College, is a former sportswriter for several Midwestern newspapers.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=us7Zsy7ksBAC&dq=The+Only+Dance+in+Iowa:+A+History+of+Six-Player+Girls%27+Basketball&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Eight Stories From The Rest Of The Robots","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Dowqi4dI624C&dq=Eight+Stories+From+The+Rest+Of+The+Robots&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How To Open Locks With Improvised Tools: Practical, Non-Destructive Ways Of Getting Back Into Just About Everything When You Lose Your Keys (formerly published as Lock Bypass Methods)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5zkOAAAACAAJ&dq=How+To+Open+Locks+With+Improvised+Tools:+Practical,+Non-Destructive+Ways+Of+Getting+Back+Into+Just+About+Everything+When+You+Lose+Your+Keys+(formerly+published+as+Lock+Bypass+Methods)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Star in the Window","description":"'I've always wanted to be a Star Hunter.

Drawing on 20 years experience in art and architecture, the author has developed this book on model making as it applies to students and professionals of the built environment. More than 300 photographs illustrate a multitude of techniques and the use of a wide variety of materials, providing a solid foundation for students and professionals to create and enjoy three-dimensional model making for interior design, architecture, landscape architecture, furniture design, theatrical design, and retail merchandising.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ZqflQgAACAAJ&dq=Architectural+Modeling&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mixed Feelings; Short Stories","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=qN1QAQAAIAAJ&dq=Mixed+Feelings%3B+Short+Stories&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mobile Location Services: The Definitive Guide","description":"-- Includes case studies based on real world solution deployments with Vicinity, ATX, Ford and Hutchison 3G.-- Insights into differences between solutions for US and European marketplaces.-- Includes a software development kit for building a basic Location Service Solution.Mobile applications must be much smarter than desktop web applications.

He led a long and sometimes eventful life with marital tensions, traveL controversy, crises, even some thoughts of suicide and a period of time as a student in a home for retarded and unmanageable. In addition, there was his search which led him through the culture and arts of West and East, his views of politics and society, of psychology and philosophy. The difference between Hesse and other writers is that virtually every shred and patch of his life was brought into his writing, his fiction particularly. 'He had to write about himself and there is little of what he wrote that is not confessional in form and therapeutic in function.' Autobiography is the very matter of his work. Mileck's contribution is to extend and fill out the evidence of his life, his psychoanalysis, his drive toward self-realization which was the very engine of his being, to show the raw material and thus to invite readers to see how it was transmuted, transfigured, fantasized, poeticized, symbolized.\\"--Los Angeles Times \\"Hesse was a prolific author for some 60 years, and his mind drew everything it contemplated into his private wars between flesh and spirit. objectivity and subjectivity, the longings for society and isolation. No one is better qualified to disentangle this abundance than Mileck, compiler of the huge two-volume Hesse bibliography.

In Black Noise: Rap Music and Black Culture in Contemporary America, Tricia Rose, described by the New York Times as a \\"hip hop theorist,\\" takes a comprehensive look at the lyrics, music, cultures, themes, and styles of this highly rhythmic, rhymed storytelling and grapples with the most salient issues and debates that surround it. Assistant Professor of Africana Studies and History at New York University, Tricia Rose sorts through rap's multiple voices by exploring its underlying urban cultural politics, particularly the influential New York City rap scene, and discusses rap as a unique musical form in which traditional African-based oral traditions fuse with cutting-edge music technologies. Next she takes up rap's racial politics, its sharp criticisms of the police and the government, and the responses of those institutions. Finally, she explores the complex sexual politics of rap, including questions of misogyny, sexual domination, and female rappers' critiques of men. But these debates do not overshadow rappers' own words and thoughts. Rose also closely examines the lyrics and videos for songs by artists such as Public Enemy, KRS-One, Salt N' Pepa, MC Lyte, and L. L. Cool J. and draws on candid interviews with Queen Latifah, music producer Eric \\"Vietnam\\" Sadler, dancer Crazy Legs, and others to paint the full range of rap's political and aesthetic spectrum.

This was followed into service by two much larger and capable carriers in 1927 with five more being built prior to the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor including three large Yorktown class.??To take the offensive against the Japanese Navy, the American Congress funded by far the largest carrier building programme in history based on the Essex class, a larger version of the pre-war Yorktown vessels. Of the twenty-six ordered, fourteen were commissioned in time to see Second World War service. These were joined by many smaller classes of carriers, including light carriers and escort carriers.?Post-war ever larger and more capable carriers were commissioned. Since 1975, when the first of a fleet of ten nuclear-powered Nimitz class carriers was commissioned, they have epitomized United States superpower status and worldwide power projection.

The food of northern Thailand is a world away from the highly refined, royal court- and Chinese-influenced style of cooking in Bangkok--the Thai food that most of us are familiar with. It's a cuisine with its own distinct identity, one that is rustic and earthy, meaty and fragrant; one with roots in the Thai repertoire but with branches that extend into unfamiliar areas; a cuisine that feels ancient, but is ever evolving. A writer, photographer, and travel-guide writer, Austin Bush has lived in Thailand for nearly 20 years. In this book, Bush travels across northern Thailand to talk to the region's home cooks, academics, restaurateurs, writers, and hawkers. Their recipes and stories, along with Bush's photographs, capture the people, countryside, markets, and of course, dishes and cooking techniques of northern Thailand. Each of the chapters in the book will focus on a single province, giving a snapshot of the dishes, staple ingredients, cooking methods, and people specific to that area.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6D9wDwAAQBAJ&dq=Northern+Thailand&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"God Helps Those That Help Themselves","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=VJsCRAAACAAJ&dq=God+Helps+Those+That+Help+Themselves&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The key to German translation ;: The analytical approach to German translation based upon the capitalized noun and eleven major rules","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=7fJ5AAAAIAAJ&dq=The+key+to+German+translation+%3B:+The+analytical+approach+to+German+translation+based+upon+the+capitalized+noun+and+eleven+major+rules&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"TRADEMARK LAW:A PRACTITIONER'S GUIDE","description":"This file contains Trademark law originally written by Siegrun D.

The end of the long war was at last in sight. In the forenoon a regular meeting of the Cabinet was held, at which General Grant was present as a distinguished guest. The victor of Appomattox Court House was a medium-sized, stoop-shouldered, taciturn man, then at the zenith of his military glory. At the White House he met all the members of Lincolns official family, except Secretary of State Seward, who had been the Presidents closest rival at the Chicago Republican convention of 1860. Seward had been thrown from hiscarriage a few days before and was lying at home under the care of physicians. The framework of steel which encased his face and neck, agonizing though it must have been, was destined that night to save his life. Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles was there a kindly looking man with a long white beard, who was gifted with a shrewd insight into the character of men. Thoroughly loyal to his Chief, and with a finely balanced judgment, he kept dose watch on the events of his era and faithfully recorded them in his diary. The President himself seemed in unusually good spirits. Be fore the opening of the formal meeting he spoke freely of his plans for reconciling the conquered South. So far as he was con cerned, he promised, there would be no persecution he even hoped that the fallen leaders of the Confederacy would leave the country and thereby make it unnecessary for him to take direct action against them. He then told of a dream that had come to him during the night, the same that had so often in the past 4 WHY WAS LINCOLN MURDERED presaged a portentous happening. This time he hoped that it foretold the surrender to General Sherman of the last Confeder ate army. As Lincoln was describing his dream, Stanton entered. The President stopped abruptly- Gentlemen, he said, let us proceed to business. Stanton did not often attend Cabinet meetings and, when he came, he usually came late. It was his way of indicating the superiority he felt over his colleagues, if not over Lincoln him self-Gideon Welles distrusted him intensely, considering him an unscrupulous intriguer. He has cunning and skill, the head of the Navy Department once wrote in his diary, dissembles his feelings ... is a hypocrite. .. . 2 Small of stature, with a long beard which he kept perfumed, the Secretary of War had an air of sternness j but Welles always believed that this outward sem blance concealed the heart of a coward. The two Secretaries had crossed swords only once. On that occasion Welles had shown plainly that he would brook no interference in his department, and Stanton had since treated him with an obsequiousness in sharp contrast to his imperious manner toward the other Cabinet members. 3 With Stantons entrance the pleasant flow of informal con versation ceased...","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=fBa-bRGHY3IC&dq=Why+was+Lincoln+murdered%3F&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fashion/Cinema","description":"The moving image has become a key marketing tool for luxury fashion, central in enabling brands to shape their visual codes and extend their brand awareness. Fashion Film is the first detailed study of the shifting shape of fashion imagery in the digital age, investigating the role of the moving image in the promotion, communication and spectacle of contemporary fashion. Combining interdisciplinary analysis of cinema and digital culture, this ground-breaking book traces the emergence of fashion film in the 21st century through its historical roots in pre-digital forms of photography, experimental cinema, mass-media advertising and documentary film-making, right up to today's visual spread of contemporary fashion on video blogs, online magazines and live-streamed catwalk shows. Examining collaborations between fashion designers and pioneering image-makers such as Guy Bourdin, Jean-Paul Goode, William Klein and Nick Knight, the book highlights the critical tension between the fashion film conceived as a creative endeavour and as commercial enterprise. Fashion Film also includes a parallel focus on factual representations of fashion through the recent rise of documentary fashion film that goes behind the scenes to follow the processes and personalities involved in making fashion. Accessible and well-illustrated, Fashion Film will appeal to students and scholars of fashion, film, media, photography, celebrity, sociology and cultural studies.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=gK13DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The City of Ladies (Penguin Great Ideas)","description":"A fascinating insight into the debates and controversies about the position of women in medieval culture, written by France's first professional woman of letters.

They instruct her to build an allegorical city in which womankind can be defended against slander, its walls and towers constructed from examples of female achievement both from her own day and the past: ranging from warriors, inventors, and scholars to prophetesses, artists, and saints. Christine de Pizan's spirited defense of her sex was unique for its direct confrontation of the misogyny of her day and offers a telling insight into the position of women in medieval culture.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=cH_IvbC1VmoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A is for Airplane/A es para avion (Alphabet Books) (Multilingual Edition)","description":"Bright illustrations and simple text, in both English and Spanish, present the twenty-eight letters of the Spanish alphabet.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=H-nRPAAACAAJ&dq=A+is+for+Airplane/A+es+para+avion+(Alphabet+Books)+(Multilingual+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Scarlet Shadows","description":"Scarlet Shadows is a chapbook of meticulously polished poetry describing a journey: from ignorance and pain to insight and hope.

In a house on the Cape  older than the Republic,  Robert MacIver, a historian who long ago played rugby for Scotland, creates a list of rules by which to live out his last days. The most important rule, to  tell a story to its end,  spurs the old Scot on to invent a strange and gripping tale of men in the trenches of the First World War. Drawn from a depth of knowledge and imagination, MacIver conjures the implacable, clear-sighted artist Private Callum; the private s nemesis Sergeant Braddis, with his pincerlike nails; Lieutenant Simon Dodds, who takes on Braddis; and Private Charlie Alston, who is ensnared in this story of inhumanity and betrayal but brings it to a close. This invented tale of the Great War prompts MacIver s own memories of his role in World War II and of Vietnam, where his son, David served. Both the stories and the memories alike are lit by the vivid presence of Margaret, his wife. As Hearts and Minds director Peter Davis writes,  Pouncey has wrought an almost inconceivable amount of beauty from pain, loss, and war, and I think he has been able to do this because every page is imbued with the love story at the heart of his astonishing novel.

You crumble under the weight of your own disappointment. In despair, you cry out to God,  Why don t You do something? I need your help! Will You ever save my husband?  This is the heart-wrenching cry of a Christian woman whose husband doesn t know Christ as his Savior and Lord. A great spiritual gulf separates them. It is difficult to agree on day-to-day decisions, let alone larger questions. Everyday life becomes a lonely and painful existence. Linda Davis lived in this difficult situation for fifteen years as she prayed and waited for her husband to become a Christian.

They have ruled with the slimmest of majorities and yet have transformed the nation s governing priorities. They have strayed dramatically from the moderate middle of public opinion and yet have faced little public backlash. Again and again, they have sided with the affluent and ideologically extreme while paying little heed to the broad majority of Americans. And much more often than not, they have come out on top. This book shows why and why this troubling state of affairs can and must be changed. Written in a highly accessible style by two professional political scientists, Off Center tells the story of a deliberative process restricted and distorted by party chieftains, of unresponsive power brokers subverting the popular will, and of legislation written by and for powerful interests and deliberately designed to mute popular discontent. In the best tradition of engaged social science, Off Center is a powerful and informed critique that points the way toward a stronger foundation for American democracy.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=GT9ZAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Pilgrims at Plymouth (Landmark Books)","description":"A collection of historical Pilgrim stories depicts their voyage across the Atlantic Ocean and their struggle to survive in America.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zIjWAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Pilgrims+at+Plymouth+(Landmark+Books)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Italy from the Air","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=K841PwAACAAJ&dq=Italy+from+the+Air&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Pocket History of Ireland","description":"From prehistoric times to the present day this comprehensive history presents the story of Ireland in bite-size chunks.

Es ampliamente aceptada como la primera autobiograf a occidental jam s escrita, y se convirti  en un modelo para otros autores cristianos de los siguientes siglos. No es una autobiograf a completa, pues fue escrita tras sus primeros 40 a?os de vida y vivi  hasta los 76, tiempo durante el cual produjo otros importantes trabajos, entre ellos La ciudad de Dios. De todos modos, proporciona gran informaci n sobre la evoluci n de su pensamiento en sus primeros a?os. El libro es un acabado trabajo de filosof a y tambi n un importante aporte a la teolog a. La obra est  dividida en 13 libros. En ellos se narra la ni?ez de Agust n, su adolescencia y juventud, su carrera acad mica, su estancia en el manique smo, su proceso personal de acercamiento al cristianismo (ya conocido en la ni?ez), su conversi n, y sus primeras experiencias como cat lico. San Agust n es el mayor fil sofo cristiano y a la vez el padre de la filosof a y de la teolog a cristianas. En gran medida esta primac a la gan  con sus Confesiones.

The necessity for this new mind set is being driven by the situation that a completely new business world, a new reality, is being created at the point where the phenomenon commonly referred to as the \\"new economy\\" converges with the well-known old economy. During the very late 1990s, this new reality was being driven by an almost incredible increase in yields in the financial markets, where conventional but value-driven and stable stocks such as Philip Morris, General Electric, or Bayer, did not attract as many investors as before - if we can call some of them investors at all. Companies in the high-tech or the new market segments are all part of the new economy. This new economy has created new business ideas, business models, and a new reality, in which chief executive officers (CEOs) were in the mid twenties and had basically no clue as to what real business is and how much a dollar counts. Now, as this convergence is happening, the painful reality and the business rules of the old economy get us back down to earth. The CEOs become more senior, business plans are validated more carefully, and just having the famous \\". com\\" in your company name does not get you any further or lead you to any of required money.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=AS7yBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dark Destiny: Proprieters of Fate","description":"In this historical journey, readers will experience the fall of the Roman Empire, the crucifixion of Christ, and the Spanish Inquisition.

In Gather at the River, Crowther extends the wide-angle vision of Southern life presented in his highly acclaimed collection Cathedrals of Kudzu. He cuts to the heart of recent political, religious, and cultural issues but pauses to appreciate the sweet things that the South has to offer, like music, baseball, great writers, and strong women. Some of these essays invite debate. Crowther gives a balanced perspective on the tragedy of the Branch Davidians at Waco, shedding light on a different world of religiosity and revealing urban media prejudices for what they are. He describes the unique heroism of a fallen Marine in the Iraq war, a war fought by one class and promoted by another. And his solution to racial conflict -- interracial procreation -- will jump-start readers' sensibilities. In other chapters, Crowther discusses the grim portrayal of the South in early film and the triumphs of Southern music. His literary essays include appreciations of William Faulkner, Thomas Wolfe, Elizabeth Spencer, and Wendell Berry, and a biting lampoon of exhibitionist memoirs. Among the Southerners Crowther profiles with pride are the art historian and Museum of Modern Art curator Kirk Varnedoe; the great, cursed baseball player Shoeless Joe Jackson; the curmudgeonly realist H. L. Mencken; and the singer Dolly Parton, whose candid artifice inspires the author's litmus test for Southern authenticity.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=DCFfDwAAQBAJ&dq=Gather+at+the+River:+Notes+from+the+Post-Millennial+South+(Southern+Literary+Studies)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hohokam Bones","description":"When a thousand-year-old skeleton with an arrowhead lodged in the back of its skull is uncovered near Tucson, Arizona, smart and sexy archaeologist Emily Harken is called to the scene and becomes obsessed with the ancient murder.
