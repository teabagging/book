Was I ever WRONG!!! Half or less of the book was related to canines, and then often remotely. Many of her works (this is a compendium of essays) are spoiled by her frequent use of the most vile, crude, and vulgar expletives, always unnecessary and adding nothing to the story. Although humorous on the rarest of occasions, this tome consists mainly of the mindless babblings of the typically self-loathing liberal. Unfit even as a chew toy for your pup!"},{"Title":"Patriots and Liberators: Revolution in the Netherlands 1780-1813","review":"I have read most of Simon Schama's published works, and he is one of my favorite historians. His books range from the long to the short, from the survey text to the reseach tome. PATRIOTS AND LIBERATORS is a long research tome. The book contains 750 pages covering the years 1780s-1813 -- a period marked by the rise and fall of the Dutch Republic. A long bibliography and section of endnotes follows the text.Readers of CITIZENS or AN EMBARRASSMENT OF RICHES may not enjoy PATRIOTS quite as much as either of Schama's earlier books because it contains little joy. In CITIZENS, the French Revolution begins on a somewhat inspirational note, and though it is soon followed by a Reign of Terror, the rise of Napoleon restores some hope. In PATRIOTS, Schama continues the tale begun in CITIZENS, but the French Reign of Terror and Napoleon's exploits are viewed from the unhappy perspective of the Dutch.While the French Revolution has sometimes been depicted as colorful, horrendous, and/or chilling, and Napoleons's exploits are often glorified with blue-white-red cockades as well as land and sea battles, the Netherlands knew only deprivation, destruction, and death at the hands of the French. And, although PATRIOTS begins at a time when the Dutch still enjoyed a bit of the prosperity depicted in RICHES, by the battle of Waterloo, economic conditions in the Netherlands were terrible.Napoleon extracted every drop of wealth from every citizen of the Netherlands to finance his military exploits against other European powers. Although the Dutch originally established their own Republican government, it soon became a puppet of Napoleon. In the end, the Republic of the Netherlands was destroyed by the struggles of the European superpowers.If you like history about the Napoleonic era, you will probably enjoy this book. If you are of Dutch descent, and want to gain a little insight into your ancestors experiences of ethnic cleansing and a holocaust during the early 1800s, this book will prove interesting and informative."},{"Title":"Patriots and Liberators: Revolution in the Netherlands 1780-1813","review":"Unless you're an academic and the Napoleonic Wars are one of your subjects, the Netherlands is probably known to you as that progressive, Scandinavian-type little nation that's always ahead of the rest of the world (euthanasia, maternity leave, employer-paid child care, transparency in government, equal pay for women, universal healthcare & post-secondary education, absence of violent crime, etc.); and maybe, some dim memory from high-school/college of the Golden Age, when the Dutch were one of the world's powers. This interesting history by Schama covers the years just before the French Revolution up to Waterloo.The book is extremely detailed with what, at times, I thought was minutia, but Schama has a gift for telling a story. He probably could have written the book in 300 or so pages instead of 650, but he makes the detail interesting, and there isn't that much written about this era of Dutch history. Recommended not only for history fans, but for readers who want to mix in some non-fiction with their usual novels."},{"Title":"Patriots and Liberators: Revolution in the Netherlands 1780-1813","review":"The story of a former world power's decline into relative obscurity, which unfortunately coincided with the French Revolution and Napoleonic wars, this is a difficult but ultimately rewarding book. This was Schama's first book, and I believe it was from his thesis work.The book covers a complicated period and is long enough that there is almost a complete turnover of characters. Add to this my complete unfamiliarity with all the characters, and their difficult (to American) names - Schimmelpennick, van der Capellan tot der Pol - and places - IJ, and IJssell, \`s Hertogenbosh - and I found it pretty rough going at first. It took me nearly 200 pages before I was able to detect themes and remember people.If you want a single theme and ongoing progress, this is not the time or place for you. Most of the story is about false starts, obstruction by individuals and groups intent on keeping their power, and changes in regimes. It bears a superficial resemblance to Revolutionary France (pre-Napoleon), but as Schama points out, this is only superficial. On the other hand if you are the kind of person who thinks you can learn a lot from the apparently unimportant, this is the book for you.The two main lessons I learned from this book was that the change from mostly local powers controlling everything to a national (unitary) government required massive economic stress and (possibly) rule by another country. The other is that despite intense pressure from the French, the Dutch remained Dutch. These are lessons that are still relevant today."},{"Title":"Patriots and Liberators: Revolution in the Netherlands 1780-1813","review":"This book deals with how the Age of Revolutions played out in the Netherlands, whereas I was looking for how Holland seceded from Spanish rule, which I found in the excellent Blom book, and for your information, is as follows:Spain inherited the united (post-Burgundian) Low Countries from Habsburg Austria by royal marriage. It over-taxed the prosperous Low Countries, and suppressed the growing Reformation Protestantism in the North. The northern provinces under William of Orange successfully revolted in the Eighty Years' War of the Sixteenth Century with the help of England and France, who were looking to hurt a hegemonic Spain booming on New World silver.Furthermore, the Blom says the Dutch Golden Age of the Seventeenth Century occurred partly because of the internal problems besetting England and France at the time. Indeed it was the relative decline of the next century that led to the democratic/Enlightenment Patriot Revolution Schama describes that swept away the Dutch ancien regime, prior to Napoleonic annexation lasting till Waterloo (after which the British seized the Cape Colony), which was followed by another union with Belgium (made brief by Belgian resentment at- Dutch domination of the state and at- the authoritarianism of Restoration monarchy), in a United Kingdom of the Netherlands, formed to make a more powerful buttress to France.Bong on, Homes!"},{"Title":"I Will Fear No Evil","review":"As a huge fan of Heinlein's work, I was more than a little dissapointed with 'I Will Fear No Evil.' While many trademark Heinlein-type characters and moments can be found, it was definatley one of his slower moving novels with not much payoff at the end. The premise, though, is intriguing. A wealthy man dies and is still-living brain is placed in a females' body. If you are a fan of Heinlein and know what to expect from him, you might very well enjoy this novel. But if you are new to Heinlein, may I recomend 'Starship Troopers' or 'Revolt in 2100.'"},{"Title":"The River Of Adventure","review":"As a child I walked every week to the library to pick up Enid Blyton books.

When my kids were old enough I ordered Enid Blyton books over the internet in India and read them to my kids over and over, then my kids read those books over and over. The concept of children living through adventures and taking care of themselves without much adult help was fascinating in my childhood and even more today."},{"Title":"The River Of Adventure","review":"The River of Adventure continues the adventures of the friends Jack, Philip, Lucy-Ann, Dinah and Kiki.

Let me say that I own both, and MFK Fisher's is by FAR the better one. It expresses Savarin's personality so well in English. Even though I am not a fan of her writing in general she is a first-rate translator of French! She captures the humor and poetry and makes it much more the book so many have read and loved. I've tried but I just don't enjoy the colder, more academic Penguin version. I am grateful to MFK Fisher for bringing this document to new life."},{"Title":"The Physiology of Taste; Or, Meditations on Transcendental Gastronomy","review":"Funny, informative, charming: this is one of the best books I've ever read.Brillat-Savarin was a French judge who barely escaped with his life during the Reign of Terror; to be able to write such a light-hearted, witty, fun book after such an ordeal is in itself a miracle. But The Physiology of Taste is more than a romp; it's a trip into the past. From a detailed inventory of the senses (including the 'generative sense' -- there's no mistaking the author's nationality!) to a description of a turkey hunt in New England while in exile, Brillat-Savarin's love of food, good company and beautiful women is a reminder to us that life can be good.I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Physiology of Taste; Or, Meditations on Transcendental Gastronomy","review":"Full disclosure: I admit I read this book based on juicy rumors from gastronomy sources that it was considered an &quot;underground classic&quot; and summarily treasured by modern (and well-placed) gourmet cooks. And to complete that thought, I'll spare you, dear review-reader, some suspense: this book disappointed me. I even found the notes (glibly called &quot;translator's glosses&quot;) by the esteemed M.F.K. Fisher a bit dry. Maybe the late Ms. Fisher got caught in the same trap; her notes refer almost constantly to the author's fame and wit in *other* contexts but they're uneven in the current text.Still, I stand behind the three stars. Brillat-Savarin is not a brilliant author, but his insights into at least a few well-chosen subjects shine across the nearly two centuries since these &quot;meditations&quot; were penned. Long before the Atkins craze gripped American nutrition, for example, one can find here (in Meditation #21: &quot;On Obesity&quot;): &quot;... the principal cause of any fatty corpulence is always a diet overloaded with starchy and farinaceous elements ...&quot; One wonders how our 20th century nutritional experts missed this--especially since the good author's book has been out nearly two hundred years and very popular across Europe for much of this time.Other nuggets of wisdom are equally remarkable. His analysis of taste manages to turn the standard teeth-chew-the-food, stomach-takes-the-food scientific tract into a celebration of good flavors. A long meditation &quot;on food in general&quot; gives any reader new perspectives on coffee, chocolate, and especially truffles. But physiology is never far behind; the aforementioned tasting discussion includes a prophetic note about the contributions of smell. Fisher's contributions to--and obvious loving translation of--these bits bring the gastronomical poetry up to date.Unfortunately, I've given you all the highlights. The remainder of this book is stuffed with essays either having little to do with gastronomy (&quot;On Exhaustion?&quot; Death? Hunting Luncheons?) or rambling on with little factual basis. Brillat-Savarin wrote this as a journal and it shows far too often; it's disorganized, didactic to the point of annoyance, and only occasionally stays true to the scientific promise of its title. And poor Ms. Fisher usually ends up as a bystander.With these critiques in mind, I'd recommend 'The Physiology of Taste&quot; as selective reading. A few of the essays are timeless and beautifully written. Most are turgid and make little sense to a 21st century food lover. Given Ms. Fisher's pedigree I'd hesitate to blame the translation; the author gets full credit and blame."},{"Title":"The Physiology of Taste; Or, Meditations on Transcendental Gastronomy","review":"Physiology Of Taste is an unabridged photomechnical reproduction of a classic 1925 edition and should be on the shelves of any serious and dedicated gourmet cook. Physiology Of Taste provides a timeless discussion of French food and cooking written in 1825 by a master at both culinary insight and writing. Whimsical reflection mixes with serious food insights in a most satisfying manner."},{"Title":"The Physiology of Taste; Or, Meditations on Transcendental Gastronomy","review":"Brillat-Savarin makes you feel good about feeling good about food! Especially entertaining are the chapters entitled &quot;On Obesity&quot; and &quot;On Thinness.&quot; Interesting to note that the chapter &quot;On the Treatment of Obesity&quot; in this 1825 treatise entails a low-carbohydrate diet. Maybe it's true that there really is nothing new under the sun!"},{"Title":"The Physiology of Taste; Or, Meditations on Transcendental Gastronomy","review":"The standard edition of this work in the US, and a lively one. Jean-Anthelme de Brillat-Savarin (1755-1826) is known for this book and for pithy maxims like \\"Adam and Eve sold themselves for an apple. What would they have done for a truffled fowl?\\" (That of course in the days when the truffles that most people heard of were real ones, not chocolate candies that look like them; and also when the real ones were much more plentiful and less expensive.) Memorable are the wonderful anecdotes of the kindly old priest and his \\"austere\\" meatless menu (\\"The Cur&eacute;'s Omelet,\\" with \\"theoretical notes\\" afterwards) and of Brillat's scheme at a country inn to enhance a humble dish. This wide-ranging book established its author as an original and knowledgeable voice in French food writing, to be compared with Carme and Grimod de la Reyni&egrave;re.Brillat-Savarin, among other roles, was the basis of Marcell Rouff's _The Passionate Epicure,_ a fictional book gently combining food and sex (naturally, as a friend of mine remarked, since it's French), which was widely read in English when the translation appeared in 1962. Marcella Hazan and (I believe) Julia Child cited it in their cookbooks. In his preface to the 1962 Rouff, Lawrence Durrell (himself a fashionable author at that time) explained that many in the Brillat-Savarin family \\"died at the dinner table, fork in hand\\" and that Brillat's sister Pierrette, two months before her hundredth birthday, spoke at table what are to food fanatics easily the most famous last words ever: \\"Vite! Apportez-moi le dessert -- je sens que je vais passer!\\"Fisher's translation and notes are a lively part of this edition of Brillat-Savarin (happily reprinted recently). Some booksellers offer newer editions by different English translators; I don't know why. This semi-scholarly translation and editing, executed in France during the post-war period described in her autobiographical _Two Towns in Provence,_ was the work that established Mary Frances Kennedy Fisher among US gastronomic writers. Her later status as Official Food Celebrity encouraged journalists to cite her automatically (whether they had read her work or not), but at least this time, publicity and merit coincide."},{"Title":"The Physiology of Taste; Or, Meditations on Transcendental Gastronomy","review":"NOTE: This review refers to ISBN 1-58243-103-5. This is a reprint edition of the original Heritage Press publication, in 1949, of M.F.K. Fisher's translation of Brillat-Savarin. As issued, the book is simply titled \\"The Physiology of Taste, or, Meditations on Transcendental Gastronomy.\\"Now, with those details out of the way, let me make bold to say that this is one of the world's great books!When I first began reading it, I became annoyed: \\"Who is this Frenchman, who thinks he can write about, and tell me about, everything under the sun?\\" For the book contains many, many digressions. I have seen it referred to as a \\"cookbook,\\" which is wildly wrong -- it is MEANT to be a book about food and the art of cooking food. And no less about the art of eating food.But the many digressions are the key to this wonderful book.A brief biography: born in 1755, trained as a lawyer, Brillat-Savarin became the mayor of his home town, Belley. But he fled France at the time of the Revolution, and went to America. After his brief exile, he returned to Paris and served as a judge in the court of appeals. He spent the last twenty-five years of his life living peacefully, and writing this book.Did he know that he was creating a masterpiece? Interesting question!As his intrepid translator, M.F.K. Fisher comments, this seems to be a book which will last more than a century or two. It may well live for thousands of years.WHY?Because of the personality and intelligence of the author! Just like Fisher, I wish that I had been one of his friends! And, when push comes to shove, one purpose of a library is to provide an army of friends, hopefully intelligent, gentle, serene, and perceptive. Brillat-Savarin is all of these.One sample discussion that I can recall from memory is about the ability of various men to enjoy tasty food. And Brillat-Savarin puts his point simply and unforgettably: there are men born blind, and men born lame, and men born deaf. On the other hand, there are men born with sight, men born with normal mobility, and men who can hear. In the same way, some men are born with an inability to appreciate delicious food, due to a lack of taste-buds on the tongue or whatever, BUT there are men who are born loving tasty food -- and I am writing my book about and for these people! :-)Be careful about buying this book! It may wind up on your nightstand for a long, long, time. Fine wine indeed, from a truly vintage mind -- and a truly fine translator.Also beware: it may make you hungry! :-)"},{"Title":"The Physiology of Taste; Or, Meditations on Transcendental Gastronomy","review":"Jean-Anthelme Brillat-Savarin born in 1755 in Belley, France, an area renowned for its foodstuffs and wine. Encouraged by the gourmet interests of his family, he quickly developed a taste for good food and wines. After graduating in law, Brillat-Savarin became magistrate of Belley and was later elected mayor of the town. With the outbreak of the French revolution his life was increasingly endangered and he fled to other parts of Europe and then on to America where he earned his living as a violinist in a theatre orchestra. He returned to France in 1796 and became a judge of the supreme courts of appeal. Apart from his judicial functions, he spent much time entertaining his friends, and his dinners were famous for their culinary excellence and witty conversation. His attitude to food was reflected by his famous comment \\"tell me what you eat and I will tell you what you are.' He began compiling a book of meditations on gastronomy and in 1825, a few months before his death, published la Physiologie du gout, a brilliant treatise on the pleasures of eating and the culmination of his long and loving association with food. French literary heavyweight Honore de Balzac was a friend of his and even titled one of his books 'the physiology of marriage' in honour of Savarin."},{"Title":"The Physiology of Taste; Or, Meditations on Transcendental Gastronomy","review":"The previous reviewer has it exactly right. This is a book of meditations on the pleasures of food. It is written by a man in whose company it would have been a great pleasure to eat and drink. It is written for people who have the capacity to taste and rejoice in tasting. It is translated by the most original food writer of the 20th Century, and illustrated (in my edition) by the estimable Wayne Thiebaud.What's the point of a book of meditations? In this case, it's to provoke your appetite and deepen your pleasures in satisfying that appetite. I recommend a page or two after dinner, at least three nights a week and washed down with good red wine.Lynn Hoffman author ofThe New Short Course in Wine"},{"Title":"The Physiology of Taste; Or, Meditations on Transcendental Gastronomy","review":"After reading some of the reviews concerning this book, I can certainly agree with much of the praise as well as the criticism. Filled with pithy euphimisms, chunks of this wonderful adventure in gastronomy are a revealing look at the life of the well-to-do author; other morsels seem be out of place, dry of wit, and ill-seasoned. Nonetheless, this is still a good read--there are some fascinating ancedotes as to life in the \\"new\\" United States which Savarin reports on after an adventure in the newly independent colonies. Worthy of any well-stocked bookshelf."},{"Title":"The Physiology of Taste; Or, Meditations on Transcendental Gastronomy","review":"This is a classic of food literature, translated by the 20th century inheritor of the humorous, poetic style of food writing. It's pretty much a required text for foodies, though not everyone loves the book, you need to give it a look. Avoid the Penguin translation which makes the text into a dry, formulaic bit of history rather than an earthy, living homage to good food.If you want a small library of classical French cooking (and you don't read French!)

Therefore, the Physiology of Taste, unlike a myriad of other volumes, stands out in it's attention to all aspects of gastronomical study and understanding. Not only it is incredibly detailed in an eloquent exploration of Sicilian history but compliments this journey with relevant recipes and gastronomical description.

She had such great things to say about 'The Physiology of Taste.' and such reguard for Brillat-Savarin's wit that I couldn't wait to read her translation of his book.

The three main branches of Christianity are covered: Roman Catholic, Protestant, and Eastern Orthodox. Early mystical writers such as Clement of Alexandria, Origen, and Augustine open the book, and modern day mystics such as Evelyn Underhill, Thomas Merton, and Pierre Teilhard de Chardin close the book. In between are such names as Pseudo-Dionysius, St. Francis of Assisi, St. Teresa of Avila, St. John of the Cross. I was a little disappointed to see some of my favorite mystics such as Jean Pierre de Caussade and Thomas Kelly given just a mention, but at least they weren't forgotten. Francois Fenelon, however, wasn't even mentioned. After one reads this book, I highly recommend the 5-volume series by Bernard McGinn entitled &quot;The Presence of God,&quot; currently in the making (3 vols complete to date).

I've just finished reading the book and most of what I was planning to say is right in Mr. Stinson's review. Red, White and Blue Paradise should be in the library of every ex-Zonian who remembers the Canal Zone with fondness. It's an antidote to all the Marxist nonsense written about the Zone by the usual suspects. Herbert and Mary Knapp experienced the Zone, overcame their initial prejudices and wrote the truth about their time there. This isn't just an intellectual/political history. Life in The Zone is described in great detail. The book brought back many fond memories - I spent two years at BHS in the late '50's and even then I thought of the Zone as a paradise. This book now joins The Path Between the Seas on my bookshelf. I highly recommend Red, White and Blue Paradise.Incidentally, although the book is out of print, the copy Amazon obtained for me was an ex-library copy in excellent shape.Marshall S Thomas"},{"Title":"Red, white, and blue paradise: The American Canal Zone in Panama","review":"I lived in the Canal Zone and moved away 14 years before I happened onto this book in a Nevada library. It is a jewel! Frank and Mary Knapp were two intellectuals from the Midwest who went to the Canal Zone in 1964, on the eve of the pivotal Flag Riots, to teach at storied Balboa High School on the Pacific side of the Zone. This book is at once an intellectual history of the Canal Zone and the its host Republic, and an account of the Knapps' own reluctant emergence from knee-jerk Liberal contempt for the Zonians. Like Isaac Singer's Yiddish ghetto, our extinct Canal Zone contains stories worth extracting. There are lessons paid up but yet to be learned. I think, for example, that the State Department's collaboration with a military dictator to discredit the Zone community, with the eager assistance of purportedly objective American journalists, was a precursor to the Justice Department's recent villification of anti-Castro Cuban-Americans in Miami. Frank and Mary Knapp are no crusaders, no polemicists. Their most important contribution may have been to re-introduce a meek objectivity and intellectual integrity to the scorched earth of Canal Zone literature. This book is not a magnum opus. But I hope it can serve as a re-orienting force, a compass, for authors of more ambitious future works about our communal Progressive experiment on the banks of the Canal that lasted almost exactly as long as the Soviet Union."},{"Title":"Red, white, and blue paradise: The American Canal Zone in Panama","review":"This is a well-written,thoughtful and historically sound book.It covers a slice of the American experiment in the former Panama Canal Zone. Noble at times and flawed at other times as are all human endeavors the experience served the world well. Human shortcomings should not detract from the bottom line. There were many success stories created by Americans, Panamanians and others as they carved out an engineering masterpiece out of the veritable jungle.Much propaganda has been written about America's intent, mission and accomplishments in building the canal and maintaining it ever so effectively for nearly one-hundred years. Much of it is too critical and distorted.All in all, America's accomplishments are a proud and successful chapter in the history of the Americas. Indeed of the world. Some readers will cringe at what I just wrote because so much foolishness and so many falsehoods have been written that it is hard to know the truth. Luckily this book and others will serve as fodder when, in fifty years or such, the definitive books are written.The privately funded Panama Canal Zone Museum now housed at the University of Florida is collecting primary material that will help with the task of chronicling the myriad of amazing stories.Many events are planned for 2014, the 100th anniversary of opening the Canal.This book is sound and a good read."},{"Title":"Trompe L'Oeil Bible","review":"In short - this book is fantastic. I am a novice painter with no art background or formal training, simply a passion to try my hand at murals and trompe l'oeil - and this is by far the best book I've found. It gives a good explanation of the materials needed and the basics of trompe l'oeil. Colors for each project are shown, along with how to mix them for the light, medium and shadow tones and how to use the color wheel to get realistic looking shadows for any color - and it works! There is a discussion of perspective and light and shadow, necessary to make your painting look real. If this in any way sounds complicated, it's not! The author makes it very clear and simple. I'm sure this book is not a definitive work on these subjects and I know people can spend years studying this, but it is plenty for a beginner like me to start getting cool results quickly. Sure my stuff doesn't look as awesome as the authors (yet!), but I'm pleased with the results so far. They're better than I'd ever expected in so short a time. My wine glass actually looks like a wine glass!The other really great thing about the book is that one technique or element is shown and explained in detail and then the author gives lots and lots of variations to let your tastes and creativity take over. Specifically, this book shows great examples of how to do several variations of windows and doors, a stone rosette panel, columns, stone work, and dozens of other items like wine bottles, glasses, birds, vases, grapes, greenery, skies, trellis, door pediments and I could go on and on. It has tons of ideas, so many you can get really inspired to create. Tropical scenes, castles, classical gardens, ruins, Provencal countryside and seascapes are a few of the things shown in the book. I don't want to mislead anyone - not every one of the items I've mentioned has completely detailed step by step instructions, but there are more than enough that do so you will start to understand how it works and be able to apply the principles yourself in just about anything shown in the book. I love how this book has so many examples.Many thanks to the author for writing this book and sharing his technique in a straightforward step by step style that is easy to follow, and including so many examples of his work. I really feel this book is intended to teach people, compared to some other books I have on trompe l'oeil where the authors seem more concerned about showcasing their important commissions than really teaching people. Not the case at all with Chris Westall! And I really appreciate that, I think you will too. I don't usually write reviews but I'm so impressed with this book I just had to! In my opinion, this really is THE Trompe L'Oeil Bible - a must have for all beginners. I have read through it several times, and each time I do I get more out of it. I really appreciate the abundance of material in this book. Overall, I highly recommend this book and the author's other book Trompe L'oeil Interiors for more inspiration, examples and techniques as well!"},{"Title":"Trompe L'Oeil Bible","review":"Good book but I have found a good site that offers free online tutorials for Trompe L'oeil at http://www.creativeevolution.net/school/howto.php"},{"Title":"Trompe L'Oeil Bible","review":"This book has a lot of useful information for the ordinary painter.

Most texts on the subject, however, are written at the graduate level for those with strong mathematics, economics, or business backgrounds.In a clear and refreshing departure from this trend, Introducing Game Theory and Its Applications presents an easy-to-read introduction to the basic ideas and techniques of game theory. After a brief introduction, the author begins with a chapter devoted to combinatorial games-a topic neglected or treated minimally in most other texts. The focus then shifts to two-person zero-sum games and their solution. Here the author presents the simplex method, based on linear programming, for solving these games and develops within his presentation the required background in linear programming. The final chapter presents some of the fundamental ideas and tools of non-zero-sum games and games with more than two players, including an introduction to cooperative game theory.Excerpt: This book will not only satisfy the curiosity of those whose interest in the subject was piqued by the 1994 Nobel Prize awarded to Harsanyi, Nash, and Selten. It also prepares its readers for more advanced study of game theory's applications in economics, business, and the physical, biological, and social sciences.This book is intended to be an easy-to-read introduction to the basic ideas and techniques of game theory. It can be used as a class textbook or for self-study. It also could be helpful for students who must learn some game theory in a course in a related subject (such as microeconomics) and have limited mathematical background.In recent years, and especially since the Nobel Prize in Economics was awarded in 1994 to John C. Harsanyi, John F. Nash Jr., and Reinhard Selten for their research in game theory, people have been intrigued by the unusual connection between games and mathematics, and the author hopes that this curiosity may be satisfied to some extent by reading this book. The book also will prepare them for deeper study of applications of game theory in economics and business and in the physical, biological, and social sciences.The first part of the text (Chapter 1) is devoted to combinatorial games. These games tend to be more recreational in nature and include board games like chess and checkers (and even a simple children's game like Tic-Tac-Toe). There are also many such games that are challenging even for accomplished mathematicians and our study covers various clever techniques for successful play. The rest of the book deals with the general theory of games. Chapters 2 and 3 contain a thorough treatment of two-person zero-sum games and their solution, which is the most well-understood part of game theory and was developed from the 1920s through the 1950s. John von Neumann was responsible, almost by himself, for inventing the subject, which reached its climax with the elaboration of the simplex method. Chapter 4 introduces the reader to games that are not zero-sum and/or involve more than two players. Here it is often natural to consider cases where the players must no longer act as isolated individuals but are permitted to form coalitions with other players. Games in which this happens are called cooperative games. All of this is an area of current research and there is still no general consensus about its concepts, methods, and applications. Here we have only attempted to present the basic ideas and some of the less controversial results, so that readers can venture further on their own. The reader will find in this chapter some of the applications that make game theory so interesting, for example, in economics, in the theory of political power, and in evolutionary biology. We assume no previous acquaintance with the details of these subjects. Our treatment is intended to provide enough of the fundamental concepts andtechniques of game theory to make it easier to understand more advanced applications.There are three Appendices. Appendix 1 reviews finite probability theory and provides whatever is necessary to understand all applications of probability in the book. Appendix 2 sketches an axiomatic treatment of utility theory. Although the utility concept is necessary for a proper understanding of game theory (and economics in general), we have avoided dealing with the subject in the body of the text because it would be a difficult and unnecessary distraction for the readers in their first confrontation with game theory. Appendix 3 contains two proofs of Nash's Theorem on the existence of Nash equilibria. The reason for consigning them to an appendix is that they depend on sophisticated results from topology, with which many readers will not be familiar.The section of Answers to Selected Exercises contains brief solutions to enough of the exercises for the readers to be sure that they understand what is going on, and then usually leaves some exercises to be answered on their own. There is an extensive Bibliography that contains not only the articles and books referred to in the text, but also many readings that may attract the readers' interest and extend their knowledge."},{"Title":"Introducing Game Theory and its Applications (Discrete Mathematics and Its Applications)","review":"I came across this title back in 2004 on our school library's new book shelf. Being an introductory text, the range of topics and the level of mathematics it features is not geared towards a graduate course in the subject (which is what I was looking for at the time). However the exposition is perfectly suited for a junior or senior audience in the applied math, operations research, or economics majors. The coverage of the combinatorial games is a very welcome addition, and there is also a nice chapter on nonzero sum and n-person games which discusses among other things Shapley's Theorem and Imputations. The book bibliography provides numerous references for delving deeper into the specific topics of interest to the readers. After reading Mendelson, students can move on to more advaced texts such as Osborne/Rubinstein, or Fudenberg/Tirole. All in all, this title is recommended to anyone trying to read up on and understand game theory, starting from its basic methods and principles."},{"Title":"Sarah Lugg's The Handcrafted Wedding: Special Touches for the Perfect Day","review":"When my daughter was preparing for her wedding last year, our crafty family was determined to do as much as possible with our own hands.

He tells the story of his sickly childhood, his less than satisfactory education at Oxford. He tells essentially how his hunger for knowledge led to the great self- education which is preparation for the writing of his work. There is also the story of his falling in love, and his obedience to his father's rejection of the match. The great turning point moment of his life is described as follows,\\" It was at Rome , on the 15th of October 1764,as I sat musing amidst the ruins of the Capitol ,while the barefooted friars were singing Vespers in the temple of Jupiter, that the idea of the decline and fall of the city first started to my mind.\\"The majesty of the great prose style of the 'Decline and Fall is also felt in this work."},{"Title":"Autobiography [of] Edward Gibbon (Everyman's library)","review":"Edward Gibbon (1737-1794) was an English historian and Member of Parliament, whose monumental three-volumeThe Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, Volume I: 180 A.D. -- 395 A.D.,The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, Vol. 2: The History of the Empire from 395 A.D. to 1185 A.D., andTHE DECLINE AND FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE - VOLUME III - 1185 A.D. - 1453 A.D.has been called the greatest historical work ever written. Editor Dero Saunders explains the need of this revised edition: \\"The controlling reason is the existence of serious flaws and omissions in the official version known to so many readers.\\" (Pg. 7)Gibbon explains his own purpose in writing: \\"after the completion of a toilsome and successful work, I now propose to employ some moments of my leisure in reviewing the simple transactions of a private and literary life... My own amusement is my motive, and will be my reward; and if these sheets are communicated to some discreet and indulgent friends, they will be secreted from the public eye till the author shall be removed from the reach of criticism or ridicule.\\" (Pg. 27)He admits, \\"I secretly rejoiced in those infirmities, which delivered me from the exercises of the school and the society of my equals. As often as I was tolerably exempt from danger and pain, reading... was the employment and comfort of my solitary hours.\\" (Pg. 66) Of his schooling, he states, \\"To the University of Oxford I acknowledge no obligation, and she will as cheerfully renounce me for a son as I am willing to disclaim her as a mother. I spent fourteen months at Magdalen College; they proved ... the most idle and unprofitable of my whole life.\\" (Pg. 72) He adds, \\"It might at least be expected that an ecclesiastical school should inculcate the orthodox principles of religion. But our venerable mother had contrived to unite the opposite extremes of bigotry and indifference.\\" (Pg. 82)Of a visit to Italy, he recalls, \\"Yet the historian of the decline and fall must not regret his time or expense, since it was with the view of Italy and Rome which determined the choice of the subject. It was at Rome... as I sat musing [in 1764] amid the ruins of the Capitol... that the idea of writing the decline and fall of the city first started to my mind... some years elapsed, and several avocations intervened, before I was seriously engaged in the execution of that laborious work.\\" (Pg. 154) He adds, \\"As I believed... that the propagation of the gospel and the triumph of the church are inseparably connected with the decline of the Roman monarchy, I weighed the causes and effects of the revolution, and contrasted the narratives and apologies of the Christians themselves with the glances of candor or enmity which the pagans have cast on the rising sects.\\" (Pg. 166)He notes, \\"Had I believed that the majority of English readers were so fondly attached even to the name and shadow of Christianity, had I foreseen that the pious, the timid, and the prudent would feel ... with such exquisite sensibility, I might perhaps have softened the two invidious chapters [XV & XVI] which would create many enemies and conciliate few friends... I could only rejoice that, if the voice of our priests was clamorous and bitter, their hands were disarmed from the powers of persecution.\\" (Pg. 180)Gibbon's autobiography is as charmingly-written as the 'Decline,' and will be of interest to anyone seeking to know more about the man behind the books."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Cliffs Complete)","review":"My daughter was 16 when she read this book.

He was only a monster because his eyes just didn't have human life in them because he was created by Frankenstein, which is the name of the doctor and not the monster.I'm pretty sure none of the following constitutes a spoiler:Dr. Frankenstein is a pretty wimpy guy, who slipped into an apoplexy (okay, I did read part of it myself due to my daughter's exuberance) over nothing but his emotional reaction to the monster not turning out as hoped ... and then killing someone.

The message is that the deeper need of the two is friendship, but that we are susceptible to the temptations of ambition, which can destroy friendship. Ostensibly, Victor Frankenstein had an unselfish mission to &quot;benefit all mankind&quot; with his scientific project. His &quot;selfless&quot; ambition failed him and proved to aim at self-glory because he wanted to create a race that would bless him as its father. In Captain Walton's second letter to his sister, we learn that although he has a well-trained crew, he has no soul companion; this need he regards as a &quot;most severe evil.&quot; Walton's exploration of the secluded and frozen Arctic serves as a metaphor for how his ambition has removed him from society. His ambition even threatened his own and his crew members' lives when ice surrounded and trapped his boat. The message is that if one sets out ambitiously to benefit mankind, once that person has acheived their goal, their prominence sets them apart from the same society they set out to benefit.Victor had a much more intense ambition than Walton, with corespondingly more disasterous results. As Frankenstein prepared for his project, he isolated himself from his friends and family to laboriously study the sciences and he would later postpone his marriage for this project. The embodiment of his ambition, the repulsive monster, would eventually slay several of Victor's loved family members, including his fiance on their wedding night. Even the monster feels as his deepest need a human relationship, which he has none. While observing an impoverished family, &quot;the bitter gall of envy&quot; arose in the monster. He considers them rich because they have the companionship of each other even though they are in financial poverty. When Frankenstein rejects the monster's pleas to create for him a mate of the same race, the monster sets out on an unstoppable path to destruction and an ambitious one indeed. The novel links ambition with destruction, particularly destruction of companionship and conveys friendship as a great need for mankind.I don't think the story conveys that all ambition is destructive. At the end of the story, Victor has great regret for the results of his ambition, but he still has pride for his effort. Although he cautions us that we would be better off to believe our &quot;native town to be the world,&quot; he adds, &quot;yet another may succeed.&quot; You could interpret this as Victor not &quot;learning his lesson;&quot; that mankind will continue to give in to harmful passions. Another, much different analysis could be that this story portrays that limited ambition, integrated with society and not aimed at self-glory, can be virtuous. After all, for the teenage author of a classic, enduring novel to tell us that all ambition will destroy us would be a contradiction."},{"Title":"We Like Kindergarten (a Little Little Golden Book)","review":"As a child, &quot;We Like Kindergarten&quot; was one of the first books I read.

It is a well organized collection of essays that encompass the history of teaching reading, the research that has informed teaching practices, and how these practices are implemented. Jeanne Chall has had two major roles in the field of reading. She has been an active researcher and has been the inspiration behind the work of others. This book is an excellent testimony to her prominent role in the field of education. The first essay, \\"The Legacy of the Dartmouth Seminar\\" documents the historical significance that this seminar had in the field of literacy and education in the United States and the English speaking countries of the world. Through the hard work and efforts of the participants and those who valued their work, reading and literacy education as we know it today evolved. The second essay describes the Boston University and Chelsea Public School partnership. The authors describe the extensive collaboration between both faculties. The result was a co-teaching model using Title I and classroom teachers. Literacy instruction, classroom organization and literacy assessment were the principles that guided their work and research on these principles informed their instruction. In the third essay Wood Smethurst, Ed.D. describes how students who wish to succeed but don't in traditional high schools meet success at the Ben Franklin Academy. Mandatory work study programs and individualized mastery approaches are integral parts of the school's curriculum which is taught in a family-like atmosphere. Students are encouraged to make their own choices and take responsibility for their learning. Most of the students make dramatic gains. The fourth essay is a history of the teaching of reading. The teaching of letters, phonetics, phonemes, whole word, whole language and a combination of words, explicit systematic phonetic instruction and literature are explored. This is followed by an essay authored by Jeanne Paratore and Joy Turpie. They invite the reader into Joy's first grade classroom to view and see the merits of her literacy program which incorporates a flexible grouping model. This model enables her to meet the needs of individual readers. The sixth essay is devoted to the basics of reading: word identification, word meaning, and reading comprehension. The differences and similarities of teaching young children, adolescents and adults to read are addressed. The correlation between reading and listening ability is also clearly stated. This essay is followed by Lillian R. Putnam, Ed.D.'s research that measured the ability to make story predictions by four year olds, kindergartners and first graders. The value of using prediction when teaching reading is known. Children who have been read to make better story-ending predictions when they later read the same stories on their own because they are more aware of story elements. After conducting her study she recommends that the skill be practiced with kindergartners and first graders but not taught to four year olds. The eighth essay explores low income children, their language and connectives and their use in reading and writing. The study found that low income children, no matter what their ability, appeared to use a small number of connectives in their writing. The implications from this study are the need for vocabulary development, practice with the use of connectives and more practice reading and composing. Steven Stahl, Ph.D. discusses teaching children with reading problems how to recognize words. His essay is divided into three parts: the assumption that there is a need for special programs and curricular adaptations for these students; a review of the research concerning the need for special programs for teaching phonics; and a review of the effects of the University of Georgia's \\"not phonics\\" approach. He suggests a focused, systematic approach to phonics with repeated and assisted readings. His technique, called supported contextual reading, involves reading material to the student above his instructional level. Then through echo and repeated readings the child masters the material. He has documented dramatic results. This essay is followed by Edward Fry, Ph.D.. He collapsed many years worth of work into several pages. His \\"tool box for reading\\" is very useful. He offers many practical tips and tools for reading teachers of all experiences. The next few essays deal with assessment of reading abilities. The first one documents research concerning a deficit in naming speed and its implications for teaching and assessing reading. The researchers question suggest the importance of a double deficit in reading and naming speed. Research in other languages has substantiated this. The breakthroughs in neuroscience have a great impact on the teaching and assessment of reading. This is followed by assessing with trial lessons. One of the merits is that it offers insight into the level that a child can attain with guided assistance. The essays examine the importance of all the areas of reading, the age, the developmental level of the student, and the assessment instruments. From there Sandra Stotsky, Ph.D., examines the language in multicultural basals. She questions the worth of such language when teaching children to read in the English language. The vocabulary and story elements found in these basals are not challenging and the difficulty does not increase at a constant level. Thelast essay is a history of the English language and the first English language dictionary, a fitting way to end this book. This book is a compilation of the reading research that has occurred since the Dartmouth conference. The authors have explained how reading theory has evolved and how informed instruction has been implemented into the classroom. This book is a fine tribute to Jeanne Chall."},{"Title":"Science and the modern world (Lowell lectures)","review":"Naturally, a book written in the midst (or even aftermath) of the relativity revolution is going to be both insightful and limited. Whitehead's book is, in this regard, a child of its age. Yet this is not the entire story, since Whitehead possessed the gift of being able to contextualize his own thought and thus leave it open-ended.The technical aspects of the book are, of course, sparse on facts. There is evidence that Whitehead (who, in 1925, had been at Harvard for only a year and was now engaged full-time with philosophy, less so with the mathematics of his earlier career) was aware of the sweeping changes in the world brought on by the quantum physics. He was certainly aware of its potential. Niels Bohr said that anyone who is not shocked by quantum theory has not understood it; on this definition, Whitehead did indeed understand it, because the new physics never ceased to amaze him. He grew up, after all, and was edicated as a mathematician, in a very Newtonian world. But it is important to situate the book: the theories that shape what we today know as quantum mechanics were still being debated and worked out in the 20s. Most of the most stiking information has been theorized since that time, certainly long after Whitehead's death. Two examples are Bell's work on separated systems (60s) and Wheeler's discussion of a self-observing universe (1979!).Whitehead's book is most useful as a book on the philosophy of science, as well as a succinct and accurate appraisal of science in the modern world (modern meaning 17th-19th centuries, historically speaking). He takes a very \\"post\\" modern view of the extent of science, writing in chapter one, \\"if science is not to degenerate into a medly of ad hoc hypotheses, it must become philosophical and must enter upon a thorough criticism of its own foundations.\\" At the same time one can imagine his glee over such recent developments as chaos theory. Whitehead would disagree with Einstein, and side with Bohr: God does indeed play dice.If you take your science as religion, i.e. the scientific method is still your Nicene creed, you will dislike this book, and most of the recent work on the philosophy of science. However, if you are interested in a hermeneutical perspective on science's recent past, and are willing to see science as as much a faith committment as any other world view (a laKuhn, for example), you will benfit greatly from this book. If you take Rouse's (1987,1996) and van Huyssteen's (1998,1999) position that even so-called \\"hard\\" science is thoroughly corrigible and foundationalist, you will enjoy this book. Whitehead's ideas are opposed to scientific materialism from the get-go, and he is absolutely against dogmatism on the part of science or philosophy. To this extent, 75 years down the road this is still a great book, worth the price of the volume simply for the essays \\"Origins of Modern Science,\\" \\"Science and Philosophy,\\" and \\"Religion and Science\\" alone."},{"Title":"Science and the modern world (Lowell lectures)","review":"In short: A serious and thoughtful book about the meaning and impact of science. This is not light, popular science reading. (If you're looking for that, I highly recommend the works of folks like Freeman Dyson or Stephen Jay Gould.)_Science and the Modern World_ has some stunning, timeless insights, and many things I'm fond of quoting. Here's a favorite, from the last chapter:\\"Modern science has imposed upon humanity the necessity for wandering. Its progressive thought and its progressivetechnology make the transition through time, from generation to generation, a true migration into uncharted seas of adventure.The very benefit of wandering is that it is dangerous and needs skill to avert evils. We must expect, therefore, that the futurewill disclose dangers.\\"(Here it comes:)\\"It is the business of the future to be dangerous; and it is among the merits of science that it equips the future for its duties.\\"(*P*O*W*!*)\\"The prosperous middle classes, who ruled the nineteenth century, placed an excessive value upon the placidity of existence. They refused to face the necessities for social reform imposed by the new industrial system, and they are now refusing to face the necessities for intellectual reform imposed by the new knowledge.\\"(Same as it ever was!)\\"The middle class pessimism over the future of the world comes from a confusion between civilization and security. In the immediate future there will be less security than in the immediate past, less stability. It must be admitted that there is a degree of instability which is inconsistent with civilization. But, on the whole, the great ages have been unstable ages.\\"Whew."},{"Title":"Science and the modern world (Lowell lectures)","review":"I cannot make a good summary of this book, for I do not know it well enough. I do have a sense of its great depth and beauty. Whitehead seems to me not only a profound thinker but a humble person who stands in certain awe before the Universe. He opens by describing the way a few people in a small part of Europe caused a great revolution in human thinking. He argues that this Scientific Revolution will amount to the triumph of Reason in the world. His chapters are on, The Origins of Modern Science, Mathematics as Element in the History of Thought, The Century ofGenius, The Eighteenth Century, The Romantic Reaction, The Nineteenth Century, Relativity, The Quantum Theory ,Science and Philosophy, Abstraction, God, Religion and Science, Requisites for Social Progress.I was moved by the concluding words of his book .\\" I have endeavoured in these lectures to give a record of a great adventure in the region of thought. It was shared in by all the races of Western Europe .It developed with the slowness of a mass movement. Half a century is its unit of time. The tale is the epic of an episode in the manifestation of reason. It tells how a particular direction of reason emerges in a race by the long preparation of antecedent epochs, how after its birth its subject- matter gradually unfolds itself, howit attains its triumphs, how its influence moulds the very springs of action of mankind ,and finally how at its moment of supreme success its limitations disclose themselves and call for a renewed exercise of the creative imagination. The moral of the tale is the power of reason ,its decisive influence on the life of humanity. The great conquerors from Caesar to Napoleon, influenced profoundly the lives of subsequent generations. But the total effect of this influence shrinks to insignificance, if compared to the entire transformation of human habits and human mentality produced by the long line of men of thought from Thales to the present day, men individually powerless, but ultimately the rulers of the world. p. 186"},{"Title":"Science and the modern world (Lowell lectures)","review":"Whitehead is widely regarded as a humane philosopher in the best sense of that word--a philosopher able to get across very difficult ideas with a wink and a smile. Also, he has always been commended for his prose style in his more intimate writings, at least in his books based on lectures (the best of which are Science in the Modern World and Adventures of Ideas). Process and Reality is difficult but worth the effort; one does need a glossary at times, but this isn't a review of that book.It is hard to imagine a philosophy book written with more clarity than this one. I think that the quotes given by reviewers witness that fact. The only review here, it turns out, which dilikes the book because of its \\"unreadability\\" is the one riddled with spelling and grammatical errors itself. Hard reading, it turns out, is even harder if one cannot spell. With that, I heartily concur."},{"Title":"Science and the modern world (Lowell lectures)","review":"To see a reissue of one of Whitehead's classic books is very pleasing and timely. There have been very few people with his depth of understanding of science and technology. The historical and philosophical analyses of this book, written many decades ago, are still fresh and very important."},{"Title":"Science and the modern world (Lowell lectures)","review":"I found this a curious blend of sparkling expression with sometimes impenetrable prose. It seems worth reading from a general-semantics view because of Whitehead's influence on Alfred Korzybski's work. In this book, Whitehead uses the history of western science as a backdrop for examining some of its basic assumptions and for discussing his own alternative to scientific materialism, which he calls the &quot;theory of organic mechanism,&quot; (81) a forerunner of general-systems theory. Whitehead strongly emphasizes a process view of nature: &quot;...nature is a structure of evolving processes. The reality is the process&quot; (74). His discussion of what he calls the fallacy of misplaced concreteness seems close to Korzybski's notion of confusion of orders of abstraction. Whitehead pushes for including the concerns of philosophy, art and religion in a broadened view of science. He argues against &quot;A self-satisfied rationalism [that] is in effect a form of anti-rationalism. It means an arbitrary halt at a particular set of abstractions&quot; (201). Opposed to such limitations, he argues instead that &quot;...almost any idea that jogs you out of your current abstractions may be better than nothing&quot; (62). You may skip the book's at times difficult metaphysics and still find many gems to jog you."},{"Title":"Science and the modern world (Lowell lectures)","review":"The content of the book is just terrific. See other reviews.I just wanted to let folks know that for their $19.95, they are getting a very cheaply made book. The cover is quite thin, but even worse, the book is printed on awful, pulpy paper--worse than most romance/mystery novels.I'm sure that it will pass out of its concrescence sooner than most books . . . ."},{"Title":"Science and the modern world (Lowell lectures)","review":"This is one of the most important writings of the twentieth century. I first read it for a college course in the 1960's (and for that I thank my teacher, Dr. Peter Caws), and I have returned to it many times since. Yes, it is difficult to comprehend this profound book in one reading, but it is well worth the effort.The book conceptualizes the way of thinking that led to and supported the development of modern science. It proceeds to show not only the value but also the limitations of that way of thinking and how it affected the development of Western civilization in both enriching and limiting ways. The book suggests, long after it was written, how these persisting limitations may be plaguing our current personal, social, political and economic life. By no means is the book anti-science; it is instead asking us to see a bigger reality beyond science but that includes science. That bigger reality includes aesthetics, broadly conceived. His description of the \\"fallacy of misplaced concreteness,\\" though applied to the philosophy of scientific materialism, points to a more general mental error of mistaking mental abstractions for reality itself. It is an error present, for example, in today's politics, where words like \\"liberal,\\" \\"socialism,\\" \\"big government,\\" \\"capitalism\\" and \\"freedom,\\" are thrown about as though there was an identifiable reality that they described. Such abstractions substitute for experience instead of enriching it. The error is even reflected in much (not all) modern architecture, where often abstract forms dominate with boring and sterile emptiness within the forms. The error of substituting abstraction for empirical reality affects not only how we see ourselves in relation to the world around us, but also our social, political, economic and culture milieu.So I recommend this book, for if you put forth the effort to understand it, it may enrich your life.--John L. Hodge, author"},{"Title":"Science and the modern world (Lowell lectures)","review":"I gave this five stars only so as to not effect the ratings of the previous, more knowledgeable reviewer. I am having some difficulty, however, understanding major portions of this book. It was written in 1925 and I expect that some of what was said would no longer be applicable today. Whitehead may well have changed his views regarding quantum mechanics and relativity. In fact, he continually refers to an &quot;ether&quot; that had already been abandoned by his time. Much of it is very accessible review of Hume, Locke and the Romantic poets. But his command of the more technical aspects of the science may no longer be useful. My question is: Does anyone out there know of a book that attempt to update his book or some guide as to how to interpret some of Whitehead's special language. I am very interested in this book and would like to understand it much better than I can at this time."},{"Title":"Science and the modern world (Lowell lectures)","review":"The ideas and philosophical concepts in this book are generally sensible, rational, and correct, but the writing style and execution leaves much to be desired. In other words, this book is extremely difficult. The impenetrable density of this prose is intolerable, especially considering it was written IN ENGLISH, in the TWENTIETH CENTURY! If someone had handed me this book with a blank cover, I would have been convinced that it was originally written in old German during the time of Kant, and verbosely translated by some frustrated acedemic. It is beyond me how any book writeen in English so recently could be so unreadable.I might recommend this book to someone with a highly scientific, mathematical and empiricist mind-set. After all, Whitehead is an accomplished mathematician, and his book has an aire of unbiased, empirical objectivity. For a mathematician with a desire to cross over into the philosophy genre, this might be a good choice. But for normal philosophy readers who come from a liberal arts/literary background, this book will probably come across as obfiscated and tortuous."},{"Title":"Adopting a Toddler: What Size Shoes Does She Wear?","review":"This is an excellent book!!! Not only is it detailed in its knowledge re: adopting a toddler versus a newborn, but it has excellent general adoption info which I found focused more on int'l adoption as more toddlers are adopted out of the country... which was nice as we are adopting internationally.Honestly, I had not even thought about the contrast in adopting a toddler versus a newborn, and this book was wonderful in its enlightenment as your toddler (aged 1-3) will have had more time being alive therefore will have more memories of his/her life, care, and customs. This book discusses what to do about changing his/her name (or if you should), buying the toddler wardrobe, should you learn the language, toddler safety, appropriate toys (and his/her reaction to them), mealtimes, potty-training, the pediatrician, other care-givers (and how your toddler may react), packing for your trip, how to \\"act\\" while you are in another country (appropriate dress, gifts for the caregivers, souveniers, etc.) and your arrival home and the adjustments that will take place.I have to admit that there were some chapters that I skipped over because already having bio children, we already knew about child safety, carseats, strollers, and some of the \\"normal\\" toddler behaviors, etc. But for someone for whom this will be their first child, it is definitely worth the time."},{"Title":"Adopting a Toddler: What Size Shoes Does She Wear?","review":"I thought this book was a great guide to adopting a toddler. I work with families who adopt internationally and there really is limited references out there for parents who are adopting and especially for parents who are adopting a toddler or older child. I thought the book touched on important topics that adoptive parents face in adoption and I thought the book was very practical, easy to understand and thorough. I loved the title and its meaning. I was glad that the author was writing from personal experience in adoption, which to me, made the book more real. I recommend this book to all my adoptive parents to read before they adopt. Definitely worth the investment. What a deal! You will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Adopting a Toddler: What Size Shoes Does She Wear?","review":"It was great to read the honest personal experience of an adoption--both the positive and negative.

The author says that she tried to write a book about everything she wished she'd thought of before adopting a toddler - unfortunately, my impression is that she didn't think it through much at all. The book is full of helpful tidbits like if you are adopting a three year old, you might want to consider getting a toddler bed instead of a crib, or if you're feeling frumpy and stressed out with all the waiting, you could go shopping! Or maybe get some Glamor Shots taken! Seriously, most of the things in this book are either common sense (don't leave the kid alone in the bathtub) or just plain goofy (Glamor Shots, getting your hair bleached blond).

As first time parents my husband and I have found the book an invaluable guide and a source of information we simply wouldn't have thought of.If you are considering adoption, or if you are in the middle of the paperchase...

It contains all the basic issues you'll want to begin to think about before you begin the process (paperwork, parenting classes, childproofing a house, setting up a nursery etc.), considerations while in the process (packing, donations and international travel), and issues you will face once you get home with your new child (attachment, eating issues, medical concerns, school etc.).There is a resource section at the back of the book with pertinent web links and names and addresses of agencies, organizations and professionals. She has a very good list of other books to look into for more in-depth reading on most of the topics she covers.Her personal experience as an adoptive mother through international adoption shines through every page but it is her easy yet straightforward professional style that allows you to cover a lot of ground without being overwhelmed.

We will be taking it with us in two days when we finally get to pick her up. There is a lot of useful information about the entire process and how to deal with different issues that come up. I highly recommend this book!!!"},{"Title":"Adopting a Toddler: What Size Shoes Does She Wear?","review":"This book sounded so promising ... but the author wastes chapters on such superficial things as decorating a nursery. Granted, the author has some interesting resources listed (although you could find most of them with a Google search), but there's not much else I found helpful. My husband and I are waiting for a referral from Russia, so a little bit of the travel advice was helpful, but mainly I found this woman to be a very self-important mother who didn't seem to have a clue that children even existed before she decided she wanted one.This book focused so heavily on the angst associated with the author's adopting because of her infertility that it got on my nerves. People DO adopt children for reasons other than infertility, but she doesn't recognize that.And finally, in addition to the MANY typos in this book (Can't help it, I am a former journalist), the author mentions at one point that she is the mother of \\"children,\\" but the only child she talks about is Callie, her daughter. I don't know if the second child is really just a typo, or if the author just neglects to talk about him or her.Don't waste your money: you can find all of the good information she includes by doing a pretty good Web search."},{"Title":"Adopting a Toddler: What Size Shoes Does She Wear?","review":"This book is an easy read but I didn't find the information useful at all. The author describes her journey to adopt a toddler through the eyes of someone who has had no experience with children at all. If you have children already this is not the book for you. Most topics are dealt with superficially and short shrift is given to exploring options other than the ones the author chose. Her child is not in day care, so there isn't much useful information about day care. She chose a particular kind of bed, so the pros and cons of different kinds of beds aren't explored very well. The author also makes it clear that fathers are definitely second best when it comes to child rearing and this book is definitely written with a female audience in mind."},{"Title":"Adopting a Toddler: What Size Shoes Does She Wear?","review":"I am very disappointed with this book. The author seems to have written the book as a way to vent her frustration with challenges she faced in the adoption process (losing a referral, problems with the hotel, delay in her daughter's speech therapy, etc.). Some of the difficulties the author mentions more than once, making the book somewhat redundant. At least half of the information has nothing to do with adopting a toddler; it may apply to parenting a toddler or adopting internationally, but NOT to \\"the unique needs of adopted toddlers,\\" as the back of the book claims. I had been hoping to learn more about adopting a toddler from this book, since I am still in the decision-making process of the adoption -- but this book did not meet my expectations. Furthermore, I have only read half of the book and I've already found 4 very obvious typos/grammatical errors. This is just plain sloppy! Call me nitpicky, but I believe any book with more than three errors in it deserves a poor rating (and the author should fire their editor).The book does have some good shopping lists in it though, and I probably will use it when I create a gift registry for my \\"baby\\" shower.

I was absolutely amazed to see a book that asked (and offered realistic advice) to just those same questions. This book is written by adoptive parents that found themselves adopting a child much older than they were expecting, a situation very common in international adoption, with delays, red tape, and miscommunication. The book provides easy to read, NON-PREACHING suggestion and advise for any parent adopting a slightly older child (the \\"tweens\\", between infancy and preschool age). Even those adopting a 4-5 year old child could still find useful information. Among all the books about raising adoptive children, this is the one that \\"spoke\\" to me the best, on my terms, about things -I- was concerned about.

The early chapters of The Domestic Dog concerning evolution may be a little bit factual and historically oriented (read: a tad dry) but presents an excellent understanding of how dogs came into contact with humans and the resulting reliance and interations. The book, in part, looks at areas of canus familiarus and human interaction from both a biological, survival necessity to what kind of kennel should be considered based on breed selection. There are many discussions on topics not normally covered in commercial or general appeal dog books that will compliment, inform and provide insight into otherwise unknown or insufficiently covered areas about dogs. Areas of new information include (but is not limited to): pack hierarchy, dog development and growth, dog psychology and others. It is one dog book I can rely on for its research, reference material and impartial analyses into breed types. It has helped me learn more about dogs than previously possible in other purported books based on fact.

The book is in its 5th printing so some professors must share my judgment of it. Let's hope that by 2005 there's a revised edition including and evaluating recent work.It has 17 chapters written (or co-written) by 21 specialists in their fields -- British, American, Italian -- (after an introduction) divided into 3 major divisions: I. Domestication & evolution (2 chapters) ; II. Behaviour & behaviour problems (8 ch.s); III. Human-dog interactions (6 ch.s). The chapters provide an excellent summary and the key references to the area discussed. A few chapters have a definite British flavor but American readers will be able to transpose when needed.Dog breeders (& many owners) may be especially interested in the chapters dealing with what's known about heritability of traits, temperament, etc., as well as the role of early experience on later behaviors, disorders, etc.A few chapters are filled with research results in tables and graphs. One is dense with specialist jargon. But all are readable if you're interested in learning what the applicable sciences know and do not know about the dog.

With the foundation firmly laid in The Hamlet, Faulkner is free to delve deep into the character of Flem, the volatile Snopes-Varner dynamic, and the fascinating interaction between Eula, Gavin Stevens, and Linda Snopes, the pawn in her father's plan to take over Jefferson. Not surprisingly, another host of Snopes parade onto the scene; but it is Flem and his underhanded, diabolical shenanigans that make this novel a joy to read. The ending is both humorous and seriously disturbing, paving the way for the Fall of the House of Snopes in The Mansion. One note: while the book jacket claims The Town may be read on its own, I would highly discourage it; trek through The Hamlet first before launching into it--it is well worth your time."},{"Title":"The Town: A Novel of the Snopes Family","review":"This is the middle book of the Snopes trilogy, and it seems like Faulkner has significantly changed his perception of the Snopeses. The Town and the Mansion were written much later than the Hamlet, and it's clear that they're written by a more complex person. It seems that the Jefferson of The Hamlet has an idealized honor that is being stolen away by the invasion of the amoral Snopeses. However, by the Town, the honor held by the locals is shown to be largely in their own opinion. We do see something slipping away, but it's not altogether clear that it's worth preserving. The shift makes for a much more interesting book.Additionally, there's the maturation of Eula Varner, something beautiful in the South if not altogether pristine, and she is lost in this middle section of the trilogy. Her suicide says something about the South's willfull destruction, the outgrowth of a deal with the devil, but it takes some further mulling to fully absorb her.There are three first person narrators guiding the reader through the news of The Town. Unfortunately, one of them, Charles Mallison, is an enormous yawn. Faulkner is usually fantastic with the first person children (Sound and the Fury, The Unvanquished), but his heart isn't in this one. Fortunately, the others are much more interesting and make the novel fly. Gavin Stevens is similar to father Compson in Sound and the Fury, and I believe one of the mouthpieces for Faulkner himself.The Snopes trilogy is interesting in that it shows the maturation of a writer and the deepening complexity of his views. This trilogy didn't end up in the vein in which it was started, and that's a very good thing. Not my favorite Faulkner, but ambitious as hell, and that's the real reason to read him in the first place. When he pulls it off, there's nobody better. If you're already hooked on him, the trilogy is worth doing, unlike Sanctuary and Pylon, which are just downright miserable (regardless of what Sartre had to say about them, the putz)."},{"Title":"The Town: A Novel of the Snopes Family","review":"County Attorney Gavin Stevens and his relationships with Eula and Linda Snopes provide the centerpiece for this rambling, reconstructed narrative of the rise of the ignoble Snopes clan in the Town of Jefferson, Mississippi. The narration comes through the viewpoints of Stevens, his younger nephew Charles Mallison, and sewing machine salesman and all-round busybody V.K. Ratliffe. Stevens' rivalry with Mayor De Spain dominates the first section of the book, and shows how irrationally an educated man can behave when he is blinded by desire; any reader with an ounce of sensitivity will surely squirm at Faulkner's skill in combining drama and farce here. Later Stevens turns his attention to \\"saving\\" Eula's daughter Linda from a life of \\"Snopesdom\\" and continues making a fool of himself in the process. All the while, the inscrutable Flem Snopes continues on the acquisitive path he established in the first volume, The Hamlet, now setting his sights firmly on De Spain's bank. Can the sympathetic lawyer save Linda, or even himself?Faulkner's Yoknapatawpha County novels are among the best that American literature has to offer, and the Snopes trilogy is certainly no exception. Jefferson is populated with unforgettable characters, including (besides the above-mentioned) the many additions to the vermin-like Snopes clan - Eck, Montgomery Ward, I.O., and Wallstreet Panic Snopes. Some of these characters will turn up in other Faulkner novels as well, and collectively the books enrich each other, building up a depth of shared experience. Although Faulkner's focus is on men, and his women are often either absent or troublesome, this volume's focus on obsessive relationships makes this a fine selection for women readers as well - much more so than the horse-trading of The Hamlet, for example. And while this isn't the Master's very best work, it still easily rates 5 stars."},{"Title":"The Town: A Novel of the Snopes Family","review":"'the town\\" is the second book in a trilogy written by faulkner on the snopes family. the 1st and second books were written almost 25 years apart. it is strongly suggested that you read the 1st in the series, \\"the hamlet\\", first.in this book faulkner brings the infamous flem snopes from frenchmen's bend to the city of jefferson and traces his steps up the social ladder from superintendent to president of the local bank. The story is told thru the eyes of three characters ranging in age from a child to an older adult. the story deals with the thwarted lover of eula snopes, gavin stevens who attempts to free eula's daughter from the shadow of snopes name.as usual, Faulkner finds ways to make the story telling interesting. He does so by having the tale told by two \\"observers\\" and one participant. The youngest, charles mallison, tells what he sees and what he hears occurred before he was born as told top him by his cousin gowan. He is given the task of speaking for the town and his perspective is objective and not tainted by personal feelings. Gavin stevens and v k Ratliff on the other hand speak only from their personal perspective. Faulkner takes the opportunity to use each of their differing points of view to leave open a debate as to what motivates flem. As usual, we never see into flem and can only speculate like stevens and Ratliff on why he does what he does.What we do see is flem ridding the town of the baser elements of his own family while he attemps to raise his own moral and social standing. He uses and destroys everyone around him to get what he wants. At the end, he is all alone."},{"Title":"The Town: A Novel of the Snopes Family","review":"Faulkner does take your full attention to understand his writing but I would recommend it read as a series as it's intended."},{"Title":"The Town: A Novel of the Snopes Family","review":"This is a much more complex story than we find in its prequel The Hamlet.

And a Model Ship builder. The historical period between coming solely away from Sail power to Sail and Staem power is covered fully in this text. The Illustrations are excellent and the author has done his homework. An easy read and easy to understand. This book covers a void in the periods between 1850's and the early 1900's. When Naval Ships were crossing over from sail power to a combination of both Staem and Sail. A good example of this is the French Navies Ship \\"The Napoleon\\" 1857. As well as the American ship U.S.S. Susquehanna, 1860 and the U.S.S. Kearsarge 1863. Not forgetting of course the C.S.S. Alabama 1863. Confederite Raider of the American Civil War. I call this book a Transistion Book and not many authiors seem to cover this period in Nautical History. For some reason this era is almost forgotten. But none the less. It needs to be studied and understood. So one can experience the full gammet of Naval Histories.The book contains dates, and Illustrations of various ships from this time period.

Fortunately, this great team effort fills the gap. Among the contributors are Andrew Lambert and David K. Brown, both authors of notable works about this period that are not currently in print. The authors cover developments with a focus on the Royal Navy and French Navy, but do not ignore developments elsewhere, and the chapter on the American Civil War will prove a useful introduction to those who may not realize what a crucible of experimentation that conflict proved to be. Other chapters cover the development of paddle warships, the steam-auxiliary ships of the line, warships built of iron, the introduction of steel as the material of choice, and the final pre-Dreadnought era. Given chapters of their own are the development of the torpedo boat, early submarines, naval armament and armor, and a very useful chapter on the varying kinds of steam engines in use during the period. The book is well illustrated with period photographs and illustrations. It would be a useful addition to your naval history library at any price."},{"Title":"Michael Jackson American Master","review":"This book, authorized by MJJ Productions and with a foreword from Mr. Bob Jones, is absolutely unique and precious in content, purpose and appearance.

It really addresses how our thought process is crucial to how we perceive, and thus change, our lives and the world.I am amazed that the author is 60 years old, and is not a &quot;fan&quot; (check out the Amazon interview with Ms. C. Mecca). Her objectivity in arriving at her conclusions adds credence to the message (this is further detailed, as I discovered, in the foreword from Mr.Bob Jones, called &quot;The Essence&quot;). The message itself takes us back to the basics of universal principles, and also brings to light the truth about many things about Mr. Jackson which we are all curious about.It breaks down, into steps, the process of changing the world by changing the way we think. It transcends any religion, and shows us through the example of Mr. Jackson's life and accomplishments, that we can all achieve mastership in our endeavors.The book itself is beautiful cover-to-cover. There is no way to describe it - one must see it, and feel it, and then it is overwhelming. At first, I thought it might a little pricey, but once it was in my hands, I immediately realized that, even simply based on quality, it was quite underpriced. A classic? Depends on the value the public assigns to it over time. Very well could be. It is definitely a collector's quality work in every sense of the word, as was promised.Of course, the icing on the cake is the fact that it is authorized, without any negativity of any kind within its pages.

Unfortunately, this early title from Leisure was not at all a harbinger of their bright future.\\"Dan enjoyed what he did. Tremendously! It gave him the freedom to do whatever he chose, seeing and doing what some men only dreamed about. It enabled hom to make the move from a hustling city like New York toa quiet little place like Kinston, North Carolina-- a move for the better, despite what his publisher, John McVey had said.\\" (p. 34)Once you have recovered from the trauma of reading that paragraph, we'll continue.The grammatical horror presented there (in a paragraph chosen at random) as augmented by Fain's propensity for italicizing words seemingly at random:\\"Tommy was after her constantly to exercise and try to keep some semblance of her former figure, but she just lost interest in herself. She probably figured that since she had already got her man, there was no longer a need to do anything but sit around, watch the soaps on television, eat Hershey Bars and drink Mountain Dews.\\" (p. 57) (For those of you not reading in HTML-- since Amazon refuses to let us put italics in Amazon reviews-- \\"got her man,\\" \\"Hershey bars,\\" and \\"Mountain Dews\\" are italicized in that section.)The grammatical idiocy of this book might possibly be overlooked, or at least pushed to the back burner, with a sufficiently intriguing plot, exceptionally well-drawn characters, or a well-thought-out mystery (or, of course, any combination of the above). We get none of these things. The book is painfully predictable, and this is heightened by the first scene, which supposedly takes place ten years after the events in the rest of the book (though even that is called into question by the book's epilogue, which seems to place the frame the day after the events in the final chapter). All this, unfortunately, represents the publisher very badly; assuming an editor hadn't rejected the manuscript out of hand, that editor should have required extensive revision before publishing this monstrosity. Were I not already quite familiar with some of the wonderful stuff Leisure has put out over the years (for example, six of William Schoell's eight brilliant eighties horror novels, and their recent championing of such horror lights as Richard Laymon, Edward Lee, Simon Clark, and Charlee Jacob), I'd likely be scared off from ever reading another Leisure title. Thankfully, I discovered the great Schoell first, back when Leisure first released Spawn of Hell back in '83. I can only recommend that readers, even the most hardcore supernatural-horror fanatics, avoid this title like the plague. I'm giving it half a star because I finished it, but I wonder if it even deserves that. (half)"},{"Title":"Gaia: A New Look at Life on Earth","review":"Gaia: A new look at life on Earth, by James E. Lovelock, Oxford University Press, 1979, 176 ffThis was the first book on the subject that Lovelock wrote presenting the idea that we need to regard Earth as a holistic, interacting, organic system. It is organic not only in the sense that it is teeming with life. It is organic also in the sense that it is a continually interacting system and, until or unless humankind exerts its disruptive influence, it is also capable of renewal and readjustment of one system if changes, natural or artificial, are produced in another system. Referring to Galileo's struggle with Church hierarchy in his attempt to introduce some rationalism concerning the planetary system into Church dogma, Lovelock comments:\`It is the scientific establishment that now forbids heresy'. \`Heresy' here should be taken to mean anything that does not conform to established scientific ideas. Biologist Richard Dawkins is one of those vociferously opposed to any such notion as Gaia.Lovelock was surprised that scientists regarded his Gaia metaphor as teleological, suggesting the action of some divine purpose, while the theologians asked him to deliver a sermon in a prestigious cathedral in New York! The rest of this short book presents information supporting Lovelock's Gaia hypothesis by considering data from land, sea and air. There is also an interesting chapter on Cybernetics - communication and control in self-regulating systems. Lovelock says that that is precisely what humankind is not doing.There are some surprising and controversial statements in the book: \`ozone depletion cannot be as lethal as it is often made out to be'; \`A high level of technology is by no means always energy-dependent'; \`the very concept of pollution is anthropocentric and it may be irrelevant in the Gaian context'; \`if half of all of the nuclear weapons in the world's arsenals...were used in nuclear war, the effects on most of the human and man-made ecosystems of the world would be small at first would be small at first and would become negligible in thirty years' - I think the Chernobyl disaster would make most of us question that statement.I think the concept of Earth as an environment with which we constantly interact and which we drastically alter at our peril is an important one - indeed it may well be crucial to our survival as a species."},{"Title":"Gaia: A New Look at Life on Earth","review":"This is not a new book or a new topic but the source of an essential concept. At this point, the notion that the planet Earth is a living, breathing bio-system seems obvious; but originally Lovelock's idea was not easily accepted.

From a planetary engineering point of view, life terraformed this planet and the biodiversity of life - from microcosmic phytoplankton to Blue whales - maintain the critical balance of the global ecosystem.

This quest began about fifteen years ago and has ranged through the territories of many different scientific disciplines, indeed from astronomy to zoology... I have frequently used the word Gaia as a shorthand for the hypothesis itself, namely that the biosphere is a self-regulating entity with the capacity to keep our planet healthy by controlling the chemical and physical environment.\\"Here are some additional quotations from the book:\\"Our results convinced us that the only feasible explanation of the Earth's highly improbable atmosphere was that it was being manipulated on a day-to-day basis from the surface, and that the manipulator was life itself.\\" (Pg. 6)\\"By now a planet-sized entity, albeit hypothetical, had been born... It needed a name. Fortunately the author William Golding was a fellow-villager. Without hesitation he recommended that the creature be called Gaia, after the Greek Earth goddess (Ge) ... from which root the sciences of geography and geology derive their names.\\" (Pg. 10)\\"We have since defined Gaia as a complex entity involving the earth's biosphere, atmosphere, oceans, and soil; the totality constituting a feedback or cybernetic system which seeks an optimal physical and chemical environment for life on this planet. The maintenance of relatively constant conditions by active control may be conveniently described by the term 'homeostasis.'\\" (Pg. 11)\\"For the present, while the evidence for (Gaia's) existence is still inconclusive, it will serve as one kind of map of circuit diagram to compare with what we may find in further exploration.\\" (Pg. 63)\\"If we assume Gaia's existence, we can make other assumptions which shed a new light on our place in the world.\\" (Pg. 126)\\"There can be no prescription, no set of rules, for living within Gaia. For each of our different actions there are only consequences.\\" (Pg. 140)\\"From a Gaian viewpoint, all attempts to rationalize a subjugated biosphere with man in charge are doomed to failure as the similar concept of benevolent colonialism.\\" (Pg. 145)"},{"Title":"Gaia: A New Look at Life on Earth","review":"In Gaia: A New Look at Life on Earth, environmentalist James Lovelock presents us with a revolutionary way of viewing Planet Earth. He describes the world as though it is a singular organism in and of itself, an analogy that facilitates understanding of difficult issues and scientific facts in an interesting and intuitive format. He explicates with extreme lucidity the interdependent relationship between the elements of the ocean, the air, and the land.The name Gaia is intended not to personify the Earth, but to reflect the fact that we too often look at all the entities on our planet separately, when in fact it would be most beneficial for us to first consider the world as a whole in much the same way we consider a human, with all the elements functioning inside of it more like organs; they don't necessarily function for the sake of one another, but all must function in order to maintain the well-being of the organism as a whole.Once we are comfortable visualizing the world like this, we can begin to dissect the serious problem of climate change from a new angle. First of all, although many people think of climate change simply as global warming, the issue is far more complex than this, and unfortunately, this popular definition is very misleading. It is important to understand that the term \\"climate change\\" encompasses all significant alterations or fluxions in global temperature, atmospheric oxygen, ocean salt, and the carbon cycle. Looking at the world not as a collection of many things but simply as Gaia, we become psychologically inclined to consider the effect of a fluxion in one of these categories on the others.In fact, current science seems to support the fact that none of the significant states or processes listed above does truly exist in a closed setting. It has been observed that a change in just one area frequently affects some or all of the others; they seem to be bound together through countless cycles of different size (e.g. Some changes in one area will affect all of the others, whereas other changes might only affect one other. The point is that it is extremely rare for a change to affect only the area of its immediate physical influence).For example, as rocks decompose, they release carbon into the soil and the atmosphere. As the atmosphere becomes full of more carbon, the temperature heats up, and this creates a temperature very suitable for the growth of many species of plants, so we see an increase in plant populations. And of course, the plants ultimately return the carbon to the soil. Ongoing studies show a trend that when seawater flows over certain types of rock, it may become saltier. Therefore, depending on how quickly the rock decomposes and on whether it is carried to another section of land or it remains in the water, the water may increase slightly or significantly in salinity over time.James Lovelock has made some fascinating and very important observations about the symbiotic relationship between the ocean salt, oxygen in the atmosphere, global temperature, and carbon cycle in the world. When we talk about climate change, he reminds us that we need to carefully and closely monitor all of these things, because a sudden or serious change in one can spell out imminent trouble for the others. Fighting climate change is a battle with many arenas. Just like we need to do regular checkups on all of the organs and systems in our bodies to ensure that we remain healthy, we need to pay attention to and understand the importance of even one small change in a major part of the Earth's composition. If we allow a problem to go untreated, we may be faced with widespread disaster as the problem grows and infiltrates other natural processes."},{"Title":"Gaia: A New Look at Life on Earth","review":"I'm known as an environmentalist. I'm not or will never be a scientist of Lovelock's experience, but I do appreciate that he was given credit for promoting his heretofore unsung \\"Western\\" hypothesis that the Earth is a homeostatic organism. Aboriginal cultures knew this and agreed with it, and Lovelock acknowledges that in this book. So this book is the first \\"scientific\\" recognition of which I know that such a self-regulating phenomenon would be possible. For that it's absolutely invaluable. Science is by nature reductionistic, and Lovelock's book works in the opposite direction, toward being inclusionistic. It's interesting that he acknowledges that no single human could ever grasp the whole of science now, and that scientists typically know only a subsection of a single chapter in the book of life or knowledge. True.And, the style of this book would be something used by a learned English man 30 years back, when it was published, to make his science accessible. Lovelock would have been at that point the kind of guy you'd love to meet at the pub night after night, and have him regale you with his hypotheses, and you'd have a fabulous time. For an impatient reader like me, I found myself skipping through many sections to cut to Lovelock's conclusions.

The aim is to get the reader thinking that Earth is alive, and does have the same functions an organism. For example, the chemistry of the atmosphere and the ocean are controlled by life for the purposes maintaining the planet as a haven for life's continuance.Life does appear to drive the planet away from the expected chemical equilibria. To this I give Lovelock credit for drawing a brilliant parallel that makes the book worth reading. There is a sort of alternate equilibrium under life's influence that hasn't been studied enough. The book really can change the way one looks at Earth. I'm not perfectly convinced with the precision here, but this is far better than picturing random life trying to survive on a otherwise dead world.However, there were some chapters in the second half that were weak, and seemingly off-the-point.

Why? Because it's already a classic. I am so confused about the nature of this book. If it is fiction, it is alright that the author would like to rest on his literatry achievement and not change a word of it. But it is supposed to be a scientific hypothesis which must be sustained with the best known scientific research to day. As I read thorugh it, I have no idea what still holds true, and what bit of science is outdated, and the author never bothered even to add a footnote to explain that. It's a real struggle. I am so annoyed. Just to make it worse, the author seemed to use the book to demonstrate his literary prowess, deliberately blurring the fine line between science and science fiction. The narrative is poorly constructed, weighed down with a clutter of basics of outdated chemistry, rudimentary cybernetics, and porous passages of imaginative outbursts. The worst thing is, as a book, well, a classical book on ecology, it seems the author himself is not well trained in ecology and the book didn't even talk much about ecology. The first three chapters prepare the reader for the book (all background analogies made out of obsolete science), the last three chapters constitute a call upon environmentalism (ok), and among the mid three chapters, the first one explains how an oven works (don't laugh, it's true), the last two chapters talked about atmosphere and ocean and yet, what a shame of its content!I suspect the author didn't want to change the text so the different versions of basically the same idea could be sold and sold again. Don't buy it, just google it. It's all there on the internet.The book might be a great eye-opener 30 years ago, but now it's a joke."},{"Title":"Gaia: A New Look at Life on Earth","review":"Product arrived promptly in perfect condition. Amazon is a great shopping resource. Keep up the good work!"},{"Title":"Gaia: A New Look at Life on Earth","review":"I ordered this book hoping for some scientific evidence supporting what I already knew from personal experience; that there is a gestalt emerging from all of the beings in the universe. An emergent property that some call \`the spirit that moves through all things' and some call \`god' and I was hoping that this book would call it Gaia. Bah! The author totally ignores the metaphysical evidence and misrepresents the impact of civilization on the natural world. He also misrepresents the relationship tribal aka primitive cultures had with the natural world. Furthermore, this isn't even good science. Typically I pass books on to friends or trade them at a used bookstore. The best thing about this book was how easily the pages tore out to become kindling for my fire. If I could I would give it a negative rating -- don't pollute your mind with this trash."},{"Title":"Gaia: A New Look at Life on Earth","review":"James Lovelock has created a powerful and interesting argument in this book that will keep scientists busy for centuries. He notices that there is an ability for the Earth to maintain relatively constant conditions in temperature, atmosphere, salinity and pH of the oceans, and reductions in pollutants that defies the simple observations of what &quot;should&quot; happen. From this, he concludes that there is a complex of physical, chemical and biological interrelationships that work like a living organism, which he defines as the Gaia Hypothesis. For defining that concept and providing some of the measurements to establish its premises, he deserves a 7 star rating.Unfortunately, the argument is expressed in overlong and convoluted fashion. He deliberately limits himself to a nonscientific explanation in this book. The scientific version of the argument is in The Ages of Gaia. Although the book is not long, it certainly could have been condensed into a longish article for Scientific American or The Atlantic Monthly. My second quibble is that the editor was nowhere in sight on the organization of the book. The key point is often buried in the third sentence of the last paragraph in a chapter. The argument in between wanders into all kinds of places where it doesn't need to go. For organization and editing, I give this book a one star rating.So the average is a 4 star rating. The writing itself is pleasant enough. Don't let the lack of organization and editing put you off, for it is worth your while to read this book. It will remind you of the benefits of the sort of sytems thinking that Peter Senge talks about in The Fifth Discipline.The other thing you will learn is the weakness of scientific work that fails to develop enough field data and to connect enough with other disciplines. I was struck by the same observations recently while visiting environmental scientists at the Smithsonian Institution. The basics in many of these areas have yet to be measured and evaluated. This book will point countless generations forward in understanding how our plant maintains its environment that permits life to flourish. Clearly, it is a stallbusting effort to replace &quot;stalled&quot; thinking about the history and future of the Earth. I found the key questions (such as why doesn't the ocean become more saline?) to be irresistible. I think you will, too. Enjoy and think!"},{"Title":"Gaia: A New Look at Life on Earth","review":"Although parts of the text are confusing and too deep for a mere mortal like myself, this book changed the whole way I look at the earth and my own role upon it, not to mention the part my species is taking. Reading and re-reading yields great rewards, the arguments, whether agreed with or not, are cogent and thought provoking, and will provide for many a night spent in those deep discussions with friends"},{"Title":"Gaia: A New Look at Life on Earth","review":"In essence, Lovelock says that since evolution started eons ago, all forms of life evolved together resulting not only in balance among themselves and their surroundings, but also in such a way that they regulate the environment, controlling the atmosphere, the salinity of the seas and the temperature. This complex eco-system is presumably an inevitable consequence of the algorithm of evolution running successfully. Want to know if there is life on another planet? Easy, look at the atmosphere.This comes out in the book, but it is a bit bizarre. Lovelock seems to go from anthropomorphism (the world learning to breath and making decisions) to using scientific terms that the average non-science reader will have to look up. He presents a table on page 63 that I think is incomprehensible unless you understood the work that went into it, which is not presented. He finishes with a plea not to hunt whales, which seems like a strange non-sequester to the book as whole.As a consequence of this he seems to have appealed to crystal-swinging, horoscope-reading new age wo-wos rather than hard scientists. This is a shame, because the idea is brilliant (thus 4-stars), and could result in decades of research, added to which Gaia is a great name. It seems self-evident that we are part of and completely dependent upon the environment around us. Lovelock has such faith in the self-regulating mechanisms, he rather pooh poohs our ability to mess with it too much. However, it seems to me that evolution and balance takes time - we do things incredibly fast - our ability to warm the globe has only been for a couple of hundred years. We could easily give Gaia a fever, by overcoming her ability to make gentle regulations. If this happens, we do not know what the results will be, but we almost certainly will not benefit from them. As they say; \\"nature bats last\\".Everyone should read this book and, despite its faults, it is readable."},{"Title":"Gaia: A New Look at Life on Earth","review":"Reading Edward Wilson's \\"The Future of Life\\" served as the spark to pick up and read this book. And its true, good things do come in small packages. The book is all of 140 pages, and is written in a lean, but not glossed-over style. Robert Lovelock (to my knowledge) is the contemporary father of the study of the earth as a complete living system.Lovelock readily admits that the book serves more to promote the dialog about our planet as a living, breathing whole and to share key discoveries that support his concept. (He states in the Preface that his follow-on book, \\"The Ages of Gaia\\" aims to build the scientific argument to the Gaia theory.)By no means, does Lovelock detour around the science that supports his case. With the scope of the topic requiring knowledge of both physical and biological science, and the small number of pages, he manages to instruct and create a sense of awe in a short amount of time.The 3 major principles he brings to light about Gaia are:1. Gaia exhibits a tendency to keep conditions (e.g., temperature, air quality) constant for all terrestrial life.2. Like other living systems, Gaia has vital organs at the core, and expandable or redundant ones on the periphery.3. Under the worse conditions, Gaia responses similar to other cybernetic systems (i.e., where time constant and loop gain are important)The material is far reaching in both its scope and in shaping our understanding of where we stand. Put in the context of Gaia, we have straddled ourselves to the largest of all known living and breathing creatures."},{"Title":"Gaia: A New Look at Life on Earth","review":"Gaia: A New Look at Life on Earth is an overall good read. J.E. Lovelock gives valuable insight into the Gaia theory and supports it with convincing evidence of a surprisingly large variety. Proving that the life in Earth's biosphere may sound like a dauntingly complex task, but this little book presents information in a way that even the less scientifically minded can understand; high school and college students everywhere will applaud the lack of a dictionary in this particular reading experience. The analogies used throughout the book are creative and sometimes odd, but help immensely with the reader's understanding of the subject.The content of this book is fascinating and highly credible. Even better, the chapters are well organized for a comprehensible read. Lovelock, while mostly concerned with explaining the Gaia theory itself, also endeavors to address questions the contemporary reader would present, such as what processes are a part of Gaia, what effect pollution has on Gaia, and what human population Gaia can sustain. He also hypothesizes on how Gaia came to be, what could injure Gaia on a global scale, and how humans can harmonize with Gaia.Though this little layman's guide is very interesting and well-written, this high school student thinks that going a bit more in-depth and focusing instances of conjecture more if possible, though these suggestions may well have been addressed since the 1989 version. I'm sure there is much more information and support for the Gaia theory since then, and the recent edition even has a spiffy new cover.I give this book a three for the fluency with which it presents an obscure theory to the masses, and the convincing evidence actually used. There is, however, room for more information, and sometimes it is unclear what is conjecture, what is known fact, and where some speculations fall in between. If you have an interest in the Gaia theory or just want to find out more about how you and fit into the world, or how the world fits in with you, I recommend Gaia: A New Look at Life on Earth for an enjoyable and thought-provoking read."},{"Title":"Gaia: A New Look at Life on Earth","review":"James Lovelock's book \\"Gaia: A New Look at Life on Earth\\" reads like a libertarian manifesto. No doubt, many well-intentioned liberal environmentalists will be turned off by his laissez-faire approach to polution, as he believes that Gaia (the Earth-organism) can, and has handled much worse than our man-made pollution of the present day. Likewise, self-absorbed capitalists and fiscal conservatives may feel redeemed by some of Lovelock's claims, and may quote passages of this book to their liberal family members to score points in some future debate.However, it would be wrong to interpret Lovelock as condoning pollution and the misdeeds of mankind. Lovelock instead implores us to participate in Gaia from a Taoist perspective, by learning to work with, rather than against the ways of the Earth. He believes (as do I) that we can only do this when we fully understand how the Earth has changed throughout history (including the environmental holocausts that the Earth has already endured), and how it presently changes to maintain a global homeostasis.After reading this book I felt encouraged by the strength and mother Earth, and impressed by her ability to adapt to a wide range of near-cataclysmic events. My only critique of the book is that Lovelock sometimes makes certain leaps in his explanations, which at times left me (a lay scientist) confused as I was reading through them."},{"Title":"Gaia: A New Look at Life on Earth","review":"Simply written, mythically convincing, and conveying an idea--Gaia--so evident to the intuitive feel of life here that it's hard even to summon the will to question it.Lovelock treads difficult ground. Apparently unaware of depth psychology's amplifications of the &quot;anima mundi,&quot; the World Soul described by Plato and so many aboriginal socities, Lovelock seeks to move the proof into the realm of science without sounding--in this book--overly scientific.One could wish he'd dreamed into the Gaia image more deeply and less literally. At the same time, empirical research could go a long way toward establishing the systemic, globe-regulating processes he envisions in this book. Whether such science would convince those who benefit financially from colonizing and exploiting the world's resources is open to question.While I don't share the author's optimistic belief in Gaia's capacity to regulate herself despite our ever-increasing power to disrupt her systems, I admire the attempt to give current form to an ancient idea...an idea with tremendous archetypal punch and relevancy.If you buy this book, use it as a point of departure--into biology, ecology, or ecopsychology, perhaps. Or into that state of humility that pauses to wonder what the world is thinking and feeling."},{"Title":"Gaia: A New Look at Life on Earth","review":"I read this book sometime ago and is impacted me significantly as it has with many others. I enjoyed the explanation of the huge organism (Earth) that is self- regulating. I also enjoyed that Lovelock points out that we humans are part of the environment and belong here. We will produce waste.Having said that, any system can overload. Thus, we need to be good stewards of our planet.As the astronauts left the earth in the 1960's and headed towards the moon they looked back at our planet and did not see borders or countries. They saw the earth as a single unit...beautiful and fragile. It rotated on an invisible string in the blackness of night. It affected many of the astronauts profoundly.The book has already helped many more people see the earth as a single unit. If it can continue to do that, hopefully we will find a way to live more harmoniously with the environment on our planet.Gaia is a great read and a way of looking at things that is both fascination and enlightening!The Re-Discovery of Common Sense: A Guide to: The Lost Art of Critical Thinking"},{"Title":"Gaia: A New Look at Life on Earth","review":"A really interesting book, and hypothesis.

This is definitely a thought provoking piece of work."},{"Title":"Gaia: A New Look at Life on Earth","review":"An intriguing new look at our planet. Lovelock extols the need for a more holistic approach to science after its centuries of moving towards ever more specialization and reductionism. 'Gaia' is the metaphor for his top-down look at Earth - literally - and what makes it 'tick'. He makes the reader aware of the adaptability of life to whatever conditions prevail and the consequent near-impossibility of achieving lasting equilibrium (as of a dead planet). He describes the complex interaction of atmosphere and sea as well as the impact of life thereon both from organisms on land and in the sea, and he raises interesting questions about the nature of pollution. All this leads to his hypothesis (now known as the Gaia Theory) that Earth - through the life it spawned - is itself a self regulating living system, where planetary homeostasis is achieved and maintained by living organisms.In 'Living with Gaia' he discusses two mainstream views: man as Earth's steward and man as Earth's tragedy or even its scourge, but avoids a direct answer by emphasizing the cybernetic qualities of Gaia. All he says is, that man being a part of that system, but also with the ability to influence it significantly, may play a role in it - for better or worse.In contrast to Lovelock's later books 'The Revenge of Gaia' and 'Vanishing Gaia', which are dire warnings, 'Gaia' is simply the presentation of the original hypothesis, and in a very elegant way at that, to make it accessible to the non-scientist too."},{"Title":"Violent No More: Helping Men End Domestic Abuse","review":"I just completed a training in treatment of men who abuse women with Anne Ganley, PhD, who has worked many years in the field and is the acknowledged expert in this part of the country.

Violent No More helps readers to understand how a culture of violence and dominance teaches men to rely on violence to get their needs met in intimate relationships, and yet how those needs can never be adequately met without developing the skills required for equal mutual relationships.

Too often, they make choices based upon using the often swift, and expedient method to control what they see as a positive outcome: the result they seek with minimal output on their part. Failing to appreciate the autonomy of the &quot;individuals&quot; who rely upon their wisdom as well as their purse, they begin to feel all-powerful and in control. This view of measuring masculinity may well be centuries old, and cultivated to encourage the protective instincts of males in their roles as providers as well as protectors. But it reduces their charges to little more than inanimate objects as possessions, to do with as they please, and as if they had no feelings that could be harmed; or that the harm done is irrelevant. The mere fact that males have choices is a world previously unknown to women, who, by and large, have had no choice. Seen by an economic system as dependent upon males, they and their children have always been at the mercy of their males, and their choice of treatment. The greatest failing of mankind, itself, was to give men this choice since it is wholly subjective in purpose, manner and method. The fact that the author maintains that illusion by suggesting that men have a choice is preposterous, and characteristic of the flaws that have been built into society that permits men to become batterers in the first place. The choice of when or upon whom violence is acceptable to use in humanity was a lesson very early in Christian teaching with the don of Cain and Abel, the Great Flood, and Soddom and Gomorrah which were not well learned, and give the impression that anger is godly, and an appropriate response to displeasure. While we might have learned that when Cain killed Abel, the banishment was the point and effect of using violence, instead we incorporated the acceptance of violence in the daily affairs of men as a necessary consequence of settling differences. This unjust premise has yet to be effectively challenged successfully. It is very much a &quot;male&quot; view of privilege as well as responsibility in the defense of oneself, and one's community. It is an age old problem that paves the path to war and as expected, wars have been the result. The failure of men to view their masculinity without war and violence is questionable and often seen as weak, and passive. For this reason, the perpetuation of the privilege to use violence to solve any problem is suspect, and may well be ignorant. Keeping the peace is rarely a sufficient criteria of measuring the level of violence that exists in a community since what is seen usually takes no account of what is unseen. A code of violence for living is the code men must refuse to accept to achieve peace, and to earn respect, and maintain dignity. Violence robs men of dignity and respect."},{"Title":"Violent No More: Helping Men End Domestic Abuse","review":"A very outdated book in light of the recent research showing that women are just as likely as men to initiate a violent confrontation with an intimate partner. The book takes the VAWA approach in condemning men whilst never touching on the accountabilities of women as the culprits of a majority of child abuse.Whilst we continue to target men as evil and women as saints we run the risk of ignoring many victims, which is exactly what VAWA has done. The policy of assuming all men and only men are the culprits will shift much needed funds and attention from other victims who suffer just as much.This book needs to be accompanied with one targeting women and the domestic violence they are accountable for. Perhaps Andrea Yates would not be famous if society took a 'Stop all abuse by everyone' approach.2 stars for the effort, but this is a step in the wrong direction for both equality and helping everyone who suffers from abuse."},{"Title":"Honorable spy,","review":"\\"HONORABLE SPY\\" ; Exposing Japanese Military Intrigue in the United States by John L.

In a way he stands alone, for as far as I can tell he has not overtly used other writers styles and no contemporary writer has used Francis as a primary influence. All of Francis' books follow a similar arc, from one to the next, you know exactly what you will get. But in a strange way, this is not bothersome, instead it is like revisiting an old familiar and comfortable place.Francis' books are not in a series format. He only uses the same character for a second time once. In his first ten or so books, he uses a particular jockey to set his story around. And later he finds people of different professions that have racing interests to center stories around. This book, \\"For Kicks\\" is from the transitional phase, the late 60's, early 70's. It tells the story of Daniel Roke, a trainer from Australia who is hired to uncover a doping ring that is not being detected through traditional meathods. Its a pretty simple story, and like all of Francis' work it is refreshingly understated. With James Patterson and Patricia Cornwells mamoth body counts and terrorising serial killers, or end of the world scenarios ala Tom Clancy and too many others influencing todays reading lists, its amazing to see how much quiet tension builds up in Francis' stories.I would highly recommend Francis to anyone. Its a fun world to live in for a while, where all of England revolves around the racing world... every other profesion comes second. I remember how much I loathed the idea of Francis before I first read him and I laugh now at my perception of what his books would be about. I mean, how can one author base a huge series of mysteries on racing horses? Dick Francis does so quite well."},{"Title":"For Kicks","review":"I agree completely with the other reviewers. This is a terrific suspense novel that happens to give insight into British racing, the class system and each and every character. While I have read all the Dick Francis books, this is the one that I go back to and reread every year or so. Its quiet, understated tone still builds up to suspense and excitement.His earlier books (like this one) are the best, as far as I am concerned, and the most recent one or two are not worth reading.p.s.

This tale takes place mainly in the stables and not the race track like most of the writer's other stories and it is interesting in that it shows just how much back breaking work is involved in caring for the valuable race horses. Dan Roke, an Australian, is lured away from his quiet, successful life and whisked into a very different existence, trying to uncover a race fixing scheme. While the story is loaded with suspense and menace it is the character of the man that stays with you after the book is finished. Roke is a very original fictional creation, unique among the templated heroes that fill most modern thrillers. In the chaos of modern living it is nice to know there are authors like Dick Francis, whose work never disappoints. If his name is on the cover the story is going to be unlike anything else you've read and a satisfying experience."},{"Title":"For Kicks","review":"For Kicks is a wonderful read, for those who love Dick Francis' style and substance, and for those who are discovering him for the first time. This is my favourite, along with Blood Sport and Dead Cert. All his early books reek of the special atmosphere of British racing, and his understated, self-deprecating manner is still delightful, if increasingly out of vogue. You know what you are going to get, when you read a Dick Francis, but the joy is in rediscovering what you like, in a slightly different cocktail. What I like most about him is his no-fuss attitude, and the gentle, almost unnoticeable ease with which his tough guy heroes fall in love.

It's a superb book."},{"Title":"For Kicks","review":"This was the first of the Dick Francis I read and it was stupendious.

She didn't have time for any type of serious relationship, despite the advances and the offers she has received. She is content to spend her life caring for Davina (Davy), her spirited daughter - or at least, that is what Sarah tells herself. But when she darts out in front of a car in a thunderstorm, she meets the most intriguing man - and she suddenly wonders how she can let this wonderfully intriguing man walk out of her life. If he stays in her life, though, she will be forced to divulge a secret that could destroy her daughter and the life Sarah has eked out for the both of them.Jake Hogan had dreamed of running into the woman of his dreams - although he never meant literally! But when the business tycoon accidentally hits Sarah Tracy in the middle of a thunderstorm, he is transfixed by her beauty and charm. He is determined to get to know this woman better, but she seems so withdrawn and standoffish most of the time. He can tell there is something in her past that is preventing her from getting too involved with him, but he won't let that stop him, for one way or another, Stacy and Davina are meant to be a part of his family for keeps!I enjoyed this book as something different from what I usually read. Although the book is clearly set in England, the lingo was usually toned to a minimum and even I, an English-is-my-second-language reader, didn't have too much difficulty deciphering what the author meant by using British lingo. I liked the character of Sarah, and could identify with her as a single mother myself. Sarah had a difficult time because she was always looking for a potential step-father to Davy, as well as a mate, all rolled into one package. I could definitely relate to that. I also liked the character of Jake Hogan because he wanted to include Sarah's child in their relationship too, instead of just shutting Davy out.As for Sarah's secret, it was not what I expected it to be at first. After being told halfway through the book what the secret was not, it didn't take too much to figure out what it was. The secret itself was a bit of a let-down, and although there was much tension leading up the revealing of the secret, the secret itself was rather anticlimactic. Once the secret was revealed, the rest of the book had a few subplots shoved into it to spice up the story, but those subplots were rather rushed and one was just solved way too easily. Altogether, though, this wasn't a bad book, and was actually quite enjoyable for the most part. The book earned a solid four star rating from me. This book was reissued by Harlequin Presents in June 2004. The cover is different, but the text is the same."},{"Title":"Antisemitism: The Longest Hatred","review":"Published in 1991, this book predicted the resurgence of the ancient hatred; it was unfortunately correct. In the introduction Wistrich discusses the problematic term Antisemitism then briefly explores its continuity and development down the ages. He does not believe that history provides definitive answers to the Why? of the phenomenon but emphasizes the importance of understanding the How? of it. The most enduring conspiracy theory of all times, it's a shape shifter and nothing seems able to stop it.Part One examines its pagan roots, its lethal and influential infection of Christianity at an early date and the course it took in Western Europe until the early 1990s. This section includes the medieval legacy when the phenomenon took a particularly ugly turn, Martin Luther, the Holocaust and post-war attitudes in Germany and Austria where it evidently never died. Previously neither the Reformation nor the Enlightenment put an end to it. It instead just mutated along lines acceptable to the Zeitgeist. After World War II the pattern of European guilt-denial has led to increasing anti-Zionism in a process of displacement and projection. Hatred of the Jewish people is being transferred to the Jewish State.Part Two looks at the history in Britain, France, Hungary, Rumania, Czech, Poland and Russia. Of interest here is how the thing persists even in the absence of Jewish people like in Poland in the late 1980s, and how the US strain has mercifully always been less virulent than the European. I am afraid that things have deteriorated since the publication of this book. The long history of popular and state antisemitism in Russia has been revived, with the country's open support of rogue states and terrorist groups like Hamas, Hezbollah, Syria and Iran. And in Old Europe, the large immigrant communities are in the vanguard.Part Three deals with the Islamic world and includes chapters on the history which contained ups and downs as in the Christian world, the explosion of antisemitism in the literature and media of the Arab states since 1948, the issue of Palestine with reference to the notoriousHaj Amin al-Husseini, and includes a chapter on Arabism, Semitism & Antisemitism.Peace: The Arabian Caricature of Anti-Semitic Imageryby Arieh Stav provides a window on the Arab press, proving that anti-Zionism is not merely a political instrument but an idea with cultural, racial and theological dimensions. Its most visible host on the international stage is the United Nations and its agencies.Wistrich argues that the Western psyche is permeated by this ancient hatred, a deeply disturbing thought. The agnostic postmodern Westerner is just as susceptible as the medieval Christian because antisemitism was inherited by the new hosts: the religion's secular salvationist offspring like socialism, fascism, Marxism and environmentalism. In this regard, please seeThe Resurgence of Anti-Semitism: Jews, Israel, and Liberal Opinionby Bernard Harrison and Barry Horner'sFuture Israel: Why Christian Anti-Judaism Must Be Challenged. Nowadays its Christian hosts include the World Council of Churches and liberal mainstream Protestant denominations. Its spirit is a revived Replacement Theology propagated by Jimmy Carter and Anglican theologians associated with the Sabeel Ecumenical Centre ofNaim Ateek.As to the Why of it, I have foundWhy the Jews? The Reason for Antisemitismby Dennis Prager & Joseph Telushkin quite instructive and illuminating. I agree with the French writer Andre Glucksmann that the concept of a contagion of hatred must be taken literally as a mental disorder that invades minds, bodies and society. Such an outbreak inoculates itself against those who oppose it and is immune to reason. Phyllis Chesler'sThe New Anti-Semitismshines a revealing light on its latest mutations. William Nicholls has done sterling work on the painful subject ofChristian Antisemitism, whilst Paul Charles Merkley examines the state of Anti-Zionism and Philosemitism in the churches today inChristian Attitudes Towards the State of Israel. Drawing on ancient wisdom, Yoram Hazony looks at ways of dealing with it inThe Dawn: Political Teachings of the Book of Esther.Antisemitism: The Longest Hatred contains numerous photographs & illustrations. There are copious notes arranged by chapter, a glossary, extensive bibliography and index. Because the virus mutates so fast the book is a bit outdated by now but it still serves as a valuable reference source."},{"Title":"Antisemitism: The Longest Hatred","review":"Wistrich is certainly correct in calling Antisemitism the longest hatred. Almost every culture, from ancient times to the present, has been infected with this philosophy. His book covers its history from Biblical times to the late 20th Century. The first two thirds look at Europan and western attitudes, and how they contributed to the holocaust and have changed since World War II. The final third examines the Islamic world and the present conflict over Israel. This last section is in many ways the most interesting, as it covers material many in the West may be less familiar with.The greatest weakness here is that while the author gives us many facts, he offers very little in the way of explanation. We learn almost nothing about why antisemitism has been so prevelant or so intense, or why, like a natural disaster, it flares up in cycles every so often. No one expects Wistrich to have the final answer here, but he should have made at least some attempt to discover the reasons for the 'longest hatred'."},{"Title":"Antisemitism: The Longest Hatred","review":"for my Masters degree, a must have book about Antisemitism , as it was a used book, i paid only 1 cent instead of 150 dollars"},{"Title":"Antisemitism: The Longest Hatred","review":"This is an excellent study based on extensive, thorough research of both ancient and modern-day anti-Semitism that destroys any myth that anti-Semitism is now on the decline.Introducing the definition of anti-Semitism as the hatred of Jews & Judaism (and not Semites in general), the writer displays a commendable knowledge of the subject while devoting a sizeable section of this book to revealing and analysing the re-emergence & immediacy of the virulent, racial hatred revived by the ongoing situation in the Middle East.Many readers will find this book both painful and shocking. The writer approaching the many aspects of anti-Semitism through the ages, not least of which being those originating through some aspects of 'Christianity', which were subsequently adopted by Nazism, Bolshevism and Islam. Certain revealed myths shown to provide the seedbed on which Nazi and other racialist doctrines/prejudices could flourish, dehumanising Jews & subsequently removing all/any moral restraints that opposed a persecution or genocide of the Jewish people.The book examines the erroneous, malignant myths like 'The Protocols Of The Elders Of Zion', (of which the Arab world is now the largest supplier), and how these have now taken root in the Middle East as another Islamic weapon against the Jewish State.The writer declaring that, despite being an absolute tissue of malicious lies, wherever there is a 'will' to believe such aberrations, events can always be made to fit the paranoid visions & homicidal hatred of a Jewish 'world conspiracy'.A whole section of the book is devoted to Jews living in Islamic lands & the question of 'Palestine'. Of particular note here is the revelation that the enforced wearing of the 'Yellow Badge' by Jews actually originated in Baghdad and not Europe. The 'dhimmi' status of Jews under Islamic rule is also studied, together with the post 1948 enforced expulsion of the Jewish populations from these Arab lands, together with the confiscation of all Jewish property.The author also describes how in recent years a vast anti-Jewish literature has appeared in Islamic/Arab countries, using theological, racial and 'demonological' motifs to vilify the Jews, including the revival of the 'blood libel' and the promotion of an image portraying Israel as a ruthless, oppressive nation . (Aryeh Stav's book \\"Peace; The Arabian Caricature\\" admirably covers this subject.). Anti-Jewish ideologies constantly being disseminated through books, newspapers, caricatures, radio and television, subsequently reaching mass audiences with this indoctrination.The complicity of the Arab world and the Mufti in Hitler's Holocaust is also discussed along with the Palestinian National Covenant. The latter, which has still not been rescinded, containing a basic premise which demands within nearly half of it's 33 articles, that the State of Israel must cease to exist.The present situation in the Middle East relating to the 'peace process' is also expounded with reference to the anti-Semitic diatribes within the International arena and the UN. In view of the study here, I cannot help but recall the statement of previous UN Secretary General Boutros-Gali which showed the real position of the UN;- \\"The Jews must give up their status as a nation and Israel as a state, and assimilate as a community in the Arab world.\\"Indeed, this essential study reveals that there is an underlying, universal precept at work pertaining to the Jews and the Middle East itself. I do not believe it is a desire for peace, but it is the distaste for the Jewish state. No other nation in the World is or has been treated in this way.I concur with what the author I believe is trying to convey within his discourse about the Islamic/Arab towards Israel, in that the issue here is not 'land for peace'! It is the very existence of the Jewish state in the land of 'Islam' in the Middle East that is the issue. An existence that will never be accepted by the Moslem world, irrespective of any boundaries.To elaborate slightly, when the Arab world demands a 'just peace', it is saying in effect that 'peace' can only come when Israel no longer exists and there are 'JUST' Arab nations in the Middle East. Perhaps readers will make up their own minds on this. This is one of the best works on anti-Semitism that I have come across to date and I highly recommend this book to everyone."},{"Title":"Antisemitism: The Longest Hatred","review":"Robert Wistrich predicted the return of the ancient hatred in this book published in 1991. In the introduction he analyses the problematic term Antisemitism. More appropriate terms might be Judeopathy or Judeophobia. Wistrich does not believe that there are definitive answers to the Why? of the phenomenon but emphasizes the importance of understanding the How? of it. The most enduring conspiracy theory of all times, it's a highly mutable mental virus that infects cultures, movements, ideologies and religions.Part One explores its roots in the pagan world, its lethal infection of Christianity at an early date and the course it has taken in Western Europe until the early 1990s. William Nicholls has thoroughly dissectedChristian Antisemitismin his book by that title. The virus proliferated in the Middle Ages and during the reformation infected Martin Luther whose writings contributed to creating a climate that made the Holocaust possible. Not even the Enlightenment put an end to it. Post-war attitudes in Germany and Austria show that it never died in Europe. After World War II the pattern of European guilt-denial has enabled the growth of anti-Zionism in a process of displacement and projection. Hatred of the Jewish people is being transferred to the Jewish State. Anti-Zionism may even be considered the typical form of the virus in the 21st century.In Part Two, Wistrich looks at the history in Britain, France, Hungary, Rumania, Czech, Poland and Russia. It is remarkable how the thing persists even in the absence of Jewish people like in Poland in the late 1980s, and in a place like Japan. The US strain has always been less virulent than the European but has now infected the universities to an alarming degree. Since the publication of this book the situation has deteriorated. Popular and state antisemitism in Russia has been revived as the country openly supports rogue states and terrorist groups like Hamas, Hezbollah, Syria and Iran. In Old Europe, the large immigrant communities are the major carriers.Part Three deals with the Islamic world in chapters on the history which contained ups and downs as in the Christian world, the explosion of antisemitism in the literature and media of the Arab states since the birth of Israel, the issue of Palestine and the notorious Haj Amin al-Husseini. In the Middle East, anti-Zionism is not merely a political instrument but a force with cultural, racial and theological dimensions. Its nature is revealed in the bookPeace: The Arabian Caricature of Anti-Semitic Imageryby Arieh Stav. The most prominent host of antisemitism on the international stage is the United Nations and its agencies.It may be argued that the Western psyche is permeated by the disease. The agnostic postmodern Westerner is just as susceptible as the medieval Christian because the virus was inherited by the religion's secular salvationist offspring like socialism, fascism, liberalism, Marxism and its mutations like multiculturalism. This is confirmed inThe Resurgence of Anti-Semitism: Jews, Israel, and Liberal Opinionby Bernard Harrison and Barry Horner'sFuture Israel: Why Christian Anti-Judaism Must Be Challenged. Its Christian hosts include the World Council of Churches and liberal mainstream Protestant denominations, driven by a resurgent Replacement Theology propagated by theologians associated with the Sabeel Ecumenical Centre of Naim Ateek, and aided and abetted by Jimmy Carter.Like most mental illnesses, antisemitism is immune to reason and fact, making it a difficult disease to combat. Transmission from one mind to another often occurs by means of tones of voice, hints and gestures. In psychological terms it is a form of psychopathy whilst in spiritual terms it's a type of demonic possession. Analyses of the irrational outbursts against Israel reveal an erotic quality and a psychic compulsion in the accusers to displace their own fear and guilt on to the other. Despite the lessons of history that has repeatedly demonstrated the unspeakable suffering it brings on the guilty and the innocent alike, people still become infected.As to the Why of it,Why the Jews? The Reason for Antisemitismby Dennis Prager & Joseph Telushkin is instructive and illuminating, and inChristian Attitudes Towards the State of IsraelPaul Charles Merkley exposes the state of Anti-Zionism and Philosemitism in the churches today. The alarming spread of the latest epidemic is examined by Phyllis Chesler inThe New Anti-Semitism: The Current Crisis and What We Must Do About Itand Abraham Foxman inNever Again?. Drawing on ancient wisdom, Yoram Hazony looks at ways of counteracting it inThe Dawn: Political Teachings of the Book of Esther.Antisemitism: The Longest Hatred contains numerous photographs & illustrations.

It is especially illuminating in its understanding of the new anti- Semitism which has come to the Islamic world. The bulk of the book however is devoted to European anti-Semitism and its disastrous culmination in Nazism. Wistrich is a very thorough and broad- ranging scholar and he writes with brilliance about one of the most recurrent evils in the life of mankind."},{"Title":"Antisemitism: The Longest Hatred","review":".. I haven't read this book (3 stars is the mid-point, not intended to mean anything), but would point out that, following this book, Lady Jane Birdwood in Britain published 'The Longest Hatred - Anti-Gentilism' as a booklet, which had a chequered history of prosecutions and harrassment. I assume the title was a riposte to Wistrich's book. Probably it's available on line with a bit of Googling."},{"Title":"Antisemitism: The Longest Hatred","review":"Well written, but so way-off. This book's title can be used to address the long hatred that the Jews have towards the Gentiles.I am firmly convinced that the separation demanded by Jewish religion is the primary cause of anti-semitism, simply because of the implied insult to the majority culture. If Jews would stop being separate, they would gradually stop being hated, but they would no longer be Jews, either. It's an uncomfortable situation for Jews, dealt with mostly by denying that there is any inherent insult in the traditional refusal to socialize, eat together, and intermarry."},{"Title":"The Wines of Italy","review":"I love Italian wines, so I grabbed this when I found it. It does have great information - a breakdown of wines by region, then for each region it gives the main types of wine and the vintages that are good for each type. A general star rating indicates how well this wine does in general. Next to each region is a list of the key producers of that wine, with a brief note about the producer.I think, though, that this will be relatively difficult for a person new to wine to use. If you're looking at a Ruffino Chianti, you look up Ruffino. Its brief notes about Ruffino don't indicate if this is a good or bad winery. You then move to the Chianti section and find out what a Chianti is, but now you are given general notes about which years are good. The years are just listed - you can't tell which are better than others.If the book had even a general rating for each winery, and more details about the vintages, I think this would be excellent. Maybe a future edition will include this information."},{"Title":"Sarajevo Days, Sarajevo Nights","review":"Elma Softic has allowed us to read her personal diary and correspondance to family members about how the war in Sarajevo effected her family, friends, neighbors, and herself personally.

The photographs are truly appealing, and the fact that most of the recipes can be prepared in under 30 minutes makes this an everyday cookbook for me. Even my husband (who, unlike me, is not one to browse through cookbooks for the fun of it) was moved to consult this cookbook on his own initiative due to the fact that the ingredient lists are not dauntingly long, in addition to the aforementioned pictures, ease of preparation, and variety of flavors.Try some of the longer recipes on the weekends, but with this book you can put together a simple but exciting meal after a hard day's work during the week, too.

The recipes definitely take minimal effort to prepare, which is a blessing, but the flavor part is where the book goes weak. This is all about 'good enough' eating. Nothing too adventurous, nothing too fancy. Recipes range in cooking styles from American to Italian to Asian to Moroccan, but none of them stand out as exceptional. The spicy Szechuan eggplant is quite good, the curried cauliflower just okay because it asks you to use preprepared curry powder instead of the author's own spice blend, the chicken ragu the kind of fare you'd expect to find at a homey, local restaurant--yummy, nothing exceptional. It's an inexpensive book and I don't regret buying it, but it's not peppered with culinary jewels. There are a lot of good ideas, though, so if you want another book in your collection, get it.

It's a great read."},{"Title":"The emperor and the kite","review":"Young's The Emperor and the Kite shows us that even (seemingly) small, insignificant individuals can accomplish great deeds and challenges us not to underestimate anyone's capabilities. The story, by Jane Yolen, takes place in ancient China and tells of a tiny princess, not much thought of by her family, who uses her intellect, creativity, and skill to save her father, the emperor, held hostage by kidnappers. The text of the story is lengthy (many pages have ten or more lines of text) and more explanatory than descriptive. The illustrations, done in multi-colored paper cuts, bring the text to life, depicting the most dramatic moments of the story. The illustrations stretch across both pages and often bleed off the edge. Despite their exquisite detail, the illustrations are flat and float in the white space of the page, without any sense of depth or context."},{"Title":"The emperor and the kite","review":"When I ordered Emperor and the Kite, I already knew I loved the folktale. I saw it first as a teacher in the reading text, and knew I wanted it as a book on its own. I looked forward to that story every time we came to it in the text, and it was a favorite with my second and third grade students as well.It is a classic tale of strength, courage and loyalty in a small girl, which enpowers children and assures them that there is a little bit of hero in all of us. She remains loyal to her father, even when her other larger and stronger siblings desert him, fleeing in the face of evil. Her father had always favored the others, so this was particularly noteworthy. In the end, he rewards her loyalty and learns that even if you are big and strong, without strength of character, you are useless.The story reminds me of Mulan in the way that the main female characters basically save China.

Arrived safely and was exactly as described. definately recommend this seller."},{"Title":"Exploring Space: 1999: An Episode Guide and Complete History of the Mid-1970s Science Fiction Television Series","review":"Quite simply, this was a very disappointing book. It's merely an adequate episode guide with overwhelmingly flattering commentary, precious little information about the genesis of \\"Space: 1999\\", virtually no input from people who worked on the show, and VEEEERRRRY few photographs (less than 10!). Most perplexing of all, was it absolutely mandatory for Muir to take pot shots at every incarnation of \\"Star Trek\\" (from 1966 thru 1995) on practically every page?! I'm not kidding...on nearly EVERY page! What the...? Was it so hard for Muir to prove one thing's worth (with supportable reasons) without insisting that another, more popular thing is comparably worse?I've always had great affection for \\"Space: 1999\\" since the show premiered in 1975, and I certainly concur with Muir that it was unfairly maligned from Day One. But I have also recognized and accepted the series' several deficiencies and have looked beyond them to enjoy the show unto itself, as a whole (I have every episode on DVD, naturally). Muir's obvious ardor (unabashed bias?) toward the series has resulted in a wholly subjective approach to his book, with completely unnecessary and dismissive commentary on the several sci-fi series that were critically and/or commercial better-received since the 1960s. But whatever negative reaction the series inspired at the time of its premiere, and to date, has never and will never dampen my affection for this uniquely ambitious series.Trust me, you're much better off spending your money on the excellent Year One soundtrack CD. In fact, I hated this book so much, I threw it away after I read most of it! Yes, it's THAT bad! Sure, I could have palmed it off to some unsuspecting fan on Ebay, but there was just no way, in good conscience, I was going to pass along this tripe to someone.Over the issue of \\"Space: 1999\\"'s alleged superiority to the various \\"Star Trek\\" entities over the years, Mr. Muir has clearly drawn a line in the sand; frankly I am unhesitatingly up to his challenge...I am crossing the line, sir: THERE IS NO FREAKIN' WAY \\"SPACE: 1999\\" WAS, IS, OR EVER WILL BE BETTER THAN ANY INCARNATION OF \\"STAR TREK\\" BEFORE 1997!"},{"Title":"Exploring Space: 1999: An Episode Guide and Complete History of the Mid-1970s Science Fiction Television Series","review":"As far as book titles on Space:1999, this is the only critical evaluation currently in print (a thesis, really) that takes the show on its own terms, and explores (as the title says...) the ins and outs of the program and its history while explaining the 25 years of absurd criticisms thrown at it. The author even points out how many of those who did slam the show publicly (and helped to give it the reputation as being somehow unworthy)WERE affiliated with Star Trek (actors, writers, fan organizers), which is an illuminating point. I find it amusing that after years of bludgeoning Space:1999 with comparisons to Star Trek, there are now reviews on this book's Amazon page complaining that the author is unfairly slanted against Star Trek! What a laugh! Recounting the history and defending Space 1999 against some of the absurd arguments thrown against it is indeed the appropriate purview of a book like this. But judge for yourself."},{"Title":"Exploring Space: 1999: An Episode Guide and Complete History of the Mid-1970s Science Fiction Television Series","review":"John Kenneth Muir has written two books here. One is a comprehensive production history of \\"Space 1999\\" and a detailed guide to its 48 episodes. The other is a passionate defense of the series as an influential, high-quality landmark in the history of televised science fiction. Readers who are fans of the series will welcome both elements of the book, as other reviews on this page make clear.Readers with a deep interest in science fiction but no special love for \\"Space 1999\\" will also find Muir's history and episode guide invaluable but will likely find his argument unpersuasive. A lifelong reader and viewer of SF who also writes about it professionally, I fall firmly into this latter category. Here's why:1) Determined to rehabilitate a series he clearly loves after a quarter-century of savage reviews, Muir overreaches. He argues, for example, that viewers of \\"Thunderbirds\\" (an earlier series by the same creative team) could almost forget that they were watching puppets rather than live actors. Even the biggest fan of the earlier series would find this hard to credit. Elsewhere, Muir reverently describes guest stars Brian Blessed, Roy Dotrice, Ian McShane, and Julian Glover (among others) as \\"famous actors\\" . . . as if they were the likes of Laurence Olivier and John Gielgud rather than established character actors who did such work routinely.2) Assessing the contributions of \\"Space: 1999\\" to the development of televised science fiction, Muir falls into the \\"after X . . . therefore because of X\\" trap far too readily. He implies, time and again, that this or that element of later series such as \\"Star Trek: The Next Generation\\" and \\"Babylon 5\\" must have been inspired by similar elements in \\"Space 1999\\" simply because they came later. He is doubtless right about some of them, but never seems to consider the possibility that (for example) the presence of a shape-shifting alien in both \\"Space: 1999\\" and \\"Star Trek: Deep Space 9\\" is simply the result of *both* series drawing on an established science fiction plot device (see, for example, John W. Campbell's story \\"Who Goes There?\\" from 1939).3) Muir fails to come to grips with the series' most frequently cited flaws. His treatment of its scientific errors is typical. The concept of \\"Space: 1999\\" depends on the Moon breaking loose from its orbit (propelled by an exploding nuclear waste dump on the far side) and hurtling though space fast enough to encounter a dozens of other planetary systems in 5 or 6 years of story time. This is purest nonsense, but Muir is undaunted. Faced with a widespread consensus that his beloved series rests on bogus science he responds that: 1) Every SF series does it; 2) The critics are nitpicking; and 3) The laws of nature might be different \\"out there.\\" He thus displays a deep misunderstanding of: 1) The nature of televised SF; 2) The nature of SF in general; and 3) The nature of science.I watched nearly every episode of \\"Space: 1999\\" during its run, and remember many of them fondly. I remember the series as a whole as an interesting failure: full of interesting ideas, but undermined by bad science, a dramatically flawed premise, bland dialogue, and a near-total lack of engaging characters. I'm willing to be convinced that it was better than that, but Muir has utterly failed to do so.Five stars for devoted fans of the series (who will be predisposed to buy Muir's arguments); three for the (probably few) others deeply enough interested in televised SF to consider buying a copy."},{"Title":"Exploring Space: 1999: An Episode Guide and Complete History of the Mid-1970s Science Fiction Television Series","review":"If you are a fan of science fiction, this book is one major revelation. It tracks major influneces of space 1999 in the star trek and star wars franchises and goes into detail on the philosophy of the show which made the X-files possible. Its about time somebody exposes the lies of the Trekkies , which sought to kill space 1999s' reputation. Even as recently as last months New York Times , Emily Nussbaum gave the show a bad reveiw without even explayning her problems with the show.Long live Space 1999!"},{"Title":"Exploring Space: 1999: An Episode Guide and Complete History of the Mid-1970s Science Fiction Television Series","review":"&quot;In Defense of Space: 1999&quot; might have been a better title for this book. I've been a fan of the show since I saw it in first run, when I was in my early 'teens. And I'm still a fan now (I bought the episode DVDs). I agree that many reviewers have unfairly &quot;bashed&quot; this show, perhaps because it did not fit the mould of other televised sci-fi. (Actually, I would class &quot;Space: 1999&quot; as fantasy or drama, but not as science fiction.)Unfortunately, author Muir seems almost zealously (and tediously) determined to justify the show against all comers. Too much time is spent comparing &quot;Space: 1999&quot; to other shows, rather than praising it for itself. Gerry and Sylvia Anderson have produced some of the sexiest and most stylish sci-fi/fantasy on TV. They've got the &quot;cool.&quot; And &quot;Space: 1999&quot; is one of their greatest.If you are a fan, you will want to buy this book. It is worth the trip. It is a rare look at the creation and development of a popular show."},{"Title":"Exploring Space: 1999: An Episode Guide and Complete History of the Mid-1970s Science Fiction Television Series","review":"Space:1999. You either love it or you hate it. This mid-1970's science fiction television program seems to inspire a lot of passion with no middle ground even after 20 years. The book &quot;Exploring Space:1999&quot; explores the reasons behind fandom's feelings quite adaquitly. The author, although an admitted fan, keeps a fairly objective view of the program as he &quot;reviews&quot; each of the 48 episodes in production order. Often he points out simularities in storylines and style in series that have followed. In particular, there are comparisons to Star Trek: The Next Generation, a program which prided itself on being a &quot;thinking man's&quot; science fiction televison program. Space:1999 did that first and in many ways, helped pave the way for the &quot;intelligent&quot; programs on the air today such as &quot;Babylon 5&quot; and the various Treks. The book is a bit of a let down when it comes to telling the history of the program. Only actress Catherine Schell was interviewed for the project. The bulk of the information comes from mainstream magazine stories and interviews. Personally, I would have loved to have seen more information from the script writers and editors about the evolution of the series and it's scripts. An example is that in the begining, ITC New York insisted on having an American script editor. In the days before E-mail and faxes, this caused quite a problem with the development of the early episodes. In the reviews of these stories, the author comments on the quality of the scripts but offers no explaination for the downslide. Articles and interviews of this nature have appeared in fanzines over the years and many of them are now available on the internet. Hopefully, there will be a revised second edition of the book which incorporates some of this material. Still, dispite my criticisms, it is great to finally have an objective telling of the program's history between one cover. &quot;The Making of Space:1999&quot; published in 1976 was basically a big PR product to help promote the changes to the second season of the program an barely touched on the first season. I enjoyed the book and appreciate the work the author put in to it. But, I would only recommend it to true fans of the series like myself."},{"Title":"Exploring Space: 1999: An Episode Guide and Complete History of the Mid-1970s Science Fiction Television Series","review":"Two thumbs up and three cheers for Muir's Exploring Space:1999. This is the reprint of the 1997 book by the author of Terror Television (which also has a chapter on Space:1999)and The Films of John Carpenter. This is a sturdy, utilitarian volume with some good photographs of Catherine Schell, two original illustrations, and a great text. Today, everybody from the New York Times to TV Guide is hailing Space:1999 as a lost masterpiece but in 1997 Muir's was the only voice in print supporting the series, - and we can be thankful for it. The book stands the test of time because Muir writes so well about the series' strength, and destroys many of the old arguments against the show through logic, reason,and with empirical evidence. He writes about how 1) the series is high-quality and 2)how it picks up on interesting film techniques to tell its stories and advance its themes. I don't agree with every episode review in the book, but Muir is consistent - preferring those with &quot;film style&quot; rather than solid, traditional stories. This is great, innovative reading, and well worth the price."},{"Title":"Exploring Space: 1999: An Episode Guide and Complete History of the Mid-1970s Science Fiction Television Series","review":"I always considered the '70s sci-fi show &quot;Space: 1999&quot; something of a guilty pleasure. Muir's book, however, shows there was more substance to the ill-fated series than even I thought. My only reservation about the book is that Muir doesn't know nearly as much about other SF series as he does about &quot;Space: 1999.&quot; Some of his comments about &quot;Babylon 5,&quot; for instance, fall well off the mark. (Muir contrasts the two, while I think they share some similarly Lovecraftian undercurrents.)"},{"Title":"Exploring Space: 1999: An Episode Guide and Complete History of the Mid-1970s Science Fiction Television Series","review":"As the Cybrarian of the multi-award winning Space: 1999 Cybrary web site, it's a rare occurrence when I come across anything new about the classic Gerry and Sylvia Anderson-produced British sci-fi series of the mid-1970s starring Oscar winner Martin Landau, three-time successive Emmy winner Barbara Bain, Barry Morse, and Catherine Schell. Happily, John Muir's take on the series is unique, highly informative, and best of all, wonderfully intelligent and thought provoking, providing many a keen and thoughtful insight into this marvelous, beautifully produced, and oftentimes misunderstood epic television series. Without question, John Muir's intelligently written Exploring Space: 1999 is certain to be as sought after and collectible one day as the ultra rare Japanese Town Mook SuperVisual Guide to Gerry Anderson's Space: 1999 is today. I cannot recommend this title more highly. It's an exceptional addition into the body of literature on Space: 1999, and certainly among the top three titles one would want to own on the series."},{"Title":"Exploring Space: 1999: An Episode Guide and Complete History of the Mid-1970s Science Fiction Television Series","review":"This book is a true work of love! Kenneth Muir was superb in describing the very thought provoking show of the 70\`s - Space 1999. A lot of people disregard this show or despise it as a minor one, but it was the predecessor of series like Babylon 5, Alien, Star Trek - The Next Generation and others. Muir showed his knowledge not only in the Space 1999 series, but all the SCIFI universe.

Like the book Space:1999 - The Future Is Fantastic (which would come out some three years later), this book about the classic British science fiction series was well researched and exhaustively informative. Like Paul M. Sammon's book on the making of Blade Runner, John Kenneth Muir's book really captured every detail about the show. From the synopsis of all 48 episodes, to direct quotes of dialogue from the characters and interviews with various actors, actresses, behind the scenes personnel, and the creators Gerry and Sylvia Anderson, this book was a pure pleasure to read. Muir's comments and criticisms about each episode and the show in general were justifiable in some areas, and in others, not. However, his book on the show, and the information contained were muti-dimensional and layered. Like many fans of the show, Muir's writings clearly indicate that he too is a fan, and truly cares about this classic piece of science fiction. He also goes into detail about how strong a cult-fan following the show has, and why it was on for only two years. Especially the changes made between the first and second seasons.If you enjoy Space:1999, then you will want to pick up a copy of this excellent and informative book. If you really enjoy Muir's book on this show, then you'll want to check out his book on another classic piece of science fiction and fantasy.

For those of you giving it bad ratings, you are so incompetent that you don't understand anything about the book. I've e-mailed Ms. Rice, and to me she seemed disappointed with you people for being so inhumane and unforgiving. I very much agree!I understand the character of Lestat more than all the other books now. Ms. Rice has really nailed him this time. He exactly as she describes him, arrogant, sophisticated, fun-loving, well-dressed, savvy, hilarious, insane, wanting-to-be-a-saint, chararismatic and smart! If you want the old Lestat back, whatever, go for it. I personally like the hip Lestat better.However, Ms. Rice is almost at her best in this book. It is deeply detailed, perfectly portrayed, and a sensational hit! I do agree with those you say it isn't right for children. Children are too immature, and they don't understand the concept, just like some of these adults. I myself am thirteen, yet I understand the book completely. So mature a little, then go ahead and re-read this lovely novel.I've been reading the Chronicles since I was 11, and I'm am totally enamored of Lestat's character. I have also read The Witching Hour, Lasher, Taltos, Pandora, and Vittorio the Vampire. I read at college level, so I know good books when I read them.The perversion of these attacks personally affect me and all others who are fans of Anne Rice. You insult her, you insult me. Is it not enough that her husband has died, and that she is under enormous pressure from these worthless fiends who write obscene comments about her? Guess not. Why don't you just take a baseball bat to her and work her over a while? That ought to satisfy your cruelty.And for the record, this is probably just a waste of time. You people are so wrapped up in yourselves that you carenon-whatsoever for others. You don't even deserve the right to apologize to Ms. Rice. You utterly disgust me.Also, you attack Ms. Rice herself with comments such as ,\\"Go mourn your dead husband.\\" or \\"Good thing she stopped writing.\\" You know what? YOU try dealing with the death of a loved one and stil continuing your career. Anne Rice is writing for a living, so why don't you insult some business owner or a cashier at a store? Hmmm???You can bite me for all I care! You are pathetic imbeciles just looking for attention! Leave this poor woman alone! Just don't mess with her!However, it is unfair of me to insult you if I don't even know you that well.(Might want to take THAT hint...) Anyways, I apologize. Blood Canticle was a really great book! It was my favorite of all the Chronicles. It really does hurt me that people would say such nasty things like Ms. Rice didn't write the novel, or she could have done better. I was sorrowful to learn that this was the last of a series I enjoyed so much, but all good things must come to an end. You can't expect the author to live forever, or people to commit to the series.That being said, I hope this will help reviewers out there to take in what I've said. Thank you for your time to read this, and please think this review over.P.S. Lestat is not a wuss! He is a brave, compassionate, tortured soul!!!! He is my hero!

I became interested enough in literature to become a Lit. major, and although I've certainly moved on to other authors, I still pick up any new Rice books when they come out.I'm very surprised at some of the reviews I've read here. Yes, Anne Rice is considered commercial fiction; you can expect an occasional cheesy line or scene you're not happy with as a reader. However, looking over many of the reviews, I question the fact that some of these reviewers actually READ the book, because they've some important literary elements of the novel that perhaps might not be visible on the surface but are certainly not too hard to find. Think about it: was 'Interview With a Vampire' about a vampire? Certainly. But if you missed the obvious undertones related to loss and religion, Rice might not be the best read for you.If you didn't get anything more out of 'Blood Canticle' than the surface story, which I don't believe was her best but certainly not her worst, ask yourself what you're missing.And then read it again."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I've always been a fan of Anne Rice way back when I discovered &quot;Interview&quot; when I was a freshmen in High School.

After reading Canticle, I cant say I wasnt disappointed. I personally wasnt offended by Letstat's rant about Memnoch/being a Saint, I found it a way to lighten up the book. But to me this is not the Anne Rice of old - where are our beautiful descrptions, where is the elegant language? Plot wise, this book is horrible. To be the end of the Chronicles it seems to me that this was more about the Taltos! All of the &quot;loose threats&quot; remaind untied. Overall, I give it 3 stars because its by Anne Rice and its a Vampire Chronicle - I cant really make myself dislike it, I did enjoy reading it.

He talks about it as if there was nothing left for him to be but a saint. This is not the Lestat we have seen in some of the other Chronicle books. That Lestat was seen as evil, and as &quot;Cain, the slayer of my brother&quot;. But you have to remember that Lestat's words have only been used in four of the previous nine books. Louis told us the story in Interview with the Vampire, Armand told his own story, David told us of Merrick, Marius gave us the rest of his tale in Blood and Gold, and Quinn Blackwood told us the story of Blackwood Farm. When these others talked of Lestat, they were not using his words, his style. Blood Canticle is the first book to use Lestat's own words since Memnoch the Devil.And why wouldn't he have changed his manner of speaking in that time? Lestat is the one who, learning from the example of Marius, always found a way to fit in with the times he was living. So one of the lines is the book ends with !!!!!!! Isn't that the way people do things today in the world of Internet chat and email? Why should we be surprised that Lestat is doing it?As for his wanting to be a saint, think back in the Chronicles to a time someone said, &quot;As we get older, we do not really change. We just become more and more ourselves&quot;. Re-read The Vampire Lestat. Since he was a child, Lestat dreamed of being a saint. As he gets older, and becomes more and more himself, his earliest dreams and desires would surely come back stronger than ever.I won't talk of the story, because the story tells itself. It is a typical book in the Vampire Chronicles in that for the first little while, you may be confused, thinking nothing is happening in sequence, or meshes with anything else in the story. But then it all starts coming together, as it always does, and you have trouble putting it down.This is not the best of the Chronicles (See Memnoch the Devil). Nor is it the worst. It may not be the best way to end the series (if it is truly finished), but it a very good story, a very good read, and is very true to the Lestat we saw in The Vampire Lestat, Queen of the Damned, The Tale of the Body Thief and Memnoch the Devil. This character has grown into the times. And that's what is making people say this is a bad book; He's not the same. Good for him!This is not a bad book. It's good book. I enjoyed it thoroughly."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I too, at first, was unable to appreciate the majestic sprawl if this fine tome. One hot August night, however, the secret unfolded itself to me as if in a dream, peeling back slowly like a withered hydrangea...You must prepare yourself.1) Begin with a long, warm-to-scalding shower. Scrub, scrub, scrub away the tensions and impurities of the day. Wash your hair. Rinse and repeat. Don't forget to brush and floss!2) A robe for gentlemen, or a nightgown for our distaff friends. Blue and pink print flannel. Treat yourself to a new garment, as they can become coarse after a few washings.3) Warm slippers, of course, complement any fine reading experience.4) Now, beckon forth your assistant (we'll call her Sue for now). Ask Sue to bring you, in the following precise order, and at six-minute intervals, the following:a. A tall glass of chilled Pellegrino. No ice. Ever.b. A china dessert plate bearing three ginger snaps. DO NOT EAT. These are simply for fragrance. Ambiance, as the French would have it.c. An aperitif of chilled, shaken Sambuca. Three coffee beans are to float on top, the classic token of good fortune to follow!d. A crystal highball glass filled to 1/2 inch from the brim with a fine Bourbon whiskey. Three ice cubes made from springwater, please.e. Repeat step d.f. Repeat steps c, d and e.5) Instruct Sue to cover you, in your oversize leather wingback chair, with an assortment of chenille throws and steamer rugs. Make sure she leaves the book, opened to page 476, in your lap (this is CRUCIAL).6) Awaken the next morning refreshed, entertained and (dare one hope) enlightened!You'll want to thank me, but it is truly my pleasure."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Blackwood Farm was excellent and i was very excited about blood canticle. Unfortunately it wasnt one of Anne Rice's best. Read it, but dont expect much. And Mona, what an irritating character."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I'm an avid Anne Rice fan and have read everything she's written. I also heard this was to be her last book, so I assumed she'd do some concluding and wrapping up. She did do that, but in a very clumsy, simple, uninspiring way. The beginning with Lestat's narration was hilarious! I'm a huge fan of Memnoch so that little diatribe made me chuckle. But what started so well did not continue on the same vein.I loved the Mayfair Witches and Merrick and Blackwood Farm seemed to begin to bring them together better than I thought would happen. This book, however, forced everything together way too fast with no real inspiration or effort behind it. And too many pages were wasted on the pointless. Why bring in Quinn's mother's ghost? It went no where. I had hopes for Julian's ghost but it was superfluous in the end! I disliked the lack of other vamps. There was no real flushing out of characters or of situations. Everything was tied up way too easily.I did read it in two days. it was only about 300 pages. I guess that's the other issue. 300 pages is not enough to do what needed to be done to bring both of these majestic chronicles to an end. If this truly is the end. However, it was not the worst of her writing and considering what she's gone through, I just wish she would have either waited or never written this."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"This book needs to be made into a movie. The Mayfairs mixed with Lestat is an adreneline rush that keeps moving."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Okay, so it's not her best novel, but far from her worst, either. Yes, there are a few typos and phrases in need of editing, but any fan of Anne Rice should be accustomed to that. The errors aren't distracting enough to prevent the reader from enjoying the narrative. Seeing as I read it in just a few sittings, I have to say that Rice still has a gift for making you want to turn the page. One strong point of the book, for me personally, is that it includes her most interesting characters: Rowan Mayfair, Lestat, the Taltos, Michael Curry, Mona Mayfair, and Quinn Blackwood. In some ways, it's more of an extended character sketch than a story with a solid plot. It's a little more introspective than her previous vampire books. Some of the soliquoys, I found myself skimming over. But, considering it turned out to be the final book in both the Mayfair Witches and Vampire series (despite the open-ended conclusion which would suggest a sequel, Rice has stated that she won't write any more vampire or witch tales), it does tie things up fairly well. I don't want to include any spoilers here so I can't get too specific. But if you are a fan of either the Vampire or Mayfair books, you won't be dissappointed. The worst part about the book, reading it after Rice's conversion, is knowing that it's the end of the series and there won't be any more. I just hope her conversion doesn't prevent her from allowing some of her books to be adapted to film."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"If you have missed reading any of Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles or her Mayfair Witches books you may find your missing some information when you read this book. I highly recommend reading all of her Vampire Chronicles and Mayfair Witches books in the order they were published. I have read them all with the exception of this book twice. I found the second read to be better than the first! I finished chapter 14 of this book last night. I started reading it two days ago. Anne Rice sure has a way of keeping you from putting the book down! I have only the greatest respect for her works. She has been a master in bringing the two stories together. They are indeed works of art!"},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"This is my 1st Anne Rice book. Thank you to everyone who reviewed it. I didnt read all of the reviews just a few and with such a response both pro and con, I had to read the book and see what all the fuss was about. Well, I am very glad I did. I loved it! I loved the concept ,the story and the characters . I especially loved the character of Lestat and the love he had for Rowan. I plan on getting all of the other books! I cant wait to meet all of the characters again."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Once again Anne Rice out does herself. This book picks up where the witch serices and Blackwood Farm ends. It is an easy and enjoyable read. It answered all of my questions that I had after reading the Witch series. I couldn't put the book down."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I loved this book! I loved it so much that i read it in only 3 sittings, and that's amazing for me! It usually takes me at least 10 reading sessions to get through a whole book (i'm not saying that this book is too short, just that i was so excited to find out what was going to happen that i read for long periods of time).Just make sure that you read &quot;Blackwood Farm&quot; before reading this book, because it's basically a direct continuation of it."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I am a die-hard fan of Anne Rice. I truly believe she is one of the best fiction authors of our time and that Lestat is one of the best-written characters. Of course he has to change! There's just no way our Brat Prince would be the same after having seen all the things he's seen and done all the things he's done. He saw God Himself for goodness sake! Frankly, if Lestat HADN'T changed from the character he was in The Vampire Lestat I'd be disapointed. He was never meant to be a static character. Congratulations, Ms. Rice, on a job well done. A truly fitting end to a wonderful, magical series."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I truly enjoyed \\"Blood Canticle\\", I am in avid reader and fan of anne's and i was delighted to see lestat back in the driver's seat for this book! i dont find it racist (i'm black and native american and i dont understand how someone could call it so). lestat's use of modern lingo was enjoyable and i thought the wit used through out the book was wonderful, if you dont like the book dont trash it on the internet put it away and read something else :)."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Up to about 3 years ago, when Blood and Gold was published, I was a great fan of Anne Rice. I loved her style of writing, and her characters. I loved her beautiful use of the English (and other European) languages, and the marvelous way in which she weaves history into her plots. In fact, the very first Anne Rice book I have read is Ramses the Damned. And from that time, I fell in love with her writings, especially her Vampire Chronicles.That is, until her recent works came along. When they were first published (Merrick, Blackwood Farm, and Blood Canticle), I, being the faithful fan that I am, wanted to look at her books. But I found myself skimming them and utterly bored by them. Most of all, I did not like the direction that she had taken with Lestat. Which I suppose is what most fans are thinking.That was 3 years ago. A month ago, I decided to try reading those books again. When I was done with these books, I wondered why I ever thought they were 'bad' to begin with. I am ashamed that I ever skimmed them in the bookstore when they were first released. Anne Rice's abilities hold true in these most recent books, and so what if her characters change (by this I mean Lestat, who is quite a different person in Blood Canticle, isn't he?), and are no longer the ones we expected from her earlier books? Taken by themselves, these books are still excellent pieces of fiction, with interesting storylines, and her abilities as a writer are apparent in them. I think that Anne Rice should not be judged for trying to change her characters: why shouldn't they evolve as she does? Should we, as her fans, admiring an artist's work of creativity, EXPECT the artist to CONFORM to our preconceived standards? Doesn't make sense, right?Which is why I say now, to those who think the book was 'no good', 'horrible', 'poor', read it again. Give it another chance. I certainly did, and I'm not disappointed. I am, to say the least, still a fan, ESPECIALLY considering this latest piece."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"As I was reading this-I was reminded of those terrible moive adaptations of INTERVIEW W/A VAMPIRE & QUEEN OF THE DAMNED-even worse I was mostly reminded of that infinitely bad adaptation of EXIT TO EDEN[even the plots were similar]-I kept seeing Rosie O'Donnell as Rowan & Dan Aykroyd as Lestat. This was painful as I've been a fan of Anne Rice since I was twelve-I'm twenty-nine now & this is the last Anne Rice book I will buy. Someone here said something about relevancy which I disagree with-as I see it any kid playing VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE could make a better story & probably already has-therefore this book anyway has no relevancy at all. If you are into vampires stay away from this book-its terrible-just go back & reread the first three or find some other dark fiction to read."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"The story content of this book was very interesting to me. I wished that maybe there was some more debt into the Taltos but alas, I have lots of wishes.With this being the last book in the Chronicles and especially from Lestat's eye, it left me with NO closure. I was impressed that for once she didn't have Lestat turn someone, but to just end it and leave the world wondering what happenes is very frustrating to me. With this being the last book in the series, I personally was looking for some closure for the characters. Or should I say more closure. Even if it is just an Epilogue to sum it all up.I do not think of this book as a bad book. I enjoyed reading it. I can not say that it was bad. When the plot was in focus I was enthralled!"},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Ooooh, maybe Anne Rice will re-write the Bible for us.

I remember seeing the previews of the movie Interview, when i was 12. However i really got into them until i was 16.Anyway....I was kind of dissapointed, first of all let me tell you! j/K. I don't really like the whole witches thing, it kind of made it seem like a freak show, like a bunch of freaks were reuniting.I think many people did not feel like it was a finale, but was more like a weak lingering.And about lestat's love interest, i was not too into her either, did not know why he got into her.However, the whole religious thing Lestat went through i think that it suits his personality and would be expected. It seems that at the end (death) everyone who is anyone gets spiritual and wants to get closer to God. Look at the works of any famous person, writers, composers, all religious in subject at the end.Anyway, just to put in my two cents, it would have been interesting if at the end Louis and Lestat would have ended up toghether. However, I don;t think it would have lasted.I think that what bugged people so much about it is that it ended semi-realistically, he ends up wandering trying to find something else to do, which will he be doing the rest of his life, until he gets bored, and can't find anything else and decides to kill himself. I think that people expected was a romantic ending. I think that he is never really going to back to Rowan, and turned her into a vamp. I think that he left her for good, he did not want to ruin her life. I seriously think that at this point Lestat had gotten bored of life and when he left that was it, I mean literally, i think he killed himself afterwards or a few months later. And no i don't think i'm exagerating or reading too much into it.I would love to hear any opinions regarding my interpretation, and I don't know if someone's already comed up with this, but if they did, hey, i just tought about it right now.Sonia G.23"},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I absolutely adore Anne Rice's writing, and this book, for me, definitely did not disappoint. Although, like many others of her readers, I am sad to know that this will be the last one in The Vampire Chronicle...I am pleased that Lestat's \\"blood song\\" was fitting of what the last book should have been."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"As a long time fan of The Vampire Chronicles, I can't help but hope this book was not the last about all the characters we have all come to care about. While it was clever to pull the two sagas (the vampires and the Mayfairs) into one story, this book really concluded nothing, and very little actually happened in this novel. The story is rather weak and does not give us a final wrap up on Louis or Armand or Marius or David, not even on Lestat really. The end of the book leaves my hopes up for more to come and maybe a concluding novel that will do the series justice. It's worth reading if only just to visit briefly with the characters and world readers have come to know. Not Anne's best work - but we should all give the lady a break. I think (and hope) there will be more to come."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Anne should have taken some time off to grieve, and not to write this book. It is the worst of them all. I skipped entire chapters that were poorly written. My thirteen year old nephew speaks like Lestat. What a disappointment. Get it out of the library, so you don't have to pay for it, if you don't believe me. DON&quot;T BUY THIS BOOK&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;"},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I'm not sure how to respond to all this fuss, except to say, in the simplest of terms...I liked the book! I did! I, who've been a fan since I was 12, who at 13 prayed for Louis to come to me (always Louis, by the way, or Armand), I who have loved to hate Lestat the Blond for years and years... I just liked it!I don't understand what was wrong with it. It was readable. Lestat, if anything, was more Lestat than ever - though as and avowed Louis-Girl (whatever else that makes me) I'm not sure how much of a complement that is... However, Lestat is like Essence of Lestat for me here. Why do you all hate his gangsta speak? He's always spoken in a bizarre but sweet mixture of high fallutin' fancy talk and gutter trash slang. He's always been a bit of a baby! But we love him for his contrasts, do we not? Or we love to hate them, in my case.I love Lestat, but he is so blond and so bizarre, and perhaps that's why I can see how he has evolved into this character in Blood Canticle. It's ineveible! Why must he pander to pretentious goths everywhere who need psuedo-intellectual speak to like a book? He learnt from Sam Spade, remember? He's Lestat, baby!Enough on Lestat's voice. Live with it! I need to talk about the book itself. What the hell is wrog with it? Oh, it isn't my favourite chronical, it would have gotten five stars if that were the case. Lestat, dear boy, couldn't hold my attention for that long! But I liked it, as I said. I've liked all of them. And the Mayfair trilogy, also, and to see it all brought together brings a powerful sense of excitement to me. Why do you hate the witches? Why do you hate the Taltos? Why do you want to see our lovely vampires caught in the same storylines over and over and over? In fact, it seems like you all want 'The Vampire Lestat' and 'Queen of the Damned' rewritten ad nausium. To be honest, as a fan, that seems absurd to me. I want more! I want change! I want evolution!The melding of the storylines was inspired, I thought. I adore Quinn. Mona is a sweetheart. Rowan and Michael weren't all they could be, sadly, but rarely is there a happy ending. The Taltos were as fascinating and brilliant as ever. Lestat's wanting to be a saint was so damn Lestat that I laughed when I read it - in a good way. Of course he wants to be a saint! Hasn't he always! He only ever wanted to do evil if he thought it would do good. Our Blond Boy has always been a moral creature, whether you care to admit it or not. And he knows very well that he can't be a saint, which makes him want it even more. Always the case! One of the eternal themes of the Chronicals has been redemption, whether the seeking of it, the spurning of it, or the final admitance that it simply can't be achieved. Simply ridiculous that people haven't picked up on this.This isn't my favourite novel, but it is a good story. And I'm absolutely heartbroken that it's the last, but we shouldn't attempt to view this story as the pinnacle of a decade spanning series, but simply see it for what it is - a very good story.And we mustn't forget that Anne is the author, not us. Give the woman the respect she deserves, you bloody ingrates! And you call yourselves fans."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"While I don't think it's Anne Rice's best the story in the book was entertaining to me. I had been waiting to find out what happened after the end of Blackwood Farm. I think people also have to take into account what was going on in Anne's personal life when she was writing this book and cut some slack. A lot of people hated Memnoch too, but it was a really great book."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"If Opinions are allowed on Amazon, why shouldn't they be allowed by the author herself? Wonderful book, deeply moving and warm. Lestat, as in Memnoch, questioning the world as we all do as mortals and always looking for answers other than the obvious. I think that's what it is here, you are looking for the obvious, and the world \\"ain't\\" built that way. Think outside the box and within the pages of art that this BRILLIANT master artist has given us. Thank you Anne. S."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"In reading some of the earlier reviews of this book, as well as those of its predecessor, \\"Blackwood Farm,\\" I agree that \\"Blood Canticle\\" has the look and feel of a first draft. If Anne Rice had put it away for a bit and then come back to it, I believe she could've corrected many of its flaws.One subtle thing that bothered me right off the bat was the style of language used by Lestat's character. It is markedly different than his speech in the other books and his new style of speaking, saying things like \\"babe\\" and \\"cool,\\" really doesn't work. He sounded more like Austin Powers than he did Lestat.Something that could've been developed a lot more were the references to \\"Memnoch.\\" For example, there's a reference made in either this book, or \\"Blackwood Farm,\\" to Lestat's mind or consciousness being \\"stolen\\" by Memnoch or other angels. To what end, the reader isn't told. This seemed like an obvious point to follow up on and I was disappointed that it wasn't.I was also disappointed to see the pages that were wasted by the appearance of Patsy's ghost. In my mind, that whole tangent added nothing to the book.And finally, I had read a rumor that Anne Rice was going to use the Blackwood saga to delve into the origins of the Talamasca. I was quite disappointed to see that she didn't do so in either of the books. The organization's beginnings are discussed somewhat in the \\"Witching Hour\\" trilogy (it is hinted, by the Lasher character, that it was started to breed Taltos), but, I think, never fully fleshed out and explored.In conclusion, I believe that this book is rife with missed literary opportunities."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I found this book to be so-so. I have spent the last year reading the 10 books in the vampire series and 3 books in the Mayfair Witches series. I am glad it is over. The books seem to get more and more boring as they go along. Some of the books seem to be nothing more than a rehash of previous books. If I were recommending to a friend, I would say to quite reading after Memnoch the Devil, and The witching hour is the only worthwhile Mayfair book. It seems the author got a successful series started, then cashed in by spitting out several mediocre books without much effort."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I've been reading Anne Rice's books for well over 10 years now, and I have to say I've never been truly disappointed until Blood Canticle. Blackwood Farm was okay, especially when compared to the earlier Vampire Chronicles and the stories of the Mayfair Witches, but Blood Canticle was a huge let down. The diatribe on \\"getting\\" Memnoch was definitely insulting to long-time fans. Maybe it's time for Rice to leave the vampires and witches behind and start with some new \\"blood\\"."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Well, I read all the reviews here before I even opened the book. I was sort of expecting the worse. I think the major thing is that Lestat has changed, he changed in the novel Memnoch the Devil. Alot of people don't seem to want to come to terms with that fact. I found there was cohesion with this book and it was interesting. Of course it is not the same as the older books, Anne has changed and she has made her characters change as well. I did not find the novel wrapped everything up. I had more questions after I finished reading it than when I had begun. I was really annoyed with the &quot;running away&quot; of Mary Jane Mayfair. After the last book in the Witches Chronicles, how could there be any story with Mona that did not involve Mary Jane in some way. I did like the book, very much, but I am bitterly disappointed that this is how it is all going to end. But then again, why would I want to read something that Anne Rice really had no desire to write? Contrary to popular opinions I think she did want to write this, we just have to face up that it is just never going to be like it once was."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"If you liked Blackwood farm you'll love this book. Lestat isn't really his normal character but still a great book"},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I thought this gave me exactly what I was looking for: more development into the Mayfairs tied with the vampires and development into Lestat and his character. I think my only complaint about the book is that it felt \\"hurried\\" and I felt rushed as a reader. I didn't enjoy that. It is quite possible it is because I couldn't put it down, but towards the end things didn't feel fully developed as they could have been.*spoiler* I loved the glimpses into the personalities of the different Taltos' as well as seeing the further degeneration of the Mayfair family's mental state as a result of their tragedies. It left me wanting more, but feeling satisfied at not knowing. Also seeing Lestat's caring and nurturing side and his human qualities coming out was very refreshing.Overall, I loved this book."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I am a big fan of Anne Rice, have read all her books, blah blah blah. The bottom line is Anne Rice is ending her Chronicles with this? At least that's what I heard. I tolerated the disorganization and rambling about the Pope etc. because I was hoping for a great story. It never happens. The resolution is too rapid and clean. The characters, like others have pointed out, aren't consistent with previous books, even Lestat. I still love Anne Rice, would recommend this to fans, and would read anything she wrote."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Seriously, did she write this book or [...] I was just waiting for Lestat to call something \\"da bomb\\" after he used the word \\"cool\\" for the tenth million time. And what happened to Mona? She certainly turned into a whiny cardboard copy teenager. I have been a huge fan of Anne Rice and own everything she ever wrote, including books under her other names. This was just a horrible let down, like she didn't even want to write it. And by page 200, I didn't want to read it. I had to push myself through the pages. Someone needs to tell this woman when the book is this bad. It discredits her name. It discredits the editor. And the only reason it's in print is because it has her name one it. I still refuse to believe she wrote it.In this book are some of the best characters created in the 20th century and they were destroyed. What a horrible end to the Mayfairs and the Vampires."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I've had a lot of trouble with some of Ms. Rice's books: Blood and Gold, Vampire Armand, Vittorio the Vampire, Violin, etc. And I realize that I am in the minority when I admit to having thoroughly enjoyed Tale of the Body Thief, Memnoch the Devil, Merrick, The Witching Hour, and Servant of the Bones; but I thought it appropriate to comment here on Blood Canticle. I have read all of the Vampire and Mayfair Witches books and like many others have followed The Saga for many years. As each series progressed there was a point at which it seemed everything had already been said, no further developments seemed possible, but I kept reading just to &quot;see how everything turned out.&quot; I suppose I became as weary of reading the series as Ms. Rice seemed in writing them.Blood Canticle is a coda; a short summation or just a long final chapter that, aside from the &quot;religious ranting&quot; by a born-again catholic, was surprisingly satisfying to me. Time was, I enjoyed the depth, the detail, the examination presented by Ms. Rice. But after having been disappointed with her work over the past few years, the coda-style wrapping it all up in Blood Canticle worked for me.Two final thoughts: As I was reading this book I realized why I had been drawn to her writing initially and ultimately disappointed with the later books: the scariness, the fear-factor I loved so much at the beginning was gone. I remember being thrilled to be scared by the content, the creepiness, the discovery, the concepts. It became too known, too understood, there was no room left for fear of the unknown.My final thought: could there have been more finality, more detail, more connection to the completion of both of these sagas? Yes, of course. There COULD have been and if Ms. Rice had been as dedicated to the writing of that as she was in the writing, say, of The Witching Hour, I would have loved it and devoured it. But based on her apparent lack of interest (or patience?) for these stories any more, I'm glad she wrote this coda to bring the kind of completion she was capable of at this time. I recommend this book to those who want a simple completion to his or her own journey in the reading of Ms. Rice's work."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"While I won't lambast this book as harshly as others, Blood Canticle certainly fails to live up to the Anne Rice of old. In fact, this is quite possibly my least favorite of all her books. But in all fairness, if you look at the dedication, you realize Mrs. Rice lost her husband at some point during the process of this novel. So I forgive her bitterness, although it is quite shocking to be ranted at for the opening chapter of the book. Apparently from this rant, many people didn't like Memnoch The Devil, a book I found fast paced and thought provoking. But back to Blood Canticle, I do feel cheated. The Mayfair Witches become one dimensional and boring. A pity because these were probably my favorite characters of all of Mrs. Rice's creations. Lestat's character does not move or grow in this book. His &quot;sudden&quot; desire to be a saint really isn't sudden if you have read the previous books. And his continual fantasizing on the subject really is pendantic. If this is the last of The Vampire Chronicles, I am indeed sad, they deserved a more fitting send off. I would not recommend this book to those new to Anne Rice, it's far from her best. Really the only people I would recommend this book to is the die hard fan, but you like I probably have found this book disappointing but are hopefully awaiting the return of the quality and imagination of the Anne Rice we know and love even if her story telling takes a new direction, as is discussed in the opening chapter."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Blood Canticle... Despite the mostly harsh reviews, I have to say that this book wasn't bad at all. I agree that it is perhaps not the ending to the Chronicles that we all hoped for, but that is because we have all grown to love our Brat Prince, Lestat. We have an image of how he should be in our minds, and being human, change is hard when we grow to expect things from someone or something. Like many of us, Blood Canticle was just another phase in Lestat's eternal life. As for Mona- I admit, the idea of merging the Witches and Vamps didn't appeal to me either. However... we love Anne Rice because she paints a \\"real\\" picture for us in her novels. That said, with the power of our Mayfair Witches, and the power of our Vampires, wasn't it inevitable that they cross paths- after all... there is only so much paranormal and supernatural happenings that can occur in New Orleans. Mona was meant to be a vampire. I'd rather her be a Vampire than dead. Mona allows the Vampire Chronicles to live in. You know Mona, the Power Slut, the genius, the witch. She is now our \\"Brat Princess\\" in the world of vampires. Who better to take that title than Mona? Yes... Lestat did whine a bit... But for the love of heaven, wouldn't you if you lived two hundred years, and went through things one can only imagine? If you seen God and creation, and knew it was real, then I would want to be a saint too. I'd be scared not to be, or scared to at least not try.Good job, Anne... This is just another chapter, and I think it was just fine."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I enjoyed Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles, and I really liked the Lives Of The Mayfair Witches series, so I was greatly looking forward to reading Rice's newest effort. &quot;Blood Canticle&quot; is one of those books where you can't quite decide if you love it or hate it. There isn't really one coherent plot, instead we get several mini-plots; Lestat's continuing search for redemption, Mona Mayfair's rebirth into the vampire life and search for her missing Taltos daughter, Julien and Stella Mayfair's haunting of Lestat, the supernatural chaos at Blackwood Farm and more. The problem is that there are so many things going on that none of them are fully delineated or explained. Why did Mona, who bore a Taltos, develop this bizarre wasting disease while Rowan, who bore two, did not? Why does Lestat become so passionately obsessed with Rowan Mayfair? What has happened to Rowan to make her so mentally unstable that she would throw herself at Lestat the way she does? How did the Taltos get to their &quot;secret island&quot; and take it over, and how were they in turn overrun by druglords? Why is Mona such a brat (and who really uses words like &quot;egregious&quot; in everyday conversation anyway?)? What is Oncle Julien's PROBLEM?Another problem I had with &quot;Blood Canticle&quot; is Rice's prose. While I normally enjoy her lush, descriptive language, this book descends from word one into shameless melodrama and stays there. It's written from Lestat's P.O.V., so the whole thig is one dramatic, overdone, rambling stream of consciousness with words after words, so many words, oh my goodness the thoughts and feelings and emotions and...well, you get the idea. Wonder if Valium works on vampires? &quot;Blood Canticle&quot; is the literary version of an oversized fancy dessert; luscious and sugary but you can get surfeited pretty quickly."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"This is not only her worst effort , it's one of the most Dull,Laughable ,and Unreadable books EVER !!! Oh yeah none of the other vamps are here in case you were wondering, BTW I was a hugh Anne Rice fan but it's obvious she's lost her stride !"},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I loved most of the \\"Vampire Chronicles\\". They established a rich and fascinating world full of wonderful characters and intricate storylines. The same can be said for The Witching Hour. And I have never had a problem with the combination of the two storylines. I thought that &quot;Merrick&quot; was a enough of a connection without it getting to &quot;novel&quot; like. But, unfortunately, Anne Rice does not feel the same way about her work. How else can you explain the horrendously boring &quot;Armand&quot;? Or the numbing stupor that &quot;Blood and Gold&quot; and &quot;Blackwood Farm&quot; induced?I thought that &quot;Blackwood Farm&quot; was as bad as novel's get, but I was wrong. &quot;Blood Canticle&quot; redefines the genre with what is undoubtedly, the worst novel that I have ever read. There are so many things that can be said about the \\"story\\", but why? Why should anyone take the time to dissect the \\"intricacies\\" of a novel, when the author can't even be bothered with putting forth any effort? Simply put, \\"Blood Canticle\\" is an insult to anyone who has ever read a \\"Vampire Chronicle\\" or \\"The Lives of the Mayfair Witches\\". Anne Rice should be ashamed of herself, and so should her publisher and her editor for peddling this drivel.Throughout \\"Blood Canticle\\", Lestat professes his desire to become saint. I suggest we do one better. Someone grab two pieces of wood and some nails."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Lestat seemed different. In a way he was the same but some things were just \\"missing\\". Maybe after being with Memnoch and everything, he lost some of his spirit. I don't mean to sound mean, but hey if it happened to me, I would not be the same either. I did enjoy the book though. I don't like people yelling at Anne about why they don't like it. I mean if you don't you, don't but don't insult her like that! I liked it but some of it I didn't like. I didn't like the romantic thing with him and Rowan because it seemed kind of forced but I didn't hate it either. It made some sense why he loved her. I didn't like the fact that Louis wasn't in the book except for brief mentions because Merick left off with him and Lestat being together. At the same time though, I am glad that he was mentioned. That they did talk about him. It kind of leaves off with you, wondering what became of Louis and even Lestat. It didn't end with the gorgeous fiend or the beautiful one dieing, just kind of left off at what next? Overall, I did like the book a lot and I am intrigued by the Taltos too."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Having read Blood Canticle, as well as the many reviews posted on Amazon.com, I am disappointed in the reaction of most reviewers. Though, to be honest, the book was not one of Anne Rice's best works. My two favorite works by Anne Rice are Violin and Memnoch the Devil. Violin is the best example of purple prose Anne Rice ever authored. She created a rich and fascinating environment and wondrous characters. Memnoch was almost all philosophy but philosophical musings that are common to most thinking people and presented in an enjoyable tale.Blood Canticle lacked the purple prose of Violin or even Blackwood Farm. It also lacked the scope that is characteristic of Ms. Rice's major works. As an independent story, the book did not work. Someone who was not familiar with the history of the Chronicles and the Mayfair family would be lost. However, it seems to me that the book is meant more as an epilogue to her earlier works, attempting to bring everything together. As a series epilogue, I think it worked reasonably well.One of the goals of this epilogue appears to have been to explore the moral evolution of Lestat. I would be profoundly disappointed if Lestat had not evolved over the years of this series. Blood Canticle shows a Lestat who has grown up somewhat. He is no longer the Brat Prince of the earlier books but someone who has a conscience, a sense of responsibility, and the capacity for selfless love. While this is the first time we have had access to Lestat's inner musings since Memnoch, the process of evolution was apparent in Merrick and in Blackwood Farm. With access to Lestat's inner musings once more the extent of his inner struggles is center stage.That the dream of the Taltos heading off into the sunset to live an idyllic life was shattered is a bit of healthy closure. There are good times in life and there are bad times but life goes on. The Taltos seemed to enjoy a good life for awhile but it is natural that the bad times came as well. In the end there is death but also hope for those who remain. Life goes on.While the Mayfair characters are a bit thin, they are supporting characters in this book. That supporting characters are a bit thin can be forgiven. This is a book about Lestat.It seems to me that Lestat is asking us how different is the human from the vampire. Obviously, the vampire lives off the blood of others. The vampire is a parasite on humanity. Yet, those who are killed, at least by Lestat and his children, live off the suffering of others. Though human are they morally different from vampires? They are probably more evil than the worst vampire because it is not inherent in their nature to live off the suffering of others. Lestat seems to be struggling with the knowledge of his fallen nature yet trying to make something noble of his existence as well. This is the classic human dilemma.Lestat discovers that no matter what our nature we are capable of discipline and free choice. Within the context of our nature, our choices shape who we become. As the story makes plain, Lestat's desire to be loved is also a desire to love. By the end of the story we see that Lestat is capable of selfless love, The Brat Prince has grown up. I find that satisfying closure to the tale of the Vampire Lestat."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I have read every book that Anne Rice has written, and after reading this book I have come to one conclusion: Anne Rice did NOT write this book! There is no way she wrote it. Her style, which comes out profoundly in her writing was not present in this book. I was wondering if I was reading the right novel, or a story told over AOL messenger half the time. The overuse of &quot;dude&quot; and &quot;yo&quot; and &quot;cool&quot; throughout the book, then changing the name of the nurse at the beginning (wasn't necessary at all), and the overuse of punctuation!!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;----like that...It just did not seem like her at all. Not only that but it was crawling with typos. Obvious ones!!!Overall, I gave this story three stars because I did like the story. I was just confused and wondering who the real author was."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"What has happened in Anne Rice's station on Amazon? It appears there has been a war between reviewers. I didn't even know until my friend told me in casual conversation, and she had read it on Anne Rice's web site.Well I'm fully well in the know now and I had read this book a few months back and I must say, honestly I did not like this book. It disappointed me how the vampire Lestat had changed from the brat Prince to Saint. And I was deeply expecting a reunion of some kind with all the vampires, just to assure the readers what happened to all the characters we had come to love. I must say I was a bit bitter over these two things, plus I never liked Lestat's new Blood Children Quinn or Mona and I was stuck with them throughout the entire book, adventuring with Lestat on a quest I cared not for because I never was interested in Anne's Witch series, which was what they speak of throughout the entire novel. So no, I did not appreciate this to be the last of the legendary Vampire Chronicles. The earlier ones I had grown up with were the ones I will forever be in love with.But I will say another thing. All authors make a piece of literature some readers don't appreciate. Like Stephen King, for example. One of my most favorite authors like Anne is, but I did not care for his novel Cujo. I thought the book was a bit silly. And it's the same with Blood Canticle for me with Anne. And I will not lie and say I loved either one even if I met the two authors face to face. But I also never, ever would say some of the bull others have been posting on here. It is perfectly all right to write like I did, saying you didn't like the novel and that's that, you've thrown your two cents in. But many of the things a few reveiwers have said were terribly offensive, and totally out of line. And for you who say Anne was out of line and egotistical, just think if you wrote a story. If someone remarked to you that you were one terrible writer and should never write again, you would get a little pissed off yourself. Just cause she wrote a novel not to your liking doesn't mean you turn vicious on her. When I read Cujo, I just shrugged as I did with Blood Canticle and replied to myself: Maybe their next novel I'll fall in love with. And that's the way to do it. I truly hope Anne keeps writing like King, for they're two writers I have known and read since a little girl and their writing has inspired me, for they're both writers that say the unspeakable in many ways.The point is nonetheless, I know Anne cannot write gold everytime. No writer can. No writer has. We must understand that. If I, noted a harsh critic at times, can accept that theory, I'm sure everyone else can. And we, the disappointed fans, can wait for the next novel, hoping this time we will fall back in love. That's what the mature fan does right?Anne, please continue on writing. And possibly, maybe, you could give us a formal farewell to the vampires? I desire to say farewell to Armand one last time.But overall Anne, you have my personal apology. And for any other writers whom have been attacked with such cruel- hearted and uncalled for words before as well."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I used to love Anne Rice's early works, specially \\" Interview with the Vampire\\" and \\"The Feast of all Saints\\". The characters where so rich and yet so real that anyone could in fact relate to them.The writting was simple and captivating at the same time.However, everything changed in the \\"Tale of the body thief\\". I ignored how ridiculous a rock star vampire can be, but stealing bodies? and the next books including God allmighty himself???...Lestat stopped being a sensual wicked playful vampire to become a pathetic \\"supervampire\\" who finds Jesus... I guess it is because Anne is into Christianity now which is perfectly valid but it doesn't go with vampirism much.The books have become pure preposterous fantasy and The Blood canticle is the cherry of the cake.Meeting the Pope, having ST Juan Diego(Which actually might insult the catholic-mexican comunity), is way over the top. Anne, you should have stopped the Vampire Chronicles with the \\"Queen of the damned\\".Readers don't think of you as serious writter anymore.Yes you still sell, and yes you have an audience : I have been to recent book signings and 90% of your audience were goth/vampire kids.which brings me to give you a short reply to your post here on amazon.com:-you say that you have avoided criticism most of your career. that only means you can't take it and can't accept the fact other people dislike your work.You call them (us) utter \\"trash\\".-You emphasize the fact that Lestat belongs to you; he is your character. well news flash: everytime a book, song, movie comes out the characters belong to the public since they are the ones who allow you to develop them further thanks to sequels.-you imply that the people who dislike your last books are too stupid to understand them. Well, insulting readers won't get you anywhere.Indeed, it only makes you look more selfish and angry because a woman of your age, who \\"has found christ\\",is expected to come up with a more mature response to our criticism.And please don't attack my spelling or grammar since you can't even spell \\"Juan Diego\\" correctly in your review (or should I say pathetic attack?)and I seriously doubt serious educated people read the junk you write anyways.I hope you find peace in your mediocrity and that you remember why you started writting in the first place."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I loved Blackwood Farm, but having now read the sequel, Blood Canticle, I find it disappointing. The story is loose, slow, unfocused. It feels like Rice has tried to tie up loose ends without being able to create a coherent story. At times, she seems to please herself with rantings that give the novel little direction. Read it if you must, but don't expect too much of this one."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"First things first: Mrs. Rice, if you're out there: I am very sorry to hear of your recent loss.Now, Literature, or the lack thereof:With her first novel, \\"Interview with the Vampire\\", Anne Rice acheived something remarkable: she stripped from vampire fiction all the musty, B-movie trappings it had accumulated since Stoker, and in doing so allowed her characters to be human, and thus accessible to a human audience. \\"Interview\\" was a revolutionary and influential book; without it there would be no \\"Buffy,\\" no \\"Angel,\\" no \\"Bram Stoker's Dracula\\" and cetainly no \\"Underworld.\\" Mrs. Rice is on record as stating that if she's read two hundred years from now it will be for her adault \\"Beauty\\" series... I warrant it will also be for \\"Interview\\".The trouble comes will all the subsequent books. Rice puts back all the pointless trappings, plus some, expecting her readers to accept, not only vampires, but witches, ghosts, astral projection, dopplegangers, ad nauseum, with very little inducement for suspension of disblief save for an implicit, authorial 'because I said so'. I understand she uses the entire first chapter of this latest book to chastize (via Lestat) the readers who dared criticize \\"Memnoch\\": \\"I give you this metaphysical vision...and what thanks do I get? 'What kind of novel is this,' you asked.\\" Well, Anne, if you're wondering, the answer is simple: the world moved beyond arguing over how many angels can dance on the head of a pin some time ago, and 'because I said so' isn't enough. Piling on unsubstantiated, \\"metaphysical\\" tommyrot outside the realm of their experience--indeed, outside of ANYONE'S verifiable experience-- serves only to alienate your readers. They are mortal, and children of the twenty-first century. They teach Critical Thinking in colleges, you know.But, all of this is apparently now moot: \\"Blood Canticle\\" purports to be the last of the \\"Vampire Chronicles\\" (Riiight... how many times has David Bowie retired?), so perhaps disenchanted Rice fans may place their hopes on the upcoming Elton John/Bernie Taupin musical adaptation of The Vampire Lestat. And, who knows? Perhaps Mr. Christopher Rice's recent forays into horror fiction are but practice for the day he takes over the franchise."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Blood Canticle delivers a startling double-shot of literary unprofessionalism.First, Anne Rice uses her most beloved character to berate and insult her fanbase for not appreciating her 1995 release, Memnoch the Devil. In his half-coherent rant, Lestat points out that Memnoch sold more copies than any other book in the series. Were those numbers really a surprise to anyone? After all, the film version of Interview with the Vampire had become a huge hit only months before. But apparently (at least in Anne's mind), most of those books went to idiots who didn't bother to understand its importance. So yes, Anne, insult us. Insult the readers who have kept up with your work for a decade or more, because we obviously just don't appreciate you. Never mind that literature is, by nature, always open to interpretation. We didn't read Memnoch the way you wanted. We deserve to be berated by the Brat Prince.Please.Oh, and the second unprofessional element in Blood Canticle? Rice follows up that rant with a novel that's practically unreadable. Characters act entirely differently than in past books (and that's not character development -- that's simple inconsistency). A few of the luckier characters have disappeared completely, thus escaping this soapy car wreck of a narrative. And what in the world happened to Lestat's written voice? He used to turn a charming phrase; now he speaks and writes like a half-literate teenager.I hope Anne keeps her promise and makes Blood Canticle the last book in the series. Her once-great characters deserve to rest in peace, if this sort of book is the best she can manage for them otherwise."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"'Blood Canticle' is by far the fastest-reading one of the Vampire Chronicles. I found myself surprised by the pace, as I've been reading Anne Rice for years and am accustomed to their taking a bit longer to get through. This one was a three-nighter.I'd call this one 'Anne Rice for people who don't really read Anne Rice.' It's a bit lighter fare than some of the others and it's quite playful in places. I for one enjoyed Lestat's opening diatribe chastising readers for not liking 'Memnoch' and found his recent discovery of 'lingo' amusing. I can't understand why so many readers were so violently upset over Lestat's linguistic change - I mean sure, maybe 'yo' and 'dude' and 'shove it' are a little behind the times, but that aside, do some of us have a problem with Lestat entering the 21st century? He is getting on to 300 years old, is he not? He's an immortal, is he not? Hadn't he better get used to the world changing? Hadn't the readers better get used to it too?It would NOT work for a character like Louis or Armand to be talking that way, but it works for Lestat - he is an always has been completely full of himself and I think that's a fine and funny way to keep things fresh.It was kind of strange to have Maharet communicating by email! That threw me for a loop but again, it is the 21st century.Missing from this book are some of the lengthy narrative descriptions - Anne Rice is a master of description and in many of her books this can go on for pages. While it can sometimes be a bit bogged down, I almost found myself missing it in 'Blood Canticle.' It was as if something had been abbreviated.The characters seemed somewhat abbreviated too - especially the Mayfairs. 'The Witching Hour' is my favorite Anne Rice and one of my favorites, period, and I was delighted with the idea of incorporating Mayfair with Vampire Chronicles. But after the lushness of 'The Witching Hour,' these characters return in 'Blood Canticle' somewhat diminished. I forgot Michael Curry was even in the room on several occasions - wouldn't even know he was there until he spoke some line of dialogue. The same went for Quinn, who also disappeared almost completely in this book. I liked him in 'Blackwood Farm' (and yes, I liked 'Blackwood Farm'!) but in 'Blood Canticle' he's rather reduced to a vehicle for shushing and comforting distraught females. Oncle Julien didn't seem quite himself either, although putting him in the book was throwing a great bone to the readers. I never really understood why it was Stella who appeared with him, of all the Mayfair witches to choose from, and it occurred to me that if you hadn't read 'The Witching Hour,' you'd have no idea who Stella was.The Rowan/Lestat thing made sense to me. They've both done some unspeakable things in their lives and they're both seeking redemption in some way. They each see the goodness in the other and they're drawn to one who sees their goodness. However, I found their teenager-like encounter at the base of the oak tree unnecessary. This thing existed in the book on a much loftier, almost metaphysical plane until that happened and I was a bit grossed out.The whole Taltos thing was rushed and needed more explanation for readers who haven't read the Mayfair books. I totally understood what was going on because I have, but I imagine that someone who hadn't wouldn't cotton at all to the Taltos business, and some of the reviews I've read here are obviously by readers who haven't read 'Taltos,' 'Lasher,' or 'Witching Hour.' Those three books are the perfect example of suspension of disbelief and they are great.I did feel sad at the end knowing that this is the last of the Vampire Chronicles because for all these years I've been reading them, but I suppose we can all just use our imaginations from here on out and hope that Anne Rice will continue writing, even if it's something completely different. Subject matter aside, she is an excellent writer and while I don't necessarily love each and every one of her books, I'll always continue to read them.I'm shocked by some of the mean-spirited reviews I've read here. Everyone's entitled to their opinion and that's why this is a great website, but to be so destructive in attacking Anne Rice only deters people who have never read any of her books, and now never might.No, it's not 'The Witching Hour' or 'Interview with the Vampire' or 'The Vampire Lestat', but 'Blood Canticle' is fun. It's a good time reading it. It's entertaining and it's good escapism. What else are you looking for if you just want to enjoy yourself with a book?Sure, I would have loved to see Louis but it looks like Louis has moved on with his life so more power to him and let the rest of us take his example."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"&quot;Blood Canticle&quot; is a novel that Anne Rice was well over 3/4 of the way writing when her husband was diagnosed with brain cancer. She took time off from writing and then went back to the novel in order to make her dead line. When reading the novel, the shift in her tone is evident. (Besides the fact that the novel was finished on October 5, Stan was diagnosed in August. No way the novel was done that quickly, no matter how sloppy and poorly written it is.)Still, that means she had written over half the book before he was sick. So you know what that means... no excuse. &quot;Blood Canticle&quot; is repellent. And it would be forgivable if Blood and Gold &amp; Blackwood Farm had been even half-way decent novels, but they weren't. And so the all the excuses and half-hearted defenses with continue for Ms. Rice. It still does not make up for an once brilliant author who had decided to churn out novels more processed than Velvetta.The language is terrible, the &quot;plot&quot; is a joke, and all the while you can't hope but think, she knows it as well. But she doesn't. And I don't think this will be the last chronicle. Let's face it... writing a vampire chronicle pays, and it's obivious that is what Anne Rice is concerned with. Art and intergrity have been stomped on and there isn't even a glimmer of the once great author she was. That's the greatest tragity. Yo, I think it's time for us all to boogie on over to a better writer, baby."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"If you love the Vampire Chronicles, please don't read this book. It won't be the smashing hit you want it to be, it won't even come close.If you heard the Vampire Lestat was back and he's starring in Blood Canticle, you were lied to. The Lestat you knew in the first few books of the Chronicles is gone. Blood Canticle stars Saint Lestat, a contrived rip-off of the original.The butcher of Lestat's character aside, how do you remember all the other characters? You Mayfair fans, don't look for your characters here, unless your looking for the fancition-style card board cut-out of them.I'm as big an Anne Rice fan as the next person, believe me. And I wouldn't be saying such harsh things about her work if I didn't believe they were true. It saddens me to say it, but this book was nothing but a disappointment. I do not recommend it."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Usually, I think that appreciation for every book is up to an individual's taste. Believe me, there are a few classics that I would rather be bludgeoned to death with than have to read again. But, how can anyone who has appreciated Anne Rice's earlier work even give this novel 2 stars? I mean, it is really bad.The work (or lack thereof) is just terrible and shoddy. I have read short stories by 8th graders that had more thought than this drivel did. I have read every novel Anne has written. Some have been better than others. But nothing has been as poorly done as &quot;Blood Canticle&quot;. She has just completely lost touch with reality. Does she really think that people speak like that? And does she truly think that by having Lestat use words like &quot;Yo&quot; and &quot;Bro&quot; that he has adapted to modern times?Religion is great and Lestat used to be so interesting. But Lestat, like the author, seems to have found a new orifice that he like to speak out of.I won't comment on the characters. They are all one dimensional idiots. There is no plot, even though we are promised one. And... I just can't even go on. I will never read or purchase another Anne Rice book. This is just too insulting. I think I will join two Taltos in the deep freeze and just pray that it goes away."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"This book is really not good work compared to Ms Rice's earliest works, although I still think the Witching Hour is the finest book that she has written. This book has the thinly etched sense that makes me feel as if I have already read it.I don't see any point in being nasty or personal, that's just my take. These are reader opinions, not professional reviewers, but we do buy (and buy and buy) her books. If she can't take the heat she should stay out of the Literary Amazon Kitchen."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Of course I will always love Interview with The Vampire, The Vampire Lestat and The Queen of the damned. But many Anne Rice fans agree they go down hill from there. There are certain circles that refer to my previously mentioned first three vampire chronicles as the ONLY vampire Chronicles. All the rest come off like fan fictions from some other person.Nothing done now can change what had been. The Interview with the vampire is still the interview with the vampire. The Vampire Lestat is still The Vampire Lestat, The Queen of the damned is still The Queen of the damned. I just pretend it's 1989 and the others were not published yet. They did not happen.Lestat, in my mind, is still a rebel, still a brat, still mischievous, still questions things, still fearless, still angst driven, still a fighter, and still perseverent. He's still riding around on his Harley, hunting down his killers and falling in love with the world. He's still an optimist (He has a pessimistic view of humanity in Blood Canticle.) He still views society today as an age of innocence and he's still my Lestat. All the rest... to me.. They're just fan fictions.I wish Anne Rice had done a book that she once hinted about years ago. The idea of the vampires being found out by some mortals and possibly captured and studies and then the escape... Lestat talks about this idea in The Vampire Lestat. That could have been a great novel, especially with our proud and defiant Lestat. This conformist, prude, depthless, two-dimensional Lestat would fold under that pressure but the Lestat I know would not. The first three vampire chronicles- that's my Lestat. That will always be my Lestat and no one can take that away from me.I miss Lestat. Lestat in Blood Canticle is whining. And he's become a conformist. He's now a hard-core Catholic who questions nothing, a cold hypocrite, a misogynist, a prude, and pessimist. This is not our Lestat! Our Lestat was a brat. Our Lestat questioned things. Our Lestat was always a rebel. Changing his personality this abruptly is like saying he now has blue hair and orange eyes. The angst is gone. The fearless soul that could never be oppressed is gone. He seems almost defeated by life, and defeat is against Lestat's nature. This whole book is against his nature! Certain aspects of one's personality don't change THAT drastically over time. And he's supposed to be roughly two-hundred and forty-six-years-old. And for most of that he was the Lestat I loved. This so called maturing is tragic and if this is what you call maturing I'd rather be a child. I never viewed maturing as becoming closed minded, sexist, spiritually defeated, conformed or becoming pessmistic. What a dreary view of life that would be!I did not love the fangs or the blonde hair. I loved his personality. I related to Lestat, not the vampire! She's forgotten who Lestat was.Lestat used to see this world as an age of secular innocence where evil doers were scarce. And now he says there are many in the cities who deserve the vampire's kiss. He's become depthless (if he had much depth to begin with.) He's two dimensional. He's hunting down rogues and rule breaker vampires! He is a rogue and rule breaker! I want Lestat, I don't want Angel from Buffy The Vampire Slayer!I want Lestat the way he was meant to be. If Anne Rice needed a new character to express her obsession and new-found conformist mentality she should have used ANYONE but The Brat Prince to express it! I think this book disappointed every Anne Rice fan, everywhere, one way or another.What happened to our man of action? Where's The James Bond of the Vampires? My God! In these later novels the character himself can't even get his own name right. He keeps saying he was twenty, he was twenty-one as a mortal when he killed the wolves so how could he appear twenty now?I know I'm being harsh but Anne calls this maturing for Lestat. Being mature does not mean clinging desperately to something without question. Being mature does not mean becoming sexist with fashion, and seeing evil everywhere where he once was in love with the goodness in society. Lestat was a brat but he had faith in goodness. Now he doesn't seem to have that faith. His real and pure faith has been replaced by something superficial, something dark. And the restless spirit, the angst driven rebel, the one who could not be dominated... Our beloved antagonist, he's gone.... I don't know who this creature is who is narrating the story but it's not our Lestat.I'll always love the first three vampire chronicles, Interview with The Vampire, The Vampire Lestat and The queen of the damned. By my advice to anyone just starting, don't go any further than that. Tale of the body thief is good for comic relief if you have a dark sense of humour but that's about it."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I have always been a huge Ann Rice fan, and have read several of her early books more than once. The first few vampire chronicles and Mayfair stories were awesome. But I can't get into Blood Canticle, even after giving it the standard 100 pages I try to give all books I read. Mona is a trashy brat, Lestat is over the top cocky, Rowan is loopy...only Quinn holds any interest for me at this point and he has hardly been featured at all. Unless Ann brings back Louis, Armand and the old gang, in some new adventure, this will be my last vampire chronicle. There's just nothing like the good old days!"},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"And I don't say that lightly. It really is the WORST book ever. My favorite book of all time is The Vampire Lestat, so it hurts to have to say that. But it is true. From the first diatribe ridden page to the last anti climatic ludicrus page it is truly horrible. I've read and reread all of Rice's books except for Feast of All Saints and I've liked all of them (except Taltos and to some extent Memnoch the Devil; but at least that book had SOME redeeming qualities, Blood Canticle has NONE). I refuse to even think that the character in this book is actually Lestat. There is almost no similiarity to the Lestat I know very well and love. This is a completely different character who is boring, juvenile, and insipid. None of the characters are consistent with what they were in the previous books. Michael is reduced to just having a hot bod and being Rowan's cast off. Mona is a brainless you know what. Rowan is a shadow of her former self. The love story between Lestat and Rowan is unbelieveable, laughable, ridiculous and painful to have to read. The storyline about the Taltos is almost disgusting and it is beyond that, besides any point I could see the novel might have. I could say so many things about this book. When I heard about the plot about Lestat wanting to be a Saint, I thought it would be very interesting. It is so far from interesting it goes absolutely nowhere. He yammers on and on about some obscure saint, and has nothing insightful to say about the subject. Inexplicably he gives up the subject half way through and goes of to have a relationship with Rowan who he is paired with through some sort of convenience for the author to try to wrap things up. Lestat could have gone out gracefully, but this book cuts his head off and buries him in sludge (not literally of course). I was excited for Julien to be in the book.....he is hardly in it and is ineffectual as a ghost, person, or character. I see no reason for him being in the book at all. I could go on and on. Seriously, and no kidding, worst book ever."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Talk about a mixed bag of reviews! Either people hate it, or they love it. Either is fine, but why the personal attacks on the author? All that shows is bad case of \\"small person syndrome\\" - very bad taste people, let's keep reviews about the book.A lot of the negatives among the reviews here seem to want to compare the Blood Canticle with previous Vampire Chronicles and Mayfair Witches novels. \\"It's too fast paced\\", \\"it's lacking description\\", \\"it's not as good as...\\". Yes it is fast paced - great read isn't it? What you all seem to be forgetting is that the Vampire Chronicles all have several different \\"authors\\" who themselves have different styles. Even Lestat himself has had several lifetimes worth of fantastic supernatural experiences - is it any wonder his outlook (and therefore is focus when recounting a story) will change. Who says Lestat is not growing or developing - the very fact that the Blood Canticle is again different to previous books is evidence that he is. Enjoy the evolution for what it is, and stop trying to be too analytical and clever for your own good - read with an open mind and you shall see.For new readers to the Anne Rice series, this is a great book. Period. It is fast paced and full of action, and wonderfully entertaining throughout. Other reviewers have complained that the characters here are not as well defined as they appear in other books. That is completely irrelevant for this book, and takes nothing away from this story - all characters here are perfectly represented as they need to be for this tale, as they appear in the eyes of the writer and lead player, Lestat. This is the book of a story as told by him, as he sees it. It is not a narrative from a non-existent third person perspective - it has bias and it has feeling. There can be no better example of this than by going back to the first two books in the Vampire Chronicles, whereby the same story is told through the eyes of Louis, in Interview with a Vampire, and through the eyes of Lestat, in The Vampire Lestat. I think many \\"reviewers\\" here have forgotten, or indeed missed this point altogether. New readers, read this book. If you can wait, read it last - after you have read all of Anne's previous books. They will entertain you, provoke thought, inspire you - this list could go on for ever, but most of all, you'll want to read more of these characters. The different styles of writing in this series tells us as much about the story teller character as the words themselves, and this approach is in my opinion a true stroke of genius. Get involved, you'll be glad you did."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Bravo! Mrs. Anne Rice! On so many levels...but especially for ALL your novels and for expressing your opinion on your pathetically-less-than-devoted-so-called fans.I did feel that the southern charm was rather thick, but it was done so well and so beautifully that how else could this read come to live so much without it...it is called setting and atmosphere, two essential components for ghost stories, which this novel is much of. And I do love ghost stories. This incredible lady never fails to create lasting legend.For those of you who think she didn't stick with the characteristics that we have so much fallen in love with, I suggest you re-read each and every Vampire Chronicle and do try to pay attention this time!Just a few comments on the negative feed-back I've read...The post concercing Lestat using the terms 'yo' and 'cool'...It took me off guard, too, but I accepted it easily due to the fact that Lestat IS a rather unpredictable character and always chooses to do and say whatever he wants (poor little things can't handle slang coming from the mouth of Lestat, the horrible gasp of air you must have had! How DO you sleep at night?) For any true Lestat fan, it should have been just as easy for you to except this little 'faux-pas', which is clearly what you see it as. But then again, you probably aren't a true Lestat fan, or you would have easily 'forgiven' him this just as all the other 'blunders' he has ever committed. I'm a little shocked you even made it this far really.As for the comment about the ending and letting all the other characters 'go out' like that...a little insight on this...have you perhaps considered that Lestat's continuence reflects the continuence of all the other surviving vampires (and I shall point out Maharet's communications to Lestat from a distance). Thankfully Lestat continues as do the others. I truly was afraid I would have to say a tearful farewell to Lestat, but I am over joyed that he still roams.Someone also commented on Mrs. Rice's arrogance concerning her post about not allowing any editor to 'distort out...or otherwise mutilate sentences...she herself polished.' For you 'true' Lestat fans, had she allowed that, you would not have been truly hearing from Lestat. Be thankful she did not allow it and you got an ever more intimate meeting with Lestat de Lioncourt. Try to understand this and be grateful and honored, as you very well should be, not only for the opportunity to know Lestat more cleary but for Mrs. Rice's respect to you as her reader.I do believe Lestat gave you ample opportunity to NOT read the book from the beginning. Seeing as how you DID choose to read it, shut-up your whining! Perhaps you'll listen more closely next time...I applaud Anne Rice for standing her ground on keeping true to her characters, concerning letting no editor or publisher dictate how SHE should write HER story. That sort of thing is absolutely essential for hard-core authors such as herself and also for hard-core fans, as she obviously knows more than any of us ever can. After all, she does hold the fate of all those beloved characters in her hands. Their fate is not and in no way should be up to any other but herself and her characters.AND, as for being 'arrogant' about responding to the incredibably cold, malicious, taunting, outrageous, inhumane criticisms...HOW DARE anyone imply or out-right declare that she has no right or is 'out-of-line' or should just bear it because that's what a professional and accomplished writer would do! SHE IS HUMAN! I hope all of you nasty little minions become so one day yourselves!I'll conclude this now, and just say to Mrs. Anne Rice...Bravo! in SO many ways!"},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I feel as though I have to come to the defense of Ms. Rice. I am a long time fan, and I have always identified with her work. I think the reason I identify with her books so much is because Ms. Rice writes of her own personal experiences. Like most people, through the course of life, our experiences mold us and change us. This is, therefore, reflected in her novels. Do not kid yourselves. Ms. Rice does not write for you. She write first and foremost for herself. Why shouldn't she? Yes, her most recent novels differ from her older ones. Why shouldn't they? She is writing from a different view point, from a different frame of mind. No one has a right to hold that against her. You have the choice to read her novels or not to read them. For those of you who aren't satisfied by her latest work, do not read it--don't whine and carry on and act as if you've been betrayed. She never promised you anything. Ms. Rice wrote the best book she could in her eyes. You go try writing a novel yourselves. Then you can criticize."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I have not finished it yet, but can see that it will be the perfect conclusion for the mayfair/vampires chronicles!

In case you people don't keep up with the news, she's retiring the publisher's needed her to write an ending for her chronicles. She had nothing left to give, but hell at least she tried. I don't see how anyone can complain. She wrote for herself not the public so get over her book being crap."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Let me first off say that im a big fan of anne rice. i simply adore her work. including this book. so her writing has changed, so Lestat changed, so what? Lestat, as a character, has met God. let me reiterate, he met the Creator, the maker of heaven and earth, the most awe-inspiring being in creation. and you expect him to remain unchanged? the problem is that you assume a wise man will speak in an antiquated dialect. Lestat's strength is his ability to adapt, to change with the times. look beyond the slang to see the moral evolution it represents."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I've been reading Ms. Rice's works for years and I've got all of her books.Honestly, it's one of my priced possesion. I've been thinking that those who criticizes her work were'nt able to read the whole saga. this is not a question of correlation of the events in the book. it's clear that those who dissed her writing didn't even knew how to write their own bestseller! Yes, we knew that as the book progressed, it's story is not as catchy as it was before. But don't ever forget that it's still one of the sought-after vampire tale of the century...and so very unlike Dracula whose funny eccentricities are what I hate most.It was the lives of the vampires and not the technicality. Yes you people are the most unperfect creation of God yet you're the creature who fiercely sought for perfection. It was not like what you said because if it is... then the book will not be labeled bestseller!Have you got no sense at all? Just want to inform those fans who still support and love the chronicles down to the last chronicle, we asians still love the book and if we have some complain about it, it was'nt as rude as those who didn't even knew what writing means. i'm also a Writer and I knew that half of those who read the chronicles didn't even knew what to make of it. The ending of the book may be hurried, but still, Ms. Rice was able to impart to her readers the main character Lestat's feelings in very awarding ways. It's not a petty thing to be inlove and all people knew that. The book must not be labeled like a usual romance because it was'nt.though we still want another supplement and we knew the series is over. Well, admit that ms. Rice is one of the brilliant Gothic Writers of our time and it will take another century to produce a gothic genius like what she was."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I really enjoyed the book as I do all her books. Really liked it alot."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"This book by Anne Rice, Blood Canticle, a conclusion to the Vampire Chronicles, was an insult. I felt Blood Canticle concluded absolutely nothing but my desire to read anymore of her books. Anne did not like the negative reviews she recieved for Memnoch the Devil, the last book that truly featured the character Lestat, and in the first chapter, Lestat/Anne berates her readers for it. While reading this terrible book, one gets the feeling that Anne is writing to those that did not like or understand Memnoch the Devil by saying, \\"Here, you simpletons, I've written a book that even you can understand.\\" The result is that the book reads like trash. Indeed, I believe even Anne herself admits to this when she has Lestat tell the readers to \\"Go ahead, throw this book away. Spit on me. Revile me. I dare you. Cast me out of your intellectual orbit. Throw me out of your backpack. Pitch me in the airport trash bin. Leave me on a bench in Central Park!\\" I wish I had listened.Blood Canticle picks up where Blackwood Farm left off, and the way it was presented, I wish it had not.In Blood Canticle, Anne merged the Vampire Chronicles with the Withching Hour series. The WH series in itself was great, but Anne ruined the other wise rich and intriguing characters in it.1. In Witching Hour, Mona was a tough, overly mature, genius at the age of 13. In Blood Canticle, at age 20 she is constantly whining and crying, and throwing temper tantrums.2. Michael Curry, the hero of the Witching Hour series, and one of the kindest characters, has been reduced to a spineless shell of his former self, allowing his wife Rowan to do whatever (whomever!) she wants.3. Rowan Mayfair, the cold hearted neurosurgeon, who has the ability to kill people with her mind,( and she does, several times), has cheated on Michael with a Taltos, has left him for dead while Michael was drowning in a swimming pool, shot 3 bullets into her innocent Taltos daughters' face, tried to pimp Mona off on Michael, wanted to (but did not) have sex with another Taltos, had sex with her adoptive father while her adoptive mother was dying in agony of cancer, and has tried to leave Michael again for Lestat, is only 'just now' depicted as mad in this latest book.4. Doesn't Lestat kill women like Rowan Mayfair? He always has before.....but no, what does he do? He falls madly inlove with her! The way that the Rowan and Lestat love affair was written, I swear I was reading a Danielle Steel novel.So much has already been written about Lestat's little trip to Heaven and Hell with Memnoch, that I'm not even going to get into it here. Suffice it to say the Lestat we all love to hate is gone.5. None of the other characters from the VC are in what was supposed to be a conclusive book.Anne Rice left openings in her previous novels such as the threat of the Talamasca, or Lestat's time with the angels, so the Vampire Chronicles had still some potential. Instead she wrote Blood Canticle, and it felt as if she just threw it all together simply to get it all over and done with as she wishes to move in other directions now.In an interview, Anne Rice said her readers had to come where she was going. If she writes anymore of this drivel, and loses her world wide fan base as a result, she'll be coming back to where her numerous fans are still waiting for a much better ending to the VC."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I read all of the reviews for this book and I thought it can't be that bad. From the 3rd chapter I thought to myself who is this new whinny,weak Lestat? The story line was weak and my goodness Quin is such a wimp! What a useless side kick! Also what was up with Lestat's lingo??? Yo Bro? I have so many more things to add but I'm sure it will just be the same thing has everyone else's. So, I will just say this for shame anne, for shame you could have done a lot better then this!"},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I Bought the book, only so anne rice could sign it, and that's the only reason i won't throw it in the trash. i'm going to have to reread books 1,2,3,4, and 6, just so i can remember why i loved the vampires to begin with. honestly, i couldn't get past page 100. the dialogue didn't flow, and made no sense, so unlike anne. when anne's on, she's the best in description and dialogue, but this book just proves that no writer is great all the time.i don't particularly enjoy reading about ghosts or her family of witches, but if it was a good story, i would hardly have noticed the obvious flaws. and it's practically dripping with catholism, which i don't mind in a good book, but this book wasn't.i know anne's been through a rough time, with her husband dying in the next room, so i'll just pretend i never read this horrible slap in the face to the vampire chronicles. i think she's a great writer, now she just needs to write great books again. poor, poor lestat, and where's my louis?"},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"We'll it's a first for me: I had a review removed, and to have it removed for this particular book is quite amazing, considering all the insults and name calling that have been posted here, aimed at and between both readers and Mrs. Rice. Someone obviously didn't read beyond my prior post for them to consider it the most heinous and offensive post here! So for this repost, I'll try not to step on any sensitive toes. God forbid that to happen! That my review was removed, while others exponentially worse, more insulting, and grossly crueler remain, is nothing short of miraculous! My faith in the ability of others to respect the diversity of opinions is renewed! We should all strive to be one and politically correct, after all. Onward to my review 2.0...In my most humble opinion, this book is just as boring if not more so than the novel that preceded it in the series. Early on in the novel, we, the readers, are chastised by Rice through Lestat for not liking \\"Memnoch the Devil.\\" While Rice remains one of my favorite authors, I still retain the right to not like a work that she produces - as I do with any writer. Of all the books that I've read in my life, I've never seen criticism addressed in such a manner. To me, it seems petty to do this and to alienate the readers, without whom Rice would have no audience.This book suffers from a boring plot. The book mainly seems to follow Lestat and company (Lestat, Mona, and Quinn) trying to find Mona's lost child, a Taltos. What exactly is a Taltos? Apparently tall humanoid creatures, lacking bones (yes, bones!) and human wisdom. Ironically, they have the intelligence to build vast financial empires, as one of them does in the story, but they can't survive amongst humans. Oh yeah, and they only consume white foods. They're boring, and they only drag the story down with them.The style of writing isn't nice to read. Lestat's manner of speaking is quite hard to follow. Especially early on in the book, he thinks in sentence fragments. It's not a flowing prose, and it's hard to read. Parts of this novel are written like an abstract poem, and not a novel.The content of the book is disturbing, too. This book is full of sexually deviant imagery, as was the novel before it. In the last novel we have Quinn and Goblin, who are bothers - albeit one of them is a ghost, having sexual contact, and in this novel two of the Taltos, who are brother and sister have sexual contact. If this isn't deviant sexuality, then there isn't any. But, hey, what do I know, right?This book is also a continuation of the religious imagery contained in previous novels. I hate to read Lestat go on an on about Catholicism and saints, while at the same time profaning the very tenants for which they stand - faith, morality, fidelity (he has an affair with Dr. Mayfair!), absolute truth, Biblical authority, etc. It makes Lestat come off not as a saint or even a person trying to be saint, as Lestat states over and over in this book, but as a hypocrite and a false messiah. I think it's an expression of New Age philosophy and Universalism, born out of extreme, all-inclusive, amoral liberalism. Rice's books have become increasingly \\"preachy\\" since \\"Memnoch the Devil,\\" and this book is no different. I'll not apologize for disliking this kind of pseudo-religion.To me, this book is another one that can easily be skipped. I've read all of her vampire novels except \\"Interview with a Vampire.\\" The early ones are the best, and, in my opinion, they generally go downhill from there, with \\"Memnoch the Devil\\" being the absolute worst and \\"The Vampire Armand\\" being a close second. My advice is to go read any of the following: \\"The Vampire Lestat\\" (which I think is the best and nearly perfect book by Rice), \\"Vittorio,\\" \\"Pandora,\\" \\"Merrick,\\" or even \\"Queen of the Damned,\\" \\"Tales of the Body Thief,\\" and \\"Blood and Gold.\\""},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Bravo, Anne Rice. If you must leave the vampires, for a moment; for now; forever...you have left them in style.Blood Canticle continues to renew my interest in Anne Rice. For years I have followed the vampires' exploits...and for a long period of time was very disappointed in the fact that it all seemed to be familiar territory, time and again.Then along came Blackwood Farm; which took my breath away. Blood Canticle is what I would term an 'extension' of that story. But not only that, it is a continuation of the Mayfair Witch saga; as well as a (purported) finale to the story of Lestat.Quinn Blackwood has most everything he wants; he has been rid of his ghostly shadow, Goblin; his hated mother Patsy has been dealt with; Mona Mayfair has been brought over to the realm of the undead, to prevent her mortal expiration from the ravages of disease left behind by events relayed in Lasher and Taltos; and his new friend Lestat is completely enraptured with him.Mona Mayfair, the headstrong designee of the Mayfair Legacy was prepared for death, which she did, in a manner of speaking, meet. But that mortal death has brought her a new 'life'; that of the vampire, and an eternity to spend with her beloved Quinn.Lestat still seeks redemption for his soul...having met with angels and demons in Memnoch, the Devil he wants 'to be a saint, ...to save save souls by the millions, to do good far and wide, to fight evil'. The 'Brat Prince' of the undead wants to be delivered into salvation, despite his evildoings. And he wants Rowan Mayfair, the beautiful, mysterious, strong-willed doctor who desperately wants Mona to return to her so that she can help her die in peace, not knowing that Mona has been given the gift of the 'Dark Blood'.Once a vampire, Mona realizes that her life will never be the same, and that a whole new existance is open to her. But there is one final door that she must close on her human life...one final question that must be answerd; the fate of Morrigan, the daughter she gave birth to years before, who disappeared with Ashlar, an ancient Taltos, never to be seen again.Lestat, Quinn, and Mona search for Morrigan, and any other surviving Taltos, while Lestat searches for an end to his own quest. And when Rowan returns Lestat's interest, his determination grows all the stronger to help Mona, and Rowan.In this supposed finale to the Vampire series, Anne Rice ties up the loose ends of some of her more recent works, and the Mayfair series. While this book will not give you insight into the further stories of Armand, Louis, Marius, or the other blood drinkers Rice has made famous, fans have been clamoring for a book in Lestat's voice for years. And Rice has delivered.This book, the 12th in her Vampire Chronicles, is a fine addition to Anne Rice's tales of the undead. Read it, savor it...it could be the last one for all eternity.'And love becomes again my reprimand, my goad, my song.'"},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I was going to read this book. I've heard from some people that they had enjoyed Rice's past works. Now that I've seen her response to some reviewers, I can't in good conscience put more money in her pocket. Anyone who would use so many flagrant ad hominems in response to criticisms of her work needs to grow up. Did you notice that I don't have a \\"Real Name\\" badge by my name? Of course you did. You seem eager to notice that sort of thing. Do you even know what the difference between having that badge and not having it is? Credit card information. I am less than surprised (after reading your \\"From the Author to the Some of the Negative Voices Here\\") to see that you are so petty as to disregard comments from people who do not wish to share credit card information with Amazon just so they can write an open review of your book. You ought to be ashamed.This is a quote from Anne Rice's own response to the book's detractors:\\"nowhere in this text are you told that this is the last of the chronicles, nowhere are you promised curtain calls or a finale, nowhere are you told there will be a wrap-up of all the earlier material. The text tells you exactly what to expect.\\"To this I say, \\"Oh, really\\". Then why is it that at the very end of that same exact response do you then say \\"And yes, the Chronicles are no more! Thank God!\\". Clearly you intended this book to be the last. Then why try to lie to your readers? These people paid money, in at least some cases, I'm sure, for the privilege of reading your book. I think they deserve a little better from you when they post their feelings about the book in a public forum. Especially when you lambast them for wanting closure in the final book.This forum is meant for reviews. Not everyone will love every book as you seem to, Anne. I noticed that you haven't given any book fewer than 5 stars in any of your reviews. Is that because you've never read a bad book? I know I have. Do you subscribe to the idiocy of \\"If you don't have anything nice to say...\\"? What value would these reviews have, then? How dare you censure people who paid for your book, read it, and cared enough about the content to tell other people about how they felt.How stupid do you think your readers are, anyway? Maybe I shouldn't ask that question. It seems obvious that you hold your high and mighty self at a level above us mere peons. Clearly the word \\"opinion\\" means nothing to you.It seems to me that the majority of \\"positive\\" reviews for this book since Rice's puerile response to her book's detractors have an appologetic nature that smack of fanboy/girlism. Quite frankly, with the rift in objectivity between the two opposing sides, the \\"positive\\" reviews do more to harm my perception of the quality of the book than the \\"negative\\" ones do. At least the negative reviews aren't kneejerk reactions that belittle the intelligence of your dissenting reviewers. How mature of them, eh?In case you didn't notice, the instructions for posting reviews reads, \\"Tell us what you think. Write a review of this item and share your opinions with others.\\" Is it really so difficult to believe that not everyone who reads this book will like it as much as you do? Must you be so childish about all this as to have an online temper tantrum and say \\"Fine! Give me back the book for all I care!\\"?\\"Stupid arrogant assumptions\\" you say? Pot, meet Kettle.3 stars. right in the middle."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Back in 2001 I decided to choose a writer and read everything that they had published. That author was Anne Rice. So far I have read them all under every name that she has used and it hasn't been easy sometimes. This book is not the worst, but it's a disappointment. It seems Anne was ready to let go of all of our favorites before we were. Now I'm a diehard fan, I've read Memnoch twice!! I was determined to get it. The only thing I can't abide is the way this book seemed to just dump all of the characters into a soup and shoved down our throats. We do deserve better than this for all of our years as fans. The characters deserve to be treated better.I own copies of all her books and the ones written about her and her work. I've reread every single book at least twice. The Witches set,The Mummy,Feast of all Saints, Lestat and Blood & Gold over and over. Violin, Cry to Heaven and the Beauty series not at all my cup of tea but I got through them. And even the new religious books I've continued on with my goal. My only hope is that even with Anne Rice returning to a religious life she will allow her past work to be filmed to the high standards that Interview was done.Go back and enjoy all of Anne Rice's books for they are really too rich to fully get with just one read."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I am firmly convinced that some people would read anything that Anne Rice writes and praise it. The fact is, even the best authors have bad books. But the reason people are so down on this book is because this is the final insult in what has turned into a toboggan ride into hell for her work They have become increasingly formulaic and terribly written. Blood Canticle is just the absolute bottom of the barrel, and people aren't interested anymore in her writing. There is nothing redeemable about this dreck. You can defend it and you can look for all of the metaphors and subtext that you want, but it is simply a shockingly bad novel.If this had been turned in by any other author, it would be at the bottom of a trash can. But Anne Rice is a brand, and they would publish anything she sends them. Why she has become so adamant in the assassination of her own career is beyond me. Perhaps she has become aware of something that has been evident to her fans since &quot;Servant of the Bones&quot;: it's over. But instead of bowing out before she completely humiliates herself... she published &quot;Blood Canticle&quot;. Well, I am glad this is it for the Vampires and the Witches, they have suffered enough. I am afraid to see what she decided to butcher in her next &quot;novel&quot;."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"This book is a sad, pathetic end to an otherwise exceptional series. The characters are flat and the story boring. Like Blackwood Farm, Rice pulls from both the Vampire and Mayfair Chronicles, but it just doesn't work. Great characters like Lestat, Rowan Mayfair, Michael Curry, and the pugnacious Mona are weak, crazed, and/or boring. By the time I finished this &quot;novel,&quot; I felt nothing for the characters. They neither grew nor moved forward. Lestat's obsession with Rowan Mayfair seems forced, the Taltos story is a major letdown, and the ending just sucked. If this is truly the end of the Vampire Chronicles and the Lives of Mayfair Witches, we (and the characters) got screwed.I have been a fan of Ms. Rice since first discovering Interview with a Vampire and have devoured her novels since. Some have not always been satisfying (Memnoch being a good example), but I've always come back for more. Now, I'm not so sure. If she chooses to write something different, it will have to be damn good for me to lay down $25 for it."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I bought this book. I read this book. Then I put it back on the shelf where it has sat ever since.I'm a more recent convert to Anne Rice's vampire books, having only read them since Pandora came out in '98 (By the way, thanks for that one Santa!)but I have since bought all the vampire and mayfair witches books. I enjoy the witches and the vampire books in two very different ways, and if I had not realised this before, it was made clear to me by this book. Unfortunately, even those parts I enjoyed were ruined by those I didn't.The introduction was both patronising insulting. Lestat's scene with the Pope, frankly silly, as has his very character become.I think the main problem I had with this book was the romance between my formerly favourite gorgeous fiend and Rowan, which seemed tacked on to the story as an after thought rather than a truely pivotal plot point. The series has been going for a while, and one can't blame the authoress for losing interest in the characters after so long, but one can't help but wish Lestat's final outing had been less... well, bland. I found the typographical errors frustrating, along with the plot holes and continuity errors (which others have gone into in great depth, so I won't bother with them).It's an okay resolution to the Witches series, but leaves the vampire series gasping and flipping around like a dying fish on the carpet.It's hard to say more without giving away the plot, so I wont, however, I will recommend other books by Anne Rice should this one not suit your taste.DO read: Interview with the Vampire, Pandora, Vittorio the Vampire and Tale of the Body Snatcher.Pandora, which I read first, remains my own personal favourite.Now to address all the idiotic controversy:1) Play the ball, not the man.When you write a review, keep your opinions of authors names to yourself. No-one cares. Nor do they care about your opinions of their private lives or habits.2) Saying an author writes only for his or herself is not only a hideous cliche, but is undervaluing the work that goes into writing a successful book. If people are parting with their hard earned wodges of folding stuff to purchase copies, and you are supplying copies, you are no longer writing only for yourself. If you are writing for yourself, it would be scribbled in private diaries.3) On a public fourm, anyone can express their views, positive or negative. Variety of opinion is a sign of a healthy readership.Deal with it.4) Don't feed the trolls.When an author posts a rant, even if you feel it is justified, remember: Trolls who are posting merely for the attention take any response to them as a win and are thrilled. People giving honest reviews and critiques will find the vilification and insults defensive and immature. People who are devoted and loyal readers probably wont read any reviews.And those who make up the majority of the worlds readers, who have no particular affinity for any one author will take away a negative view of all those concerned. If you must reply to reviews (even the very off-topic ones) for goodness sake provide an calm and reasoned explanation do not denigrate, patronise or attack those with differing opinions.This goes for reviewers as well."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"In this, her final book in the Vampire Lestat Series and The Witching Hour Series, Anne Rice has done the incredible. She has taken her two separate series, The Witching Hour Series, where Rowan Mayfair is the main character, and the Vampire Lestat Series, and brought them together in a way that I could never have foreseen, and in a manner that left one feeling both satisfied with the end results regarding the personal searches that Lestat and Rowan had both been laboring under throughout each series, and brought them together. Kindred spirits in many ways, they accidentally find each other, and while there are complications...he is the undead, and she is married to a good and decent man who doesn't look much beyond the surface of his life any longer, yet loves Rowan unconditionally, (One gets the distinct impression that he would not be able to feel so strongly about the latter without embracing the former to the farthest extent that he is able to.) one is left with hope that these two extraordinary individuals have at last found the answers to all of their problems and loneliness, their search for the meaning of their existence even, in each other, and eventually they will overcome all to be together for eternity, one way or another...and for them, at least at the time, the promise of that is enough. Was it enough for readers? Two different questions, with a third that complicates matters and I believe affected ratings of this finale unfairly.After reading the book, I realized that on the earth Rowan and Lestat inhabit, they are quite probably the perfect match. Made in heaven? Made in hell? Somewhere in between? Only the reader can decide.The side plots to the story, in particular the appearances of Oncle Julien are charming, funny and equally unnerving. He is of course the same Julien of old...perhaps wiser, and perhaps he paid a price for that wisdom. He seems more cynical and determined in a situation that is beyond his control than he ever was when alive. Must be frustrating for someone who weilded such charisma, raw sexuality and sensuality, not to mention powers beyond those of a mere mortal, that he is perhaps the one male who can truly understand the great Lestat, yet he is dead. Hence is inability to truly affect things as he would will them to be, and his resulting \\"temper tantrums\\" that result. If Lestat is the Brat Prince of Vampires, then perhaps Julien was the Brat Prince of male witches?Let us not overlook Mona Mayfair...rescued from the jaws of death by the jaws of the Brat Prince leading her into the realm of the undead, but bringing her uncanny human powers along with her; the Vampire Witch. And let us not forget her brave companion, lover, teacher, and perhaps conscience? Quinn Blackwood. A love story that transcends death into \\"undeath\\". A fictional concept to be sure, but one that no mortal, deep down where we don't necessarily talk about it at parties, might wish, even just for a moment, to have as an alternative choice to the one reality we cannot control...true mortal death.I could go on with all of the interesting ways that Anne Rice entwines the two separate series and weaves the lives of the characters together into a fitting ending for both, yet leaving devoted fans of one or both series shamelessly pining for more details, for what happens next, etc. Pointless exercise, though I loved every word, and I loathed every word...for each brought me closer to the end of two series I dearly loved and now mourn.But herein also lies the crux of the problem of so many poor reviews by, up until now, true fans. Now many are simply truly angry that the story has reached \\"The End\\". Others are confused and don't \\"get\\" it at all. No wonder. Many were led to believe that this was simply a sequel to Blackwood Farm, where the Mayfairs, particularly Rowan, make there first contact with Lestat and vampires, in a purely accidental...or so it seems...fashion.For fans of each separate series each was bound to be disappointed, because they could never understand the history of the other series' characters, and how they do fit together so well. The living provide a bridge into their world for the undead, and vice-versa. But without having read each book in BOTH series, yes, I can see where one would come away a bit confused, feeling cheated even perhaps, and of course disappointed in \\"their\\" series' author.Myself, I read both, all the way through starting way back when with the first editions of The Witching Hour and An Interview With The Vampire. Some of which I've read repeatedly, from both series. I have no doubt I'll be revisiting them again from time to time...like old friends that one hasn't seen in so long, yet it is so easy to pick up the conversation where it was left off.After reading all the reviews here, I can see that a common theme developed...one-sided series readers, and both series' readers simply peeved that their favorite author could end not one but BOTH series at the same time. It's understandable that we'd feel a bit cheated, or let down. I could even tell which series they'd read, or if they'd read both, by the tone of their reviews. To these good folks, I do understand how you could arrive at your conclusions.To new readers and one series readers alike, I would offer this advice: Read the entire series you didn't, re-read the books in the series you did read that you feel you could gain a better grasp of the second time around, and only then re-read Merrick, Blackwood Farm, and finally this, the finale of both series, Blood Canticle. I think your perspective and your feelings about this final book will change, and you won't feel cheated...well not nearly as much as you do now. You can't help but feel a little let down, even having read both series to the ending of both here in this final book, because there are issues left unresolved that those of us who like neat and tidy endings will be a bit frustrated with. To those frustrated folks, the \\"happily ever after\\" crowd, to which I confess I can fall into if not careful, and have done so in the past, why not write the endings of the relationships and situations left kind of \\"hanging\\", but with promise, just for yourself? It might be fun! Or you can leave things the way the author meant them to be, and wonder. Whatever works for you, that's what's important.Personally, I loved and hated Blood Canticle...what reader who over the years has fallen for characters in each series wouldn't feel that way? On the one hand, there is the delight of enveloping yourself in familiar fictional territory, and on the other, there is the ultimate letdown of finding out you'll never be reading about the territory or its inhabitants again.But, never say never...eternity is indeed a very long time. :-)"},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I have been an Anne Rice fan for about 7 years now (hey, I'm only 20) and I have read every book she has written that I can. I enjoyed this book, it's not my favorite, but not because of the style, the content, or the \\"ending\\" which has seemingly put off so many others. Simply put, I read Interview with the Vampire when I was 13, and I can never forget how it felt to truly fall in love with a book. As with any book, you should read it yourself because if you only go by the reviews, you will miss out on so many chances to find something new! I admit, I was a little confused by the first part, but then I remembered how it was to read Memnoch the Devil and I felt much more at home, so to speak. Everything you've come to love about Anne Rice's novels are here, you just have to actually READ, as opposed to the half-hearted attempt many people make just to fit in or say they've read the \\"latest\\" new hit. Unfortunately, many people have come to think that this is all reading can accomplish. I loved the book and would suggest it to anyone.On another note, interesting how many people posted anonymous negative reviews. What, are the lot of you too cowardly to own up to your own opinion? What's the point of voicing YOUR opinion if you won't admit to it being yours in the first place?"},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"For those of you that are reading reviews for this novel, I hope that you see beyond the sophomoric babble that dominates the first couple of pages of reviews. If you are a devout fan of Anne Rice and truly read her novels, you will enjoy this book. Anne Rice has been true and brilliant in her writings from the first page of Interview with a Vampire through the last page of Blood Canticle. The characters in this book are beautifully and eloquently developed, and the story is as compelling and undeniably virtuoso as all of her novels. I love the intimate feeling that Anne Rice has created with Lestat and I am distraught over the news that she will not be continuing the story.In response to comments made by earlier reviewers, an artist such as Anne Rice deserves more respect. She is an accomplished and gifted writer, and the fact that you are wasting your time writing your irreverent trash shows just how juvenile you are. If Anne Rice doesn't want her work to be mutilated by editors, she has earned that right. Did Mozart have an editor? What about Leonardo da Vinci? A work of art needs no editing. Finally, if you don't like her style and have trouble grasping her work, Read Something Else. Don't ruin her reputation (and our reading enjoyment) by printing such garbage."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Geez man after reading a lot of you guy's reviews of this book I thought about not reading this book. Now I glad that I did read this work by Anne Rice. Some complain about the sexuality in Blackwood Farm and this book.... Try growing up if you haven't noticed yet the Vampires in her books seem to all find some kind of sexual attraction to all creatures in her books. Who cares grow up and move past that fact. She has developed these creatures into a very observant and sexual people. So guess what from time to time they are going to have sex be it with the same sex of family... yeh it sounds bad but oh well. As for the description of the Taltos, no forget it this is what I got from the book.It starts off with Lestat ranting about how readers felt about some of his past writings. He try's to explain how he feels and is portrayed by using slang and broken English. You should skip the whole first chapter right off it really does no justice to the book. Move onto the story at hand.At this point people complained about Lestat's use of slang how he try's to talk like a gangster. This book takes place in current time. What douche bag goes around talking like he's from the 18th century, is it not his point to blend in with humans and not stick out more than he already does. So this book takes up where the last one left off which is all fine and dandy but it leaves you wanting more. The whole book is basically Mona learning their ways as Vampires and finding out secrets that her family has kept from her. Yeah yeah they go out in search of her missing child, which is a Taltos. After they find out what happen to her child and some of the secrets that they have kept them selves the story slows down to a close with a meeting between Lestat and Rowan. His two proclaimed subjects leave him and he is once again alone.Now if in fact there was another book to follow this one to give us closure on his fate as well as Quinn and Mona that would be great. Since this book is the last of her Vampire Chronicles we are only left with a bittersweet end. The descriptions she used in this book of people, places, and feelings leave you with a very vivid picture of the world through his eyes. It's a great read to kill time like I do at work lol. If you do nothing in life but read and write you may find something lacking in this book. For one such as my self who maybe reads once a month and reads only Anne Rice books, this book with hold you to the very end only to have you feeling like there is more to come. No No kids this was the end of a long legacy she has left us. God bless her and maybe she can find it in her heart to write us just one more for the age's one more to satisfy our bleeding desire for closure. Yet I am sure we will only want more lol.P.S. to you losers who hang out in front of her house get a life lol damn I cant believe people actually do these things. She a great writer but damn do something to help society with all that free time you have you bums."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I loved this book, as I have loved all of the Vampire Chronicles. It pains me to see the harsh, judgmental comments that people feel they need to share. I believe someone else said this quite well, Mrs. RIce didn't write her books for us, so they'd read the way WE wanted them to. She wrote them for herself, so that she'd be happy with them, so SHE could choose how the story developes. Those of you that act personally insulted because the book didn't end up like you wanted it to need to rethink the purpose of the READER in this relationship. The author writes, and you, the reader, read the book. If you don't like the book, then don't read it again. But don't you dare tear apart the book because you want to rewrite it. If you want a new ending, write it yourself. Mrs. Rice doesn't allow fanfiction of her work because she wants her work to be her own, in all aspects. Many authors have done the same, because they don't want angry readers like yourselves to write a book based on their work and totally ruin the idea for the rest of us.I, personally, have only read The Vampire Chronicles; none of Mrs. Rice's other works. I probably won't ever read the rest of her books, but its because the topic doesn't interest me. The vampire chronicles interested me, and still do, and I will never stop reading them. I have absolutely no complaints about any part of the series.Thank you Mrs. Rice, for writing these, and ignore the comments of the fools and buffoons who would try to shape your work in their image."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I absolutly hate hanging endings. I purposely don't watch TV because the season endings kill me. I am not very patient when I have to wait several months to see how something ends. I was so upset to finish Blackwood Farm and have it just drop off the way it did. However, when Blood Canticle was released, I bought it in hardback just to be able to finish the story! (I never buy hardback simply because I go through books very quickly and buying hardbacks add up.) Needless to say, I was not the least bit disappointed. I believe that it wrapped up the story at hand that began with Blackwood Farm and Merrick. Is it a good ending to a series? I don't think so, but I also don't think it was meant to be, whether it is the last book in the Chronicles or not.My mother always told me I was strange because I would always read \\"horror\\" books. I started out with reading Christopher Pike's young adult books. I have been reading Anne's works since I was in junior high. I was introduced, as many others were, to Anne by Interview when curiousity got the better of me after seeing the movie in the theater. After that, I was hooked. Her method of blending history, philosophy, theology, and fantastical fiction is absolutly beautiful. It makes me jealous that I don't have such talents (though I like to pretend that I do). I say bravo to Anne for producing such a wonderful work of art. I think that your eloquence of style is absolutely breathtaking.Lastly, to those of you who love Anne's style of writing, you should read her son, Christopher Rice. He inherited his mothers grace of pen."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I'm an extremely faithful reader of Anne Rice for years, and sometimes it is hard to be objective on someone's work when you love her as much as I do, but I'll try to be objective.And I apologize for any mistakes of english, I'm french, so it's a litte difficult for me to write in english.This said, I felt like a duty to post a review on this site, after writing an e-mail to her, a few months ago, to tell her my entire support. Not only because I'm one of her faithful reader, but because I felt some comments were an complete lack of respect to her, as a person, and mostly as an author.As a beggining author myself (I insist on the word \\"beginning\\", as I'm currantly writing my first novel), I imagined how painful it has been for her to read such venimous comments about her novel. I couldn't imagine that the responses had been so cruel for her and her work until I read all the comments posted here. And most of the time, truly, for the worst reviews, there are no really arguments, there are not really ideas to defend this point of view. So, it often lacks credibility.Writing a novel represents an HUGE ammount of work, researches and studies. I can't help but being in admiration when I realise how much she works for every single novel she writes. Before beginning to write, I had not the slightest idea of how hard it truly is to write a novel. Writing on your own changes everything in your life, and it changes the way you perceive the work of an other author. It changes everything. You have far more respect for an author, now that you understand how difficult it is. You realise how much an author is involved in his work, how much his writing represents in his life.There had been diffamous comments here. Doubting that she had written this book ... I hope the persons who wrote that realise how painful it can be to an author to read such a thing. When you begin to write, you realise the power of words, how it affects people, how it can make them laugh, or cry, or think.So, even if you didn't like this novel, respect is an essential thing. And I sincerely think that a lot of comments were purely disrespectful, for both her and her work, which deserves at least respect.As to the book in itself, I was, as always, delighted with every page. I cherish every line, every single word she has ever written. She is the author who gave me the desire to write my own stories, and this is while reading her novels that I realised that the rest of my life would be dedicated to writing.Reading her has changed my life. I used to see the world in black and white before reading her, now I see it in colors.I've got the most sincere admiration for her and her work, and if someday I got such a beautiful career as hers, I'd be the happiest person in the world.She has offered me, through her writing, to see the world, humans, religion, with such an fresh way ... I've grown up reading her, and her novels have been the most passionate pages I've ever read of my life.If I could, I'd put a dozens stars for this book, five is not enough."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I'm not sure why there's such controversy (and only on Amazon it seems) about this book.I loved that there was finally a real union between the vampire and Mayfair chronicles and this book essentially married the two, putting both to rest.The book was even better when you saw Anne's heart through the words. She is Rowan, Stan is Lestat. It was the end of a series but also the final chapter of her own love story on earth.I loved it."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I think this book was great, it deserves more than what all those bad reviews gave it. They miss the true story. They want an ending some sort of a tragic ending. But how can you end a saga that doesnt have an ending. It was the perfect end to something that has or knows no ending."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"First os all, this book was not a complete flop at all. some readers may very well have expected the exact same stlye and story type, but what no one is paying attention to is the fact that Anne rice stays very true to her perseption of each character. Rowan has become a weak desperate child, mona is still the stubborn brat, just learning to take herself differently. ECT. each character in this book has followed through in the course that they were set upon. stoy lines change, so do characters. stop comaring it to all her other works and take this one for what it is, a new chapater."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I just finished reading \\"Blood Canticle.\\" I thoroughly enjoyed it. It brought together so many of my favorite Anne Rice characters and mythos (Is that singular or plural?)\\"Blood Canticle\\" is definitely written for die-hard Anne Rice fans. It would be difficult to fully understand or appreciate if the reader has not been exposed to the referenced tales before (Blackwood Farm, Queen of the Damned, the Mayfair trilogy, Merrick, etc.) IF you loved those books, though, you will love \\"Blood Canticle.\\"And last...for those of you who were \\"offended\\" because Lestat implied that people who did not understand \\"Memnoch\\" were unable or unwilling to...I quite agree with Lestat. I had the pleasure of meeting Ms. Rice at a book-signing for \\"Memnoch\\" that I thought it was one of her best books ever. I stand by that statement today. The theology is high-brow but...hey...there's more to Anne's vampires than just chomping necks.:)"},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I'm proud to live in America. We have so much freedom. Freedom of speech, for example. It's sad that some people abuse this right and instead of polite criticism, they feel the need to be vicious and hateful. Such were the words going through my head as I read the reviews here. Anne Rice has an unnaturally devoted following, and the people who say things like \\"This book sucks\\" or \\"The first page is lame\\" need to read into it a bit more. There are some people called haters who don't even give things a chance. I got this book last winter and had I reviewed it back then, I would've given it 2 stars at the most. That's the thing. People can't wait to criticize and judge. I gave this book a second chance and again, my opinion didn't change. I started reading it AGAIN today, and something changed. It was good. They say third time's a charm, and it truly is. Instead of being bored, I'm absolutely enthralled with the book. For me, Anne Rice has always required patience. The first time I read Interview With The Vampire, Vampire Lestat and Queen Of The Damned, I gave up too soon. Something eventually compelled me to buy them one day, and I had a new favorite author all of a sudden. I own all the books now, and the ones I too quickly dismissed, like \\"Memnoch the Devil\\" and \\"Merrick\\" are all about to get their chance, like Lestat, at redemption.If people took the time to read the book, and ignored the negative hype, they would see that this one is a great addition to the series. I wouldn't say it's the best (Queen Of The Damned holds that honor) but I don't think it's the worst book ever written. I'd say it's better than most books out there. Anne has ended the Chronicles, and she is secretly working on a new project. Something tells me it might be a children's book (she said the new direction might lose a lot of fans) but no matter what it is, she hasn't lost me with this book. My support will continue for an extended period of time.Thanks Anne."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I just have to post something here.I've read everything Anne Rice has ever published.I've enjoyed every single page I've turned.I love all her characters, Lestat, Rowan, Quinn, Mona, Stella,Julian, Michael, Louis, Claudia: you get the idea.I will continue to buy anything and everything she honors us with.Her books have kept me company, entertained me, comforted me and been my friends when no one else was.I hope she writes many, many more books.

My main concern is the venom and hatred I see spewing out of the reviews for this book. Why so cruel and angry? This is unlike any post I have seen on this site and I browse here often.I can understand stating emphatically that one dislikes a book and why...that is the purpose of a review, to inform others of your thoughts on the book. But this has come down to people attacking the author personally. I don't understand where this anger is coming from. It's sad really. Anne has given us years of entertainment and introspection. Now you are like small boys throwing tomatoes at her because you don't like her shoes.Would you say these cruel things to her face? I bet at least 50% of you wouldn't, probably more. The internet has many wonderful aspects and there is so much to learn. On the other hand, it allows people to hide behind a monitor and say what they like in anonymity. This spells cowardice in my book. If one has full confidence in his/her opinion, why is there a need for hiding?Anne Rice will always be great in my eyes. I have liked some of her novels better than others of course, but I have always enjoyed them.Anne, don't listen to this nonsense. Anyone who has to resort to insults to make their point isn't worthy of your time."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Why do you people insist on ragging on this book? I agree that it wasn't her most amazing accomplishment, but it wasn't a flop. Not every novel can be The Vampire Lestat or Queen of the Damned.I have been an avid Anne Rice fan for about five years when my aunt first turned me on to her books. And I haven't been able to stop reading them since. I have found such strength and passion in all of her works. There have been times where I have been angry or disappointed at the fate of a character, but that has never made me slander her books in the way that these reviews have.One of her best qualities is that she allows the characters to speak for themselves. Lestat is not supposed to be the same in every novel. His greatest quality is the fact that he is so flippant and whimsical. He makes resolutions to change and yet he is always the same. That is his fate.Mona was meant to be Claudia, the counterpart to Lestat's brat prince. But she could never overpower him because of who Lestat is.I think that readers should focus more on what a book says and visual what is happening and not just wait for the author to spoon feed you the details. Grow up readers and then return to apologize to Anne Rice."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"This is one of the best books in the Vampire Chronicles. It was refreshing to read this particular volume because of the style and poetics Anne Rice wrote with. The words flow much smother then they did in Blackwood Farm (the book Preceding this one) and the general vibe was that of confidence with a clear direction. The voice of Lestat was very present and his growth within the series was clearly evident. Out of all the vampire Chronicles, i read this volume in the shortest amount of time. Again, i want to emphasize the clear and poetic style of prose Anne Accomplished with this book. All in all this volume is a very visual and is a heart felt piece of art in which you can feel Anne Rice had truly tapped into the world in which she created.As for this book being the end of the chronicles... I can only say it does not feel like a true conclusion. Lestat comes to terms with his basic questions regarding morality, compassion and sin, thus leading Lestat into a new Psychological space which really opens up the narrative for further adventures."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Interview With the Vampire and perhaps even The Vampire Lestat are masterpieces and will be read by many for a long time to come. but you have to understand, in reading anne rice, is that you're reading a highly refined stream of consciousness. go to her website and read her explanation for how she writes. i believe this has always been so with her. consequently, events such as the death of her daughter and her rise to literary stardom precipitated two astonishing and emotional novels. it was exactly that, in a simultaneous fashion. anne has gotten tough over the decades, if she wasn't tough already; and facing the death of her husband over a prolonged period of time I'm sure was no less astonishing. nevertheless, anne's novels have always been about that refinement, not only for her own mind, but for the world she seeks to understand and contribute to. that's why Blood Canticle is so much more significant to her works as a whole than I think anyone realizes. the rambling style and diction are absurd in comparison to Interview. but they reflect an inner ideal i believe she has come to in her life, that evil is absurd. not that it should be conquered or can be by dreams of redemption and sainthood. but simply that it is more absurd than good or ideals of good. without getting any deeper or violating an author who's still very much alive, i have to say this is a woman who has learned to accept pain and suffering from an early age. this is a woman who is selfless at heart. anne rice is still a new artist for this age. when you read rice you are reading a synthesis of joyce, byron, and the visual styles of dali and kahlo. Blood Canticle is a fitting end to the Vampire Chronicles and while less rambling, i would be shocked to find her new work anything but dry and vaguely existential. this is not pulp fiction folks... this is not a \\"read\\" in spite of how its main character might describe it. this is an end piece to a long-spanning collection of works. if you can respect rice, respect her for what she is, not what she says she is or idly wishes to be. after all, she is an artist..."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"There's no reason for all the bad vibe around here, Anne Rice is a great author.I have readother great authors, among which is Mercedes Lackey,Piers Anthony, Dean Koontz....and Anne Rice.I adore the fact that SHE KNOWS HOW TO WRITE.

My favorite is probably Pandora, because it was the first one I read and I fell in love with the characters and loved the way it was written. Once you have read an Anne Rice book - it is hard to read other modern day fiction. I was about to order this book when I started to read all of the reviews - I ended up ordering something else - everyone seemed so disappointed. Well, I finally borrowed the book from the library and absolutely enjoyed it. I wouldn't say its my favorite - but if you enjoy Anne Rice novels, you will enjoy this one. Just my opinion."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"This is my first Anne Rice novel of her Vampire Series. I had to get it from the library because money is so bloody hard to come by. Let's face it, we aren't Lestat who inherited so much money and apparently it never runs out. This dude is like 200 years old, you have to wonder how much he has?I absolutly adore this book! I love Lestat and his secret desire to be a saint. How he calls himself a 'gutter punk' and uses words like 'yo' and 'dude'. It is just simply amazing!ugh, I could have done without Mona.In fact, she reminded me of Moaning Myrtle from Harry Potter. *lol* the whole ghost thing was amusing and Lestat was all cool with his 'your going to fall in love with me' line. I think I have fallen in love. But, back to Mona.... She should have just died, just died. Sorry but I didn't like that character at all. Nope. nope. nope. I mainly just read the book to see what joke or vain comparision Lestat was going to call himself next. I didn't see his \\"I'm the James Bond of all Vampires\\" line, but that one is amusing.needless to say, I plan on getting these books, good or bad. I'll probably get the books with the worst reviews at a price of pennies. *lol*"},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"This book is terribly written and I am ashamed that Anne Rice would even think of submitting it to be published. The Vampire Chronicles have been fascinating and interesting, and so have the Mayfair Witches. There has been so much effort spent to fully chronicle the Mayfairs and the individual adventures of the vampires that to smash it all together in this novel is not only unfair, but just plain awful. Rice has lost Lestat--his voice lacks the quality and sentiment of previous novels, and really he is pretty boring and dull. His ravings about sainthood are rather uninteresting. He was not a good character to narrate this story. Rice could have spent a whole novel dealing with Mona's, Quinn's, and Lestat's adventures together, much less shortchange the Taltos story as well as the Mayfairs'. The writing is shocking in its shoddiness. I have been an extremely devoted Rice fan for many many years now, and this book is not only the worst of her novels that I have ever read, but is just a bad one in general. I am hoping that in the future she will consider allowing her editors to make suggestions and spend more time on her subject matter! By writing Blood Canticle, she has done not only herself but her readers a terrible disservice. I would not recommend this book to anyone; true Rice fans must beware! This is not the Anne Rice that we know and love."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Spending years loving Rice's work, I was eager to read what is to be the conclusion of the vampire chronicles. The matter-of-fact off-the-cuff manner of writing disturbed me - unlike the manner of speech we are accustomed to from Lestat. The tiresome Shakesperean quotes from Mona &amp; Quinn. Tired of Mona's portrayal of herself as Ophelia already! Enough! So much about Saints and description of the clothes Mona takes from Aunt Queen's closet! Trivial dribble. So little substance. Far too much time wasted on the lackluster story of the Taltos. The rather odd and inexplicable appearance of Oncle Julien &amp; Stella. This feels like a half-hearted effort to appease fans looking for another Lestat story and close off the vampire series. It is evident her mind was not wholly focused on this with the understandable personal matters she faced at the time she penned this work. It is a sad farewell to the Vampires so many have grown to love. All the best to Ms. Rice in her new endeavours."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Alright, so we've had devoted Anne Rice fans defend the book merely because Queen Anne of the Damned wrote it, and former fans trash the book because it's not what they thought it should be. I'm not a fan of hers; I read some of Interview a few years back, and put it down because I thought it was extremely poor. Myself, I think she's an awful writer. However, maybe my objective position will be one of reason.Look, Rice has the right to defend her work. It's her own book, and what she wrote was what satisfied her and what she thought was the proper ending to her Chronicles. However, she should not treat her fans, even the ones who have left her, so poorly, and actions like her diatribe here and the fact that she actually complained about those who did not like \\"Memnoch the Devil\\" within this work are inexcusable. It smacks of egotism, haughtiness, and poorly disguised desperation.Fans of Rice, I can understand when a beloved series takes a unexpected and seemingly ill-advised turn. I'm a Star Wars fan; enough said. You have the right to feel disappointed by it, and to voice your opinion, but there's no reason to be so venomous.Because when you really get down to it, Anne Rice is really just a bestseller writer who found a particularly passionate niche audience, and then realized it was profitable to exploit it. Call it stereotyping all you want, but goths, at least the more fanboyish of the subculture, tend to be losers, quite frankly. Kids with no social life gather in whatever dark, tragic subculture they can, because it's like, so deep, and will totally disturb your parents, those conformists. But here's the truth: Lestat is not a real person, he's just a character in a series of books, and not a particularly interesting character either. Jay Gatsby, Stephen Dedalus - those are characters that transcend from the written word to life. Going so far as to profess love for a Eurotrash vampire is rather lame. There is nothing particularly glorious or deep about death and tragedy, unless there happens to be a particularly unique insight behind it. You will grow up and fall in love and see sunlight, and by that point, you'll forget all about Anne.Here's the most important thing about the debate, and what makes it seem so ridiculous to me: There are so many authors out there that are worth reading, analyzing, and discussing passionately. James Joyce, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Cormac McCarthy, Ernest Hemingway, Fyodor Dostoevsky, William Faulkner, John Steinbeck, Gabriel Garcia Marquez, and many, many others. And that's just in prose fiction! Please, give some real authors with real insight a chance. No, you don't have to read a classic to get merit out of reading, but at least realize that great authors truly do exist. You're just being played by Anne's hype machine and cult if you treat her as the alpha and omega of literature."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"First off, Lestat wants to be a wholesome saint....that will tell you something about this book. Anne Rice turned Lestat from our loving Brat Prince into....i don't even know what! Not to mention that there is way to much stuff about Taltos and Lasher. The entire book is centered around the now, meek Quinn and the bratty little fledgling Mona. No other characters are even in the book from the Chronicles besides Lestat and Quinn. And for the last of the books, shouldn't they be included. Louis is reffered to once, and not even by Lestat, and Maharet sends Lestat a letter. Come on!! The book is littered with Christian refrences that just ruin it. The book is slow and again, way too much about Taltos and Mona. I WANTED LOUIS, ARMAND, AND MARIUS AT THE LEAST. It was very dissapointing, and the only reason i read the whole thing through was in hopes that another Vampire would be included. Sigh. I could have written a better finale! Sigh. Oh Brat Prince, what a way to go!"},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Taltos, shmaltos, who cares about these evolutionary deadend salamanders. God has Lestat turned into a bore of a vampire. Do us a favor Lestat fly into the sun. Anne Rice has taken a great franchise and turned it into a loser. And these Mayfairs, what a bunch of dreary people they have turned out to be. Especially that Mona, pining away over her mutant daughter Morrigan, hoping that Mother and Father can be brought back out of the deep freeze. Oh for the good old days of the Vampire Chronicles!"},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I love Anne Rice. Everytime she had a book coming out, I would be the first to check it out online. My sister loved her, too, but I think I loved her more. The Vampire Chronicles were and still are some of the best books I have ever read.That is, until Blood Canticle came out. I can't express the sadness that swept over me when I discovered that this would be the last of my beloved Vampire Chronicles. Then I actually read it.What happened? Part of the allure of the Vampire Chronicles was that it breathed poetry and life into a subject that had been previously ignored by all other authors. Anne Rice wove a tapestry, a true world filled with the the undead that varried so greatly that you couldn't help but loved each and every single one of them. You could go on for pages without someone saying a word, just a calm peaceful time that could be used to describe the way the moonlight looked on the Mississippi River. Now you can't.It seemes every page is perferated with some trite meaningless diaglouge with some lame character. Lestat says, \\"Dude\\"? and, \\"Yo\\"? I'm sure I know some fifth graders that wouldn't even consider using such immature language in thier writting. Why does Anne Rice, one of the most sophisticated authors in the world, use such stupid words?And where are the other vampires? Louis, Armand, Daniel, David, Pandora, Marius, Santino, and every other vampire that ever showed his or her face in the novel? I love the Coven. Where are they? How could Lestat abandon those he had once loved so much?Lestat needs to be fixed. First he rants at us in a ridicules way, then he falls head over heels in love with a mortal he would have killed had he been in the right state of mind, and he abondoned the greatest vampire that ever came into being. Lestat! What's wrong with you? Where's the vampire that authored the best of the Vampire Chronicles? I understand that you went through HEaven and Hell, but surly that could hardly tarnish the vampire we all loved!In conclusion, all I have to say is WHY?!? If Anne is reading this by some divine miricale, please write another book! Make us believe in Vampires like you made us do with all the other novels. Bring back all the other vampires, including Lestat (ther real one that is), and delve back into that world of the living dead that we all adored so much."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Lestat advises us to skip chapter one if we are unhappy in our reading. Should have listened, skipped that chapter and all others.This ends my love affair with the Vampire Chronicles, which honestly provided me with great pleasure over the years. Seems to me the Publisher should have had some sense of decency. There is no mistaking this book for anything other that a childish,amateurish attemmpt to capitalize on a &quot;name&quot; author.Someone inform the publisher that it's perfectly ok, and even preferable to turn down an inferior effort..moreover, a service to the public. Kind of tarnishes the pleasant memories I have of Ms. Rice's prior efforts. Anyone reading this review, take Lestat's advice..skip chapter one..then skip the rest."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Although this novel is certainly not among Rice's best, it's not a slugging pittance in a boot and shoe yard either. Her characters shoot off in the same direction, albeit with a few hitches in their steps. The plot, while not rivotting, certainly has its moments and I'd say that if you like Rice's other novels, you won't find this one a total loss.However, that said, I think it's rather interesting that Anne Rice felt the need to vent on her readers with a strange diatribe right here on Amazon. (You'll find it if you go looking.) I've been to Mardi Gras twice in New Orleans, as well as Halloween, which is a wonderful even there. Rice lives in an amazingly charming mansion and lives the high life. Every cent of the money that paid for such wanton opulence came from her fan base, who elevated her writing and characters to cult status through faithful support. I'm one of them, so I ought to know.Mrs. Rice, you are a sad testament to the handful of spoiled best-selling writers these days. Get off your high chair and write something with true literary merit if you want more reverence and respect. Your readers have spoken, so I suggest you listen!!! I'm a creative writing instructor, so, yes, I noticed the multitude of flaws in this somewhat enjoyable read. Your fans were right, if a bit heavy handed in their critiques. But isn't that what you encourage? Heavy-handed writing breeds a heavy-handed readership. If the glove fits, slide it on and sit back down at the keyboard. Or, if you really want to wow the critics, try inventing a NEW series that doesn't involve vampires, succubi, or anything else that goes bump in the night. Take up thy bed of nails and walk!!!"},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I'm a real fan of the chronicles, but this one sucked ass. ALL he did was talk about how he wanted to be a saint, saint Lestat blagh blagh and hes all skytzo. He says things like 'dude,man,gotcha,whatever,gimme,totally',this is set right after Merrick's death. So he now has acquired this whole new line of speech in just days... He talks like some kid they picked up on the street,is this the LESTAT WE HAVE COME TO LOVE? NO!!!!and Where IS EVERYBODY ELSE?! Just quinn, mona and him, no other vamps.There's NO CONCLUSION, and ooh yeah put michale on list of people in the family Mona's screwed.All of Quinns dead realitives have gone on to the 'other side'(except his mom *shudder*) now he cant screw any of his dead realitives ::sigh::, oddly enough, he now dresses Mona(girlfriend) up as his Aunt Queen (dead) and has her wear her clothes and shoes...If you've read the chronicles, dont get this one, if you havent you will be confused like hell.Sadly this is the LAST one too. Watch FOX make it into a movie..."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"i really wanted to read this book as it tied together and ended both the lestat series and the taltos series, which i really desired closure on. unfortunately, i'd rather have lived w/o the closure provided in this terrible \\"novel\\", which had nothing novel about it. i nearly quit after the first two chapters where anne/lestat rant and rant about unloyal fans for not adoring memnoch the devil. talk about huge ego. and my initial excitement about mayfairs and lestat (confession,skipped blackwood farm, now glad i didn't waste time/money)in the same story made me nearly gag. why does everybody-male female human vampire taltos whatever-fall in love with miserable rowan mayfair? so very disappointed. high hopes, crashed and burned. don't waste your time and money. find anything else. like an essay by an uninterested 3rd grader failing english class."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"While I felt this novel was not the worst of Ms. Rice's novels, I certainly don't think it was one of the better ones, either. I have been reading multiple reviews in magazines and here and the spectrum of feedback about the book is pretty widespread. I rank The Vampire Lestat and Interview with the Vampire as two of my all-time favorite novels. Since then I have enjoyed all of her books, from any of the various \\"series\\", but never as much as those first two. However, my very serious discomfort with this novel is a problematic timeline and other discrepancies. It seemed that events and memories Lestat relates from his life, his personal timeline and other personality traits and preferences, were inaccurate, compared to what has been established in the past, and then the timeline for the Taltos community was confusing as well. I felt that there was sloppiness, and inaccuracies, especially in reference to Lestat's past - and this was my big issue with the novel. However, I still enjoy her writing and did feel that her characters, instead of stagnating, evolve in interesting ways (yes, outside of the discrepancies). It's the lack of editing that seems to be so problematic. Yet I remain a Rice fan."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Ms. Rice has lost her ability to write, keeps churning out junk.Hopefully her \\"turn to Jesus\\" won't make people sick as well.This wasn't worth the price paid, especially if you enjoyed \\"Interview with the Vampire/Vampire Listat.\\" It's a put down of her earlier works, when she was fresh."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"When I first read the reviews for &quot;Blood Canticle&quot; my heart sank--I had been looking forward to a good read, Anne Rice style. I requested the book as a present, so I was still obligated to read it, regardless of the negative reviews. I admit, the first 115 pages or so are rough, as described they are filled with a manic, egocentric rant by the vampire Lestat. Once the rant has time to play itself out a wonderful, curious and intriquing story is revealed--that of the Taltos. Those of us who are Rice fans will already be familiar with the Taltos, yet this story reveals more details concerning the character of these unique beings. I give the book five stars because if you survive the hackneyed beginning at the hands of Lestat, a whole new world is revealed. Rice is not all washed up or rung out from mourning, she still has a trick or two up her sleeve. If you enjoy having your vision of the world and its wide variety of beings revealed in vivid detail, give &quot;Blood Canticle&quot; a chance. With patience you will find that the rambling of Lestat is there to create a counterpoint to the languid world of the Taltos. Moreover, those who shy away from goth, will find that the Taltos offer a sci-fi element that is refreshing. Rice is a gifted writer, mistress of detail who is so brazen that she even combines several different genres (horror, science fiction, the fantastic and romance)successfully, between the covers of a single book. You go girl!"},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Not more than ten minutes ago I finished reading &quot;Belinda&quot;.Yes. Anne Rice's 1986 novel under the name Anne Rampling. An absolutely brilliant, wonderfully compelling and very REAL piece of work_minus the mysticism. Truth to tell, this was the third time reading this book. I loved it the first time_somewhen in the late 1980's and I love it even more now. Of course for different reasons. Fifteen years ago I was a teenager still living at home. Now, I am a 33 year-old man living on my own, trying to hone my Goddess-given creative abilities into something worthy and memorable. Times have changed. I have changed. My outlook on life, love, people, art, beauty_everything has changed,is changing and will continue to do so until the day I die (and quite probably even after). So what is my point? What has &quot;Belinda&quot; got to do with &quot;Blood Canticle&quot;? Simply this...Everything, everyone CHANGES. It's an inevitable fact/law of nature. It is my belief that artists_whether litarary, musical, pictoral or what-have-you_because of our creative, 'feeling' natures, are more responsive to life's little alterations that occur daily. And as we change so to our creations change. Art history has clearly shown us this. Think Rodin, Picasso.Now, no matter the cause, be it external, simple, complex, beautiful or unpleasant, the result is always the same. We are no longer who we were. Jeremy walker could not be the be-loved author/illustartor of little girl's books after meeting Belinda. By the same token we cannot expect Mrs. Rice to be the same author she was two years ago or for that matter, two decades ago. Even more so now given her recent losses(sadly, her husband Stan Rice and happily, her weight_as reported by People magazine). She is not the same person in mind, spirit and body who wrote T.V.L. all those years ago. I for one understand this and accept it. All we can expect is that she remains true to herself, her art and the message she wants to reveal. Which brings me to &quot;Blood Canticle&quot;.I thoroughly enjoyed reading B.C. It did not send me into raptures (as T.V.L. did when i read it the 1st, 2nd, 3rd...you get my point). It did not reveal certain truths and lessons that I can apply to my life as it is now (as &quot;Belinda&quot; did). Perhaps this will come in the 3rd or 4th reading. Yes. I will read it a fourth time. I enjoyed this book simply because it did what ALL A.R. novels have done_taken me out of this mortal existence into another realm, through time and beauty. For those few hours, I will always be grateful and thankful.So what Lestat is no longer the same brat prince we fell in love with in T.V.L. Thank goodness! I am very glad he isn't. I mean, he's been around for what, two centuries How can we NOT expect him to cahnge? Not sad to say, even ghosts, withches, spirits and vampires_yes! Vampires, are subject to that six letter phenomenon...CHANGE. Lestat is everchanging, ever-evolving. It's what makes him interesting and I love him now as I loved him then. As for his saintly asperations...We ALL have dreams and desires that will never, ever be realised in this lifetime. Lestat himself acknowledges this truth. It does not mean however that said aspirations should be left buried to be forgotten. They are part of who we are. They are part and parcel of who he has become since &quot;Memnoch The Devil&quot;. Deal with it.Lestat still goes around doing exactly what he wants in his own inimitable style. Only now he seems closer to understanding his own sense of morality, though some issues still remain inscrutable. Hell, he even managed to surprise himself by TRULY falling in love. In LOVE! You can't get a better catalyst for change than that! Now can you?Anne Rice, in allowing Lestat to grow yet still remain true to himself, all things considered, has remained true to herself as a gifted artist. Come what may (and I am looking forward to what does) I will always be a devoted reader.Before I end, I must say that I do hope to read more Belinda-type books from Mrs. Rice now that the chronicles have been laid to rest...for the while, if the rumours are to be believed. After all these years I still find the lives of mere mortals like jeremy and Belinda quite refreshing and interesting_at least when Anne Rice does them."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"The Vampire Lestat wants to be good. In fact, true to form, he wants the whole enchilada--he wants to be a saint. But the road to sanctity is paved with distractions--new vampires to make,new victims to drain dry, and parallel Anne Rice mythologies to meld together. Yes, in this final Vampire Chronicle, the worlds of the Vampires and the Mayfair Witches are going to merge. How? Those who read BLACKWOOD FARM already have a clue--eager young newbie-vampire Quinn Blackwood is crazy-in-love with the youngest witch Mona Mayfair, but Mona's at death's door due to a wasting disease brought on by her giving birth to a Taltos-human daughter, which child was spirited away by a lone male Taltos to an uncertain fate 4 or 5 books ago.Who? What? Where? Don't worry--newcomers will get all the backstory they need, because almost half of this relatively slender tome is taken up with the various characters getting together, squabbling, freaking out and providing Cliff Notes to everything that's going on. And when the plot does kick into gear, it zooms merrily along. Make Mona undead before she dies-- check. Drive Rowan Mayfair nuts--check. Exorcize a ghost at Blackwood Farm--check. Take off to a remote Caribbean island overrun by vicious drug lords holding the remaining Taltoses (Talti?) captive--check. In its final third, the novel becomes a Saturday morning cartoon featuring a seven-foot-tall, kitten-faced Taltos fembot in a leather miniskirt wielding automatic weapons, and Lestat bringing down a helicopter with fire-bursts. Either you'll buy this zaniness, or you won't, but it sure isn't boring.(Personally, my jaw dropped for about 25 pages.)Is this a fitting coda to the Vampire Chronicles? Everyone is going to have a different opinion, though for my part I feel that Rice's ultimate responsibility is to her own vision, and she should end things as she sees fit without undue rancor on the part of her readers. I'm sure plenty will disagree--just look at some of the outraged reviews in this forum already--but debate on this issue could take up more volumes than Rice could hope to write in an Undead lifetime. Now THERE'S a scary thought."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"THIS POSTED ON 9/6---BRAVOReviewer: Anne Obrien Rice (New Orleans, LA United States) - See all my reviewsSeldom do I really answer those who criticize my work. In fact, the entire development of my career has been fueled by my ability to ignore denigrating and trivializing criticism as I realize my dreams and my goals. However there is something compelling about Amazon's willingness to publish just about anything, and the sheer outrageous stupidity of many things you've said here that actually touches my proletarian and Democratic soul. Also I use and enjoy Amazon and I do read the reviews of other people's books in many fields. In sum, I believe in what happens here. And so, I speak. First off, let me say that this is addressed only to some of you, who have posted outrageously negative comments here, and not to all. You are interrogating this text from the wrong perspective. Indeed, you aren't even reading it. You are projecting your own limitations on it. And you are giving a whole new meaning to the words \\"wide readership.\\" And you have strained my Dickensean principles to the max. I'm justifiably proud of being read by intellectual giants and waitresses in trailer parks,in fact, I love it, but who in the world are you? Now to the book. Allow me to point out: nowhere in this text are you told that this is the last of the chronicles, nowhere are you promised curtain calls or a finale, nowhere are you told there will be a wrap-up of all the earlier material. The text tells you exactly what to expect. And it warns you specifically that if you did not enjoy Memnoch the Devil, you may not enjoy this book. This book is by and about a hero whom many of you have already rejected. And he tells you that you are likely to reject him again. And this book is most certainly written -- every word of it -- by me. If and when I can't write a book on my own, you'll know about it. And no, I have no intention of allowing any editor ever to distort, cut, or otherwise mutilate sentences that I have edited and re-edited, and organized and polished myself. I fought a great battle to achieve a status where I did not have to put up with editors making demands on me, and I will never relinquish that status. For me, novel writing is a virtuoso performance. It is not a collaborative art. Back to the novel itself: the character who tells the tale is my Lestat. I was with him more closely than I have ever been in this novel; his voice was as powerful for me as I've ever heard it. I experienced break through after break through as I walked with him, moved with him, saw through his eyes. What I ask of Lestat, Lestat unfailingly gives. For me, three hunting scenes, two which take place in hotels -- the lone woman waiting for the hit man, the slaughter at the pimp's party -- and the late night foray into the slums --stand with any similar scenes in all of the chronicles. They can be read aloud without a single hitch. Every word is in perfect place. The short chapter in which Lestat describes his love for Rowan Mayfair was for me a totally realized poem. There are other such scenes in this book. You don't get all this? Fine. But I experienced an intimacy with the character in those scenes that shattered all prior restraints, and when one is writing one does have to continuously and courageously fight a destructive tendency to inhibition and restraint. Getting really close to the subject matter is the achievement of only great art. Now, if it doesn't appeal to you, fine. You don't enjoy it? Read somebody else. But your stupid arrogant assumptions about me and what I am doing are slander. And you have used this site as if it were a public urinal to publish falsehood and lies. I'll never challenge your democratic freedom to do so, and yes, I'm answering you, but for what it's worth, be assured of the utter contempt I feel for you, especially those of you who post anonymously (and perhaps repeatedly?) and how glad I am that this book is the last one in a series that has invited your hateful and ugly responses. Now, to return to the narrative in question: Lestat's wanting to be a saint is a vision larded through and through with his characteristic vanity. It connects perfectly with his earlier ambitions to be an actor in Paris, a rock star in the modern age. If you can't see that, you aren't reading my work. In his conversation with the Pope he makes observations on the times which are in continuity with his observations on the late twentieth century in The Vampire Lestat, and in continuity with Marius' observations in that book and later in Queen of the Damned. The state of the world has always been an important theme in the chronicles. Lestat's comments matter. Every word he speaks is part of the achievement of this book. That Lestat renounced this saintly ambition within a matter of pages is plain enough for you to see. That he reverts to his old self is obvious, and that he intends to complete the tale of Blackwood Farm is also quite clear. There are many other themes and patterns in this work that I might mention -- the interplay between St.Juan Diago and Lestat, the invisible creature who doesn't \\"exist\\" in the eyes of the world is a case in point. There is also the theme of the snare of Blackwood Farm, the place where a human existence becomes so beguiling that Lestat relinquishes his power as if to a spell. The entire relationship between Lestat and Uncle Julien is carefully worked out. But I leave it to readers to discover how this complex and intricate novel establishes itself within a unique, if not unrivalled series of book. There are things to be said. And there is pleasure to be had. And readers will say wonderful things about Blood Canticle and they already are. There are readers out there and plenty of them who cherish the individuality of each of the chronicles which you so flippantly condemn. They can and do talk circles around you. And I am warmed by their response. Their letters, the papers they write in school, our face to face exchanges on the road -- these things sustain me when I read the utter trash that you post. But I feel I have said enough. If this reaches one reader who is curious about my work and shocked by the ugly reviews here, I've served my goals. And Yo, you dude, the slang police! Lestat talks like I do. He always has and he always will. You really wouldn't much like being around either one of us. And you don't have to be. If any of you want to say anything about all this by all means Email me at Anneobrienrice@mac.com. And if you want your money back for the book, send it to 1239 First Street, New Orleans, La, 70130.

I assumed once he met God and the devil, there would be nowhere else for our fiendish rascal to go to. At least a place worthy of his vast powers. There isn't anyplace on earth he can't go to or anyone he can't overcome, so Lestat only has his own conscience to battle.Lestat now wants to be a saint. He is wracked with guilt at killing, except any immoral people who deserve it, especially other \\"bad\\" vampires. He is in love with his companion, Quinn, and his newest creation, the beautiful but bratty Mona. These two are what keeps Lestat in check from doing any great wrongs. He has become more of a guardian and mentor than simply blood thirsty vampire prince. The underlings new experiences are now Lestat's. He has become even more civilized. Lestat sleeps in a fine bed and at times changes his clothes to put on sleep attire. A far cry from the man who slept in coffins or even in the earth.Anne Rice has combined the adventures of her witch clan, the Mayfairs, with vampires. Together they focus on a single goal, to find the \\"tall people\\", from Anne Rice's \\"Taltos\\" and \\"Lasher\\" series, who have mysteriously disappeared with unknown intentions to humankind.Lestat is a great character, but \\"Blood Canticle\\" just doesn't allow Lestat to be Lestat. His two pupils, though he loves them dearly, holds him back. Lestat is feverently in love with the mortal witch, Rowan, and promises to give her the dark gift one day, but it isn't enough. Lestat almost single handed, kills an entire island of drug smugglers by means of blood sucking, neck breaking or fire emitted from his being. It isn't enough because it is all done with such ease, I never worry about him. Except for the sun, Lestat has no weakness. Lestat's own stumbling block is himself, and any mistakes he makes can easily be rectified becasue of his great power.Lestat needs to make a great statement to the world, beyond the \\"rock thing\\" that he did a few novels back. Maybe Lestat, on his quest for sainthood, decides to make over the world to what he considers to be a better place and the result are the old vampires like Maharet, witches, mummies, demons and other Anne Rice creations, come out to finally stop him.If your a fan of the vampire Chronicles, especially Lestat, then you have to read \\"Blood Canticle\\". It's a decent read, but my favorites are still \\"The Vampire Lestat\\", \\"Queen of the Damned\\" and Memnoch the Devil\\"."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I read this novel a few months ago, so it's not really fresh in my mind, I admit that. But after reading these reviews, I just had to write one myself. I couldn't NOT. So here it is.\\"Blood Canticle\\" is a good novel. It is. It's better than LOADS more out there, thousands upon thousands. But it is NOT spectacular, which the first three in the Vampire Chronicles most certainly are. It's just not at that level. Personally, I don't have a problem with Lestat's \\"lingo,\\" because I can see him speaking and writing that way. The whole \\"Saint\\" thing did and still DOES bother me, but when you think about it, it is in his ego. BUT only when you look at Lestat's character a certain way. The rant on Memnoch was somewhat bothersome, but again, I can see Lestat doing it... but, once again, ONLY if I think about Lestat's character in a certain way. I guess a lot of it is just accepting, which I have a hard time doing when I love a character so much.There are more problems still: Merrick was one of Louis's \\"3 Loves,\\" yes? We learn this in \\"Merrick.\\" So how come, when she dies, Lestat doesn't even TELL Louis? And the only times Louis IS mentioned is in an insulting fashion.... which I find really very sad in a variety of ways.Also, considering everything, Lestat STILL seemed out of character for me. This started in TotBT for me, and it comes to a pique here. \\"Little Brother,\\" I just CAN'T see him calling someone that. It's not the lingo, the saint bit, the rant over Memnoch.... Just, OVERALL, I disliked him in this. It was NOT him. Especially with that whole Rowan love deal...Nonetheless, when reading this novel, one has to take into account everything that Anne has been through. The death of her husband would obviously have had a HUGE impact upon Ms. Rice. Consequently, I'm not blaming her for this novel at all, save perhaps that whole computer thing which could have been cleared up easily with the help of an editor. And even then, benefit of the doubt. Hence, under the circumstances, I think she did a spectacular job... but that doesn't mean I have to like the novel.This novel was still GOOD. It just wasn't, a mon avis, Lestat or true VC material. It just wasn't AS GOOD as all that."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Not necessarily the storytelling itself, mind you, but the way she goes about it. This is supposed to be the last book in the wonderous \\"Vampire Chronicles\\", right? There's a saying in the literary world, \\"You're only as good as your last novel.\\"Anne Rice apparently understands what that saying truly means. If you are going to end a series of novels, why end it with a spectacular bang? That leaves people wanting more, and you never truly get out from under the thumb of your own creation. It is better to go out in a fun way, whimsical almost, and enjoy yourself while writing it. That's one thing that DOES come through in this final book. Anne Rice enjoyed herself. I for one think that she deserves our praises, and our adulation, for that reason alone. She took back control of a series of books that SHE wrote. Kudos to you, Ms Rice."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"There are the vampires(Lestat,Marius,Armand etc) and there are the witches(Rowan,mona,suzanne etc)...Now Anne Rice brings the main characters(Lestat,Rowan,Mona) of each of the series together to give you the best of all.This is really a good way to finish the series...Here is the plot..Set in New Orleans, Blood Canticle is narrated by Lestat. The protagonist is a young Mayfair witch named Mona. At the beginning of the novel Mona is wasting away, victim to a mysterious disease brought on by the birth of her daughter, a so-called Walking Baby(a sort of taltos). As the novel plays out, Mona and her guardian, Rowan Mayfair, the current designee of the Mayfair legacy, reveal more and more about the powerful genetic plague that has haunted the Mayfairs for generations: the Taltos.In what she believes to be her dying hour, Mona - highly romantic in nature - buys quantities of roses and takes them to the house of her lover, Tarquin \\"Quinn\\" Blackwood(who was introduced in \\"Blackwood Farm\\"), who is a vampire and a dear companion to Lestat. She lays the roses on his bed, intending to spend her final moments here. So that she does not die from the massive decline that her body has undergone, Lestat makes her into a vampire. He does this largely to satisfy Quinn, who could not bear to see Mona as she was.(This happens at the beginning of the story,continuing from where the previous novel left off)When trying to prevent Mona's family from discovering her transformation, Lestat unwillingly falls in love with Rowan Mayfair. Secretly, she falls for him as well.Lestat's blood is quite powerful -- matching that of the eldest vampires. Mona learns this quickly and discovers that she can easily dispatch inferior vampires with the powerful gifts that Lestat's potent blood has bestowed upon her. Now her renewed vigor and her anger about her situation with Rowan and their shared secret of the Taltos causes her to lash out verbally at Rowan and Rowan's husband Michael(Michael Curry,for the mayfair series). As she struggles with herself, Lestat, and Quinn, she learns her place in her new world.As she learns, Lestat pledges to find her Taltos child if it still lives. For this, Lestat nees the help of Maharet. In a very short time, Maharet provides critical information for their search.The story comes to a dramatic conclusion as Mona, journeying with Quinn and Lestat, comes to the remote island where the Taltos live. But instead of finding a secluded paradise, the three vampires learn about years of intrigue and civil war among this isolated race of beings. In the end, the remaining Taltos join the Mayfair clan at the medical center in New Orleans, where they can be safe, learn, and be together as a family.Mona and Quinn are again together and will remain so, presumably without the companionship of Lestat.Rowan Mayfair seeks out Lestat, half in love with him and exhausted by her life, requesting that he perform the Dark Trick. Lestat declines, pained as he is, because she is a guiding force for the Mayfair family and he cannot take her away from it.\\"Enjoy...................Nigel."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"This novel was a great reading for me. Don't pay attention to the immature and negative reviews here on Amazon about it; most of those reviews come from narrow-minded people who dislike Anne Rice for various reasons. How ridiculous and judgmental to behave like that.Aside from that, this is a great book. It is certainly not in the same league as The Vampire Lestat, or Memnoch the Devil, but it is a good reading.I especially liked the entire Taltos concept; felt like a novelty since I haven't read much at all about the Mayfair witches, and the rest of Anne's occult world (I've only read TVC and New Tales of the Vampires).The only thing that was sort of a disappointment, was that if you're going to end The Vampire Chronicles, please do it by giving us more: I wanted to read more about Maharet, Mekare, Armand, Louis, Marius and all of the other vampires that I've grown to love throughout the years."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I read this book a few days after it was released. I've reread it three times since then as I do all of Anne Rice's books. I have read every single book that she has written, right down to the Beauty series, and I have to say that she has never been a disappointment.Lestat's evolution into a saint and then inevitable plunge into the old Lestat was to be expected but that doesn't mean it was written poorly. Lestat is Lestat and as an aspiring writer I understand how sometimes books just write themselves. Just because you want Lestat to stay the same throughout the years it doesn't mean that he wants to. These characters are entities unto themselves and just like any character or person, for that matter, they evolve and grow over time. They don't always make the choices you want them to or become the people you think they should be but as Anne so eloquently put it, if you don't like it, read something else.Well I loved it, Anne. I look forward to what else you have to give to the world whether it is simple reviews on Amazon or a whole new genre of books. Thank you for the years you have given us thus far and the gift of your imagination."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I really enjoyed this book especially because I really love &quot;Blackwood Farm&quot; and this is a follow up. There's more religious references and I think a lot of people don't really understand it, but we have understand that she's going through a lot and her Catholic faith is really important to her. I read her all her books and events in her life has a lot of impact to her writing. A lot of people hated the movie version of &quot; Queen of the Damned &quot; but I really enjoyed it. I took for what it is, not as a word for word movie version of the book. I think comparing her works is really unfair because she wrote them at different times of her life under different situations and events."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Have finally got the whole vampire chronicle series. Can not wait to read the rest."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"And I hope Anne will let us know about his farther achivements soon. I enjoyed this novel a lot; stunning opening chapter, which raises a lot of questions and touching, romantic ending. In a way it took me back to The Tale of The Body Thief, but Blood Canticle is absolutely different. It shows us the most domestic side of Lestat, beyond the glamorous fiend we grew to love. I don't know whether he ever saw Christ in His Glory, and I don't think I quite get to understand Memnoch, but this I know: Lestat is no longer 19-years-old. Sure, he will never abandon his eccentricities and wild disposition, his taste for fine clothes and rags now and then. But we cannot lock him up in his dazzling youthful body forever. Claudia would have never imagined a most cruel revenge.I like the moral evolution of Lestat, I like the way he comes closer to Armand's experiences and feelings on his own. I like that he meets (at last!) the \\"other sex\\" as Mona says (next step will be to accept that mum never loved you, my darling, it was not just she was bored or uninterested).Blood Canticle is a good novel of characters, with great dialogues scenes. We do not get here a thrilling and intricate plot, true, but the book is highly readable and very easy to follow, just as Lestat promised in the first chapter."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I loved this book so much, I needed something to take my mind off of the horrible state our country is in and this was perfect!I laughed I cried I forgot all of the dishonesty coming out of the Whitehouse for a couple of days. The Mayfair witch saga was my favorite set of books of all time and bringing them together was just perfect. Anyone who says they didn't like this book just needs to read the Mayfair witch books again and (I just read them again for the third time) and then read Interview With a Vampire and then read this one again. It was the perfect ending. Ms Rice, I am so sorry for your loss I know that this is something that you will carry with you forever just know that you are in the hearts of your TRUE fans and we love you!"},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"To say the least, I have read Blood Canticle more than once and I found it not what I expected at first. I am a huge fan of her work and personally, I found nothing negative about this book. The characters were presented in the way I have found comfortable at least to me, I have not been disappointed at all. I would like to clear up one thing that I found discouraging about these people who leave reviews on Amazon, they are just here to complain and that was not what I intend to do. I intend to tell Anne Rice exactly how I feel. I love Quinn and of course ALL of the Mayfair witches!Anne Rice, please don't listen to people who are just here to complain, please! I happen to have found your book incredible like all your books!"},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"This was a wonderful book. I'm love with Lestat like never before. He has changed like we all do. With time, tribulations, joy, and pain we grown just as he has. He is the Brat Prince no more. I always loved reading as a child but really fell in love with books and reading when I read Interview with the Vampire. Every book from Anne Rice has been wonderful to me. I was able to relate to each of them each in its own special way. To all who trash this book, it's ok not to like it but get a life and just read something else. Get over it. It's one thing to give a review, it's another thing if you're going to burn Anne Rice at the stake. You all act like it's the end of the world. You try to dictate Anne's writing and our choices for what to read. What is wonderful for me might not be for you and vice versa. That's how things work, stop being so hurtful, angry, spiteful, and SAD! I don't know who hurt you but I'm sure it wasn't Anne Rice. Give your review but be careful with what you say, stop being so incosiderate. Don't say she shouldn't write anymore. I and many others still want to read her beutiful books. Anyway I couldn't put the book down and really enjoyed all of it. Anne Rice continues to enthralls me."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"True, this may not be one of Anne Rice's best books that we have come to know and love. But all in all its a fun book to read if you have a long flight ahead of you, or its a lazy winter day and you wish to curl up with a book by the fire!I can understand why some of Anne's fans are super ticked. The writing at times is a bit much, but lets face it......its a book on vampires...not Shakespeare!Lestate, Mona, and Quinn meet again! I won't spoil it for you any more, other to say its a fun filled book.Don't get your hopes up with the thought of her first books, but all in all, if you are a fan of her work, you will like it none the less.I am already looking forward to Anne's next book which is due out in November!Happy Reading!!!"},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Well, I'd like to start by saying even though I own the book, I haven't read it yet despite being an avid Anne Rice fan. It's on my list, I just haven't had the time to read it. I was notified by a \\"friend of a friend of a friend\\", so to speak, that *gasp* a well known auther had the nerve to respond to critique. So here are my mixed views:Point, Anne says in her response this exact quote, \\"First off, let me say that this is addressed only to some of you, who have posted outrageously negative comments here, and not to all.\\"As far as that is concerned, there are too many people who seem to have missed that line when they said she \\"flew off the handle\\" at her reviewers.Counterpoint: lines such as \\"But your stupid arrogant assumptions about me and what I am doing are slander. And you have used this site as if it were a public urinal to publish falsehood and lies.\\" and, \\"...when I read the utter trash that you post.\\" kinda hurt my head. Mostly because I think it's funny that someone I held in such regard could be so hypocritical, and partly because Anne's just asking for more. (Hate begets hate, etc.)Counterpoint, again: this line probably would have hurt me, had I been actually embroiled in either side of things - \\"There are readers out there and plenty of them who cherish the individuality of each of the chronicles which you so flippantly condemn. They can and do talk circles around you.\\" I like your books, Anne, I'm obsessed! But, as you can probably tell I'm not one of those \\"talk circles around you\\" types. I overuse commas when I write, I can hardly ever piece together a straight thought when I'm upset in any way, and don't even get me started on verbal communication.Self-slander aside, I don't believe liking or disliking someone's work has anything to do with their intellectual levels. Nor do I think that of whether you are able to read further into the piece of work. Even though I liked each of them I started and restarted QotD and Memnoch twice each, Lestat once, until I actually owned the books and had some free time. At that point I flew through them and was so engrossed. I fully re-read the chronicles 3 times. I had meaningful conversations dealing with real life ideals and beliefs based off of them, with people who hadn't read them!Let's go back to the other side of the spectrum for a moment: I have friends who dislike Anne Rice literature, all of them because they want storyline and Anne gives so much detail. Nobody has yet said to me \\"gee, I liked the first 8 books of hers I read and this one just makes things so different so I don't like it.\\"Short end of the story: I personally think everyone who is taking deliberate sides and bareing their teeth at each other is being a bit silly."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"OK so this wasn't the best book I will admit. Anne Rice is an awesome writer! I do love her books, but this one was somewhat disappointing. However, it wouldn't be so disappointing if it wasn't the last book. I really would love it if she would write one more. Wrap things up, tell us what happens to Lestat, Pandora,Marius, Armand, the rest of the cast, and my Favorite, Louis. Anne, if you ever read this, I really admire your work, and I understand that you're tired of writing. But if you want to end a series, then you should really end it. Not just stop."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"i am a longtime fan of anne rice and every single one of her books. i am reading blood canticle for the 2nd time, just because i feel like it. i think i have read all of her books at least twice because i find them even more amazing when i revisit them. the characters stay with you, follow you home, they go to bed with you, you can't get them out of your mind. as for blood canticle, i appreciate the coming together of the two stories (witches and vampires). i think that is why merrick appealed to me also. anyway- anne's words and her storytelling, and the sheer vitality of her characters truly puts you under a spell. a spell that you don't want to come out of. it has always been this way and with this last vampire chronicle, it still is this way...spellbinding. ms. rice has given so much to her readers over the last few decades in the vampire chronicles. what a treasure this final chapter is!"},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I am surprised by all the negative reviews over this book and tend to think it is more a case of disappointed fans with too high an expectation than any real problem with the storyline and writing.For myself I found it enjoyable if not profound. It's complexity comes from interweaving several sets of characters and storylines into a single novel. If you haven't read the Witch series, for example, you'll likely be lost. I appreciated the cameo's of these characters and particularly liked Rowan's participation since I always considered her an interesting character that deserved some more attention.The book reamins a light read however largely because of the linguistic style used. It's very difficult to be horrified, saddened or even concerned about anything going on when Lestat is prattling on in his fresh new 'slang' intermixed with his usual egotistical prose. Even in his dramatic scene with Rowan near the end I couldn't help chuckling at some of his turns of phrase.In short, it was an enjoyable and light read. Light is not necessarily a bad thing, it was well-written and flowed well. If you, like me, are a casual appreciator of her work overall you'll probably enjoy this one. I tend to think it's only the truly hard-core fans who were hoping for some series revalations or particularly dark and dramatic writing who might have been disappointed.Regardless, nothing but obvious immaturity justifies some of the particularly nasty personal attacks posted here.The only thing that really disappointed me is the rumor that this is the last of the Chronicles. I can only hope Anne may one day reconsider."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I am THRILLED about Mrs. Rice's apparent life choices and what appears to be progress toward regaining the ability to be happy. I believe it has effected (and affected) her writing as it ALWAYS HAS. The writing that kept us all spellbound came from a dark, and I think, unhealthy place. If her personal recovery means I pay for ONE less-than-exemplary book, I'll take it! Hurray for Anne! Thanks so much for all the wonderful tales, and I apologize for my, and my fellow readers SELFISHNESS.

I don't think it was a good enough conclusion to the Vampire Chronicles though..."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"A saint, please...Lestat must have stayed out in the sun a little longer than he thought. He does kinda go on and on about this whole saint business too much. I didn't like Mona Mayfair as a witch and I don't like her as a vampire. I loved Quinn story in Blackwood Farm. I have to now go back and see what's the deal with the Taltos. Overall it as a fun read."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Ah Lestat, I've missed you! To be brief, I would say I loved this book, but that sort of gushiness doesn't suit an Anne Rice book.However, if you've become so enthralled with the Chronicles and all things vampyric, you seem to be disappointed. May I say that -in this world where too much tv and film are hopelessly predictable and derivitive- you may also be so wrapped in your visions of what Tom Cruise, I mean Lestat, would do that your derision of Blood Canticle was preordained.If you're so disappointed, get out a pen and proceed writing something original- not fanfic for the boards. Lestat is not yours.Beautiful, vivid, enthralling; I couldn't put it down - that's my most helpful review."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Combining my favorite vampire with my favorite family was an exceptional treat. Anne Rice writes (via Lestat) with a fast paced and sensual delivery. LeStat's wonderful wit and intelligent languaging alone make the read worth it. The old character's revisited have often changed (such is life) and it's interesting from the perspective of time gone by in our own waking realities and those of the author. Julian Mayfair is always engaging and completely welcome in the storyline. As well, he could only fall short to one other character in strength and determination, and rightly so.The pleasure is in Lestat's personal ponderings and they tie in well with prior books while continuing forward with his ever present justifications of when to be good and why to be evil. Rowan Mayfair appears as a refreshing combination of realistic vulnerability and her old formidable self. This is a wickedly penned tale from the perspective of a huge character favorite."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"The Vampire Chronicles continue with this tale of love, madness and redemption.In the first novel since Memnoch The Devil, Lestat is the central character on a quest to find love.Mona Mayfair has come to Blackwood Farm to die but instead she is given eternal life with the undead.

Rowan's husband, Michael Curry is seeking Lestat's help as he feels his wife is slipping further into madness, and Patsy, a country-western singer, returns to avenge her death at the hands of her son, Quinn Blackwood.\`Blood Canticle' is classic Anne Rice; dark, sexy, gothic and filled with rich descriptions. Once begun the book can't be put down as the seductive story holds you entranced. I have been a fan of The Vampire Chronicles for many years and this new entry is one of the better ones.Anne Rice is the premier author of vampire tales and the power of her storytelling genius is on full display in her masterful new novel.

Blood Canticle was the only way in my opinion to end was was in fact, one of the best Chronicles I have EVER read, and if you've been through Lestat's adventures then you would understand why in fact, this was ended in such a manner.Always loved are my books, and always will I keep this one and all of the others in high standards.I would give it 10 stars if I could!"},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I would like to begin with the fact that her books have NOT gone down hill since Queen of the Damned. I started reading Anne Rice when I was 11 or 12 years old. I am now 16. I think that the chronicles have improved very much since the first three books. Even though I loved the first three dearly, I would not however rate them as the best that she has written. I have read Interview atleast three or four times, and I have read a couple of the other books a few times as well. But I have read every Vampire book she has written except this last one. I know that this book cannot be THAT bad. Sure, the first hundred, or even two hundred pages in a book are gonna be bad, but almost all of the books are this way. She is still introducing the characters!!! It always gets boring in the begining but then once you get to the best parts you need all that was read in the begining. I cannot believe that you people are critizing her work like this. I know that any book written by her could not be this bad! Back to my original subject though, you say that the first three were the best? Then why is it that everytime I try to reread one of those (besides Interview, I only love that one so because of Louis) I can't do it. My mind keeps drifting off to either Body Theif or Armand, or yet my favorite Blood & Gold. In my opinion you must have not \\"got\\" all of the books to be critizing them in this way.

I was like what am I going to read now? Dang!!!!Quinn, is so cool; he just shoulda been a brotha :-). I loved the fact that she finally put some black (one) folx in her books, since New Orleans is full of us.I was hoping Quinn, Mona, Jasmine, and Jerome, would be back (maybe not Mona, cause boy I thought she would be an ugly sight.)I have to agree with one reviewer who said that \\" the residents of Blackwood Farm, WERE/ARE some of the dumbest people on the planet\\" And the withces just shouldna been with my Lestat.All I have to say is if you liked The Vampire Lestat, you should like the story of Quinn Blackwood.

Does anyone know?"},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"With the number of reviews spewing negative rhetoric about Anne Rice's 'Blood Canticle,' one would automatically assume that it is to be expected within a free country. This is a country in which its citizens are free to criticize, praise, or be indifferent to a work of fiction such as the book in question. However, the same freedom goes both ways from the readership...to the author. Suffice to say, this may be the most intriguing tale about a writer who stands up, not only for her work, but for herself.After reading her response to the negative reviews, I was impressed by the sheer courage it took to write it, let alone leave her address so that some of you could return the book in exchange for your \\"hard-earned\\" money. I am, however, curious about something. Have some of you shown the same courage by actually returning the book to her and asking for your money back? Keep in mind that it makes no difference compared to what I am about to touch on, but it is merely for my own curiosity.In weight of everything here, I can honestly say that as American citizens, we must endure these types of responses from cynics, critics and speculative people alike. That's the given. Although, I also can't help but think about how they knowingly gave their \\"hard-earned\\" money to such an \\"atrocious\\" book. The same \\"hard-earned\\" money that you people pay for the internet connection that allows you to post these reviews? Anyway, these same people that are so caught up in this site and so insistently determined to arrogantly preach about writing as if we should take their opinions as professional analysis are also the same people who do it with one goal in mind: To get under your skin.By \\"your,\\" I'm referring to fans of Rice's work and, of course, Anne Rice herself. Some of the negative reviews are so amazingly similar in writing style and structure, even in grammar and vocabulary (however horrible it may be), that it leads one to believe that some of you are posting under different names to concur with the same opinion. Not to mention taking the opportunity to get another personal shot in for the hell of it.Yes, you can criticize. Yes, you can do so free of consequence if you do it without defaming someone's character, but do it knowing that you leave yourselves wide open for the same critical analysis. With that being said, let's keep one thing in perspective here. All of you are nothing and nobody to hold your collective weight over a writer such as Anne Rice. In fact, I don't even think any of you are worthy enough to be speaking the English language judging by the mundane and cockeyed approach of your feeble criticisms. Your pseudo-intellectual whiney rants serve no purpose other than to promote yourselves. Deny it all you want, but it is impeccably obvious due to the redundant nature and somehow elevated aura the majority of you carry about yourselves. You are not relevant. You are not important. And for years to come, your greatest accomplishment will be the fact that you managed to get under the skin of a critically-acclaimed writer and her fans.Wow.Are you all impressed with yourselves? I wouldn't be if I were some of you, because while you all post here with your swelled egos and lack of intelligence, keep in mind that others could care less what you think, which I know would be the kiss of death, otherwise you wouldn't proudly post your opinions for all to see and reply to.I felt inclined to write this because I also write for a living. I write, and I report. I use the facts to report, and I use my heart to write. It's a balance. I believe that Anne Rice writes from the heart, but does so responsibly. For those of you that had or are still going to have choice words for Rice and her work, keep in mind that she does what none of you could ever dream of doing and has what none of you could even dream of having. She has relevance. The rest of you will fade into obscurity, and the only way we would have known that you even existed is by the dimwitted and negative comments you left behind.

To slander this wonderful and talented author and her work (the way it was done) is absolutely terrible.While this may not have been her best book, Anne Rice has still written a great book. I would only like to say that when you know the series and what it is about; when you've read every book; when you know and love every character, you should be able to see past the lingo/editing/plot lines. Because, aside from those things, Blood Canticle was still a part of the Vampire Chronicles. A true fan should be able to appreciate it for that reason alone."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"This was the last thing I ever thought I be doing. Giving an Anne Rice book, least of all a Vampire Chronicles book, one star.There really isn't a God...Anne, dear Anne. I've followed your writing for so long. The VC books have captivated and fascinated me for years. When I found out that The Blood Canticle was the last book, I was upset. Devestated. Horrified. Frightened. Then hopeful. Hopeful that perhaps this one would feature all of the old Coven. You all remember them, right? Anne had kind of ignored them for a long time.I hoped for Louis, Armand, Marius, Daniel, Padndora, Gabrielle, and any other old Vampire that ever surfaced in this series. But, low and behold, I didn't see any of the Vampires that I loved.In fact, I didn't even see Lestat.No. No Lestat. No Brat Prince that I had adored for so long. Instead, there was 'Saint Lestat', a pseudo-Lestat hellbent on being good. He wrote fragments, used all capital letters for several words, verbally attacked his devoted readers, said \\"Yo\\" and \\"shove off\\", and somehow lost all of the poetic sayings like \\"Savage Garden\\" that he had once so freely written.No paragraph exceeded six lines. I seem to remember several paragraphs going on for a whole page.Where were all the elaborate sentances? The description? The heart-felt dialoge. In all the other books, no one ever spoke. So when one of the Vampires actually decided to talk, you knew it was important. In the Blood Canticle, the pages are rife with frivolous coments about how Mona's calfs look great in high-heels.I think I read that Anne stopped using an editor after Queen of the Damned.I think she needed thirty to save this book."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"The thing about Anne Rice is that when she gets it right (Vampire Chronicle 1-3, The Witching Hour), her books are extraordinary. That it makes it all the more disappointing when she gets it wrong, as she does with Body Thief, Memnoch, Taltos, and , Blood Canticle. The biggest disapppointment is the language of the story -- Ms. Rice has (sometimes), a wonderful gift for language, but her lush and elegant prose is compleletly missing from this latest effort. The story itself is weak, and previously engaging characters are either missing, or curiously lacking in personality. I hadn't read her books in a while, but happened to pick up Blackwood Farm, and was intrigued by Quinn and reminded why I liked Anne Rice in the first place. I went back and read Merrick, and was eager to see where the story would now go. Unfortunately, it doesn't go anywhere. As this is the consulsion of two series, I wanted to know what happened to old favorites like Louis, and was keen to see more of Quinn and my old favorites Rowan, Michael. Unfortunately, Louis isn't mentioned, Quinn is reduced to the role of lovesick puppy/useless sidekick, and Rowan and Michael, and even Lestat feel like one-dimensional and flat caricatures, rather than fully-devloped characters. Lestat and Mona are also less sympathateic and engaging that they have been in previous books. And not that believability is the hallmark of an Anne Rice novel, but the Taltos meets the drug lords storyline seemed was a bit much to swallow even when you suspend belief as you turn the first page. All in all, an unsatisfying conculstion to two storylines that both began with so much promise."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I ask beacuse it couldn't possibly be Anne Rice...she who wrote so brilliantly in the earlier Vampire Chronicles. I honestly wondered as I struggled through ENDLESS fragmented sentences and \\"flashes\\" (meant to entice readers who have never read her books to buy another to get the \\"full story\\"- hopeless, beacause if this is the only book of hers you ever read, I can't IMAGINE anyone wanting to read another ) who was writing this trash. Blood Canticle contains every possible mistake that a writer can make: bad prose, stupid, melodramtic dialog, and a complete disregard for the characters personalities that readers have come to know over the years. Honestly, if Lestat had said \\"yo\\" or \\"cool\\" one more time, I would have been certain that the manuscript was meant to be on the reject pile and a dreadful error was made at the publishing house. (Actually I'm positive of it!) If this is the best she can do, I'd say it's a blessing that this is the last Vampire book she plans to write. (...)"},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Yes, yes.

Please stop whining and write something decent."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I agree that reviews should not be mean spirited or slanderous. I wouldn't dream of saying that it was not Anne Rice who wrote \\"Blood Canticle\\". It is clear that she wrote this book. One can look at the huge downward slope of her novels, to see that \\"Blood Canticle\\" is the absolute bottom of the barrel. Yes, taste is subjective, and you have the right to like anything that tickles your fancy, but I have the right to dislike it.Mrs. Rice doesn't seem to think that it's possible to not like this \\"book\\" because it's just simply really, really, really bad. Instead, she says that basically she is a great, great talent and that \\"we just don't get it\\". Well, maybe if she put aside her enormous ego, she might realize that some of us really do get it. I got it from the first sentence. It's an awful \\"book\\". You can make lame excuses all you want, but nothing excuses bad writing. \\"Blood Canticle\\" reeks of nothing more than a case of fulfilling a contractual obligation. I won't go through the trouble of dissecting the \\"book\\", because it's clear that the author was troubled with plot development (I mean drug overlords and Taltos?) or character development (massacre). But, there is justice as it is apparent to me that more and more people are getting it: her novels fall off of the bestseller list like a rock and her print runs have been dwindling steadily since \\"Servant of the Bones\\". Maybe Anne, you don't get it. Perhaps, Ms. Rice should look towards a successful peer like Stephen King. Mr. King manages to be quite prolific and not descend into blithering drivel.Anne says that she is above being edited. I cannot remember when I have heard a more egotistical comment in my life. If her words were \\"polished\\", there wouldn't be plot and character inconsistencies that a Hummer could drive through. Thankfully, I didn't pay for this tripe. I will NEVER purchase another Anne Rice book, and I will make sure that I tell every single person that will listen to do the same."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I cant agree more with all other disappointed fans out there. When i read The Vampire Lestat i knew Anne Rice was going to be my favourite writer. I loved queen of the damned, tale of the body theif and then mamnoch came out and i was like, what was that all about. Still the chronicles that followed kept me interested. Blackwood farm and Blood Canticle had nothing to do with the series and what we had been reading earlier. A BIG BIG disappointment this one. When Merrick ended i thought the story will take a new turn secially with the unexpected threat from the Talamasca.The chronicles had so much potential Rice could've continued with them forever, but this was really low. Yes like other readers i also want to know what became of Louis who really started it all. And why was Lestat without companions in this book so pathetic when he managed to bring everyone together so long ago. He has both his fledglings David and Louis both faithful to him but oh.. they were forgotten in the last book werent they???. I didnt like the Mayfairs or the Taltos crap.This is not how it should end and for most readers it didnt end at all. What can be worse.. this book wasnt even scary. Why did Lestat fall so stupidly in love with Rowan. Suddenly Lestat the magnificent has developed so many weak points in his personality. No he was not like Louis, Louis has a reason to mourne or whine, Lestat was whining for no obvious reason. Really Rice should consider writing another one to end it decently. Her fans deserve this much!!!"},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I have read almost every book of The Vampire Chronicles of Anne Rice. I think \\"The Vampire Lestat\\" is the best book of the series and I waited patiently for the return of the phlegmatic Lestat. And he has returned, only in this book he sounds as if Anne Rice hopes that nobody ever will ask her again to write about Lestat. He sounds like a vampire who does not believe in himself anymore, doesn't take himself very seriously. And therefore the reader is not taken very seriously.I have believed in Lestat, had hope even and the belief that he existed, but now I know that Lestat is dead, just as the writer of the book wanted to achieve. Lestat is dead. I hope she never writes about him again."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Blood Canticle is by far the most stripped down raw and honest installment of The Vampire Chronicles. I have read them all dozens of times. I am not sure where all the hostility towards this novel comes from all I can offer are my own insights.Spoilers:This novel starts with an interesting open. Its a glimpse of where our narrator (in this case Lestat) is currently at heart and soul wise. Brilliant open really curious insight into his mind. Sometimes I think that since its been so long since we the reader have heard from Lestat, well I think this could really sum up this novel in a whole, but I truly feel that the Lestat some had in their minds ceased to be once Memnoch reached its end. Since that point there have been glimpses of Lestat in other novels but not the man himself. I guess overall the audience who found this novel tough to digest were angered maybe because there was no answer to what happened to him during his slumber. As for the open lots of wonderful moral questions and solutions that could be found if only Lestat could become a Saint, themes to play out and the stage is set for a novel (whether you liked it or not)we did not see coming. Again this did not surprise me character wise and I am kinda surprised that the hater audience for this novel latched on that idea so much. Do you all not remember Lestat as a human long ago wanting to be a priest? Its almost like it never happened I know it was so long ago but I laugh at the notion that this novel lacks character development.On the subject of Character development. I should say that for the first time I could recall the mortals in this story far outweigh the immortals, which I found to be a breath of fresh air. I loved all the characters that emerged from Blackwood Farm and was happy to see them again. As for the development of the Mayfair's that was brilliantly handled by Anne Rice. What a treat it was so revisit them again, Michael and Rowan (who I love the most of the whole Clan Mayfair) and Dolly Jean, Uncle Julien, Stella and of course the roving harlot herself Mona and Mona of course still dealing with the effects of the Taltos ironically becomes a thing apart from humanity much like the Taltos she birthed so long ago.There are several intense short brilliantly written chapters in this novel one of my favorite being Lestat in the hotel room with the drunken woman waiting for the hit man. Pure brilliant writing short and brutal and beautifully written. The other is Lestat speaking of his love for Rowan Mayfair. Very intense writing there.The long and short of Blood Canticle is this.Its been more then 30+ years of Vampires and Witches. The two central characters of both worlds fall hopelessly in love with each other. And never has love felt so helpless in reading of a Anne Rice novel? The choice Rowan and Michael made to not go into the unknown at the end of Taltos lead to Rowan going to Lestat at the end of Blood Canticle. All of the horrid choices Lestat made over the years lead to him not giving in to Rowan, is Lestat redeemed for not giving in? Has his Saintly being finally shown thru? Is Rowan more then ever reinforced in her quest to right all her wrongs? We will never know, and honestly that does not bother me. That's where this tale really resides, in the unknown. It doesn't bother me that we never knew what happened to Lestat during his waking sleep. There are hints, glimpses but that is not what this story was about. To me Blood Canticle is about Love, spiritual love, love of the Earth love of what you cant have, Love of what you hope to be. A pure shame that so called fans only want complain about their personal wants not being met. We often forget as fans, as devoted as we are we really forget this is not ours. The creation belongs to the creator, we pay for the privilege to read along for the ride. And money well spent I love this book. Its my fave right behind The Vampire Lestat and The Witching Hour."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"With this book Rice completes her sad transformation from compelling gothic author to melodramatic hack. There have been many times over the years when I've wanted to throw an Anne Rice book across the room, but the sheer fascination of her mythos kept me coming back even through the most deadly books (of which Servant of the Bones is a prime contender). With her last book, Blackwood Farm, the writing was as purple and crammed with descriptions of furniture, clothing and architecture as ever, but after the first 100 pages of breathless description she took off with a story that was hilarious in its kitchen-sink, anything-goes byzantine plot. It may not have been good, but it was a juicy read. However, with it's follow-up, Blood Canticle, Rice has turned in what is probably the worst book of her career, and a pathetic close to the Vampire and Mayfair Witch sagas. The fact that she hasn't allowed an editor to change one word of her writing is a strong clue that she takes her dross for gold, but this tripe seems like the thinnest gruel of fan fiction. If there were such a thing as a Anne Rice drinking game where you did a shot for every time you read someone refer to another character as &quot;darling&quot;, &quot;dearest&quot;, &quot;beloved&quot; or &quot;my love&quot;, her readers would all be in alcoholic comas. The woman can't write dialogue, and really never could...the difference is that she used to know it and restrict herself to narrative. Now, we get diatribes about the infallibility of the pope(!) and Lestat's babble about how he wants to be a saint. Demented claptrap! I'd have to agree with those who found the first 3 Vampire chronicles, along with Witching Hour and Lasher, to be Rice's finest inventions. Rice has stated recently that she no longer wants to write about her Vampires and Witches, and for those of us who care about the once fascinating brood this can only be long overdue news; the author has turned on her children and defiled them and their story in what seems clearly a delusional belief in her writing skill and voice. Better she should retire now, for she ran out of things to say a LONG time ago. RIP!"},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Yes, they're hers but she gave them to us and I have the right to be disappointed. Any artist that abruptly changes something good that they've already created- the fans have a right to react. It's unhealthy to believe that any human being is infallible. You can be loyal to someone and still admit they have faults. Don't be afraid to speak up, you have voices, and you have the right to have an opinion other than absolute love for everything someone has done simply out of blind loyalty for what had once been glorious. Yes, Anne Rice is an artist. Yes, she's a genius but let's face it, kids, once she signed that fifteen million dollar contract that got her pushing two or three books out a year she dropped the ball. I'm an Anne Rice fan but I'm not afraid to say she made a mistake. Okay! She made a mistake. It's all right. It's not the end of the world. You're allowed to dislike something an artist creates. You can like a dozen movies by one director but if one doesn't sit right with you, that's okay. It's okay to admit she's wrong. I am a fan of Anne Rice. I adore the first three vampire chronicles (the trilogy as someone else once called it). But I'm not afraid to admit she's dropped the ball here."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"This series should've stopped several books ago. How many people can Anne make into vampires and then force us to endure listening to their angst as they come to terms with enjoying that ultimate vampire orgasm which is drinking someone's blood? How many more side characters can she stretch out into full stories?My biggest disappointment was the \\"love\\" story between Rowan Mayfair and Lestat. It was unconvincing and contrived. One of the nicest parts of the Witching Hour was the romance between Michael and Rowan, which Anne proceeded to destroy in subsequent Mayfair books.This is a tired, tired series. Try doing a sequel to The Mummy, Anne."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I was a big fan of Ms. Rice's books for a long time. Blackwood Farm was the first vampire (or Mayfair witch) novel that I didn't love. Actually, she had been declining for a couple of books before that, but it was in Blackwood that I noticed the sharp drop in quality, which only drops even further with this book.Now, I know that Ms. Rice was going through a hard time. Her husband died, she found out she had diabetes, etc etc.If Ms. Rice had said to her fans (via her website or otherwise) 'You know what, I'm just dealing with a lot right now, so I'm going to take a break from writing' or some such, I'd have supported her one hundred percent. It would have been completely understandable.But no. For whatever reason, Ms. Rice decided she wasn't going to write more vampires since she found Jeebus all over again and is now gonna write Christian tripe, so she thought she'd end the Vampire Chronicles/Mayfair witches with this book that brings them together. Normally, this idea would excite me.But this book left a sour taste in my mouth. Everyone has become flat and cardboard. Mona, Rowan, Lestat are all shadows of their former selves. And Taltos being the prisoners of drug dealers? PUH-LEEZE.Anne Rice has a ego that nobody would envy. I don't know what was worse, this book or Twilight. NO ONE is above the editorial process. When I write, I thrive off feedback and critique. No one can consider themselves 'good' at anything unless they are willing to admit to themselves that there is always room for improvement. And this is only exacerbated by the declining quality in her work... writers often get better, not worse.It is a huge shame that the Vampires and the Mayfair Witches had to end like this. A crying shame, really."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I wish I could say that it didn't deserve any stars, but this review format won't allow me that luxury. A gold star for effort I suppose.I want to know what happened to the Vampire Chronicles. They were amazing at first, true works of art that transformed my idea of vampires forever. But then they started to decline. That is, they started to decline once the witches were introduced.But I'm here to write about Blood Canticle, aren't I?Well, I still want to know what happened. It used to be that Lestat could contemplate for pages on end, but now there is never a page that doesn't have some half-hearted dialoge! What happened to the rich history and beautiful description?And, above all, what happened to all the old characters? The old coven that made me love these books more than any other horror novel?I miss the Chronicles. I miss them alot."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I believe this will go down as my least favorite of the Vampire Chronicles. How disappointing to find that the book held little interest to me after the first few chapters, especially when I could barely put Blackwood Farm down once I started it. I guess my expectations were so much higher than they should have been. I expected a lot more from one of my favorite authors. This book picks up immediately after Blackwood Farm ends and goes off into a lot of repetition which I assume is for those readers who did not read the The Witching Hour, Lasher, and Taltos. If you're an Anne Rice fan than you more than likely read them all so this one was boring and repetitive...and had me wishing the book would move along to something new and exciting. It never got to that point. It's ending was as disappointing as it's beginning."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Let me start off by saying the story wasn't so bad, it was the execution of the story that was terrible.I was thrilled to see that Lestat played a major role in this story, until the dialog kicked in. He sounds like some metro, gangsta, surfer knock-off. He actually says \\"dude\\" all too frequently. Please.The story actually does a decent job tying the Mayfair Witch/Vampire scene together. It revolves around Quinn Blackwood and how he is struggling to deal with his fresh mortal life and his new vampiric existence. But, again, let me say that for the first time in any Rice book, Lestat killed it. I could not get passed the random, rambling soliloquy that popped up everywhere.Sorry, this one didn't do it for me."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I've read every one of Anne Rice's novels, and have graciously accepted Lestat being &quot;reborn,&quot; but I can not accept Lestat becoming such a bore. The Brat Prince is now just a brat. Blackwood Farm deserves a classier follow-up. I miss the great storytelling author who wrote &quot;The Witching Hour.&quot; What happened?"},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Religion, like a parasite, not only infected our politics but also our beloved Vampire Chronicles. In Interview, Lestat was a short-sighted sociopath with little caring beyond his own nightly needs. in The Vampire Lestat and Queen of the Damned, Lestat was given a more noble personality in order to be the main character. All three books were some of the best ever written on the genre. Louis, Lestat, Armand, Marius were all powerful, multi-layered characters who kept you turning the pages.Back to reality, Anne, found religion, and in it, she sacrificed her Vampire Chronicles for her imaginary friend Jesus. Lestat finding religion would be like Michael Corleone finding work as an FBI agent. Now, what peoples' beliefs are, are their business. But murdering the series which, let's call a spade a spade, took you from a studio apartment to a becoming a multi-millionaire does seem somehow wrong and distasteful. Much like how Bob Saget continuously slams the show Full House, I would like to approach him and ask him that if he feels like that why don't he give back all his royalty checks.IWTV, TVL and QOTD were and still are great books. TOTBT is the first descent into being 2nd class but that is expected with any series. What else could be done after QOTD besides explain the stories of Marius and Armand which would be almost a redo of TVL. But turning the chronicles into an outlet for christianity is the ultimate slap in the face and a gross departure from the atheist origins that IWTV implied.Anne, I don't pray to any fake Gods, but this book inspired me to pray that when YOU mature and drop the religious fanaticism, perhaps you'll write a real last Vampire Chronicles conclusion, first chapter being an apology to the fans for the last several books and reboot the series after QOTD or TOTBT.Until then, hopefully we can count on Tom Cruise to make a long-rumoured sequel TVL or TOTBT and one can only hope Anne Rice isn't involved in the creative process because I don't trust her enough not to butcher her older work with offensive religious overtones."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Since May, I've counted down te days until this novel was released. Blackwood Farm looked like the series was improving in quality a little. Since Blood Canticle is supposed to be the FINAL book having to do with the vampires and the witches, I figured that I would have an understanding and closure of the destiny of a good number of the characters in the series accompanied by a DECENT story line. Is that to much to ask?....Apparently, it is. The book itself is narrated by Lestat and appparently his ego of wanting to be good and a saint has taken up the ENTIRE book. The story line seemed ok, so I still had my hopes on it, which for its potential and for Lestat's intro which was really funny gets two stars. The following factors prevent this book from getting 5 stars.1. There is NO way that anyone could include everything in the series in 304 pages of reading material. There were still TONS of questions that I was asking at the end. Which leads to....2. Where have all of the vampires gone? The ONLY vampires present in the action of the story are Lestat, Mona, and Quinn (i really don't like him), and VERY LITTLE Maharet and Khayman. Well, others are mentioned but only like &quot;ooohhh i wonder where someoneso is? or I remember someoneso and I did this together. It's kind of a lazy way to include characters like that. I was expecting something like Queen of the Damned, which was good at including everybody in.3. Do we really need to rehash every bit of the Mayfair story? Rowan and Michael (some of the Mayfair Witches) meet Lestat and tell &quot;a little&quot; about themselves. It is a little expected that readers of this book are familiar with the basic plots of what hapened in the Mayfair series since this book CONCLUDES BOTH the vampire and the witches. I don't mind it that much except that it leaves VERY LITTLE time to explain and flesh out the subplots from the book and left me unsatisfied.4. Why do a lot of the Mayfairs seem whiny, weak, or cruel? The way that ALL of them are portrayed in the book made me wonder whether some moody pod people kidnapped the characters from the original series. What was with Mona and Julien?5. How if you're not sober do you come up with the concept of the mystical Taltos people being kidnapped by drug lords? I almost through the book against the wall at that.6. Finally, do we really NEED that much description over trivial things. Instead of saying the beautiful jewelry box, it'd be like the beautiful, green, ornate, cool, awesome, ribbon strung....blah blah.....jewelry box. Really annoying, huh?Well, in conclusion, I really had false hopes with this book and for people who still think the next book will explain everything missing, think again. THIS IS THE LAST BOOK. No more. Both series started with sooooo much potential. Sad to say that this book does very little justice to both series or the anticipating fans. If you want to know how much potential the series had, read or reread in both series The Witching Hour (Mayfairs) and Interview with the Vampire, The Vampire Lestat, and Queen of the Damned (Vampires) Now that's good reading."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I thought it couldn't get worse than what I consider the worst three books in this series- Queen of the Damned, The Vampire Armand and Merrick. I was very wrong.I'm in the minority of people who actually kind of liked Blackwood Farm. It was a little ridiculous, and maybe the marriage of the The Vampire Chronicles and the Mayfair Witches series could have been handled- or not handled- much better. But the main problem I've had with this series since Queen of the Damned is that there are too many whiney characters who all seem very alike and constantly talk in long boring dialogues about how miserable (Armand) and/or good looking they are (Lestat), or, worse, about religion (Armand, Lestat, et al). So, I had some hope coming into the final book that some of these issues might be resolved since Blackwood Farm seemed to eliminate a few of them.Rice does not \\"resolve\\" these issues. Instead, she completely eliminates any semblance of these characters' original personalities and replaces them with whiners, and, most horribly of all, a repentant Lestat who uses grimace-inducing, self-aggrandizing slang almost constantly and, although he refers to himself every few pages as \\"wicked,\\" has lost all of whatever \\"wickedness\\" he was supposed to possess. Instead he's a simpering wannabe saint who touts very obviously Rice's own (stupid) beliefs about a good many things.What's more, the new characters are extremely brittle and two dimensional. Rowan and Michael Mayfair might as well have not existed in this novel. For no apparent reason, Lestat falls in love with Rowan. I can't tell you how many scenes consist of Lestat and Rowan staring longingly at one another. Rowan also constantly cries. Surprisingly, the character I found most entertaining was Mona Mayfair, but naturally, as with almost all of Rice's female characters, she gradually degenerates into a constantly-crying, tortured whiner. Oh, wait, that's all of the characters. Never mind.Those are the plot problems. Let me get into the writing itself. At one point, Rice uses FIVE- count 'em, FIVE !!!!! exclamation points. She also frequently uses several question marks. Why is this? Is she feeling the pressure of an aged series and wanting to make it \\"younger?\\" I know plenty of young people who are familiar with simple grammatical rules. There are also the usual problems with her later books- many completely pointless scenes, needless repetition, the incessant use of words like \\"beautiful\\" and the jarring and clumsy erotic scenes that usually come off as just sort of awkward.Then, there's the Anne Rice Classic, where some characters are involved in a big event, and on the next page, DIRECTLY AFTER YOU'VE READ THIS ENTIRE EVENT, mind you, all of the characters sit around and talk about it, recounting it word for word.Now, considering all of this horror, you'd think it would be a long book, wouldn't you? But no, it is not. It's fairly flimsy. I cannot comprehend how a person can go from writing something as rich and dark as Interview with the Vampire, Tale of the Body Thief or even Blood and Gold to...this. It's awful. I frankly wish I wouldn't have spent the two dollars on it that I did."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I loved every book in this series up to Blackwood Farms and this book, both are filled with pedantic drivel. If you like to read 10 pages about a little old lady's shoes, or how wonderful said woman thinks it is that her grandson is bi-sexual, then this is the book for you! I'm sure Rice will just think I don't get it, or understand the complex, artistic nature of her book, and who knows she might be right. Either way, not many people liked it."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Er, don't mind that title... It's a poem I wrote. Heh. Loved this book, it was great. I don't see why everyone else hates it but hey, Freedom of Speech, 1st Amendment... So yeah. I love the style of writing in the novel, it was fascinating how Ms. Rice combined the usual intellect of her novels with a more laid back casual style of writing. Very good. Eh, I don't feel like writing a long review today... :P I'm being stupid again. So yeah... I'm bored. I'm writing reviews out of boredom now. *Smiles sardonically* The world is strange in its fates... Great novel, loved it, peace to all! I'm outtie."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"O to be a true artist... what that entails. It's touching the subject, sticking your hands, no your Soul, into the grime of it all to come out w/ the masterpiece from the pain, the pleasure, the grit, the glory and everything in between and beyond those borders.Anne Rice has made a believer out of all of you... even those of you with negative reviews. Only a TRUE Artist could elicit such responses both from a place of hate & contempt or from a place of true love. Both of those emotions come from one place, the same place... intensity. And it is with intensity that each artist who truly has mastered their media, portrays their views, derived from the life experiences, the grime if you will. And Anne Rice has captured, to this point of my reading of these reviews (approx 217 views thus far), a vast array of emotion from each one of you whom felt she was worth your time to express your feelings about her work.Lashing or full of praise these are words from people who needed to express how an Artist made them feel. When an artist has achieved such devotion in this century, where a person will spend their precious personal time in writing about them... well... that's what they were put on this earth to do, and they've served their talents & passions well. Artists drive the world, they partly shape it but mostly narrate it. They use prose, color, lines, form, light, sound, motion, emotion to tell their stories, and each of you who read this, who write this... you're a part of the Art that Anne Rice has fed us all. Like it or not... you're a part of the chronicles. You're a part of Anne Rice's world.And that's exactly why she is who she is, and why you feel what you feel... because SHE Made you! She has a gift. Whether you appreciate it or not, you've been touched by that gift. And she has done her job. She has done her job well.And for that, and for the almost 2 decades of my devotion to her art, whether I always appreciated it or not, I glorify her...As for the book in question... I thought that it was devilishly clever, as was Blackwood manor and Merrick in bringing the two stories of the two great Ricean \`families' together... this wasn't an abrupt unexpected affront to those who just had a vampire fetish and didn't necessarily want to explore her entire portfolio (which I must say you are missing out. Cry to Heaven, her Erotica series, the Mayfair saga, Violin, Servant of the Bones, etc... all amazing stories quilted together with the same lush and acute understanding of poeticism in her writing), or to those who for some reason only explored the blood chronicles. (and don't get me wrong, I've been a vampire fanatic since before I could articulate such a thing).This book has been in the making for some time, and for you who say it was unexpected... well GOOD! I would hate to pick up a book and EXPECT something of it, and be gratified that my expectations were well founded. How sad a world would that be if I could predict ever book I picked up. Why would I even read? I expect an author to take me on a rollercoaster ride I wasn't ready for so I can feel the butterflies. Why else would anyone ride a rollercoaster if not for those butterflies?Was this my favorite of the tales on either side... no. Am I sad that Anne has said good riddance to the two... desperately. Because this book was so open, as open as eternal characters stories should be.. open to so many more possibilities. Never once have I ever read one of her books thinking it was the end. And I hang hopefully by an exquisite silk thread hoping that this book isn't the conclusion... if it were? I'd be just as content as if there were 10 more, because I can always explore her world in my head and imagine where Louis, Armand, Marius, The twins, Pandora, etc.. are, what they are doing. Because Anne Rice, built a world so vital that it is always inside of those who truly believe.Even if you don't feel like appreciating that."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Lestat, Lestat - your saint ramblings break my heart.

And who are these tacky bitter people who so rudely post such mean spirited reviews of Blood Canticle? Are they qualified? Is there a great writer among them? I don't see a Stephen King or a Salman Rushdie or a Naguib Mahfouz listed here. For these three are among her true peers; including maybe a few others alive today who can weave interconnected tales spanning both real and fictional time.My name is Marc St. Camille. Who am I? Why does my review matter? I'll tell you. Best grab a glass of wine first as this may take a moment. To set the mood I have J. S. Bach Lutheran masses playing in the background, about 100 candles providing ample light and my faithful dog Tessera resting her head on a First Edition Interview With A Vampire. On my mother's side I come from an ancient royal bloodline that ruled Persia until the middle 1900's. There were always rumors linking our earliest roots to a family that predates known history in ancient Egypt. Never mind Maharet. My father's side of the family has Zoroastrian, Sufi and Jewish mystics and wizards going all the way back to the beginning of Persia's history. These are people who loved, respected and passed down interwoven tales of their own history combined with popular mythology from generation to generation. (Read the Shahnama of Ferdowsi). So please believe me when I say that I recognize a good tale when I see one. Not to mention one that spans over 20 books. Pray tell me how many people on this planet have had the ability, talent, patience, perseverance, memory, imagination and gift of having such a long running series published. Especially when combining accurate history; ancient philosophies; detailed minutiae relating to places new and ancient round the globe; memorable characters; visuals so vivid they will be imbedded in my soul forever?Do these vile critics think producing a book an easy thing? A fun thing? Something to do between Buffy episodes? I have no respect for people so flip with their words. And believe me; my people can hold a grudge for millennia."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"From the very first book, That I aquired at a used bookstore i have been glued to the pages of this author. \\"Blood Canticle\\" was definately no different. It was just as good as \\"Interview With The Vampire\\" which is still my all time favorite. Kudos to you Anne Rice, May you continue to bless us with your written masterpieces.Slainte"},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Well, I must admit I couldn't put the book down. I read it within a day. It was fast paced and lacking the usual pages of description for this or that event.Immediately I recognized a different style. I immediately got the feeling Anne wanted to show us Lestat's evolving character. I was charmed by Lestat's turn for the better-his attempts at being good even if he is a little bad. I could tell right away by the language he used that he had transformed once more (kinda like Madonna!) to adjust to what he had experienced and what his envivornment was.Yes, I found it difficult to believe there was anything between Rowan and Lestat because well-they never really spent any time together. I felt Michael Curry's character had dwindled from a blazing masculine and powerful figure in The Witching Hour to nothing more than \\"Carlito the pool boy\\".I was excited, however, to see the Taltos again-probably my favorite of Anne's creations. I always wondered what an encounter between a vampire and a Taltos would be like and here I had that curiosity fulfilled. I can't tell you how ridiculously excited I was at meeting Oberon with his metallic nail polish chugging a cold glass of milk. I only wished there had been more of this character and more focus on these curious creatures. The story of the Taltos here seemed rushed and I was wanting so much more.I loved the book for its ability to keep me hooked. I loved the meeting between major characters like Rowan, Lestat, and a Taltos. Despite the fact that I didn't believe the love between Rowan and Lestat, and that I've always hated Mona since I first read about her, and still did, and thought she should die right away, I enjoyed the book a great deal.And on that note I want to make a comment on the heated critizism I've read. I was really amazed at how emotional some of the posts were and I got to wonder how can a book (or books) create so much heart ache? I understood a lot of the posts because I myself had felt this way at some point after reading some of her later books. I had felt anger, hurt, dissappointment. It became personal also, lashing out toward the author and the author's writing abilities-the same author who had run away with my imagination.It dawned on me that Anne had succeeded in making her readers fall so in love with her characters, that they felt protective of these characters. That was clear to see! To see so much dissappointment and anger because of how this or that character behaved in later books, how this or that event didn't make sense, or about how much they missed the \\"good old days\\" when it was just the good old vampire conflicts and the old Lestat. . .It really struck me that Anne should feel so proud to have created so much fierce affection from her fans that she had earned their scorn. Amazing that after writing several books that did not fit into the same pattern of the first ones her own fans had disowned her. I suddenly saw such a strange comparison of Anne as the Maker. Anne the Maker now divorced by her fans as they swore to never read another book-and making personal insults all the way. Only intense love can create so much scorn. For that alone I say to Anne \\"Bravo!\\" and well done. I think in the truest sense of you vampire lore scorn is the greatest form of flattery.I wont claim to never to read any more of your books though. I'm always interested to see how your evolution as a human being reflects itself on your works!"},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"This book is a wonderful treat. The joining of Vampire and Witch mythology that was suggested in 'Merrick' is finally, completely and irreversibly realized in 'Blood Canticle'. It's extremely fast-paced, with refreshingly few detours into tales of long ago. Rice finally reveals what happened after 'Taltos' and it's deliciously exciting. The Talamasca are respectable and seductive once again. Mona Mayfair makes a wonderful addition to the world of Vampires and the consequences of her transformation are superbly dramatic, rich and exciting. There were many points when the story could have drifted off into a two or three hundred page recounting of some series of events or character bio, but everything is kept racing along at a terrific pace; tight and relentless. This book captures everything that the chronicles once were and should be. The passing mentions of some vampire characters are tantalizing and I don't see how Rice can leave the series after this book - in fact, her interview on 'The View' suggested that this might not be the last Vampire novel, as she'd previously stated it was. My fingers are crossed because this novel demands further adventures for all the characters involved and makes the reader hungry for more from Anne Rice and the denizens of her world. Vampires, Witches, Ghosts, Angels, Devils, Criminals and Saints - all the ingredients come together perfectly in this one."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Wow, I was shocked to say the least when reading Anne Rice's \\"re-buttle\\" to all the negative comments. I sympathize with her rage though. It's terribly annoying when readers, editors, etc; act like a book should have been written for them, and to their standards. The fact is, The Chronicles are Anne's, the characters are Annes. We are invited guests into HER world, if we don't like it that's fine, but to belittle her and the choices she made about HER characters and HER story is simply ridiculous. I'll admit, The Blood Canticle was not my favorite book in the chronicles, but I really appreciated being let into that world again with those familiar characters that I have come to love and crave! Thanks Anne for hanging in there, and thanks for allowing us to enjoy YOUR world."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I thought that this book was fantastic! It was not as good as some of her early books, and I wish it had been longer- that is why I only gave the book 4 stars. The story was about Lestat and the Mayfairs, which is why Maharet and Kahyman were passing characters. I would love to see more books about the other vampires as well, but this book stands alone as being a great story about Taltos, Lestat and The Mayfair witches. I have been waiting for that combo for years (and was hoping merrick would be more like)and was so glad to see it! It was also very riveting- I finished it the same day I purchased it! And for those who didn't like it and want to slam it, remember a few things. First, you don't have to buy it. Second, Ms. Rice recently lost her husband, so be grateful that she has written anything for us at all! Third, I really doubt that anyone could do this better than Anne Rice. She is a talented, wonderful person who really cares about her fans."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"This is tripe.

Thus cometh American Hack Rice, who tries so pathetically to equal herself to Stephen King and, with this worthless defense of her novel, proves herself to be simpy Diane Steel with vampires.No, dear Anne, you are no great writer, and this work is certainly the worst of your Lestat chronicles. I read your works from a library on a beach--when, of course, there are no boy bandson the radio to distract my attention (their intelligence equals yours).So please, take your fictional greatness and go back to your fictional world where you are a wonderful writer.

However, many of you are saying that this is your last of the vampire or witch chronicles and you're more than right about that. In fact, you don't even have a choice. Anne Rice has stated multiple times in her phone messages that this is the last novel she will ever write about vampires or witches. I think it's pretty disappointing for a final bow out."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I've read all of Anne Rice's books over the years. And this isn't the worst by far. In fact, I thought that it was a rather jaunty read! It moved quickly (unlike some of the witch books), with little extraneous content. I especially appreciated the fun she had with LeStat's character. I like his narrative voice. I think that Rice has allowed him to grow and evolve in an interesting and I believe plausible way. Why wouldn't an ageless vampire find spirituality? What else is he supposed to do with his time? Wouldn't shopping, acquisition and general mayhem get a little old after a while? I would think that discovering the meaning of his own life would be a logical consequence of immortality. It was a fun read. Nothing too demanding. Just fun."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I loved this book. I'm not sure what the \\"die-hard\\" fans were upset about. I'm new to most of her books. I think that's why the rest of us enjoyed this book so much. I had no preconceived ideas of what to expect.To me, Blackwood Farm was part one, and this is part two. I would say this book is part of the Vampire Chronicles AND the Mayfair Witches series. I couldn't wait to read this book, especially considering the great cliffhanger of sorts at the end of Blackwood Farm.I encourage anyone, especially those new to Anne Rice, to read Blackwood Farm and Blood Canticle. I hope Ms. Rice's \\"established fans\\" will relax a little and try to enjoy her newer works as much as the rest of us do.An added treat is the unabridged audio books of Blood Canticle and and Blackwood Farm; the unabridged audio book narrator is incredibly entertaining.I look forward to reading Ms. Rice's next release, as well as her older titles."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"While I have no words of harshness in this review I will agree to an extent with part of the review that someone wrote...'Lestat, well, he's Anne Rice, not himself. He fully ceases to be his own character and instead becomes his author's mouthpiece.'The opening chapter in particular echoed of things I have seen said in more recent interviews that were taken by Anne herself.While I agree that the events of a persons life have some affect on how they see the world, in the past books Lestat has always remained Lestat, brat prince, in one way or another.Anne has said that her Husband was the inspiration for the brat prince himself. And with the loss of her husband we also have the ironic loss of Lestat.As far as books go, this is not a bad book. It still a interesting read. Just do not expect the lavishness and deep chapters of her previous books. Blackwood farm for me was such an amazing treat. It offered a new era, a new dawn. It was sad to go from that to this book, to see Mona reduced and Quinn playing 'tag along'.Even more so for me because in 'Blackwood farm' I found Quinn to be her greatest character since Lestat himself.Anne once was quoted as saying something along the lines of, (about the film Queen of the damned)' Names are all that this production has in common with any of my books or characters. 'This seems to be the case of this book too. A book that only has the names of characters as being the only thing in common with her other work.I hope that at a stronger point of her life, Anne will go back and realise that her chronicals deserve a greater ending this - while some may argue she owes it to her fans, I would rather argue that she owes it to herself. She can do better and does not deserve to be remembered with disapointment for this book."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Many of the recent reviews posted about \\"Blood Canticle\\" have not been about the book itself, but about the author. Furthermore, many of these same reviews have been nothing short of mean-spirited, ill conceived and downright ridiculous.You didn't like the book? That's fine. Many people didn't. Even I must confess that it was, at times, hard to follow, and that it was so very different in style from her other vampire chronicles that I often wondered if it wasn't part of a different series altogether.However, like anyone of intelligence does, Ms. Rice has changed. Her views of the world have changed. Her beliefs have changed. Her ideas have changed. This is an inevitable consequence, if one could call it that, of learning and living. And, learn she does. She obviously spends an enormous amount of time studying history, religion, and who knows what else? How else could she construct stories and characters with such rich and varying detail?It is inevitable, as time goes by, that a writer's style, ideas and views will change. And, when a writer's career spans decades, the degree of that change becomes more evident with each new work. If one were to pick up \\"Interview With the Vampire\\" for the first time, then read each subsequent volume of the chronicles, he would see decades of change in a very short time, which might lead him to believe that the writer has either given up care for her work by the end of the series, or that the writer suffers from split personalities.I believe neither is true. Times are much different now than they were when she started writing. She, therefore, is much different than she was when she started writing. If anything, I'd be worried about her if she hadn't changed in all this time. I would wonder if she had gotten so wrapped up in her writing that she forgot to live. It is living that has brought about such changes in her, as it does to us all...as it has and continues to do to her characters and stories.If you don't like the direction in which she took her story, or you're disappointed in the way she told it, then tell your own story. Read other stories. But, ultimately, you've no decency in judging and ridiculing her the way you've done.She is a human being who has suffered great loss, and now is certainly not the time for people to turn on her. If you are so vicious and vile that you would abandon someone for whom you've had any semblance of affection in the past during a time when she may need you the most, then your opinions are, indeed, meaningless, and you shouldn't expect her to take them to heart. She didn't turn her back on her readers. Many of her readers turned their backs on her.I can't blame her a bit for writing the things she did here to those of you who attacked her like rabid jackals. Everyone gets to a point in his or her life when worrying about what others will think if you're honest just doesn't factor into your existence anymore. She, as a writer, has tried very hard to please the broadest audience possible. But, as a businessperson, she has been restricted in what she could and could not say to her public. If she's had negative things to say to her attackers, she's had to bite her tongue and refuse to defend herself.Now, she's undoubtedly at a point in her life where she doesn't need peoples' money anymore. She doesn't need huge book sales to help her achieve the life she wants. If she continues to write, she does so simply because she enjoys writing, and she wants to continue to share her stories with the world. But, she doesn't need to turn the other cheek to her critics any longer. She cannot be destroyed by poor opinions of her character.So, she lashed out at those who've been so unimaginably nasty to her. That's her right. So, she praises herself and her works as being unique, pioneering, even perfect. Well, someone needs to say such things, because she still needs to feel she's working for something, if nothing more than acceptance. If no one else is willing to give her what she deserves, then I see nothing wrong with her giving it to herself.She's earned it."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Well what can I say, I truly don't even know where to start.Where Anne is the Brat Prince of old, where is our Lestat, what have you done to Lestat?

My husband and sister, as well as a lot of friends, are avid Rice fans, though. I wasn't planning on reading this book, or any other Anne Rice book, for that matter, but all the hoopla has changed my mind. If this book is truly that different from her others, then I may actually enjoy it.I do want to say one thing, though. I can't believe the way some of Ms. Rice's fans have turned on her so viciously because of one book. I really have a problem with the personal attacks. If you don't like the book and are disappointed in it, then by all means, say so, but to launch a vicious personal attack on Ms. Rice is immature and shows the limited mental capacity of those who would do so.I plan to read this book and then come back and post my own personal review in the future.

This is his first narrative since &quot;Memnoch the Devil&quot; and the voice had to change to reflect his evolution.This book was well written despite what others say.

For those looking for a great read and something a little different in pace and mood that some of the previous iterations of this series, I encourage you to check it out.As for the articles. I always have to laugh at how cowardly an individuals most polarizing critiques are. Some of the anaonymous negative post are so clearly the same poster that is is comical. Not only is the writing the same, but they even use some of the same analogies and I believe I even stumbled across complete sentances. Either someone is a very poor plagarist, or they have ADHD and can not remember they posted the exact same drivvle a few days or weeks earlier.I treasure sites like Amazon and epinion, because they often times give you a real world perspective on products. The ability to post fairly unmoderated opinions allows shoppers to bypass the advertising machines and get to the real crux of a products worth. Part of that though is being a savy consumers and I dont think Anne Rice has much to worry about in regards to the most obvious and idiot of negative of responses listed here effecting her bottom line. Or swaying popular opinion of her entire writing legacy. Unfortunately, and wonderfully, the internet allows and accepts the lowest common denominator of society, so you can never really avoid sadistic responses if you are someone positioned in a genre that creates the type of emotional response as Anne's writing does.It would be nice if Amazon allowed only those using a registered account to 'rate' an item however.I rate it 4 stars. Not her best work, but the worst of Anne Rice's is better than 90% of whatever else is out there."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Like all of Anne Rice's vampire novels I found this one to be entertaining. If you are looking for better, read Mick Farren's Rehnquist trilogy. Lestat is mediocre next to Victor Rehnquist."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"This is the first book of this author I was exposed to. I did not like the story, the plot etc. I think it was not a good book. But having to listen the narrator added to the pain. He changes from a man's voice to a woman voice, from one accent to another, and that was not only extremely annoying, but almost comical."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Many people seem to have issues with this book, however I think it is quite an interesting endeavor. Lestat wrote this book, not Mrs. Rice. Meaning she wrote it as Lestat would have written it and I think she hit the nail on the head. For me, I can always tell by the end of the first chapter if I will finish the book or not, and I was hooked. Blackwood Farm is one of my favorite books and it was nice to see where things went.It was a very enjoyable read and I await her next project."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Blood Canticle is neither \\"affected\\" nor \\"whiney.\\" It's a great book and well worth the money. Though I've never been overly fond of the character of Rowan Mayfair and don't see what Lestat sees in her, I'm glad Anne has brought these two together. (But oh! How I wish she'd write a continuation of The Mummy: Or Ramses The Dammed!) Obviously some people are just put off because she claims this will be her last book about Lestat. I, for one, don't believe that. I think one day she'll be walking down the street, perhaps after doing a little shopping or after a nice meal, and Lestat will pop up and tell her \\"Hello, Anne. Have I got a story for you.\\" Because if there's one thing about Lestat we all know, he can't be shut up."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"This was a great book, in my opinion! I loved Blackwood farm and loved this one too...as well as everything else that Anne Rice has written. There have been, of course, some that I've enjoyed more than others, but that's just personal taste isn't it? Does that make those books truly worse than the others I enjoyed more?Most of my reading consists of non-fiction...Anne Rice is one of the few fictional authors that I will read. Does that make the other popular authors of today bad? Absolutely not. They're just not my style. My point...what exactly is the motivation for writing a hateful, slanderous review of a fictional book? Who is anyone to judge whether a fictional book is bad or not? What appeals to one will not appeal to another.I don't understand all the comments about \\"Where's my brat prince?\\", \\"This isn't Lestat\\", etc. Are characters not allowed to evolve over a period of time? My God! This character has been around since the '70's. Do people truly expect him to remain unchanged over the decades? How boring! Lestat is very much still the brat he's always been, he's just a brat about different things. He's evolved!I feel that novels are a glimpse into the authors soul. I am grateful that Anne Rice has shared so many of her stories with the public. I am saddened that this will be the last \\"Chronicle\\", but it is certainly her decision to make. I'll anxiously await her next book, no matter what the subject.Everyone has the right to voice their opinion. But there's a difference between posting a negative opinion and posting out-right crap. I just hope that if someone is interested in this book, that they will give it a try and decide for themselves."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Despite all the criticism this book has received, mostly from those too immature to handle the fact that an author does NOT have to cater to the audience, I found it to be a truly wonderful piece of fiction. Rice beautifully intertwined the _Vampire Chronicles_ and the _The Lives of the Mayfair Witches_ and brought both story lines to a close. Fantastic imagery perfected this incredibly masterful plot line. I felt I knew the characters moreso from this novel than the previous 13 books combined. The depth with which Rice explored their personalities is unmatched by previous work.A word to the critics screaming that Anne Rice is another spoiled author - grow up. When you have written and successfully sold 25 novels, you can have your opinion. Until then, no one wants to hear your self-serving whining."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"This book is a piece of trash. There is no other way to express how much I vehemently despise &quot;Blood Canticle&quot;. I loved so many things about the &quot;Vampire Chronicles, especially &quot;Vampire Lestat&quot;, &quot;Queen of the Damned, and yes, even &quot;Memnoch The Devil&quot;. &quot;Witching Hour&quot; was probably one of the most interesting family sagas I have ever read.And &quot;Blood Canticle&quot; is what we have been given as a &quot;finale&quot;? It is beyond a let down. It is insulting. One dimensional flat characters, no plot, no cohesion, &quot;Blood Canticle&quot; is the very best example of writing a novel for a pay check. It is sloppy and base. Usually, I can find something interesting in even the worst book, but this novel is far beyond even the worst Jackie Collins.I shall adopt the new vernacular of Lestat.Yo, Anne, you're a hack, and any future novels you write should be confined to the very bottom of the barrel."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Like most of his kind, the vampire Lestat is more a sinner than a saint but since his meeting and metamorphous after dealing with Memnoch, he wants to be on the side of the angels. He proves it again and again when he and Merrick Mayfair help destroy Quinn's evil doppelganger Goblin. He shows his kind nature again when he turns Mona Mayfair, the love of Quinn's immortal life, into a vampire after being at death's door for two years.At Blackwood Farm, he helps a trapped spirit move into the light instead of being trapped between worlds. When Mona begs Lestat to find her Taltos daughter, he moves Heaven and earth and calls upon the mother of all vampires to help him locate the land of the Taltos. When they reach the Caribbean Island where they are held prisoners by drug lords, he liberates them and brings them back to Rowan Mayfair the woman he truly loves but will not touch.Lestat is one of the most fascinating characters in fiction today. He is living (pardon the pun) proof that one who chooses evil can also turn to the light and hope for redemption from some higher power. The meeting of the vampires with the Mayfair witches is a peaceful one and readers will be very pleased that these are two different forces of nature that can not only co-exist but thrive in proximity to each other. Anne Rice has written another special novel brimming with creativity, action and challenges the readers to question their ideas of good, evil, redemption and honor."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Witches and vampires and ghosts oh my! Anne Rice has done it again. She's created another episode in the life of Lestat the world's greatest vampire (at least in his mind). Blood Canticle is the tenth novel in The Vampire Chronicles although you do not have to read them in order to enjoy them or know what is going on.The first chapter is all Lestat. Conceded, whiny and all about his me, me, me attitude. Frankly you can skip this chapter as it really has nothing to do with the story. He did a wonderful job of annoying me the whole way through. The real story begins with chapter two. Quinn Blackwood (the focus of book nine Blackwood Farm) a newly anointed vampire by non-other than Lestat is the focus of Lestat's affection this time around. Rice really loves her triangles though and shortly the love of Quinn's life shows up on his doorstep sick and on the verge of her death. Lestat being the wonderful and loyal friend that he is gives Mona the dark gift as a favour for Quinn. She is magically transformed into this lithe of beauty with long curly red hair that is captivating to one and all. Her one flaw is she's extremely emotional and tends toward fits of crying and tantrums. These two characters remind me a lot of Louis and Claudia from Interview with a Vampire.Now we have a dashing trio of vampires. The dilemma put before them is Mona wants to find her child taken away at birth. Her child has the unique gift of being a Taltos, a group of secret people seven feet tall with no bone structure that grow to adult size within a few hours. It was this birth that put Mona (who's also a witch) on her deathbed.As with any good search there are obstacles along the way. The ghost of Quinn's dead mother whom he goes around telling everyone he killed by snapping her neck and throwing her in the swamp. Everyone thinks he's kidding but he's not. There's also the ghost of scary Uncle Julian and the adorable Stella. Uncle Julian is one of the finest characters in this story and is sure to make the hair on your arms stand up. Other obstacles include the Secret People themselves and whether or not they can or want to be found and a band of drug lords, a family of witches and of course the prince of darkness himself.One of the things I love about Anne Rice's books is her attention to detail especially when it comes to scenery. When reading it's obvious she loves New Orleans. Like an artist she paints its beauty, mystery and hidden darkness of the streets, architecture, natural surroundings and residents.Although Lestat is the narrator of this story he's not necessarily mainstream. He's sharing the stage with the other characters, his loves, although I think reluctantly. Lestat is not the gruesome killer he used to be. He's trying to be a reformed vampire. His personal goal is to become a saint and be adored by everyone but his internal demons seem to always get the better of him. If you pick up Blood Canticle you'll be able to witness another Lestat adventure. Most enjoyable.Review Originally Posted at http://www.linearreflections.com"},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I'm a big Rice fan, ever since I read Interview with the Vampire when I was 13. I was hooked with Louis and then fell in love with Lestat. He's one of the most colourful characters I've ever read about. Anyway, on to the book review! I haven't even finished it, and it's great! Memnoch changed Lestat. Well, who wouldn't be changed after traveling with the devil and talking to God? And this book continues so far with the change in Lestat. And Continues the story of Quinn and Mona, and not to mention the Taltos. I heard a rumour that this is the last of the Vampire Chronicles. That's the only disappointing thing in my opinion. I can't, and won't criticize the other reviewers. I'm sorry to hear this book isn't thought of as &quot;a good one&quot; by some people. But everyone is entitled to an opinion, no matter how distasteful it may be. Keep up the good work Anne. Even if all you do start writing about God and the Devil, and the sinners and the saints to go along with the religion, I'll still read it. Just don't change your writing style too much. It's so rich!"},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I've just finished the book and I feel deflated. I tore through it in two days, which indicates that it was a good read, but really I think I was looking for some substance, the substance that crams some of Rice's best work, the substance that positively possessed The Witching Hour, which is for me her best work. And therein lies my problem I guess, I've never liked the Taltos storyline that resulted from this great book, I've never liked what the consequent trauma did to the characters of Rowan Mayfair and Michael Curry. I think I tore through the book hoping that Rowan would come to her senses, that she could cease walking with God and return to Michael.But in the end does any Rice character of importance ever escape the voracious appetite of Lestat?"},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Forget all these negative comments. Anne Rice still has the ability to sweep me away with her stories, leaving me almost convinced that these words were written with Lestat's hand. I can hear his voice, I can see his eyes, I can feel his teeth on my neck. As I flip through the pages of Blood Canticle, Lestat comes alive for me, sadly enough, for the last time. And I am even more in love with him now than I ever have been. His character flaws endear me to him, and make him what he is, the Brat Prince among vampires. I love his vanity, and I sympathize with his desire to be as human as the next person without having to give up his supernatural powers. We all want to be normal, yet we refuse to give up that piece of ourselves that sets us apart. And who doesn't want to be an actor, a rock star, a saint?? To be adored and fawned over by all?? He is as bloodthirsty and merciless as ever, yet compassionate and loving at the same time. His love for Rowan Mayfair is heartbreaking, and his love for Blackwood Farm is sweet. The Vampire Chronicles and The Lives of the Mayfair Witches, undoubtedly the best of Anne's work, come together beautifully within these pages as we bid our nocturnal and haunted friends a melancholy farewell. It is sad indeed that the Chronicles have come to an end, but at least I have all the stories on my bookshelf, so that Lestat and David and Louis may keep me company on a rainy day. Brava, Anne. Brava."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"[...]Again, I am going to say that this book was great! I find that it ends the series very well, and I don't understand why so many seem less pleased. If you don't like the book, fine, but do you have to go on and on and on about it? I would have liked the chronicles to go on for thirty more years, but that's probably impossible, and Anne Rice ended it the way she saw fit, and the way that it was supposed to have been ended. If it wasn't supposed to have been written the way that it was, perhaps she wouldn't have started the series. Her imagination, the words she uses, the way she describes things literally send chills up my spine. Never before have I become so dedicated to a writer, and I don't think ever again will I find somebody that can put images into my head, and truly make me see the stories, clearer than any other writer (but her son is a very close second). The book is excellent, and is definately worth the cost. If you haven't read any of the Vampire Chronicles, don't start with this one, because the beginning is the best place to start, but the ending is where all the magic comes to an end, and Anne Rice does it so beautifully."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Let me start of by saying this...I have been in love with Anne Rice since my early teens. It all began with Interview with the Vampire. By the second chapter, I was in love. Her words took me to a different universe all to itself. After the first Chronicle book, I couldn't stop. I quickly went through all of the available Chronicle books at the time until I had to wait for The Vampire Armand to be released. While awaiting my beloved Armand, I read her other books...Feast of All Saints and Servant of the Bones to be among my favorites. To end with this brief history of my love affair with Anne Rice is this: Her words bring forth a life all to its own. They are refreshing as they are erotic. She is simply a Goddess.Now on to my review of Blood Canticle...This book was a rather interesting tale. Anne Rice has certainly evolved to another level of writing. I certainly praise it. At the same time, I was intrigued by the fact that Our Beloved Brat Prince has decided he wants to become a saint. How could this be? Of course if you have read Anne Rice's own comments of Lestat you would see the reason why. Lestat's own self is really a base part of us all. He has played this &quot;evil&quot; guy for so long and he wants to be delivered from it. Lestat is inherently good though his actions can and may be deemed (sp) bad. Before you judge the book as a whole, look within yourself and you would realize that Mrs. Rice is shining the light within ourselves. -Thank you."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"There are some extremely harsh reviews here, and I think they are very insulting to Anne Rice. She is right in her response: if you don't like her writing, don't read it. She doesn't owe any of us anything, especially not closure. The Vampire Chronicles, like the rest of her work, belong to her. They are her intellectual property to do with as she sees fit: she can take the story in any direction she wishes, and she can stop writing them all together. Lestat is hers, not ours. I really don't understand the nastiness and anger in so many of these reviews.This is an interesting book. It's a kind of part 2 to Blackwood Farm, which is wonderful, and it continues the blending of the Mayfair Witches and Vampire Chronicles, which is intriguing, illuminating, and fun. I loved it, and I'll surely reread it over the years. I say that if you are buying Blackwood Farm, absolutely buy Blood Canticle with it, no question.We all need to respect authors and their work. We're lucky to have been able to read Anne Rice's stories. I'll consider myself lucky to read more of her stories if she chooses to publish more, and I hope she knows that she is deeply respected and valued by many, many readers."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I am a bit mad at the fact that this is the last chronicle but I really cant believe that, even if she says it is so; she left it all too unfinished.I lived through menoch the devil and I can live through this. . . i hope. Sorry if i have made any of you mad but honestly i dont care!"},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I waited months for this book to come out and after all the yelling I gave to my local Wal-mart for lieing ot me about carrying \\"Blackwood Farm\\" day of relese they made sure they carried this one I even went as far as to email Anne about it either way tho I got this book I loved it sure there are a few things that I was wondering about like why the taltos have this thing about the color white and so on and so forth but I came to one conculsion about it its something for us readers to think about coming into the seris late I came in when Armand and Pandora and Vittoro where released and I love them all theres nothing worng with this book im my mind other than the fact that it was/is the last one of them but over all I am pleased with the way that Anne took the series I am not sure if her new ventures will be of any interest to me but I am willing to give it a try I will be a life long fan off Anne Rice thanks for the good work Anne you will never know how your books helped me when I was in High school"},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I've read the Vampire Chronicles, and now I'm working on the Mayfair series. I would like to say first off, that, those that complain about the lack of a storyline in this book have to look to the other books. The books are based off of the lives of the characters. Therefore, the story line is simply the lives of the characters in it's basic form. While there is more to it I wont go into extreme detail. I do love the Chronicles. I've reread them countless times while I waited to get the next book in the series. I'm not a fan of the movies though. My thoughts on QoTD was while it was a good movie, it wasn't that good as a part of the Chronicles. Getting back to my reason for being here tonight. The storyline of the books continues throughout the series to me. Each next book is a sequel not a new independant book. Some people seem to lose that. While there needs to be new conflicts, the majority of the story is from the last book. I like all the characters. I did wonder what happened to all the characters in the books past. Louis and David main point. I wont go into that now, maybe ever. Anne Rice has created for us a world that is ours to retreat to. Ours to imagine. Anne has been writing for quite a few years. If I remember right the Chronicles were the first or second books that were published. Perhapes she got tired of the characters, and with the passing of her husband she decided to end it. I do not know, and I claim not to know her thoughts on this. I am rather disapointed however, with not Anne, but rather, those that talk bad about her and her writing. She doesn't deserve it. Maybe a little more thoughtfullness on our parts would go far. Anne is a great writer. She's brought us a wonderful series. If you read all the books directly after the other it would be obvious to all that BC was a direct sequel to Blackwood Farm as opposed to the Chronicles themselves. In my opinion anyways. A final thought from me before I leave you to your lives. People should think for themselves, and not rely upon others views to dictate their own. Which is what I think happened. One person said they didn't like it, perhapes without reading it. The person they talked to then told another, so on and so on. I read the Chronicles within a year. And then again I read them. (Yes I do have tons of time on my hands.) Anne's style matured completly as she wrote the Chronicles and her other books. People change as well, and Lestat can and does change alot during these books. Lestat is far too trusting because of his dreams, but without that where would all the fun be had? Again, Anne my praise on a job well done. For this and your future novels I'm sure."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I can't believe that people said that Anne Rice's latest Blood Canticle was \\"rubbish\\"Now, I have read all of the vampire chronicles, the new tales of the vampires, and the Mayfair witches, and I have to say that this is one of her greatest works. Her achievement is continuously mounting! I am so proud of her, the strong woman she is. She continues to take me into a different world, one which I wish existed. Rice is so vivid and historically correct in all of her books; I learn more from them than I did while I was in high school and college combined! I am just glad she writes, I am glad she has devoted most of her life to making sure we have entertainment, and anyone who can do that is worthy of everyone's praises!"},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"\\"Go mourn your dead husband and shut up\\"??? \\"You should have quit writing while you were ahead\\"???What has Anne Rice done to anyone here that would deserve such hateful and venomous scorn? By your own words, several of you have enjoyed the adventures of Lestat for almost two decades. You're disappointed in her final installment and now you want to eviscerate her?I will admit that the writing style suprised me as I began the first chapters of the book. I will also admit that this was not my favorite Vampire Chronicle. But I do not want to lead villagers bearing pitchforks and torches up to her gate so that she can be burned at the stake. The style was different. Not a hanging offense. As I read, I began to enjoy looking for what new human slang Lestat had picked up.I also did not feel that Lestat's desire to be essentially canonized was \\"sudden\\". He's been to Hell. Literally. He has conversed and consorted with THE Satan and seen Heaven. I'd imagine that might precipitate a smidgen of change in an earthbound, once-human creature.I assume that everyone who reviewed the book with such personally-directed vehemence must be perfect beings. Everything they do is enjoyed and liked by everyone. I wouldn't wish the unforgiving, rabid and vicious attacks that many here have heaped upon her on anyone!Much less an author who has given me many hours of pleasurable reading."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I've heard a lot of people say that they hate this book, and frankly, I think they are crazy. Blood Canticle, according to me, is the best book in the Vampire Chronicles. I don't think many words can describe this book. It's just...fantastic. I would recommend this to anyone."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Rice's novels use to hold me captive. I could sit for hours reading her works as if they were made from fine wine (gee I sound like Lestat now). Since MEMNOCH THE DEVIL the Vampire Chronicles have gone down hill. Except for PANDORA and VICTORRIO, the other installments are the same story over and over again. The Armand and Marius based books are the same minus a handful of chapters and both repeating stories already told in THE VAMPIRE LESTAT. Now with this addition we have to go through BLACKWOOD FARM again. And Why do we have to go through the history of Taltos again? I was very disappointed. I loved the WITCHING HOUR. I is my favorite! But now the characters of Rowan and Michael seem so fake so not what they used to be. Sadly this book was a disappointment."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"This is not a good way to end the series. It is a cowardly thing to end just because somebody criticized you. So much has happened since the last book. Ok, This isn't a personal attack but Anne Rice should not just give up because somebody gave her negative feedback. People always get criticized, you put alot into your work and when people insult your work it can feel like they insult you. But you don't just give up, you make more and challenge yourself till you perfect your work. All artists endure this .Think about it? Really, think about that and think of all the artists and authors who endure that? Aside from that this could be perfected and much better, everybody goes through this and does a few bad ones or a series of not as good work. You don't give up! You perfect it and keep working. This book wasn't her best, the storyline wasn't as good, the characters weren't at their best. It just wasn't exciting and if Anne Rice could just keep challenging herself like a good author does, then I think fans could forgive her current meltdown on fans. Which I'm sure she has been through alot of pain. I'm such a huge fan and didn't like the way it ended and the treatment many endured over fanfiction(which should be flattering to an author) and criticism of the reviewers who had an opinion which usually ends with a better book the next time or a challenge all artists and authors endure. Come on! I'm waiting for a new addition... I'll buy it when it comes out. Also take time on it and not worry about how quickly it is made. Something tells me Lestat and The Chronicles aren't over yet..."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I originally purchased Mrs. Rice's latest book when it was first released in hardcover. I read it immediatly and enjoyed it. I have been a fan of Lestat's since I first read The Vampire Lestat, and was glad to see his return. And while I don't particularly care for Mona, I can see how she is essential to the plot of the story and to tying the Chronicles and the Mayfair Witches together. While it is not my favorite of the Chronicles I did like it. I have been reading her work for the last eight years and have never been disappointed. And while I do think that everyone is entitled to his or her own opinion, the manner in which one iterate's that opinion needs to be done tactfully. In other words, name-calling is something to be left on a children's playground, and not in a 'place' of commerece. If you didn't like the book put it down, sell it, whatever and don't keep offending yourself. That's something I fail to understand, why people when they find something that offends them keep subjecting themselves to it. If you don't like, leave it. I have read how many of you didn't like how Mrs. Rice ended her Chronicles. As a writer she has the right to end her own creation however she sees fit. And, as a writer myself, I understand that. Just because she's a best selling author doesn't mean she has to write to please an audience; she has to write what she knows and how she sees. Like I said if you don't like the book don't keep subjecting yourself to it. And while I am sad to see the end of the Chronicles, I see the book as an understandable end. Lestat will be forever; the Chronicles cannot go on for eternity. Lestat was Lestat before we came to know and watch him, and he'll be Lestat long after we are gone. 'Canticle' gives as much closure to an immortal life that is possible. I believe that it isn't designed to make us think that that's the end of Lestat; but to make us see that he's immortal, that he will keep going; we just don't get to follow along anymore. A wonderful book, full of Mrs. Rice's execptional talent with words and story weaving."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I love the Vampire Chronicles. I love Anne Rice. I love Lestat and Louis and Marius and Armand and Daniel and even Gabrielle, though you don't typically see much of her. These are some very simple maxims.So, why don't they apply here?Well, because none of the things I loved were present in the Blood Canticle. No Louis, Amrmand, Marius, Daniel, David, or even Gabrielle.And, though I'm ashamed and sad to say it, Anne Rice wasn't even there.I am sorry to see Stan Rice go. He was a talented and wonderful man that will be missed worldwide. I can't even begin to comprehend how Anne feels right now, and I don't think I would even be able to endure that pain as well as she does.However, the Blood Canticle is a disgrace. It was poorly constructed, written, and edited. It hearkens back to all the old fanfiction I see so often created. In fact, I believe I've read at least a dozen fanfics that stay truer to the characters and to the beautiful style with which the old Anne wrote.Lestat does not say 'yo', and if he did he would put class and beauty into it. It would be ironic and funny. But when Lestat says 'little bro' as he did in the Blood Canticle, there was no taste or elegance.Description lacked severly, and the dialoge held no wonder or poetry.I'm sorry Stan died. But that is no excuse for shoveling out this 'novel' without a second glance.This is no grand finale."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"This book is the worst effort by Anne Rice. It feels like she phoned it in. I always hoped that she would merge the Vampire Chronicles with the Mayfair Saga. This is a sore disappointment. Lestat's quest for sainthood and his sudden passion for Rowan Mayfair are so far fetched it is almost funny. I will sincerely think twice before picking up another of Ms. Rice's books. Perhaps her genius departed with the unfortunate passing of Stan Rice. Maybe her stories could be more foreceful if she concentrated on one book per year like most other writers instead of cranking out two per year as has been the case lately. If you are contemplating reading this book, don't bother, save your time. This is the flop to end all flops."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Perhaps it is time for Anne to leave the vampires and move on to new subjects. I have enjoyed some of Anne's previous novels that had nothing to do with Vampires, particularly \\"A Cry to Heaven\\". Sometimes a writer just wears out a subject and I think Anne may have reached that point.I vacillated between giving this 3 or 4 stars and settled on 4 just because it's Anne, because she lost Stan, and because I'd like to see her continue to write and hopefully produce novels like she used to.The things that are right with the novel are many. Anne still can make you see what's happening with her prose. When I read this I can see New Orleans, I can see that graveyard and swamp behind the house, I'm there. She does try and bring many (but not all) of the threads from both the vampire chronicles and the Mayfair Witches to a conclusion. A nice gesture if you're really going to leave the subject. I did notice though that there is ample opportunity to write another one (or many) novels with the introduction of Lestat and Rowen's love. I felt Lestat blasting us about not liking previous works and telling us that he wants to be a saint is quite OK. That's Lestat!The thing that did annoy me with this novel the most was Anne/Lestat's \\"new\\" narrative style. I suppose that it's supposed to be new and edgy and as one reader suggested Lestat is allowed to change, including his narrative style, but I miss the prose that I just gushed about in the proceeding paragraph. The \\"Pope is wonderful\\" rant was a little off-putting since I would think that Lestat would think himself above such matters, but you must remember he is a French Catholic. I must admit that after the first book on the Mayfair Witches they have not been my favorite subject that Anne has written about. And I guess I've always been a little irritated that she combined the Witches with the Vampires.Yes, I'll read Anne's next book if it's about Vampires or about turnips. I have been disappointed in some of her efforts and enthralled by others. She's human (even if her alter ego isn't) and she's going to have good, bad and mediocre efforts. I won't give up because of a couple of stinkers.My star ratings:One star - couldn't finish the bookTwo stars - read the book, but did a lot of skipping or scanning. Wouldn't add the book to my permanent collection or search out other books by the authorThree stars - enjoyable read. Wouldn't add the book to my permanent collection. Would judge other books by the author individually.Four stars - Liked the book. Would keep the book or would look for others by the same author.Five start - One of my all time favorites. Will get a copy in hardback to keep and will actively search out others by the same author."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Anne Rice's husband was diagnosed with a brain tumor when this book was being written and obviously, her work suffered because of it. The book is a threadbare cloth compared to the rich tapestry of detail characteristic of most of the Vampire Chronicles and the Mayfair Witches Series. In spite the this and curious and constant use of \`yo' and \`dude', it was a decent read up until the last chapter, but then things went really wrong. Anyone familiar with The Mayfair Witches Series (The Witching Hour, Lasher &amp; Taltos) should skip skipping the last chapter of Blood Canticle because although you get the point, you will never believe it.However, the most disappointing aspect of the novel is the missed opportunity. Three characters, Michael Curry and Rowan and Mona Mayfair are struggling with the loss of their children. As a mother who tragically lost a child to leukemia, Anne Rice could have really written something truly significant, but did not. Much is said about the toll on the characters, but very little insight is given about their internal conflicts.Sadly, Anne Rice has said is through with the Vampires and the Mayfair Witches. Hopefully, as time passes, she will change her mind and write an ending worthy of her two best loved series."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"This book is the worst of all the serie. And these are supposed to be vampires? Vampires who don't dare to kill?Louis was so special in the first books because he was like a coward lion who didn't dare killing humans... now Lestat ended being worse than him!Rowan's affair with him is not believable and so forced. The only good thing in this book were Quinn and Mona, she was the one telling exactly the things I had in my mind while reading, yet Lestat insulted her and behaved like a teenager in love insted of the ancient vampire he's supposed to be.While reading Lestat talking about the church, the pope and even giving us a biography of a saint, I never believed it was him... instead I kept listening Anne's voice there. It was not him but her.Also, it's full of secondary characters that show up once and then vanish from the story after we were given a full introduction to each and every one of them... there's too much description of non-meaningful things...It took me two months to end this book. In the middle, I finished Shakespeare's Julius Caesar and Shelley's Frankenstein.I guess that speaks for itself.I really hate this review, because Anne was one of my fave modern authors, but I must go with the rest, the last books are terrible... it makes me sad... what's worse... we'll never get an ending to this serie... after so many books, we'll never know how it ends...*sighs missing Armand and the old good times*"},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I am sorry to say that this book realy does not live up to the previous books in this series.

Lil Bro?!!!!!!!!!!!!How about &quot;Kill Me&quot;? How about &quot;I want a refund&quot;?Anne Rice has ruined everything she has done with \\"Blood Canticle\\". She has become a soulless machine that churns out garbage. There is nothing wrong with success and if someone offered me that much money, I would sign on the dotted line. But how about a book every 2 years? How about this, if you don't have anything new to bring to the series, then don't write. Get an original idea, take a break, take a vacation, take a pill... do anything but write tripe like this.She has destroyed her career and alienated her fans. She has become a parody of herself. And what's even more tragic, she thinks she has relevance. She thinks that what she has to write about is valued and worthy of a reader investing his time and 28.00 bucks. Deluded is best way to describe her. Even better, she has become a legend in her own mind. I suggest we stop buying her &quot;work&quot;.

Even if you don't like something you should still have respect for it. A talented writer such as Anne who has been giving us wonderful books since I was in diapers deserves a little respect...don't you think? And when she actually stands up for herself everyone just freaks out. Amazing, it's like you think that only you have the right to speak your mind. If someone was trash talking something I had written or created I would be irritated too and want to explain myself. I just think she deserves respect. I CANNOT stress that enough. Even if I had hated the book I wouldn't spend my time trash talking it on here. I would use that energy and go write a good review on a book I did like. Or even just saying, hey I didn't like it...but to sit there and literally rip this womans amazing writing to shreds? Well you people have way too much time on your hands.

My favorite of the chronicles was \\"Memnoch the Devil\\" I know that some readers didn't enjoy the somewhat deeper theological subject matter. However I thought it was one of her best works, because of it's intricate detail and interesting religious perspective. I liked that Lestat becomes somewhat enlightened and confused at the same time, which when dealing with religious enlightenment is,I believe the way many people feel.\\"Blood Canticle\\", in my opinion was another great read. I thought the characters were all wonderfully written and the story of the mingling vampire and witch families still very intriguing. Again Anne Rice pulled me in and filled my imagination with vivid haunting imagery of the mysterious blackwood farm and the eccentric Lestat\`s dark internal human struggles clashing with his simplistic animal nature. I hope to continue to be thrilled and intrigued by her future works, wherever they may take us."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I agree, Blood Canticle was one of her lesser novels -- BUT how would you feel if someone criticised so harshly your life's work?As a fellow writer, I can only sympathize. If you didn't like the novel, then say so, but let's not be unkind. And if you did like the novel, well good for you!My take on Blood Canticle was it was a wrap up. It felt from the moment I opened its pages like a conclusion. I hadn't learned yet that there would be no more vampire novels, but I knew when I began to read that this book would be Lestat's last adventure.Anne Rice set out to make the world love Lestat, and she suceeded. If you didn't love him in Blood Cantilce, you loved him at some point. Come on, admit it!I've loved Lestat for years and will probably continue to every time I pop in my Interview with a Vampire DVD.But in short, take my man's advice and borrow the book from the library first. You may or may not enjoy the ending of the Vampire Chronicles."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"&quot;The Vampire Lestat&quot; was the masterpiece. If you want to compare this book with other Rice books, it's probably not the best. That said, I've tried to read other authors while I was eagerly awaiting the next Rice book, and I've yet to find one that satisfies. Rice includes just enough background info to support new readers as well as those who may have forgotten details from the previous novels. Her descriptions are rich, which is part of the escape that she provides. Lestat was modeled after Rice's husband, and with his recent passing Rice has said that this will be the last novel written in Lestat's voice. I thoroughly enjoyed it."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Many people have different opinions on this book. Some completely hate it, while others completely love it. They continue to rant on and on, for whichever side they're on.The truth of the matter is that this book still has the excellent writing that Anne has always had. It's written wonderfully, and the 'plot', if you'd like to call it, is just as good as any others in the Vampire Chronicles. It's a wonderful book not only for her excellent writing, but because it combines The Mayfair Witches with the Vampire Chronicles, as in Blackwood Farm. Devote fans of Anne should be pleased that the two series have been combined, in a way. Any avid reader of the Vampire Chronicles -should- be pleased with this book, as it finalizes many things that have been in past books.(...)"},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Now before all you twi-hards attack me for my title let me explain.I truly loved this book. I have read all the chronicles (particularly loved Pandora, the construction of the setting and ambiance of that book was really mesmerizing, as was the female protagonist). However I digress. Blood Canticle offers for Rice fans the ability to see in motion the culmination of years of hard work in defining a genre, in constructing timeless characters, and challenging readers to understand those characters in different ways. This book is heavy on the last point. I enjoyed seeing Lestat change and develop from being so consumed by vanity, to questioning himself, and then to fall again, and again. His struggle between these two points was always entertaining to watch, even more so when we relate it to the changing motions of the vampire world Anne Rice created. What each book gives us is the changes in decades, which some of the reviewers have commented on. To construct all this, and then to bring into it characters from other supernatural worlds which Rice has created, and have it even be as remotely as good as this, as thralling as this, is an achievement unto itself. Now to my point. Read this book and the series it belongs to, understand what it did for the vampire in literature; for those purists you must admit that Rice had an impact in resurrecting (o yes the puns!) this ancient creature so many of us have been in love with. She created the vampire with a soul, the vampire with no remorse, the source of all Vampires and the changing faces of these characters reflect even more than what Im saying here. Blood Canticle will shock you if you start from the beginning to end without really considering the characters in transition; but for someone who looks for that transition in Rice's books I was more than satisfied.Ultimately my point is where is this ancient creature now? The reviews here talk about editing, the technicalities of Rice's writing and prose. You ask such high standards when books such as the Twilight series, which have done nothing for the vampire genre other than popularize it to a rather literature-deprived generation, are being held up on a pedestal saying this is art! I wont get into how technically messy Twilight is, Im sure there are plenty of websites to educate you on this, but my point in comparison is this: what did the most for the character of the vampire? This book is not perfection. You want to blast Anne Rice, do so, even though your voice will be little in comparison to her presence in time as far as the creature of the vampire is concerned. But I for one will not let this book, not the best, but a much better understanding of true character development and mythology, be held down, while true failings are exalted on no real merit at all. It disappoints me as a reader that so many people who have dedicated their time and effort to this series, just don't get it yet! These characters embody so many changes, the very transition of which is the point of Rice's books! And yes you still expected Lestat to play the same tune, and dance the same dance. I wouldn't have had it end any other way than it did.And if you are a twilight fan, Im sorry I didnt jump on the same boat as you did, but honestly pick up another book to read. Please? this one's a good one to end on (you probably know where to start if you only vaguely know Anne Rice and were around for the 90's).Anyways thats my two cents :) let the feathers fly!Seema"},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"This, was Rice's second-best book. Once again, Rice continues to expand her characters, and shows yet another dimension to them. And, just as people evolve with time, Lestat evolves as well, without truly changing who he is.If you haven't read this book, you should read it. If you have read it, and you didn't like it, you didn't understand it. Mature a little bit, and then read it again."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"If you love the witches and love the vampires - this book is for you.

You do lots of research; you proceed very carefully, making sure each sentence is as great as it could be. You are careful with detail. You take the time to craft that work.OK, you know how sometimes you type a careless e-mail to your friend about your day? Or maybe you're writing in your diary. You don't really care to take the time to be too careful with the imagery or diction. You just write it down for posterity. You just let things flow out.Well, Anne seems to have abandoned the first method for the second. At first I thought it was me. It started with \\"Memnoch the Devil.\\" I just couldn't get into it. With the first four novels of the Vampire Chronicles, I felt as if a whole entire world was popping up around me. A lush and ornate world that was full of grandeur -- details about places in Europe or New Orleans, the texture of the curtains, the ambience of the room, the sound of violins, the ferns. It was all very decadent and, quite frankly, amazing. She created this undescribable feeling that no one else could.Then something went wrong. After she began releasing more books, I realized that it wasn't just me. Maybe Anne was getting sloppy? Maybe she just couldn't sustain her interest in this genre after so many years? Her latest works seem to be written in the same manner that many write in their journals or e-mails. The sense of carefulness, of passion, is gone; it's no longer about the nuances. The subtley is gone. Now it's more like: \\"This happened . . . then this . . . and oh, don't forget about this.\\" There's a stream-of-consciousness quality going on that comes from a lack of precision. Either she didn't outline this current novel, \\"Blood Canticle,\\" at all or it was outlined poorly. I understand Lestat's language will change as time goes on. But \\"yo\\"? \\"Baby\\"? Does he have to sound like a sleazy Hollywood agent? Anne has failed to help readers make that transition; you can't have Lestat speak eloquently and formally in one novel and change his speech so abruptly without having some readers raise objections. His language clearly demonstrates Anne's lack of understanding of how people talk today; instead, she uses language that she thinks people still use today. This is comparable to Kate Beckinsale's \\"Romanian\\" accent in \\"Van Helsing\\"; she used an accent she thinks Romanians use.Let me say that I am a huge Anne Rice fan. I think \\"Interview with the Vampire,\\" \\"The Vampire Lestat,\\" \\"The Queen of the Damned,\\" \\"Tale of the Body Thief,\\" \\"The Witching Hour,\\" \\"Lasher,\\" \\"The Mummy,\\" and \\"Cry to Heaven,\\" were brilliant. And even though I did not love \\"Feast of All Saints,\\" I still thought the details were mesmerizing. Anne had that \\"it\\" factor going on; she cast magic with her books. She had the ability to transport the reader to any place she wanted, to bring people and worlds alive.She's been rather prolific in recent years. Personally, I think Anne should take a break. Stop writing a book or more per year. Find that passion again. Take the time to write something really amazing. I truly believe that she spent more time writing her older works than her newer ones. In spite of the negative reviews of her recent work, she should take pride in the fact that she has other books to be proud of; that many of her previous works have changed people's lives; and that she has left a legacy that many will appreciate in the future. If she doesn't have the passion, she should know it is OK to stop writing for a while and bask in the success she's had with previous novels. After all, even the best writers have written books or stories that have fallen into obscurity because they didn't measure up to their most famous works."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I love this book because I love Lestat too much not to rejoice at the prospect of him finally getting where he was always going. I sympathize with those who long for the brat prince of old, but the series was always largely centered on the quest for meaning and redemption and Blood Canticle concludes this quest beautifully. It would simply be out of character for Lestat, with his vigorous lust for life and dynamic personality, to arbitrarily regress to his old ways. He's a different vampire with every book -- with every chapter of every book even! It's the very fact that he grows that makes me love him so much! He makes innumerable mistakes in his multi-century long existence, but he learns from all of them. The ending of Blood Canticle was a deeply moving culmination of all of his hard-learned lessons and it reduced me to tears of joy. No one who ever really loved Lestat could ask for more."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"As an end to the Vampire Chronicles and the Mayfair Witches, this book does both of those series an immense disservice, as it is not a fitting end for either.Ash and Morrigan, the Taltos, should have been left alone if their fate was the best Rice could come up with. While the message Rice is sending there is obvious, it's muddled by the presence of the drug lords, and would have been much clearer and direct if left to the Taltos alone. As for the Mayfairs... Rowan's every action seems forced against her previously established character, and Michael is reduced to her accessory.Over on the Vampire side, Rice mercifully does ignore most of the pantheon of characters she has developed there. Louis, Pandora, Gabrielle, Marius, and almost all the others are allowed to drift away without acknowledgement, a blessing based on the way everyone else is handled. Maharet and Kayman make cameos without really appearing, which is probably also a blessing. As for the rest, Quin, like Michael, is Mona's accessory. Mona is spoiled and insolent, and if you hated reading what had become of her in &quot;Blackwood Farm&quot;, you'll really hate what she becomes here.Lestat, well, he's Anne Rice, not himself. He fully ceases to be his own character and instead becomes his author's mouthpiece, prone to rants and tantrums based on whether or not people like him.As the conclusion to both series, this could have been an epic, but instead it's more of a travesty."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"If I want to read \\"literature\\" where the protagonist uses words like \\"cool,\\" \\"babycakes\\" and \\"pah-leeeze,\\" I'll get into an online argument with a teenaged troll.Anne Rice, you were an amazing writer-- your works were full of beautiful, inspiring prose and muted meditation. Some called it turgid, though others like myself loved it. I bet even those critics are eating their words now. It's like you went from one extreme to another.Doubtless I'll get the trolls coming out of the woodwork with their cries of \\"OH Noes!11! You didn't just diss Teh Greatest Writer Evah!!!1!\\" and the rather mundane and predictable \\"OMG let's see u rite 25 bezt sellaz!!1\\"I don't need to be a farmer to know that pig swill is rubbish; likewise I don't need to be James Joyce to know that five exclamation marks and an undead 18th century French libertine trying to get down with da kidz through L337-speak is never going to be \\"Ulysses.\\"I'll keep hold of the books from \\"Interview With the Vampire\\" to \\"Tale of the Body Thief.\\" They're classics; they're sharp, well-written with great characterisation. If you're looking for quality writing by Anne Rice, try those books. If you've come here to tell people that they're wrong for daring not to like a book, or to roll out the \\"write 25 books\\" line, nothing will persuade you otherwise.Adieu, Lestat. It was fun while it lasted.Also, \\"Lestat\\" didn't write it. Apart from Lestat being a (hugely enjoyable) fictional character, he has been used as a sock puppet by Rice to berate people who recognised Memnoch the Devil to be an insulting rip-off of finer theological works."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I remember when I was first introduced to the wonderful, deeply lyrical and darkly enchanting world of the vampire chronicles for the first time by reading 'Interview with the Vampire'. How I was moved by 'The vampire Lestat', drawn into 'Queen of the Damned' and 'Tale of the Body Thief'. Then I remember how I gradually started to lose interest in these once so colorful, wickedly beautiful characters in 'Memnoch' which took me ages to finish, because it was just, so, very, boring. After that, reading the vampire chronicles became nearly painful, the stories grew more and more colourless, and Rice just kept repeating herself. Blood and Gold was slightly more interesting than the rest, but my hopes were crushed by the lousy 'Blackwood Farm'.Now, I'm the type of person that can't start a series without finishing it, unfortunately, because the characters I once loved have turned into something grotesquely boring and idiotic.My reading the rest of the chronicles made anything better, it feels as if Anne is just writing new books, losing inspiration, forgetting past stories, and how thoose characters FELT in the first place, just to make more money out of her name.So, let me put it in a way that no one can misinterpret. Blood Canticle sucks. I hated it. It's amateurish, bleak and even though all it's overdramatics never delves deeper into any of the people or incidents. And what's with the way Lestat is speaking? I cringed when I read his ghettotalk. And his ramblings about being a saint, his extreme LOVE for christianity. This change from how he was is poorly done, and hardly believable. I didn't think it could get worse than 'Blackwood Farm' really, which annoyed me beyond reason, with all it's sad oh-so-beautifully-tragic people, the overdramatic yet pointless rants etc. But Blood Canticle somehow manages to be worse.Anyone, who like me, fell in love with the first Vampire Chronicles, spare yourself from this! As a matter of fact, don't read the latter Vampire Chronicles, they're basically just boring, and repetetive crap. I won't force anyone, it's hardly possible, and everyone's free to read it and see or themselves what a piece of junk it is. But if you want to keep the image you have of the characters and Rice's style, don't even go near 'Blackwood Farm'.So, now, I will go and sit down with my copy of Interview with the Vampire, and enjoy the Vampire Chronicles when they were worth reading,(because they certainly arent after the 4th book), and try to push this horrid piece of literature in the darkest corners of my mind, where it will hopefully lie until being forgotten."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"What can I say about this book that hasn't already been said by other reviewers? This has to be the worst book Rice has written, and it took an act of will for me to finish it. Rice has said that this is the last of her Vampire Chronicles. I only hope she keeps her word.So why is this book so bad? First of all, the story is thin. Newly made vamp Mona Mayfair (who spends most of the book acting out) wants to find out what happened to her Taltos child. Ok, interestng premise. Could have made for a good story. Mayfair family dynamics come into play--Mona's daughter was fathered by Rowan's husband Michael and Mona's mad at Rowan. Could have been interesting. Oncle Julien haunts Lestat because he's mad that Mona has been vamped. Interesting idea. There are other glimmers of a plot that could work, but mostly they get a superficial, breakneck treatment that reads more like the outline of a longer, more developed novel.However, my major complaint about \\"Blood Canticle\\" (and much of Rice's recent work) is her treatment of her characters. In her earlier works, they were better fleshed out and more complex. In other words, they were believable, and from book to book Rice maintained their integrity. In recent books, however, she's turned them into one dimensional cartoon characters that bear only a superficial resemblance to what they used to be. She manipulates them like puppets to suit her whims--disposing of them off-handedly when it suits her fancy (poor Ash, poor Morrigan, poor Merrick--oops, wrong book). Her characters have lost any psychological reality they originally had. For instance, Mona's just an spoiled, immature brat; Rowan's a controlling Mad Scientist who wants to leave her husband for Lestat; and Quinn (Rice's best developed recent character) is so bland he fades into the woodwork. Even Oncle Julien becomes a incompetent ghostly meddler who can't get anything right. As for Lestat, now he's a do-gooder who wants to become a saint. You know the book is in trouble when it begins with Rice using Lestat's voice to whine about how \\"Memnoch the Devil\\" was misunderstood. Much of the Vampire Chronicles has been about Lestat's moral evolution, but please, give the vamp his fangs back!Part of the problem here is that Rice has written some very good books that conveyed a real sense of the uneartly. \\"Blackwood Farm,\\" Rice's most recent book before this one, was downright creepy and spooky in spots. Even \\"Merrick\\" had an eerie atmosphere to it. \\"Blood Canticle\\" suffers in comparison and does justice to neither of her major series. Both deserved a better sendoff.Vampires & Mayfairs alike, may you rest in peace and be subjected to no further indignities."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"If Anne Rice herself is glad that the series is finished, it only goes to prove how tired the whole lot of books has become.She claims she doesn't need editing. Even Hemingway had an editor. If she weren't such an egomaniac, which is obvious from her rant, Rice would have established an ongoing relationship with an editor that she trusted.She says that she doesn't want to hear someone else's voice blended in with Pavarotti's or Horne's. But if she were at all educated about the opera world, she would know that even the greatest opera singers continue to have teachers help them to hone their craft. Rice believes that she is such a genius that she doesn't need instruction or editing. Well, the continued decline in the literary quality of her books speaks otherwise.This book is truly awful. If she hadn't already had so many books published, no reputable publishing house would have touched it.And no, I have nothing personal against Ms. Rice. I wish her the best. (And I wish she would get an editor rather than rail against the people who actually read her books and see the desperate need for one.)"},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"This was the most bizarre book I've ever read and I grew up reading R. L. Stine and Stephen King.Anne Rice always liked to depict her vampire characters as gods. They had powers beyond tradition and a physical comeliness that would melt any human heart. I wonder if Anne Rice was writing these stories to entertain the public or herself? I always sensed a bit of selfishness on part of Anne when it came to her characters. Perhaps that is why she doesn't allow fanfiction of her characters?Anyway, as the series progressed, the characters seemed to get more and more beautiful and superstrong. Before long, they had more in common with Dragon Ball Z characters than vampire folklore! A major turn-off for me. The only superpowers the vampires lacked were the abilities to shoot laser beams out of their eyes and say \\"Kamehameha!\\"I think the worst part of Blood Canticle was the point of view and the language chosen to illustrate the novel. It made me cringe and whimper for Emile Zola and, in general, GOOD writers with wondrous stories to tell.As I am an athiest, I also didn't like getting bashed in the head with the persistent god chitchat and Pope worship. If I wanted to be converted to Catholicism, I would turn on the TV and listen to the rambling of some televangelist. But of course, this reason for disliking the novel is purely personal.My third complaint is Anne Rice's ugly usage of the breaking the fourth wall literary technique. Terrible and irritating in its bluntness.When I read, I want to fall into another world, a magical world of words that I can only be pried from once the book is at its end. I don't want to be harrassed or addressed by Lestat(Anne) as incompetant because I don't believe what she does. How foolish, how juvenile.Last, but not least on my list of complaints, is the destruction of the character Lestat. Not for one moment did I feel as if I was seeing through Lestat's eyes. Rather, I felt like I was witnessing Anne Rice's deepest twisted religious dream. Lestat became Anne Rice's ultimate author surrogate.The silliest part of the book was Lestat(Anne)'s visit to Pope John Paul II:\\"I lay my hands upon him(the Pope), and I banish his suffering. A quiet penetrates his limbs. He looks at me with one eye, the other squinched closed as is often his manner, and between us there is suddenly an understanding...\\"Yes, it is sad that the Chronicles are over but only because we will never find out what happened to the other characters, as the majority were not mentioned in this book. Overlooking a few cringe-worthy passages, I found Blackwood Farm to be a decent novel. I read many of Anne's books in English and in Hungarian. I liked Anne Rice. I don't any more. I'm sorry I have to write this but I am compelled to get this out of my system once and for all.We must move on. Let's take out a different book and open ourselves to a new world, another adventure, and leave this sinking ship to be swallowed by the waves."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"The vampires were a metaphor for human struggle, emotion and questioning.

Tell me the angst is still there and I'll be forced to ask you to define angst because then I'd think youwouldn't know the meaning of the word.Don't you see, you make Lestat absolutely sure, and you make sexism okay, he says religion and state should not be separated (can we say Taliban?) yet in the old books Lestat had repeatedly said that it would be great if no one has to diein the name of God and then tell people that maturing means you stop questioning the world around them, now THAT is a bad example. That is not maturing, it's giving up. It takes away some of the humanness of the character that nowhe's certain what the fabric of the universe is made of. It makes the books superficial if there's nothing left to doubt or question. Because being human is to struggle and question, it's no certainty, it's not blind faith. It's life, it's questions, it's facing contradictions and corruption.But now Lestat has lost faith in the goodness of humanity, that secular innocence that he went on about in The Vampire Lestat novel that drew me in. To stop rebelling isn't maturing, it's surrendering. To be maturedoes not mean to give up. You can be very mature and still question the world around you and not denounce others for being provocative when you're A WALKING CORPSE THAT FEED'S ON BLOOD!!!!!This book makes me sick to my stomach when pitted against ANY other vampire chronicle because it's simply not Lestat. If you recall that Blackwood Farm takes place a night before it, he's literally changed this drasticallyover night.You can call this change but Anne Rice should be ashamed of herself in calling it maturing. Don't spit in my face and call it rain.I didn't love the blond hair or the fangs. I loved the personality and now it's not there. There's no trace of him. Yes, people change over time but fundamentally who you are deep down inside, the person you're meant to be, that never goes way. To quote Lestat himself, \\"We never change, we just become more of who we're meant to be.\\" And this creature in Blood Canticle is not apparent in any novel before it. Lestat was a part of Anne Rice, a reflection of Stan Rice. And if that part wasn't there anymore she simply should not have used the name. If that part of herself has been changed or replaced she should have used a new character to express these views instead of going 180 on a James Dean type of character and turn him into George W. Bush.I never felt this passionately about disliking a book in my life. And I THOUGHT I disliked Memnoch the Devil. I could not hate this book so much if I did not love The Vampire Lestat with all of my heart and still do. If I had nothing to pit it against I would say it's just a Catholic right wingpropaganda book and think nothing of it because there are dozens upon dozens of books like that. But if you stand it against The Vampire Lestat and then say this is the same character but he's 'maturing' that concept of maturity scares the Hell out of me. And I'm an adult. If I ever mature like that I want someone to put a gun to my head and pull the trigger, please..."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Allow me, please, to set aside for the moment all the controversy this book as engendered, and point out something I think y'all might have missed.For years now, Rice has been flirting with the idea of her vampires meeting up with modern science. If you've read the books, you know this. Now, with \\"BC\\", she's finally run Lestat up against someone with the education and background to make that a reality: her character Rowan Mayfair, M.D., founder of Mayfair Medical, an institution, we are led to believe, to rival the Mayo Clinic. I read with avid interest to see how she'd finally deal with the question. Answer: she doesn't. How does she manage to avoid it? Because Rowan's (SPOILER!) in luuuve with Lestat! She's in luuuve, and therefore her brains, her experience, her training, her medical genius, her bloody Hipocratic oath, all fly out the window. She's in luuuve, and so this medical prodigy becomes a big, blubbering crybaby.Well, that's insulting. It's insulting to any woman with any intelligence whatsoever, particularly those working in the (still) male-dominated medical field. And it's insulting to her readers who can spot a dodge when they see one.But by that as it may. *I* found it funny.Here's what I think. Rice ended the series as she did, because otherwise, how long could it be before Rowan wakes up, dries up, remembers her Hipocratic oath and all her training and decides to jam a hypodermic into her date? Runs a chromatographic scan on that vampiric blood and finds...what? Anne? Anne? Anne?The series ended because AR, after all these years, still has NO IDEA what such a scan might reveal. Figuring out what it might reveal would mean asking for help, and, as her statements regarding editors show, Ms. Rice has a problem with that. It would mean surrendering to the world of reality, to science, to the rejection of Arguments of Authority and to the tyranny of numbers. Anne doesn't like numbers. She's said so.Ah, well, as Barbie (TM) once whined, \\"Math is hard!\\"So farewell, Anne Rice. Good luck with that next, non-vampiric novel. Waiting to see the sales on that one.(Of course, there's always this possibility: That Lestat already KNOWS what such a scan would reveal, and THAT is why, despite his great love for Rowan Mayfair, M.D., he's holding back. He knows, and the news ain't good, for him or for any vampire. Just a thought.)[...]"},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"It's sad how life works out some times - Anne Rice has written some of the most wonderful books ever, & for that I am very gratful to have been able to have read them. I loved those early Vampire books so much, they came to play an important part of my life & then...times change, people change & while some things (like the 'song')remain the same - it has come to this, I went into some kind of *shock* after reading the 1st couple of pages of this lastest novel, & then it hit me like a 10 ton brick - this is RUBBISH! this is CRAP! what the hell IS this!? why?! why?! why?!I could go on, but what's the point? Anne is her own person, a brilliant author, a strong, kind-hearted, caring, sharing person who has given everything to her readership over the years. I wish her all the best, & I DO still love her, but not this book - and for the record, I thought Memnoch The Devil as one of the greatest writing examples of all time.Oh well, 1st David Sylvian makes 'Blemish', one of the most worse albums EVER & now this book...don't rely on 'heroes', kids - be your own!"},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"(I'd give it 1.5 if I could)I could barely start this book. The language was completely erratic, and didn't seem to me to be Lestat. Yeah, yeah, characters evolve, blah blah blah. But it was so inconsistant! He uses &quot;Yo&quot; and &quot;Dude&quot; as well as &quot;thee.&quot; And yes, he does say &quot;yo&quot; despite a review that claimed otherwise.Mona is incessantly whining and wishy-washy. &quot;I'm not talking to you. I hate you&quot; in one breath and &quot;I love you, don't leave me&quot; in another. It became ridiculous.Despite problems such as those, there were intriguing moments in the book. A few chapters flowed well and I couldn't put them down. Unfortunately, that was not a trend throughout the work.And I don't know about you guys, but I am sick of Anne using Capital Letters for everything. I'm expecting one of her creations to say, &quot;Excuse me, I have to go to the Restroom to facilitate a Bowel Movement.&quot; It is absolutely asenine. And it started getting that way back in Memnoch.If you want to get into the Vampire Chronicles, read #1-3. Some of the more independent ones such as Pandora and Blood and Gold were also good reads. Stick to the first three for the Lestat saga. They are easily the best.I don't know much about the Mayfair witches, but I didn't find this ending all that satisfying, especially if it's supposed to be the hast hurrah. Then again, I am not looking forward to seeing the Dude Lestat in another novel. Sad, because he was such a great character.Oh, and you'll get sick of the phrase &quot;looks like an angel and talks like a gangster.&quot; Trust me.Yo."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I've been a Vampire Chronicle lover since I read The Vampire Lestat and have followed closely every single new Vampire Chronicles. I don't usually buy hardcover, but in my eagerness to read, I even bought the hardcover version, as soon as it's release; However, I must say that I'm really disappointed in the two latest chronicles, Blackwood Farm and Blood Canticle.I am no language professor or writer. I don't read to analyze/dissect the novel or anything like that. I read just for pleasure. I don't care if there's inconsistencies or some other small problems or strangeness in the novel. I only look to be able to share and enjoy the adventures with the heroes; to be drawn into the story. However, I feel alienated from the heroes. They seemed so aloof. There seemed to be no real passion in the story. I don't understand what's missing. I so terribly want to enjoy and like the books."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Anne Rice, ever since I was in my preteen era I had been reading your literature. Not your witch novels, they never interested me and I didn't feel they held the true power as the novels I did follow, which was the captivating and in- depth Vampire Chronicles. I have read all your vampiric novels and I grew to love most of them. Here is a short review of them all:Interview with the Vampire- Just as fascinating and pondering as the movie itself was.The Vampire Lestat- Even better, the characters kept getting strong and so did your whole plot of the vampires.Queen of the Damned- The movie was a disgrace, but the book was amazingly creative and I loved it.Tale of the Body Thief- One of my most favs, the plot kept me turning the pages. One of your best.Memnoch- Things were a little weird in this story I'm sorry to say. I'm not religious and so this reading was uncomfortable, and I felt I was growing detached from you already there.Pandora- Lovely, like she herself, but dulls in comparison to the others characters cause she herself was never as strong as the male characters story- wise. I liked it though.The Vampire Armand- I found this story to be very emotional and in- depth. The troubled relationship between Marius and Armand I never knew, and they kept me turning the pages. Armand is my fav character besides Louis, so I was happy you gave Armand his story.Merrick- I couldn't finish this story. It was drop dead boring. I don't see why Anne you added your witches with the vampires. What was the point? Honestly I could care less about this Merrick woman. I didn't like your witches and now they invaded the vampires land? Not a good move to me Anne.Blood and Gold- After reading about how Marius raised Armand, I have grown to be cold to him, but his story was almost as interesting. I liked the story, and the reunion between Pandora and Marius was a very powerful point in the Chronicles. I was hoping your Chronicles were picking up again.Blackwood Farm- This is where it all went downhill for me Anne. The Merrick horror came back. Quinn was a flat character and he seemed throughout the book a weak and sexually confused person. The story was weak and bored me almost to tears. It was hard to finish this book, this was not the Vampire Chronicles I remembered. I was hoping for a brighter tomorrow.Blood Canticle- Then I heard you were making one last book...Blood Canticle. I was so excited, hoping you were going to go out with an explosion of the old power you used to have. Then I read it. And all I can say was that, like many other reviewers Anne, I was severely disappointed. You ended the Chronicles I felt in the worse way. For one thing it seemed you merely wanted Lestat's ending- didn't you care about the other vampires anymore? I wanted to know what happened to the others, was it so hard for you to at least write one chapter on their last reunion? I think one thing we fans wanted was to see our vampires one last time. Lestat may have been your favorite, but he wasn't everyones, and we wanted to see our fav vampires one last time. You failed to do that and I felt that was cold of you.And you must have felt your new vampires, Quinn and Mona would satisfy our old vampires need. I don't think so. Quinn was still oh so flat in this story and Mona was just a whiny snot to me I was annoyed with her the beginning you introduced her. She was no strong female like Pandora. Quinn and Mona were two very dull and annoying characters.The writing itself was rushed and instead of writing on vampires, which it should been about, all of a sudden we are worried about a witch problem. Let them fix their own problems in their own series, don't bother the vampire world with the witch's problems I could have cared less. The plot and the writing were boring so throughout the whole story, although I was trying so hard to be hooked, I was detached and bitter.Lestat himself was the overall problem. How boring he has grown, and how silly he sounds throughout most of the novel. He no longer is charming, nor fun to read. He hasn't grown mature, even Marius was interesting and he is mature, Lestat was just weird at the end. Ever since Memnoch honestly the life was basically sucked out of him to me. His personality that was so thick like in Body Thief felt drained through this novel. The religious overtones as well were overdone. For a more spiritual than religious person, I felt very weird with a lot of what Lestat said and did, and that whole romance thing you gave him seemed so silly.I felt I was reading a whole different book than yours Anne. And I think the one thing that hurt the most in a literature way- and I think you should understand most other fans felt the same way- was that it seemed like through the whole book you yourself were dull and lifeless, like the story itself. Like you didn't care anymore about the Chronicles, for it did feel rushed. And also you seemed only to care about how Lestat ended. I felt you cared about the other characters just as much but I really think you only liked Lestat the best and it seemed you only cared for his ending. Why make all those rich characters and then just put all your energy into one at the very end? I didn't like that all.There were many things I found wrong with this book, and I just cannot believe this is the very last. And I also cannot believe you cannot understand why your fans are depressed and angry. Why don't you try sitting back and reading your earlier novels that got you these fans and see how you truly have changed over the years. You have, but it wasn't till Blacwood Farm honestly I started complaining. You changed drastically by that time and many fans like I were confused, for they were not the same stories we loved.I'm glad you have found a good path in your life Anne, more power to you, and I still love you as the author of possibly the most influential vampires ever made, but you ended I must say in a bad way. I'm sad such a great series ended in this way and I wish it hadn't. It is your story I understand, and so I won't say anymore than this review, but I wanted you to hear from a fan why I feel so many others are so angry with you. I am in a way with you too, but I go on- I mean it is merely stories, but stories we loved. You need to see our side if you expect us to see yours. I can see yours, and I understand, but please understand mine as well. Thank you for some good stories Anne regardless of it all, and some unforgettable characters of the past. But the end was not good for many, and you'll have to accept that."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I've read most of A.R. books, not just the Chronicles & The Mayfair series & I have to say this is one of the worst. I always thought the \\"New Tales\\" were stretching the story a bit (except Pandora) & this book is the defining reason.Pandora is the exception because it was NEW and INTERESTING. What is the sense in telling the same story over & over & over again as A.R. is propelled to do? Blackwood Farm was excellent & I had high hopes for B.C, also reading on her website that this was the end. Making Lestat GOOD & falling in love w/ Rowan Mayfair? Give me a break. And the Taltos story came to a climax...that never happened. The publisher's reviews also made it seem like Patsy's ghost was throughout the book hassling Quinn. A.R seems to have lost it & I hate to say that. But her prose is awful here - all slang & \\"wanna do this..& that\\" Letsat has learned nothing. Mona quotes Shakespere but can't say \\"want to\\"? Perhaps if she had made this like \\"Queen of the Damned\\" and wrote it from many persepctives. I mean, Mona & Quinn were SO in lust&love, didn't her becoming a vampire affect that? If this is the end of the Chronicles where were the twins, Jesse, Louis, Marius? Didn't they hear Lestat's thoughts about wanting to be a saint? I think what A.R. is essentially telling us is that she herself doesn't want to write about evil anymore. She's done with it. And it's obvious from this failure of a novel."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"And for Anne Rice, that time was about fifteen years ago.Like so many other reviewers here, I too have great love and admiration for most of her early work, but as time passed and the quality of her output grew worse and worse until it was a dismal parody of her one-time greatness, I became disenchanted with a woman I once cited as among my favorite writers. While I agree Anne Rice, seemingly hamstrung by her own pride and over-confidence, could benefit from a compassionate and sound editor to correct her typos and blatant miscarriages of proper grammar, the one thing I truly can't forgive her for is her continuity errors. She contradicts herself from book to book (and nowhere so gracelessly as in this novella) and butchers the timelines and previous events of her characters' pasts. She degrades the legacy of what she once so skillfully achieved.Some might claim it is mean to say these things about Anne Rice, and, yes, it is, but I feel an established writer owes her audience certain things, and chief among those is quality: quality most exemplified by continuing the internal world she's created and not confronting her readers with such obvious errors of previous facts and \\"rules\\". I continued to read Anne Rice's novels right up to this one, but I ceased to take her seriously as a creative talent sometime in the mid-1990's.Anne, thank you so much for the great works you've written. I wish you all the best in the years ahead."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I have never given a book a one-star rating before. However, if Blood Canticle is to be compared against Anne Rice's earlier works, such as The Vampire Lestat, Queen of the Damned, and even Blackwood Farm, it deserves a low rating. If you liked Memnoch the Devil, you will probably like this one; the religious ranting, lack of description, abundance of trivial dialogue, and lst draft feel are all there for you to enjoy all over again. Quite frankly, I don't remember Memnoch the Devil; I just remember that I felt this way after I finished it (bored, annoyed, disappointed).FYI, Anne Rice admits on her website that she essentially has full creative control over her books now; her editor doesn't really edit anything. That's clearly demonstrated here; I felt as though I was reading her personal journal. Lestat (she) rambles on and on about Catholicism, sainthood, and the like, and the book is only 300 pages long. It felt to me as though Blood Canticle was written over a long weekend. Mona is annoying, Quinn is a non-entity, and Lestat was a whiny bore.And then, to make matters worse, her prose is horrible! Lestat (Anne) enjoys using words such as gotcha, betcha, baby, yeah, and BOOGIE.Quote from the first page (Lestat writing to the reader): &quot;I know damned well how to be a full-fledged, post-Renaissance, post-nineteenth century, post-modern, post-popular writer. I don't deconstruct nothin'.&quot;Quote from page 7: (Lestat writing to the reader): &quot;All right, okay, yeah, forget about it, so what, stop the hand wringing, sure sure, knock it off, cool it, shove it, eh?&quot;Really charming, Anne. Every few sentences, Lestat (she) halts the story by inserting lame, pointless thoughts to remind us that this is his story. He even uses parentheses to comment about the previous sentence. I was constantly reminded that I was reading a bad book written in Lestat's annoying point of view. Very jarring and unpleasant read. I don't think I've ever winced so much while reading a book in my life. I don't know if A. Rice thought that this style was interesting or brilliant or what, but it's really, really bad. If you're a fan, you'll read it anyway, but please, don't buy it. Get it at the library. Borrow it. Be patient. Just don't pay for it.Looking for a new author with beautiful prose, excellent character development, and a book worth savoring? Try Tigana, by Guy Gavriel Kay. It's long and has a slow build, but it's so, so worth it."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Dear, dearest Anne. We love you. But whatever happened with those perfectly defined, coherent, fresh characters of both sagas, and with their convincingly complex worlds? Please, please, give us a great finale worthy of your talent before you change directions. I propose that you write for us a &quot;Book of Revelation. The last Chronicle.&quot;"},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Let me start by saying that I have read and loved almost all of Anne Rice's books. However, this book is just truly horrible. Rice has a habit of ruining her characters in the later books that feature them, and this was no exception. The attraction between Lestat and Rowan Mayfair was completely absurd, and Lestat's desire to be a saint was ridiculous. And why, for the love of God, does she have to include the last name of every Mayfair character every time she mentions them, even when the names are spoken by people who know perfecly well who \\"Rowan\\" is without having to specify that it is \\"Rowan Mayfair\\" they are referring to? It is is so painfully redundant that I am beginning to think that she does it to make the books longer. Sorry, but I have to vent a bit. Aside from the terrible content, the style is extremely annoying, with Lestat attempting to use hip words like \\"cool\\" and \\"wanna\\". Rice is just trying way too hard with this stream-of-consciousness, dumb-it-down style. It simply doesn't work and I don't think it's fooling anyone. I really wanted to love this book as I have loved Anne Rice's books in the past, but it was a terribly disappointing end to the series and a sadly unsuccessful melding of her vampire and Mayfair witch stories. It would have been better had she left well enough alone."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Okay? Where do I begin?This book is very condescending toward those who did not like Memnoch The Devil, insulting toward them in the very first or second chapter saying how it out-sold her other vampire chronicles and that those of us who don't like it only don't like it because we don't understand it. There are those who did not like it BECAUSE they understood it!This might come off as controversial of me to state but she has Lestat, the one who questioned everything and who says \\"Wouldn't it be great if no one had to die in the name of God again\\"' in the novel The vampire Lestat. But here in Blood Canticle she has him say \\"Church and state should not be separated.\\" This segregates all of Anne's non-Christian readers, and believe me, she HAD a few. And then he says The Pope is infallible. To call this maturing for the character is a sin.Now let's move on to her little blurb against us \\"Yankees\\" in the North.Deep into the book Lestat makes a comment about a man, and Lestat's saying the man was from the deep south and that's a place where people know how to treat blacks, not like intolerant Yankees. She was calling Northerners racist!And in the statement itself it gives way to the fact that in her mind African Americans are not people in saying the people there know how to treat 'blacks' as if white people are the only people and everyone else is '___ people' like they're an alien species and not Yankees or Southerners in themselves. This ain't 1865, Anne. The war is over, okay!I think she was deliberately trying to offend every one of her fans with this book. She has Lestat, LESTAT- the one who questions everything saying Church and state should not be separated. You know what this says? 'Freedom and justice but only if you're Christian.' Can you really imagine Lestat saying or believing that?Now we talk about redemption. Lestat became a rock star to have some reverence and therefor do some good, he wanted the world to see the evil that walked among them, to know the truth, and for the mythic evil that was never necessary to be wiped out. That was in The vampire Lestat novel.Not quite the same as saying Yankees are racist, that the pope can never be wrong, that church and state should not be separated and chastising a female vampire for being slutty and killing those that worship him even if they beg for their lives... All of which happen in Blood Canticle... Being good and being a religious fanatic are not the same thing, Anne.Yes, he wanted to be a teaching brother when he was twelve, and to quote her own book, he never believed in the religion. He believed in the cleanliness of the place, and he believed in the goodness of the men, but he didn't believe that God inhabited those halls. He saw their order, cleanliness, and teaching to be good- it wasn't about the religious aspect of it. He says this flat out.He never believed in the religious part, he had a secular belief, even then at age twelve, good and evil were all that mattered, it wasn't about the saints and martyrs. You can believe in goodness without believing in being rewarded for good or condemned for evil. There are atheists who believe in right and wrong. He held value to innocents because there may be nothing later. And he did not want innocents to suffer on Earth in case there was nothing after ward to justify their suffering. Doesn't she remember The Vampire Lestat at all? That wasn't about God. It was about good and evil, those were the themes, he wasn't even sure there was an after-life.In this book she has Lestat chastise a female vampire for dressing too slutty. And later the vampire girl apologizes saying Lestat's right. First off, Lestat LIKED modern fashion. His own mother dresses in drag for God's sake and he did NOT disapprove.There are no words to describe how offensive and bad Blood Canticle is. Racist, religiously bias, and sexist.If I didn't know better I'd say this book was deliberately bad and trying to ruin Lestat's reputation."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"No, I didn't like Blood Canticle. I haven't really liked any of Anne Rice's books since Merrick. As someone who loves Rice's earlier vampire books, I can understand the vehemence of those reviewers who have vented their disappointment in their reviews. Yes I have read Rice's response, and it was definately a bit arrogant and ill-advised. But the retaliation has been a bit much. I believe that when an author publishes a book that it becomes part of the public forum - people have a right to comment on it, praise it, criticise it. But there's no need to run Rice into the ground. Despite the fact that I have disliked her most recent books, they have in no way lessened my love for her early vampire chronicles. Neither has her criticism of those people who give her bad reviews. I read The Vampire Lestat or The Queen of the Damned, and it's still the same as when I first read them - they are great books. I can read them over and over. So roll with the punches. Anne's written some bad books but she's also written some really fantastic ones. Think about that before you run her into the ground. If you can't respect the author then at least respect the work she has produced that you loved."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I'm trying hard to finish this book. But it is so hard to think that Lestat would say any of the &quot;cool&quot; words that Anne writes. &quot;Give ME a break&quot; Anne, you really should have an editor or at least someone that would read your book before you send it off to print. And, let that person be honest.How very disapointing for a finale."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I believe this will go down as my least favorite of the Vampire Chronicles. How disappointing to find that the book held little interest to me after the first few chapters, especially when I could barely put Blackwood Farm down once I started it. I guess my expectations were so much higher than they should have been. I expected a lot more from one of my favorite authors. This book picks up immediately after Blackwood Farm ends and goes off into a lot of repetition which I assume is for those readers who did not read the The Witching Hour, Lasher, and Taltos. If you're an Anne Rice fan than you more than likely read them all so this one was boring and repetitive...and had me wishing the book would move along to something new and exciting. It never got to that point. It's ending was as disappointing as the beginning."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"This book is better than most of the books that I've read, but it's one of the worst of Anne Rice's books. Characters are supposed to mature over time, but come on, Lestat wanting to become a saint? That is just too much. What happened to the Lestat in Interveiw, the guy that you love to hate? What happened to the brat prince? This would be a good read for those who aren't familar with Anne Rice and her books, but for those of us who are, this book is depressing. I gave this book three stars because Lestat is narrating the book again, and there are parts in the the book that send chills down you back, but they are few and far between."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Hmmm. On top of all this silliness between those who liked this book and those who didn't, I'm still not sure if this is the end of the Vampire Chronicles or not. If it is, it went out with a whimper. If not, let's hope we get something with a lot more to \\"bite\\" on. While I found this book disappointing, I wouldn't go as far as to trash it but nowadays, this is the way many express themselves. It's an in Your Face World made worse by the advent of anonymous, written communications. This means that the lunatic fringe make an appearance ready to insult and denigrate, as do the \\"children\\" who should stick to their homework or go to bed. Does Anne Rice deserve all this vitriol? I think not. Could she have written a better book? I think so.Why didn't I like it? Well, for one Lestat has changed. Which is fine. This is Anne Rice's character and she is free to do with him what she wants. For me, he will always be the \\"Brat Prince\\" who defies convention. By portraying him as a Saint and essentially a parent, he has lost his fangs. I preferred him battling his inner demons but in Blood Canticle, he is just too much of a good guy for me. He is not Marius. He is not Maharet. He is Lestat, a monster who constantly finds himself yearning for what he lost yet revels in his immortality. The introduction of Mona as a vampire was just too close to Claudia for me. It felt like a repeat of his previous mini-coven. In addition, she is so annoying and immature, that I question why you even continue to involve her. The inclusion of the Taltos mystifies me. Why merge them if there is no resulting climax? Maybe Ms. Rice has other plans and if so, then I will give her the benefit of the doubt on this count. But absolutely nothing of substance between Vampire and Taltos occurred. I was eagerly awaiting Rowan Mayfair's transformation but that never occurred as well. This is the premise that most attracted me, a Mayfair witch of Rowan's power becoming a vampire. Surely someone that could have challenged Maharet or Mekare as the Queen of the Damned.So, I didn't like it but tis not the end of the world and hopefully Ms. Rice will grace us with another attempt at continuing the saga. If you do, please Ms. Rice, can you involve more of the older immortals? I find no magic in the new brood of Mona or Quinn. Bring back Maharet & Mekare, Pandora, Marius, Kayman, etc. Combine them with Rowan and Lestat and give us a true ride as you are capable of. I understand your anger and frustration. You did not deserve some of the comments flung on you like dung but...some of them do have a point. If anything, please direct your anger at the tyros that made Queen of the Damned into a movie (If it could be called one. How could you have let them do that!!???). I didn't expect them to stick to the original story-line but my god....that was an insult."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I thought Anne had lost it back when I read \\"Blood and Gold.\\" How I hated that book! \\"Blackwood Farm\\" was better, but still too much mundane detail. I'd read a lot of bad reviews for \\"Blood Canticle,\\" so I approached with caution.This book isn't nearly as bad as most people would have you believe. It moved a whole lot faster than the two previous books; I finished it in a fraction of the time and never even considered putting it away ... or burning it, like I wanted to do with \\"Blood and Gold.\\"That said, it isn't vintage Rice. Lestat's new use of lingo is annoying and seems very out of character, no matter how he tries to justify it. A 300-hundred-year-old white guy with long blond hair and velvet clothes trying to talk like a black ghetto kid just seemed forced and silly. Fortunately, he slipped out of that lingo quite often.As the conclusion to the Vampire Chronicles, it is very unsatisfying. I've always wanted to know more about Louis, for instance, but you get nothing about any of the older vampires. I expected some big-bang ending for all the vampires, or at least that Lestat would ascend to Heaven or something, but it just didn't happen. As an installment in the Chronicles, it was fine. As the ending, it was unsatisfying.Rice said she was finished with the vampires after \\"Memnoch the Devil.\\" Personally, I think she should have left it there. But, since she did return after that book, maybe we can hope she'll return again and give us a more satisfying conclusion."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"This is the second wrost vampire novel I have ever read.

I think and rice outdid herself with this book"},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I just finished reading this book and I'm not entirely sure what to make of it. I was definitely disappointed by its quality, but I would say that my Anne Rice fandom has been falling off for quite some time. However, I don't feel that that invalidates my opinion but rather emphasizes it - I don't feel that this was so much a failure as a Vampire Chronicle as a failure as a novel.As is previously mentioned, Lestat's language was a bit jarring. But I also agree that Lestat as a character is designed to be able to adapt to the times and new surroundings, and it seemed to me that he might have picked up a bit of vernacular in the span of his lifetime. That said, Anne Rice was definitely a few steps behind the &quot;times.&quot; I almost clawed my eyes out at the use of &quot;yo&quot; and &quot;dude.&quot; I absolutely abhor it when writers attempt to integrate language of that sort into writing and fail miserably. And I must confess, I have never thought that Anne was particuarly good at that anyway - the language she writes for Jasmine and the other black characters always seems forced and unrealistic, especially in this book. Very poor.Point blank Mona annoyed me. I was willing to tolerate Lestat working the Dark Trick on her, with faith that it would work out in the end, but it most definitely did not. I've never been all that fond of Mona in the first place, but at times I found her likeable. That is, I did in her own storylines - her speech in Blackwood Farm was absolutely intolerable. I couldn't tell whether or not Anne was having trouble thinking up synonyms for &quot;egregious&quot; or if Mona was just one of those annoying sorts of people that uses the same word over again - and when I settled on the latter, she grated even more. But I digress, the point is essentially that Mona and her incessant outbursts, whining, crying, and Lestat-Worship were just bloody irritating. I hate submissiveness, and that's precisely what she was, submissive. To have her grovel to Lestat to forgive her, and him to be so petty as he was!Patsy's Ghost - No place at all whatsoever in this book. Oncle Julien's haunting as well was a bore. It might have been interesting if developed properly, but he seemed there only to bugger Lestat, and in doing so, he annoyed me as well. And his begging, pleading, and fright at the end of the book was unacceptable.The characters were completely and utterly undeveloped. Quinn especially, and how disappointing. He could have worked very well as an essential character, but he just sort of shadowed Lestat, and Mona even. In fact, certainly as fledglings we should have examined them and their interaction more carefully instead of transitioning to the Taltos which shouldn't have even been included in this story. And fine and good for Lestat to love Rowan but that bit in the last chapter? Rubbish.The hunting was horrible contrived, nothing so romantic as Lestat and Louis' cunning, unnoticed killings at parties and the like. A bore, I wanted to be done with it all.And let me not forget to mention Juan Diego. It might have been an interesting insight into Lestat's psyche if it had a point. But it didn't. It just was there, filling up space, sloppily glued together with the rest of the flimsy &quot;plot.&quot;Overall I would say that it was temporarily entertaining at times, and that definitely wasn't because of the poorly executed plot. This was just a filler, I think, as I wait for better fare, being shipped to me as I write."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Blood Canticle lacks narrative cohesion. It feels like a jumbled dream sequence, out of focus and elastic. Rice's descriptions are lovely but even the best prose is lost amid a untidy heap of out of tune dialogue filled with equal parts slang and pompous diatribe. I must agree with whoever said that Lestat left her after Queen of the Damned. I'm afraid the witches have left the building as well. The Mayfairs do and say things SO out of character that it isn't just unbelievable, it's sad. Quinn doesn't get any good dialogue and comes off duller than a stump post. Lestat is out of his mind with wanting to be \`good' and falling in love with everyone, including the ghost of Julien Mayfair. It's all rather silly. Rice introduces two really nifty new taltos characters but we only get to spend a few pages with them before the book closes, lamely. While what story was there was interesting, it really could have been told in half the pages and without all of Lestat's sermons on sainthood. Sorry Anne, better luck next time."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Anne Rice's strength as an author has always lay in her ability to create characters who reside within the imaginations of her readers. It is easy for us to imagine, for example, the way that her characters have long teeth, the way they drink blood, the way they live and breathe and emote and sing and dance and fly and do everything else that the people in the world around us do. For that, she is to be commended.Starting with her \\"Harry Potter\\" series, Rice began to push the conventions of the novel form, and her most recent work appears to be the culmination of that exploration. This fact is most apparent in her use of lines such as:\\"Hello! Lestat Discovers The Opposite Sex!\\"\\"Look at those naked arms.\\"and\\"Patsy all dressed in pink cowboy clothes . . .\\"Based on the strength of such lines, it's a real disappointment when we come to the conclusion of the book only to find Rice's limitations displaying themselves in such spectacular fashion. Nothing in her previous writing could have prepared us for the fact that Lestat would whirl through a variety of physical manifestations ranging from bartender to top gun pilot to secret agent to a saucy young upstart trial lawyer. Anne! Anne!"},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I was very diappointed with this book. It was an easy read but the meanings of the stories felt to me, that Anne rice didn't want to write this. It felt like she rushed it just to meet her deadline. Let me first start by saying that we never knew at the end of &quot;Taltos&quot; what happened to Ash and Morrigan. That book ended good and the I did not feel that we had to go through that again and really find out what happened to them. Lestat was marvelous as always but I didn't think that the witches and vampires should have been brought together in such a way. They should have been kept separate. I would tell any Anne Rice fan to read this book but I can only hope that her next will be better."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Like most writing reviews, I've read and enjoyed them all. I'm a particular fan of well researched historical novels so I completely devoured &quot;The Witching Hour&quot;. The Vampire novels are great escapist fantasy for me and I value them for that. After reading &quot;Blackwood Farm&quot; I couldn't help but feel that at some point, maybe about halfway through, Ms Rice had just &quot;had enough&quot; and decided to complete the book in summary fashion. Major chunks of time seemed to be covered in a paragraph or two. I felt like the last half of the book should have been at least twice as long. &quot;Blood Canticle&quot; was disappointing for me because I felt that way through the entire book. Oh, the story line was OK - not particularly gripping or anything. It's been a while since I read the Mayfair books but I don't remember disliking Rowan as much as I did in this book. Quin seemed pretty irrelevant - I'm not quite sure why he was introduced in the first place. If this was it for both the Vampire Chronicles and the Mayfair Witches, I don't think the introduction of Quin did much to pull them together. I would much rather have had some closure on already introduced characters. When you consider the cast of Vampires, Mayfairs, Talamasca, etc., it would seem there was more than enough to work with to tie it all together without the Quin/Mona relationship - which, really, got pretty nauseating. If there is more to come I really hope the Rowan/Lestat relationship isn't presented like Quin/Mona - though the last scene where Rowan comes to Lestat seemed to indicate that it might. Through both books I really had a hard time with that presentation - very &quot;stick your finger down your throat&quot;, overly melodramatic yuck. The whole Carribean drug smuggler line seemed pretty uninspired. The final explanation as to what Taltos really were seemed empty and contradictory as well. They couldn't really survive yet they had for thousands of years - peaceful simpletons yet some are treacherous murderous, some are brilliant and some are idiots. Mainly, though, I just felt all the way through that the book was in a &quot;rush to get it over with&quot; - like the second half of Blackwood Farm. I really missed the depth of plot.Still, I read it in an evening as I knew I would and enjoyed it for what it was - I just wish there had been much more. I certainly couldn't do any better and, if this was really it, a heartfelt thank you to Ms Rice for providing me with tremendous enjoyment over the years. I'm sorry to see such epic fantasy end, particulary sort of limping out like this. I expect it will be a long time before anything comparable comes along again."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"What a depressing end to an amazing series. Of course it hasn't been good since after Memnoch the Devil, but in this book, Lestat is not himself, none of our other favorite characters dare touch it with a 20 foot pole, and what little plot there is is incomprehensible. More of a vehicle for the author to voice her thoughts on issues and religion than a novel. This \\"Lestat\\" is nothing like the Brat Prince we know and love. Tempers run high and there's more drama than a high school gym without any reason for it. And plot? What plot? Not to mention it contradicts lots of previously established things. For example, Lestat \\"I can hack into police computers in ToTBT\\" de Lioncourt doesn't know what e-mail is? You're kidding right.Waste of money, waste of time. Very depressing."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Many others hated this book, but I personally did not find it that bad. It's not the worst book in the series, but it definitely isn't Rice's best. My major problem with the novel is that it doesn't resolve the Vampire Chronicles to me, focusing more on the Mayfair saga. There is no true resolution given between Lestat and the other vampire characters, which I think should have been done in order for this to have been a proper finale to the series."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I still enjoyed this book almost as much as any other Anne Rice book I've read. I understood the fusion of the Witch stories with the story of Lestat and Blackwood Farm. I didn't necesarily want to mix my vampires and witches, but I came away understanding a lot more about the witches, which was important to me. I waited a long time for a Witch book, and although I wasn't completely satisfied with how Ms. Rice delivered one, I still enjoyed the book a great deal. Regardless of whether or not I thought Blood Canticle was my \\"favorite\\" book, I know I will still eagerly await the next book that she grants us. I've read all of her books, and I know Anne Rice is a guaranteed good read, and will remain a faithful fan until she lays down her pen for good. I've read some of these reviews, and it sounds more like some people simply cannot let go of the Chronicles and now want to spew spite and hatred at Anne because they don't like her decisions. I know I'll miss the Chronicles, but I respect her decision to not continue the saga. Long Live Lestat...and God Bless Anne Rice."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Of course I will always love Interview with The Vampire, The Vampire Lestat and The Queen of the damned. But many Anne Rice fans agree they go down hill from there. There are certain circles that refer to my previously mentioned first three vampire chronicles as the ONLY vampire Chronicles. All the rest come off like fan fictions from some other person.Nothing done now can change what had been. The Interview with the vampire is still the interview with the vampire. The Vampire Lestat is still The Vampire Lestat, The Queen of the damned is still The Queen of the damned. I just pretend it's 1989 and the others were not published yet. They did not happen.Lestat, in my mind, is still a rebel, still a brat, still mischievous, still questions things, still fearless, still angst driven, still a fighter, and still perseverent. He's still riding around on his Harley, hunting down his killers and falling in love with the world. He's still an optimist (He has a pessimistic view of humanity in Blood Canticle.) He still views society today as an age of innocence and he's still my Lestat. All the rest... to me.. They're just fan fictions.I wish Anne Rice had done a book that she once hinted about years ago. The idea of the vampires being found out by some mortals and possibly captured and studies and then the escape... Lestat talks about this idea in The Vampire Lestat. That could have been a great novel, especially with our proud and defiant Lestat. This conformist, prude, depthless, two-dimensional Lestat would fold under that pressure but the Lestat I know would not. The first three vampire chronicles- that's my Lestat. That will always be my Lestat and no one can take that away from me.I miss Lestat. Lestat in Blood Canticle is whining. And he's become a conformist. He's now a hard-core Catholic who questions nothing, a cold hypocrite, a misogynist, a prude, and pessimist. This is not our Lestat! Our Lestat was a brat. Our Lestat questioned things. Our Lestat was always a rebel. Changing his personality this abruptly is like saying he now has blue hair and orange eyes. The angst is gone. The fearless soul that could never be oppressed is gone. I did not love the fangs or the blonde hair. I loved his personality. I related to Lestat, not the vampire! She's forgotten who Lestat was. Lestat used to see this world as an age of secular innocence where evil doers were scarce. And now he says there are many in the cities who deserve the vampire's kiss. He's become depthless (if he had much depth to begin with.) He's two dimensional. He's hunting down rogues and rule breaker vampires! He is a rogue and rule breaker! I want Lestat, I don't want Angel from Buffy The Vampire Slayer!I want Lestat the way he was meant to be. If Anne Rice needed a new character to express her obsession and new-found conformist mentality she should have used ANYONE but The Brat Prince to express it! I think this book disappointed every Anne Rice fan, everywhere, one way or another.What happened to our man of action? Where's The James Bond of the Vampires? My God! In these later novels the character himself can't even get his own name right. He keeps saying he was twenty, he was twenty-one as a mortal when he killed the wolves so how could he appear twenty now?I know I'm being harsh but Anne calls this maturing for Lestat. Being mature does not mean clinging desperately to something without question. Being mature does not mean becoming sexist with fashion, and seeing evil everywhere where he once was in love with the goodness in society. Lestat was a brat but he had faith in goodness. Now he doesn't seem to have that faith. His real and pure faith has been replaced by something superficial, something dark. And the restless spirit, the angst driven rebel, the one who could not be dominated... Our beloved antagonist, he's gone.... I don't know who this creature is who is narrating the story but it's not our Lestat.I'll always love the first three vampire chronicles, Interview with The Vampire, The Vampire Lestat and The queen of the damned. By my advice to anyone just starting, don't go any further than that. Tale of the body thief is good for comic relief if you have a dark sense of humour but that's about it."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I have read almost every one of Anne Rice's novels, and I have to say this is the worst one. Usually the language is poetic, yet forceful, and in this one, I thought Lestat seemed scattered and stupid. Suddenly, everything and everyone was &quot;facinating&quot;. He talks like a 17-year old surfer, not a 200-year old well-read vampire. It almost seems like it was written by a different person. I can blame Anne Rice for some of it (though the story was good) but the editing was terrible (a slow downward trend has been noticeable for some time). Has she made so much money now that no one is going to tell her that she needs to FOCUS... not babble? Someone needed to take the fluff out of this book, but didn't."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I'm sorry to say that this book just wasn't Anne's best work. I've grown to love her stories, but this one just has me reeling. I'm not sure if it was the loss of her husband or what the problem is, but this one just doesn't seem like \\"her\\". Even so, I'm looking forward to seeing what she does next."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Anne Rice has written some stinkers in her time -- \\"Memnoch the Devil,\\" \\"Servant of the Bones\\" and \\"Violin\\" amongst them. But for sheer disappointment, it would be hard for her to top \\"Blood Canticle,\\" the not-so-grand finale of her classic Vampire Chronicles series. It wraps up both the Vampire and Witch series not with a bang, but with a slow squeaky whimper.The book actually starts with Lestat's fantasy about being a saint. Yes, Lestat now fantasizes about being like Saint Juan Diego and chatting with the Pope. This comes out of nowhere, and is merely an opportunity for Rice to tell us that we're all stupid shallow ingrates for not liking \\"Memnoch the Devil.\\"Then we switch off to where \\"Blackwood Farm\\" ended. The dying Mona Mayfair has come to Blackwood Farm to expire, but Lestat decides to make her into a vampire because.... well, otherwise Quinn will be sad. But while she's transforming, Rowan Mayfair arrives to pick up her young cousin and Lestat has to keep her from finding out what he's done. Also, Rowan and Lestat fall in love. Seriously.Lestat takes the two younger vampires under his wing, and shows the newly powerful Mona how to maneuver the world as a vampire. But her new life also revives Mona's interest in her old one -- specifically in the Taltos child she bore some years before, which triggered the disease that almost killed her. So the trio sets out to find out if the Taltos are still around.I'll be frank: \\"Blood Canticle\\" reads like fanfiction. Lestat falling in True Love with Rowan Mayfair? Lestat playing vampire dad to teen vampire lovers? Lestat's obsession with sainthood? Lestat having a midlife crisis (judging from his slang)? A thriller-like expedition to find the Taltos? This whole disaster sounds like a C-grade Vampire Chronicles fanfic!Sadly, not even Rice's trademark lush, atmospheric writing can save this hokey mess of a plot -- her prose seems limp and colorless, like a stalk of wilting celery. She also seems to be trying to wrap the whole mess up as quickly as possible, since it's basically about Lestat being told where the Taltos are and a quick trip there. It seems like she's utterly tired of the Vampire Chronicles and just wants it over and done with.She also seems to want the vampires themselves over and done with. Pretty much no beloved character except Lestat appear -- Maharet only communicates via email, Louis and Marius are only mentioned, and Rowan appears just so she can fall in Twilight-like instant love with Lestat. The only vampires who appear other than Lestat are... well, Quinn and Mona. Whee. So happy.And Lestat does not resemble the wild, brilliant, charming vampire that appeared in the previous books. This guy seems more like a middle-aged rich guy who's having a midlife crisis -- using slang, hanging out with the \\"kids,\\" getting a crush on a random woman, getting befuddled by technology, and so on.\\"Blood Canticle\\" is a sad, shameful ending for what was once a wonderful (or at least decent) vampire series -- a damp, sputtering creature that drifts away from its own lack of substance. Just finish the series at \\"Queen of the Damned.\\""},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I just thought i'd put in my $0.02. I also have been a fan of Anne Rice since i was 10 or 11. I have read her for years and have an amazing amount of respect for her creative talent and her eloquence. I fell in love with her books not so much for the subject but for the style of her writing. I've always been in awe of the poetry that is her novels. She can make anything sound beautiful. She has an amazing gift of persuasion. I can not believe that anyone would criticize her art. I've read some shocking things in these reviews. I agree that everyone has a right to express their opinion. But to do so harshly and personally is taking it a little extreme. I read this book when it first came out and I had no feelings of disapointment or discontent. I will admit, as a fan, the journey in the book is not what I would have chosen. But that is the beauty of it. I do not write these books. Noone does but the wonderfully talented Anne Rice, who I owe the pleasure of hours and hours of delighted reading. She is the creator of a tantalizing world where you can lose yourself in the darkness. By choosing to read her books you give her the liberty to take you wherever she chooses. So far from being disappointed, I was entranced by the unanticipated events that make up this little novel. As far as Lestat the character is concerned, what is he if he is not unpredictable, self-absorbed, self-serving, pitiful but pensive? He has many faults and yes, is a brat but isn't that why we love him? Do we find fault with him now because he has thoughts of atonement? Why can't we just accept this as a moment of weakness if that's what it can be called. No matter what Lestat has been through, he started off human nonetheless. But whether a few readers feel he is out of character is no matter. He is what he was created to be. And the only person who knows that is Anne Rice, who I am ever grateful to. Thank you, Anne, for always keeping us on our toes. And for every one person who has a distorted view of your book, you know there are 100s who understand what it truly is. A personal work of art. Thank you for that gift."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I considered myself a true Anne Rice fan, I even stuck it out through all those dreadfully boring vampire books after the Queen on the Damned, but I will never again read one of her books.This was truly a terrible book.If you liked the first three vampire books and The Witching Hour (which was my all time favorite book), stay away from Blood Canticle. Don't even read the description. This book ruined Lestat and the Mayfairs for me."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"These reviews are more entertaining than this terribly written book! As a young reader I have read more intellectual content in the pages of Harry Potter! Yes Anne, thank god it's over because I doubt anyone wants to waste any more time and money."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Wow, I guess I must be in the minority considering the reviews on here, but I really enjoyed this book. Lestat is at his wonderfully evil best, and Rice breathes more spirit and gumption into this novel than in some of her previous ones (The Vampire Armand and Blackwood Farm-good books, but slow moving at times). I definitely didn't find the characters one-dimensional, it was nice to see Lestat being himself again, as he hasn't in some of the previous books (although traveling to heaven and hell would be a bit traumatizing, I'm sure). I don't think I have ever been more in love with any character I've ever read about,and that spans a lot of books, believe me! Yes, the Brat Prince does like to spend a lot of time pondering things, he is a thinker, but I don't believe that something new, he is like that in all the chronicles, its part of his appeal.I will admit this book was a bit fast-paced compared to any previous books she has written and maybe that turned some of her fans off, but I found it a nice change, and read it in two nights. I enjoyed all the action, and the mystery of the Taltos, which is a series I neglected to read previously. I don't think the Mayfair witches turned into whimps at all. After all, who could resist Lestat? Come on! Certainly not me! I think Rowan Mayfair is a wounded soul in this novel who maybe now can get past the terrible things that happened to her and finally move on, and her husband also. Lestat to the rescue! Yeah!Overall, I would definitely have to recommend this book to any serious Rice fans. She is a lovely author I would like to meet sometime. She questions the same things in life I do: Is there a God? Where do we go after this? Etc.A good read, definitely recommend it."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I am a rabid Anne Rice fan, but I must admit I was sorely disappointed with this little book! Warning Spoilers! I found the characters to be somewhat shallow and lacking the usual definition she is famous for. I understand that she may have felt the need to rush this book somewhat, but it could have been so much more. I was devastated over what happened to Ashlar, but I never really cared that much for Mona or Morrigan. Oberon was interesting, but I guess his sarcastic attitute is probably from the Mayfair blood he carries. One can only assume that Rowan (God I despise her character)will play mad doctor with him and his sisters for awhile. I can find no place in my heart for Rowan. The way she treats Michael is absolutely repulsive. Don't get me wrong, Michael is a weak minded Pedophile, but then again, he does carry Julien's blood. And Julien, Mon Dieu! I was even disappointed in him. The interactions between him and Lestat seemed superficial at best, and he was utterly unlike himself (Julien) in former books. Stella was a breath of fresh air as always. I think Anne just brought in way too many unimportant characters and tried to people the book with them. I have read in other reviews of this book about fans being disturbed over Lestat's ghetto talking. I wasn't particularly bothered by it, though it did seem somewhat out of character for him. Then again, he cannot really be expected to talk 18th century forever. He's a vampire in touch with his time who is trying to make changes in his life. Altogether, I think my review was colored more by what she did to Ashlar than anything else. He was one of my favorite characters, and it was simply too tragic. Alors, Adieu to the Great Saint Ashlar, and the end of an era!"},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Although I love Anne Rice and her works, it's sometimes a love-hate relationship and occasionally one seems to dominate over the other. In the case of this book, I'd like to be more optimistic, but find myself strained to be so. I would recommend this book, it's not a waste of your time, but it's definitely not the older books.I personally *HATE* the witch books, and I hate it even more when they cross with the vampire books. Why? Because witches have no relevance to the world of the vampires. Lestat could set them ablaze with a thought, and frankly, I find them boring. The notions of family are well developed, but simply have no place in the realm of the vampire, where family notions tend to fall apart because of the very nature of the vampire as developed by Anne Rice herself.Sigh, I really wanted a better end, one more in tune with the classic writing style of yore. I think she was better off writing other stories than demeaning the vampire chronicles with stories involving witches or narrative experimentations. I actually thought she caught on in Blackwood Farm where Merrick was mercifully set ablaze. Apparently, I was wrong.I don't know, I definitely recommend her other books, but this should never have been written. If she wanted to send Lestat off in the blaze of glory, she should've turned him into an Archangel opposed to God and Memnoch alike and let it go from there. I hate saying this, believe me, but I was disappointed. If you're a fan, you'll probably feel the same way, if not, I recommend you start with another of her books."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I've read most of the other reviews here, and while I agree that Anne seems to struggle in this book for the gift she had tapped into in her early works, I don't think that this book should be discarded wholesale. Yes, it reads more as a jaunt than a journey, but the melding of the Mayfair Witches, the Taltos, the Talamasca and our favorite Brat Prince is cohesive. Anne's gift for storytelling is not lost. Anne's ability to match the pace and vernacular of her prose to the personality of each character has not been left behind.I get a sense of resignation here. Maybe Anne was ready to hang up the Vampire Chronicles before Tale of the Body Thief, but has been responding to the clamoring of fans unwilling to give up the indomitable Lestat. Did she make her fans happy? Perhaps some. I am a Rice devotee. I'd probably read her grocery lists (in hardcover, no less) and love them. So here, I enjoyed the story and the familiar Rice tropes. But also, I got the feeling that Anne may have achieved, in Canticle, a catharsis of sorts, exorcising these characters from her system so that her next effort will have the fresh and feverish feel of Interview.To those who claim that their beloved Brat Prince is gone in this book, replaced by a genuflecting whiner, I'd like to point out that the take I get on Lestat is that he's always ready for the Next Best Thing to come along. His current obsession with sainthood is just another &quot;thing&quot; that he'll cling to with great passion until something more captivating crosses his path. He's true to form in his verbal combat with Mona, his bent for fashion, his dining on only the Evil Doer and his desire for companionship of both the human and vampiric ilk. He's the same ol' Lestat underneath his latest &quot;enchantment du jour&quot; and I love him, now and forever.So thank you, Anne...for (maybe) sending Lestat out into the sunset (and not the sunrise...would he have survived a second trip?) at a jaunty clip. If I see him again, great! If I don't, then I'm already anxiously anticipating what/whoever you send our way next!"},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I loved this book.

This, however, is such a departure in writing style, story-line and intensity, that I am shocked it was written by the same woman who brought us timeless stories of other vampires. Lestat seems to be written like an 18 year old surfer, using the word &quot;dude&quot; too many times for me to count. Mona is detached and cold. Quinn is a stumbling fool. This book lacks Lestat's charm, it also lacks Louis, Marius, Armand, Pandora and every other entertaing character she has previously brought to life. I am sad this is her last chronicle. I am more sad that this is how the chronicle ended, which such a disappointing book."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"This is far from the worst of the series. Though I am happy to see a wide variety of readers finally realizing that Anne Rice is really not all that special, to claim that BLOOD CANTICLE is the most insulting of her novels is sheer folly. MERRICK, anyone? Or THE MUMMY? Truth be told, there are probably a dozen of her novels that are worse than this one. In fact, I dare say BLOOD CANTICLE is one of her better efforts. The main reason for this is the narrator. Lestat has always been her most intriguing character, and it's about time he was front and center again. Ignore those who are whining about his semi-modern language; it's a serious improvement. Characters that exist in the present day should more or less speak like characters that exist in the present day, a point that Rice finally concedes.The climax is somewhat disappointing, however. I was looking forward to something a little more exciting (or maybe even profound) for the conclusion of the book/series. Instead [spoiler warning] we have no tension as a group of drug dealers is liquidated and the Taltos are freed to live happily ever after. Sort of. I have to say that I am relieved to see this whole Vampire Chronicles enterprise coming to an end. It peaked long, long ago. And now, like a boxer who's been knocked out too many times, it staggers into the sunset,punch-drunk and confused."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"People please, give an artist a chance to expand. Anne Rice is extrodinarily fluent with her pen and while this creation may not be her best i.e. The Vampire Lestat it still reflects a genuine awe inspiring reading experience. I read the book when it first came out a year ago in Hardback. Shelling the extra dollars out of my college wallet to buy this precious bit of escapisim I found it completely worth while. One of the most mature aspects of the book is that it shows the characters change. This is not just the next book in the Vampire series but the next book in the Witching series as well. Characters change in this novel and that is somthing that most writers never achive...the simple change of a literary figure. Most people who complain are saying that it dosen't have the action of the earlier books or the fiery Lestat we have all come to love. but the series would be incredably boring if we only ever saw Lestat terrorizing the streets of London or New Orleans.Personaly I thank Mrs. Rice for her latest book.

After \\"Interview\\" this distraction grew to a full-fledged guilty pleasure. After finishing the vampire series (the four completed ones at that point), I moved on to the Mayfair series and have developed a steadfast admiration and respect for her talent.The stories are fun reads but, like all good classics, larger issues lie at the core of these series - namely death and meaningfulness. What would you do with a life that was potentially limitless? How does death define personal meaning? How would one find meaning if all wealth and magic were at their disposal? Each of her characters serve as vehicles to explore these (and many other) notions. Obviously there are no answers but here treatment - through these characters - is profound. From Tolstoy to Maugham, all great authors have done the same thing for different audiences at different times.For many years now I have been first in line when another Anne Rice book hits the bookstore and never have I grown tired of her discussion of these ideas and never have I been disappointed. Some have been more profound than others (e.g., Pandora), some have been a little work (e.g, Memnoch), and others I read too fast because it was a cool story (e.g. Witching Hour & Blackwood) - but that was OK, the second and third times I read it more slowly and savored the ideologies.Ms. Rice has been generous in allowing me (us) to hitch along her ideological highway and I am grateful. With even a distant understanding of the trials she has endured during these years, her work is all the more personal, vulnerable, and poignant. Those reviewers here who pick up one of her books \\"from a library on a beach\\" and then suddenly feel qualified to offer a cogent opinion give me the unsettled feeling that the depth of human ignorance is bottomless. It is certainly more of a commentary on the reviewer than that which is being \\"reviewed.\\"I personally loved \\"Blood Canticles\\" but for a rationale unique among my many Rice-loving reasons - in it she offers a fitting closure and send-off to the characters that have come to have a life of their own. If the entire vampire/Mayfair series was one big book, then \\"Canticles\\" would have been that last chapter that lets you set it down with satisfaction, hope (and a bit of piqued curiosity). I sensed a lot of love and goodbye in it - at least that is how I read it.And to Ms. Rice, in regards to those \\"reviewers\\" who seem to have flocked to this website, I offer the words of another person who made the mistake of offering himself to the ignorant masses; \\"Forgive them, for they know not what they do.\\""},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"After reading through all the reviews, and all the drible, and all the horrible remarks and rebuttles, heres what I found out from reviews.So, her last book wasnt the greatest. After 25 books, you cant write a winner every time.She was under contract and HAD to write another bookHer daughter and husband have both died. Well Jesus Christ, that might change me too....and my writing is a reflection of me, so MAYBE the writing would change?She's ill with diabetes and is having trouble with simple tasks?The slang from Lestat is....annoying...but Lestat LOVES being annoying. He really hasnt changed all that much. Mona was always a whiner, and like a previous post, Rowan was falling in the last book...Memnoc is apparently the turning point for a lot of readers. Just except that Lestat changed. Going to Heave and Hell would change you.... A character changing and growing makes him believable. And for the reviewer who said she was trying to 'convert him' to her 'religion' get real. Its FICTION.Lestats purpose in life is goodness. Has always been, he wants to be good, but loves his evil self. Hes ALWAYS been a contradiction. How bout you read the books first, then review.Lastly, you can hate a book all you want. You can publicly announce you hate a book, and why you hate it. But to lash out so horridly, taking attacks at the author personally cause she didnt write how YOU wanted for once is low.For anyone who hasn't read the book...I suggest reading it and forming your own opinion. Anne Rice was never an easy read, she has a lot of detail and it can get slow, but thats HER writing style. If you don't like it, don't read it. If you chose to try it out anyways and STILL don't like it, don't tell the author to go 'Mourn her husband and shut up.' Just put it on the shelf or give it to a used book store and try something new.My eyes are killing me after 30+ pages of cruelty. Grow up flamers."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I really liked this book. However, I don't compare these works with each other because to me they're a progression, the sum of their parts. And to ye who feel that Ms. Rice's work echoes her sentiments and/or religious beliefs, to that I loftily say, \\"Well, DUH!!\\" If memory serves, the brilliant \\"Interview with the Vampire\\" helped her to process her feelings of tragic loss, and \\"The Vampire Lestat\\" helped her find joy in life again. If a literary work is not part of the author, it is disconnected and less interesting. So, as far as I am concerned, Lestat's progressions reflect Ms. Rice's own personal journey, and I thank her for sharing so much of herself with us.And Ms. Rice, thank you for writing here and keeping in touch with the public. Please know there are many out there who love and support you and are offering their sympathy to you in your time of need.Long story short on the Vampire Chronicles: I'm so sorry they're over, and I will desperately miss my literary love, Lestat. He was, is, and will always be my FAVORITE character. There is no character out there so complex, so full of contradictions, so absolutely wonderful.

Not in a way that I feel the plot was lacking, but in a way that made me feel sad that this was the end of the line. I have read every Anne Rice book she's ever written - and never been disappointed. Even her strange religious excursions have been at least interesting. Sitting down to read the Witching Hour I was appalled at first to see the entire thing was mostly history of the family. I didn't see how that could possibly mean anything to the family or the current events. What happened instead was an obsession for the detail and other-worldly life Rice can make you believe in.Blood Canticle was EXACTLY what I was hoping for. Another amazing Anne Rice novel. Lestat has returned, and has progressed in life and character - as I feel he should with the changing times and changing events. The Blackwood family is simply exotic and Mona, dear Mona is almost bitterly annoying in her plight for love and Ophelia death. I can't say enough about the entire series (that being both the Mayfair Witches and the Vampire Chronicles). Read every book beginning to end. You won't ever been disappointed. Anne Rice doesn't create just a story, she creates another world."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"First, I would like to say that I have no idea why there are so many people writing negative reveiws about this book. Why is there controversy over it? Actually, the people who wrote these comments don't seem to understand fiction - or the Anne Rice (in her vampire days), for that matter. I am a fan.Here's the deal. If you are a Anne Rice fan - you will love the book. My suggestion - don't read it without picking up the Mayfair Witches series. I read them all, and Blood Canticle weaves all the worlds together, quite nicely. I read something about how the person didn't like how she wrote some of the characters - but I don't think they understood the power of Lestat, or the allure. A new leader emerges from this - and could bring up a \\"new\\" world, but unfortunately, we would never know. Yes, the book does start of kind of slow, but towards the end I was fascinated. Is it the best out of the series? No. but, everyone has it's favorites. Is it the worst? Certainly not. And the most compelling thing - the return of Lestat. It's a great piece to add to the collection. Do not let \\"controversy\\" (over what, i can't even contemplate) steer you away. Anne Rice is as she always was, and her story is a treasure. I am sad to see the Vampire Chronicles come to an end. She is, and always will be, the best author in vampire (and witch) lure.But dear one, see for yourself."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"To be honest, I was too excited about the storyline with the witches and vampires coming together to even notice the writing (good or bad, although normally I'm pretty picky about these things). Then again, I was always that kid who got super hyped up when two cartoons merged forces for an hour long special against an especially difficult villain. I was SO looking forward to the next book- until I found out there wasn't going to be one (at least not one I want to read)! I am so bummed out that one of my favorite writers has decided to write solely about her religion. Another one bites the dust! But- I do still love this book."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"What can I say about Blood Canticle other than give it a few days after reading it to stand back and say was this the end? Maybe even why the title? If so there is nothing better than her solution. I'ts beautiful. So long in the series Lestat seems to need a saviour but just doesn't have the wherewihthal to know where to find it. Thank goodness he never does and flies off to high expectations from here. That is my Lestat. He is finally himself here almost as he was in Interview With the Vampire.Lestat always has around him people that are close to him and choose death as a result of it.Well watch for Lestat to give readers a drubbing down. Nice one Anne. She is here with all her sly remarks and witholding promises but so be it. How many times am I going to hold her to her promises? Can't do that with Anne Rice. Lestat finally takes the bull by the horns. Again beautiful Anne..."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Anne Rice is back on her blood track. Lestat is back too and as lethally biting as usual. She brings together her two story lines : the Mayfair Saga and Lestat's Memoirs. It leads to some very fascinating moments where the psychology of the vampire, as it has evolved from that of the living being that was before, is explored in the various clashes each one of them has with the others, other vampires of course, but also human beings. And Anne Rice brings the Taltos line back into her writing. Fascinating too, but to a point. She decides to retrieve the Taltos from doom a little bit too late and she finds too many corpses that have been produced by a society, the Taltos society, that was doomed to get destroyed because of their own psychological and biological limits and possibilities and by the impossible commerce these Taltos can entertain with humans. They are taken over, which means destroyed both by the plotting members of their society and by the thugs of drug dealing. So we only get a description of their society through the survivors. It would have been interesting to enter this society and discover its shortcomings and its values and possibilities before they were destroyed. This is a little bit frustrating. But what is also kind of irritating is the fact that Anne Rice opens a great number of possible future developments but produces here a transitory book that does not really reach the level and height her novels generally reach. To the point of making a mistake and asserting that Lestat had to retrieve the microprocessor of a computer to take the memory of the computer along. Luckily she corrects the mistake later and this microprocessor becomes a hard drive, though only the hard disk was necessary. I find this volume a little less powerful than the previous ones and defintely less full of research and culture. Maybe she wanted to satisfy her readers who wanted a real Lestat again. Lestat may regress if he does not reach beyond what he has already done and into absolutely virginal lands. For sure he discovers love for a woman, and what woman, but this runs the risk of becoming a little bit soft in the intensity of the psychic and psychological exploration. And that poor Lestat loses his ambiguity in this adventure, though his ambiguity is his personal signature.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"After Blackwood Farm, anything would be hard to follow. I think this book was a great ongoing sequal to Blackwood. The new characture of Quinn and Mona could be a series all in itself, always with Lestat, the one we love the most, and Marius popping in. The New Orleans picture painted in these stories is beautifully described and much needed right now after the hurricane. I totally support Anne Rice and hope that the \\"bad\\" reviewers haven't turned her away from writing about our favorite charactures as life without them is uninteresting. We must keep Anne Rice writing, she is the only writer that writes about these charactures that you can't put the book down once you start. I await patiently for the next series. One suggestion, the first chapter Lestat sounds more like an angry Austin Powers, then it goes back to Anne Rice being channelled by Lestat. I can deal with that.....Go Anne."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Anne Rice has been one of my favorite authors of all times and i have enjoyed all her vampire novels. Expecting this book to be the same, i was dissapointed throughout the whole book. I did not read the Mayfair witch series because I wasn't interested in them in the first place. When she combined the two series together, i felt so lost and wondered why in the first place Anne Rice would do that. It was a waste of time and money. I do not recommend this book."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"i have read all of anne rices books x2, and i am very sad to see lestat and all the others go out like this. louis? armond? pandora? i love anne rice, but am very disappointed. drug lords, come on now, much more carnage then needed. julian was never scared of anyone, and mona was such a better character then that."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I love the language and voice of this author. All of her stories are worlds unto themselves but this was truly a masterpiece. There is so much raw emotion in the character Lestat--anger, jealousy, possessiveness, love, lust, guilt, tenderness--that you feel in touch with him as a though he were a living, breathing entity. In this book, more than any previously, you really see the evolution of the Lestat character. He BECOMES. No more is he merely the quixotic, daring and beloved brat prince. He is so much more than that.The story is full and rich, as are all of Rice's works. But there is something here that I think is quite different from her other works. I felt like I was reading something personal and unique in this book, and it touched me as no other book has before. At the end of the story I was sobbing, and I couldn't tell if it was from sorrow or illumination.This is a rare work, a priceless work. On the surface, this is a fun and exciting installment of the Vampire Chronicles. Lestat is at his very devilish best. But looking beneath that, to the raw core of the story, you can really see the fully blossomed talent of a modern master of the craft who has shared a great gift with us, her readers.I don't think I'll ever look at life and death, sin and salvation, the same way again."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"\\"Blood Canticle\\" concludes the \\"The Vampire Chronicles\\" crossing over with \\"Lives of the Mayfair Witches\\" alongside other independent novels that exist in the same universe. Falling back to an earlier character, Lestat de Lioncourt tells his tale on his final journey with not the original cast but with newly acquired Tarquin Blackwood and Mona Mayfair. The literary style has short clipped sentences and not as verbose or beautifully written as in the past.Outside of one particular vampire bloodbath that was very thrilling, the remaining parts uninterested me. Lestat, initially an engaging character, has become annoying and I do not wish to hear his babbling speech or read his stories anymore he has changed so much. Of course Lestat falls madly in love once more. As always, the created vampires are omnipotent, able to use any of the powers of an Elder and do not have the appreciation of one who struggled to survive.The entire Mayfair/Taltos/Vampire theme fusion has pushed the creative envelope giving way to an untrue vampire story. A nurse in the previous novel has her name spelled differently because apparently Quinn, who interacted with her on a semi-regular basis in that telling, didn't know how it was correctly spelled. Addressing such a thing was a waste of space and unnecessary. However the purpose of Stella and Oncle Julien is left unresolved, possibly answered in outside novels but I will not seek the answers elsewhere and end my experiences with this narrative.The author forgoes some of the traditional limitations found in the vampire genre such as the crucifix, holy water, and garlic, creating her own world where images on reflective surfaces are allowed. The outrageously powerful vampires have telepathy and the eldest can perform telekinesis and spontaneous combustion on the younger vampires, abilities I've not encountered in other works. I believe having certain restrictions on the undead brings some balance to the victims yet the novel isn't as much about the conflict between vampires and humans as it is about internal turmoil.Thank you."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I consider this novel just a simple follow-up to the Blackwood Farm story. I have never read any of the Mayfair books, but I know that Rowan and Michael are the main characters in that series, so I found interesting to know about them trough Blood Canticle.I really doesn't think that this is a good novel. Even when is not as bad as Blackwood Farm, it fails in a very strong point: you never fall in love with any of the characters, and Lestat's commitment with Mona's quest only tells me that he has a lot of free time. The Taltos being part of this story doesn't make it interesting at all.It seems to me that Anne wrote this book (and Blackwood farm also) only because she was trying to force even more the Mayfair family into the Vampire Chronicles. Te idea of witches turning into vampires is good, but Anne really fells short on exploding the capabilities of a witch vampire. In Merrick, the Talamasca menaced Lestat with starting an open war because of the Merrick's affair. Now, Mona is a vampire, too, and it seems that the Talamasca forgot it's former anger. And Louis, my favorite character from Anne's books, have received Lestat's (and David's) full strenght, and Anne hasn't exploded this point at all. Please Anne! Bring us a really interesting vampire novel, not the strange things you have done in the past few books!Also, I'm a little curious about how fast do Anne Rice's characters fall in love with each others. In Blackwood Farm, Tarquinn falls in love with Mona as soon as he first knows her. Same thing happens here with Lestat, who falls in love with Rowan in less than a few seconds. Generally speaking, falling in love usually takes some time, don't you think? I think that maybe this is the only way Anne can make a romantic novel out of a vampiric one.A final note: I am mexican, and also a christian, and I don't know what to think about all the references to Saint Juan Diego. I will only say that Anne did a good research on Juan Diego and the Blessed Mother of Guadalupe's tale."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I was really excited when I heard that this book was coming out. I have enjoyed all of the new Vampire Chronicles, but I was always vaguely dissatisfied with them because they didn't feature Lestat very heavily. &quot;Blackwood Farm&quot; features him of course, but the Lestat featured in &quot;Blackwood Farm&quot; doesn't seem very much like the Lestat of old. The Lestat in &quot;Blood Canticle&quot; wasn't very much like the Lestat of old either.I hestitate to say that I was disappointed in this book, but it didn't keep me as enthralled as the other Vampire Chronicles have. There wasn't a whole lot of suspense, and the style that the book was written in definitely didn't seem like the Anne Rice style that her fans have become accustomed to. It was very breezy, loose, and the language that was used made it seem like the book was written for an eighth grader instead of an adult. What has happened to the intelligence, the sophistication, the intricate plots, the suspense, the keen detail, and the character conflicts that Anne Rice used to write? I really hate to say it, but &quot;Blood Canticle&quot; is just a bit of fluff fiction that seems like it was written by a rookie writer just making her debut instead of the engaging, interesting, and mysterious writer that we all know Anne Rice can be. There is also no mention of what is going on with Louis, Armand, Marius, or any of the others in this book. Their names are mentioned only in connection to events that happened in Lestat's past, so you won't get to catch up with any of the other vampires in this book. I was especially disappointed by that because after I had read &quot;Merrick&quot; I really hoped that Louis would show up in this book and we would hear more about how he is coping with the stonger vampire powers that he received at the end of that book. You don't hear anything about what has happened to Louis lately at all.I'm not saying that you won't enjoy this book if you read it; it was nice to catch up with the Mayfair family and Lestat again, but you should prepare to be shocked at the drastic change in writing style that you will encounter when you read Blood Canticle. I know I was. Any fan of Anne Rice and the Vampire Chronicles/Mayfair Witches series should pick up this book and read it, but you should remember not to expect too much. This book won't really make you think, but it won't leave you with a ton of questions either (as most of her books do). 3 stars"},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Frankly, I think all of you who gave this novel one star suck. I think you suck because you're expecting a writer to live up to what *you* want. That's not what writing is about. Frankly, I've been amazed to see Anne churn out all these vampire books for so many years. The quality of the writing comes and goes, but for me they have not been her best works anyway. They're written to appease the masses and for once the masses aren't appeased. So what? Does that make her less of an author? No.Is every Dickens a masterpiece?Did Shakespeare really write all those plays with his name on them? (No!)My introduction to Anne Rice was The Witching Hour when I was eighteen years old. Following that, I read the other two in the series. I was enchanted, simply enchanted, and hooked on this writer who was brilliant. I can't remember which of her books I read next, seriously. I tried to keep up with what she was putting out between 93-2002 or so, and I think I did a fairly good job. However, I also went and read the things she wrote under pseudonyms. In fact, I think I read them before starting with the vampires.I read the Beauty series. I thought I was going to pass out, they were so good and I was ecstatic there were three of them! I couldn't guess what happened next, and she so thoroughly pulled me into the world she'd created that I was in love.Then, I read Belinda. There just aren't words for Belinda. I love that story. I love it with all my heart. It charmed me, it made me cry, it touched a little girl part of me that always wanted to be rescued (and loved) and never was.Exit to Eden. I was in lust with Exit to Eden. I've read it several times (that's saying a lot because I don't usually read books more than once). The twists and turns of the plot, the realism of the worlds she created, the emotional rawness of the characters and the way that rawness intersected with their sex lives.Then, finally, I came across one that was very old. One that no one really talks about, much. Cry to Heaven. It not only introduced me to subject matter I knew nothing about, but enthralled me. I wanted to know more, I wanted to learn more, I was inspired. I ate that book greedily and I still cry, like all of you vampire fans, that there wasn't more.In my opinion, all of these novels surpass the recent vampire novels in quality and depth. The depth of the characters, the depth of the plot, the emotional realism.In todays economy, the author is responsible to the fans, like it or not. So you've had your vampire novels, they keep coming. Now you want to cry because the last one, the end of the series no less, wasn't good enough for you. What about all the ones you absolutely loved? Weren't they *enough*? Weren't they enough of an achievement for any writer?I believe that in some ways Anne has stunted her growth as a writer by continuing to cover old territory. She's done that for a while. I think she probably has done it for the fans, for the people who love the vampires. Even if that wasn't the prime motivation, it factored in.I don't care if you want to knock her for the personal things she's got going on in her life. It really doesn't matter to me. What matters to me is her evolution as a writer. That hasn't been happening with the vampire series for some time now. I want to see more of Anne, not more of what her fans want to see."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Thanks to the accomplished voice of David Pittu the latest in the list topping Vampire Chronicles from Anne Rice simmers with suspense.

We will learn that she and Mona have much in common - all involving the murkily mysterious Taltos (an unearthly ancient race who resemble humans although not very much).Ms. Rice seems to have had a fine time imagining &quot;Blood Canticle,&quot; sparked by a kidnaping, rife with romance and adventure. Listeners will have a fine time, too."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"This wasn't my favorite of the Chronicles, but that doesn't mean anything. Notice the four stars. I think Interview is my favorite, but probably next is Memnoch, which I take it from the opening chapter of this book is not a popular opinion. I don't agree with many of the ideas presented in Memnoch; in fact I probably agree with almost none. What I do like is to read about a dynamic character in an interesting setting. Lestat is dynamic, and yet also always true to himself. After a trip to Heaven and Hell, wouldn't you have to make a decision?I shot through Blood Canticle just as fast as I did all the other Chronicles. Hardly stopped the whole way through. And Lestat didn't disappoint me. And he's changed. Witness the end, the way it ends with Rowan. No spoilers, but it was right."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I have no idea where the lot of you get off with the blatant bad-mouthing you've been doing. That isn't criticism, it's slander. I loved this book just like I adored every single book in the series. I was horrified when I found out that this book was undergoing such a barrage of insults. Not only that but I am very proud of Anne for coming here and telling you presumptious pseudo-intellectual braggarts what was up. It made me love her even more. Anne, you are a goddess.This book was marvelous. I would highly reccomend buying it."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I think my comments above say it all. This is probably the most boring/useless of the Vampire Chronicle books. Spend your time/money on something worth while...this isn't it."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I just finished re-reading Blood Canticle by Anne Rice. I get it now. How all the threads come together. It's actually quite beautiful.If you understand Memnoch the Devil as the midpoint in the series's development... and connect the parallel's between the various threads... It's actually kind of amazing. For example Quinn and Mona are the new Louis and Claudia. Even now Lestat hasn't quite perfected his existence but he... approximates. How much he's improved himself and his life.It doesn't quite tie up the individual stories for all the characters she's introduced to us over the years, which means it can never pass the fanboy test. It doesn't come to plot closure but it does come to thematic closure. The combinations of faith, love, evil, alienation and grief that she's been working out in the series are honed to their clearest point. The progress of her soul as represented by Lestat has gone about as far as it can with these characters.I will admit that I found the early sections of the book where Lestat was ranting at the audience, claiming he would present us with a more direct tale while portraying all the self-consciousness of the most pretentious of post-modern novelists... annoying as all hell. However, I forgive her, and him, for it as it's clear to me some of what she was setting up with that."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I've been reading Blood Canticle and am astonished at the philospohical overtones. Letstat is boundlessly optimistic, seeing wisdom generated from indulgence, knowledge from greed, strength from indolence. If true, then by allegory we can presume the USA is becoming the wiser, the smarter and the stronger by being indulgent, glutinous and lazy.This flies in the face of all religious thought, centering itself -- as it does -- around matrial deprivation as the key to intellectual aquisition.Lestat, in his lavish excesses and vanities, indeed seems to prove that affluence leads to wisdom. And America, big pregnant child, also seems to verfify Lestat's belief. I confess that I see the sense in it too. Destitution as I have experienced it has retarded my intellectual frowth, not enriched it.I'll stop here because another paragraph will be pesteferous. I very much enjoy Rice's intellectial content, her suberb writing style and her charming vampire (who chats with the Pope not only on equal terms, but on slightly condescending terms!) Anne Rice's Dickensonian appeal to America's millions says valumes about us as a people. We're going for the gold ring. I have so much more to say . . . ."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I really love anne rice and almost all her books, but this one wasnt one of her best. Since when has lestat ever used &quot;Yo&quot;. That just wasnt in his character. The good thing about this book was bringing the mayfair witches and vampire chronicals together again. As her last book for her vampire chronicals, it didnt really tie up any loose ends with marius or armond or any of them, not even lestat. But as her last I still enjoyed reading it, but hopefully, maybe she'll make just one more."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Anne has tried her best with this last book she is a wonderful person who gives to her fans all that she can.When she lost Stan she returned to her faith. She has already made it clear this will be her last book about Lestat. She wants light in her life and needs to leave the darkness behind for her own reasons.I loved the vampire chronicles and would love to have her write more.I agree that B.C wasn't her best, But I'm glad I bought it.I wish her all the luck with whatever she does and she will always have a fan in me."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I just visited the official Anne Rice website and read her thoughts about Blood Canticle. I had to admit I had some reactions about certain parts of the book but after reading her message... I understood more clearly the vitality of Lestat's voice and musings and overall element of the book. Initially I felt a bit like a stranger to Lestat with his introduction...I dont know why because I always look forward to his introductions on the chronicles and with this one... Im sorry but maybe i felt him babble a bit and got bored. I was also surprised to see the word COOL a number of times and there was even a YO. If Lestat felt he can pull it off... I can deal with it. Overall... As always I loved the book. I loved his longings to be good, thoughts about \\"pure love\\", his intimacy with mona and quinn, even when he's angry... i love it."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I agree with another reader that \\"Blood Canticle\\" is definitely not Anne's best endeavor. But, it is understandable why it isn't, being that her husband of forty years just passed away. People aren't even considering this. Think about it. Anne had been with Stan for two-thirds of her life. She basically grew up with this man! And she was obviously in a state of grief (for even as she wrote this, his health was failing rapidly). But here are her fans, her \\"loyal\\" fans, acting out like bunch starving vultures! I could care less whether anyone agrees with this review, or not. That is the way it is. I lost my wife five years ago, and I am practically still grieving. Stan just died eleven months ago! I mean, what is she supposed to do? HOCUS POCUS, I'M MAGICALLY OVER HIS SICKNESS, OVER HIS DEATH. TIME TO WRITE GROUNDBREAKING NOVEL! No. It doesn't work that way, folks. She is human. I would love to see even half of those whom gave negative, or downright harsh reviews, sit down and write some meaningful fiction (which in a state of grief, can be quite meaningless, I can imagine) after your spouse has just died weeks or months before. Please, you guys, be more understanding. Even more pathetic is a reviewer from another website, pretty much saying \\"Ah, first Anne's daughter died, now it's her husband that has died. So we're sure to get a good book out of her!\\" That's disgusting. Truly disgusting. What's wrong with everybody? This whole \\"who cares about Anne's feelings, just give me a good novel\\" thing is not so hot. Okay, so it's not a good ending to the Chronicles. I can understand your frustration. Just.....try not to be so heartless with your words."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I read this book in one day, couldn't put it down. I see it as having a more psychological and philosophical bent than the earlier ones (perhaps that's why some reviewers are so unhappy with it). Lestat is very different, it's true. But this book is not just a book about vampires and witches, but a testament to loss and the will to go on in spite of it, which may be a result of timing: Anne's husband Stan's devastating illness just at the time she was completing the book. I found it deeply moving. By the way, reviewers have referred to this as the sequel to Blackwood Farm, which it is, but it is also a sequel to Taltos, one of my favorites."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I'm avid reader and also an Anne Rice fan for decades. I fell in love which each book for their uniqueness and for the difference between each. There was a new world in each book. This book (and also the others) cannot be compared to each other. I always open a book with my own expectations and this one has meet all of them. Is fresh, new and not like any other. That's what makes a good book and a great writer. Unfortunately not all people can accept the fact that is HER book and she can direct her story and shape her characters which ever way she wants.Intriguing and intoxicating... give it a try.And for those of you who have enough time to bash at someone you don't even know to attack her directly; I'll be patiently waiting for your own book to come out."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"As a published author and avid reader from childhood, I can comprehend what it takes for many readers to lose themselves in a book. Anne does this to me in every book that she has written and I can never get enough of the Vampire Chronicles. I fear the series will end, but I hope not.As for writing style, she is one of the best. Some may not agree, but for those who find themselves transformed into the world of vampires and feel every words as through you are present in that remarkable places she creates, then Rice has done her job as an entertaining author.Blood Canticle was everything I dreamed it would be and more. With so many vivid characters to work with, Mrs. Rice could very well blow the Vampire world off the map. I hope there will be more, especially now with the new Brat, Mona Mayfair throwing her spoiled, childish personality into the works. With her being a new Blood Child, the possibilities are endless on the troubles she could cause for one and all. I can already imagine her (Mona Mayfair) taking off on her own, which would bring a good battle of skill, wit, and strength to battle with many of the other infamous Immortals, especially with LeStat, with a hopeful return of Louis. After all, he did start the whole Chronicle of Vampires, did he not? Let's just wait and see."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Anne Rice's latest book, Blood Canticle, in my opinion was amazing. The plot, storyline, and charactor interactions are just as touching and poignant as ever. It was quite nice to hear how old charactors were faring and the development of newer ones kept my attention mesmerized. Picking up this book was like hearing from an old friend; I can not wait for her next book to be published, appluad her accomplishment, and am waiting."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Having been an Anne RIce reader for most of my life, I was excited to read Blood Canticle. I fell in love with the Vampires, then the Mayfairs. I honestly don't understand what anyone could find wrong with this book.The characters are going through different issues, and in turn behave differently. Some of these reviewers make mention of the characters being \\"different\\" but thats because they are. Rowan has an understanding of what she is and why she is different. Having that level of understanding is bound to change a person.Additionally, the story itself is completely fullfilling. All the loose ends tied up. I would recommend this book without a doubt, especially to someone whose read all of the former books in the series.This book melded together both series beautifully. Anne Rice, if you are reading this, keep going, don't let these insipid pseudo intellectualists upset you. It seems silly for these people to write about something they don't like. Its like going to a concert and just to boo."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I used to wait eagerly for a book of Anne Rice and her Vampires Chronicles saga, sadly I will not be doing it anymore. Let's hope, for our sake that Anne Rice recovers her wit and writes more interesting books."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Of course I will always love Interview with The Vampire, The Vampire Lestat and The Queen of the damned. But many Anne Rice fans agree they go down hill from there. There are certain circles that refer to my previously mentioned first three vampire chronicles as the ONLY vampire Chronicles. All the rest come off like fan fictions from some other person.Nothing done now can change what had been. The Interview with the vampire is still the interview with the vampire. The Vampire Lestat is still The Vampire Lestat, The Queen of the damned is still The Queen of the damned. I just pretend it's 1989 and the others were not published yet. They did not happen.Lestat, in my mind, is still a rebel, still a brat, still mischievous, still questions things, still fearless, still angst driven, still a fighter, and still perseverent. He's still riding around on his Harley, hunting down his killers and falling in love with the world. He's still an optimist (He has a pessimistic view of humanity in Blood Canticle.) He still views society today as an age of innocence and he's still my Lestat. All the rest... to me.. They're just fan fictions.I wish Anne Rice had done a book that she once hinted about years ago. The idea of the vampires being found out by some mortals and possibly captured and studies and then the escape... Lestat talks about this idea in The Vampire Lestat. That could have been a great novel, especially with our proud and defiant Lestat. This conformist, prude, depthless, two-dimensional Lestat would fold under that pressure but the Lestat I know would not. The first three vampire chronicles- that's my Lestat. That will always be my Lestat and no one can take that away from me.Lestat in this book is whining, conformist, a hard-core Catholic who questions nothing, a cold hypocrite, a misogynist, a prude, and pessimist. This is not our Lestat! Our Lestat was a brat. Our Lestat questioned things. Our Lestat was always a rebel. Changing his personality this abruptly is like saying he now has blue hair and orange eyes. The angst is gone. The fearless soul that could never be oppressed is gone. I did not love the fangs or the blonde hair. I loved his personality. I related to Lestat, not the vampire! She's forgotten who Lestat was. Lestat used to see this world as an age of secular innocence where evil doers were scarce. And now he says there are many in the cities who deserve the vampire's kiss. He's become depthless (if he had much depth to begin with.) He's two dimensional. He's hunting down rogues and rule breaker vampires! He is a rogue and rule breaker! I want Lestat, I don't want Angel from Buffy The Vampire Slayer!I want Lestat the way he was meant to be. If Anne Rice needed a new character to express her obsession and new-found conformist mentality she should have used ANYONE but The Brat Prince to express it! I think this book disappointed every Anne Rice fan, everywhere, one way or another.I know I'm being harsh but Anne calls this maturing for Lestat. Being mature does not mean clinging desperately to something without question. Being mature does not mean becoming sexist with fashion, and seeing evil everywhere where he once was in love with the goodness in society. Lestat was a brat but he had faith in goodness. Now he doesn't seem to have that faith. His real and pure faith has been replaced by something superficial, something dark. And the restless spirit, the angst driven rebel, the one who could not be dominated... Our beloved antagonist, he's gone.... I don't know who this creature is narrating the story but it's not our Lestat."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Apparently Anne Rice has decided to sacrifice quality for being on the best-seller list. Having read all of her books, I was hopeful after reading Blackwood Farm, but not anymore. If you want to read great Anne Rice, try the Vampire Chronicles before Memnoch and the Mayfair witches before Canticle. She's turned into the McCaffrey of horror, writing more for money than quality. This book is a disgrace to the fans and to their beloved Brat Prince."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"What happened Anne? What is it that possessed you to write this miserable piece of literature? I have been finished with the book for just over a week now. I thought perhaps giving it time to sink in would help (as it did for Violin and Blood and Gold) but a week removed and I still hate this book as vehemently as I did when I finished it. After reading the last chapter I cried for a solid half-hour - mourning the loss of characters and stories that I dreamed of that Anne would not come through with.I was hoping for a magnificent send-off for our favorite Ricean vampires! A farewell to end all farewells. No chance of ever coming back. Lestat going down in a blaze of glory.No, instead we get Lestat going down in a blaze of self-pity. I was disgusted with what Anne has done with Lestat. I realize that we have not really gotten a taste of Lestat since Memnoch but I never imagined that he would turn out to be obsessed with redemption. I think, instead, she is speaking of herself when she speaks through Lestat.Lestat's monologues and dialogues with Mona and other characters are a travesty! What happened to our well-spoken vampires? Why is Lestat using &quot;dude&quot;? Editors Anne. Please. USE THEM.I once admired and looked up to the &quot;great&quot; Anne Rice. Now, I'm searching for a new favorite author."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Fortunately, I was wise enough after struggling through the god-awful &quot;Blackwood Farm&quot; not to run out and purchase &quot;Blood Canticle&quot;, choosing to get it from the library instead (surprise:brand new book, no waiting list!). I didn't think anything could get as pathetic as &quot;Blackwood&quot;, but boy was I wrong! This book is a bad joke. All of the spiritual conflict and superb characterization of her first ten-or-so novels is gone, and she seems to be doing a Saturday Night Live commercial for Catholicism. I'm not sure why I'm even bothering to write this, except maybe as a plea to Anne Rice herself.I often wondered how such an incredibly gifted author could have slid from masterpieces like &quot;Interview With the Vampire&quot; and &quot;The Witching Hour&quot; to the utter c#@p she's putting out now.However, on her website, Anne gives a very good answer: she doesn't use an editor, or use any objective input other than her own! This may have worked for awhile, when her publisher was so pleased with her sales they allowed her carte blanche to submit any old thing she could type out, but I'll bet that's about to change with her ever-dwindling readership.I recently saw Anne on a talk show, and she appeared to be as sharp, brilliant, and charming as ever, but not a drop of that is spilling onto the page.Please, Anne, stop insulting your fans with these dreadful, laughable books. If &quot;Blood Canticle&quot; is the best you can do, it's time to retire."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Whenever a new vampire chronicles book comes out; I run out, get it, and read it right away. The classics like Vampire Lestat, Queen of the Damned....and even the individual focus books on Pandora and Marius were mystical and exotic. Those books took the reader on a journey through time with the tortured central character. Lestat was always the brat prince in all of us; and in his adventures we found our thrills.This new novel by Anne Rice is the finale of the series. As a finale, it is very much a let down. I couldn't believe that the story had no driving plotline....and seemed so meandering. Lestat seemed like a shadow of himself.I found myself bored with the text. Usually Anne Rice is so descriptive of the world that these Vampires live in, but in this book descriptive text is thrown around like an afterthought.I have read every book in this series; and this was a very disappointing finale. Instead of going out with as Lestat would say, &quot;A bang, baby!&quot;. The story ends with a whimper, leaving the reader not caring about what happens to Lestat or all the other characters....and what a shame that is. I think that the author needs to get away from these characters for awhile and come back once she is fully recharged and has a story worth telling.My final point is that the novel seems almost rushed to conclusion. The new one came out about a year after the last one (Blackwood Farm), and seems like it was put out just to fulfill a contractual obligation to the publisher. Go to the library and read it if you must, but otherwise just skip it and reread the prior novels. They are more satisfying to reread than this novel."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I'm more a fan of the Mayfair Witches (and, to be fair, really only of The Witching Hour, although I've read Lasher, Taltos, and Merrick), and don't know much of the Vampires beyond the movie. But I found Blood Canticle to be readable and interesting enough to keep me moving through the book--unlike Taltos, with which I got very impatient and Merrick, which never caught my interest.What this book \\"felt like\\" to me was the end of a prematurely-cancelled television show, where the various loose ends are wrapped up as conveniently as makes sense. (Did anyone ever see the last episode of \\"Once and Again\\"? Like that.) It offers a resolution to those who desire it. In fact, it was SO tidy, it almost felt like a fantastical fan-fic, bringing favorite (if you can call Rowan a \\"favorite\\") characters together to resolve two separate storylines.Maybe Rice is just tired of the whole vampire/witches thing. Has anyone else who's had the same job for over 20 years ever got tired of it? And instead of coming out and saying \\"please quit bothering me about these characters\\" she wrote this to give everyone an ending. I think it was a kind thing to do.Also, if I read the dates on the book correctly, she finished writing the story around the same time she found out her husband had cancer. I don't think one had to do with the other. To those who are being mean to her about her personal life, please stop. Don't you have any imagination? Can't you imagine what it would feel like to have the death of a loved one thrown at you as a criticism? Lame."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"This book was hard to get through. Being a fan of Lestat, it was hard for me to accept that out of nowhere he starts talking like Brandon Kutcher. Saying \\"that's cool man\\" and \\"dude.\\" It ruined it for me."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"After reading positive reviews (including 2 star) of this &quot;book&quot;, I must say that taste has gone way down hill.&quot;Blood Canitcle&quot; is the worst book I have ever read. What makes it even worse is that Anne used to be such a great writer. This is just... I'm not sure how to describe it. It's almost as though she's just given up. After Blood and Gold, Blackwood Farm and now Blood Canticle, I know I have given up as well. Give me Queen of the Damned or even Merrick... I take anything over this door stop.The positive reviews still baffle me. I can only assume that these people would gush over anything that Ms. Rice cares to dole out. It's time to stop praising this &quot;writer&quot;, and it's time to stop donating to &quot;Cash Cow: The Vampire Chronicles&quot;."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"In the first pages of Blood Canticle, Anne Rice's beloved Vampire Lestat tells us not to fret, that this story will pick up where Blackwood Farm left off and that the story will have a beginning, a middle and an end (in other words, a plot). Well, Rice has just made a liar out of Lestat, because there is very little plot to be found in Blood Canticle. As a matter of fact, there is very little to appreciate in this self-loathing, overrought novel.The novel more or less does pick up the loose ends of Blackwood Farm. This time, it is the young, sickly Mona who is made into one of the undead, upon Quinn's demand. But Mona proves to be Lestat's female counterpart; mean, always complaining, unrespectful and with very little love left in her. The one thing she does wants most, however, is to find the daughter who was stolen from her so many years ago.Her daughter was one of the Taltos, a strange kind of creature that grows tall in just a few days and who nearly kills the mother that gives birth to them. She asks Lestat to help her find this people so that she can be with her daughter once again.And that's it. Lestat will moan about a ghost that will not leave him alone and Quinn, the great, carismatic protagonist of Blackwood Farm, is nearly forogtten and completely underused. And the melding of Rice's vampire and witches series doesn't go as smoothly this time around.Anne Rice's The Vampire Chronicles had taken a hard blow in the last few years, only to be given life again with Blackwood Farm. But now, it almost seems as though Blackwood Farm was a fluke, because Blood Canticle has very, very little to offer fans of the series. Even Letat has changed, and for the worst. Maybe it's time for Anne Rice to put the Chronicles to rest for a while to concentrate on something new and fresh."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I loved the book. I read most of her other books and they were all really good. I was not disappointed by this last book I actually enjoyed this one more than Interview with the vampire that had its boring moments."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I finished this book in one night, unable to put it down, literally. There very well may be answers that are left to speculation as some have not so eloquently put it in earlier reviews, but so what? I know I personally need things to ponder to keep my Beloved fresh in my mind. If everything was neatly wrapped up, it would leave no hope, no faith, no wonder to the Vampire/Mayfair legacies. I was completely satified and drawn into all aspects of this piece of fine artwork. This is a piece of someone's mind we are reading here...And I have read about 25 pieces thus far...We should be past the point of criticising by now. It dissapoints me to read all the negative remarks about a book so interestingly written. It is a different approach to the books of past, but it is our Beloved Lestat, Mona and Quinn and it is wonderful to be within their embrace once again."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I loved this novel, but the only thing I didn't like was that Rowan and Michael just kinda fell apart. They seemed so passionate in The Mayfair Chronicles, and then it was just gone. Why Anne? Why?To some of you who like to complain about Lestat being different than he was in the first three novels, have you ever stopped to think and understand that yes, it is possible for someone to grow, wether they're alive or undead? As Ms. Rice stated, she is the voice of Lestat, and she herself has grown in the years since she has written Interview with the Vampire."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"As a long-time Anne Rice fan, I was absolutely delighted with her latest tale. For years, I have longed for a merger of Witches and Vampires. Now I finally have it. And what's more, it's FUN! An exhilarating read. Well, done, Anne!(...) What on earth gave you the idea that Anne should write exactly to your specifications? How absurd! Art is art. It begs no explanation. You are entitled to your opinion, but slander is unacceptable. This book is fantasy. This book is fiction. It is not the be-all end-all of human existence or the answer to life and death's greatest questions. This book is simply a beautifully and thoughtfully woven tale of the collision of two worlds.ANNE, I am sorry you've had to deal with the foolish ravings of those who haven't the courage or the stamina to do what you do. I believe in you, I believe in your writing, and I look forward to your next book. Thank you for many, many years of gut-wrenching, thought-provoking, and heart-warming entertainment. Keep it coming!"},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"A true Anne Rice fan...will know that this is the best so far....too bad its the last...as a 20 year fan its too bad that i will no longer read anything good from her again...she has become a born again writer..i will stick to the old ones..."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Ms. Rice has gotten so many ugly comments on this book, I have NO idea where they come from! Some people need to grow up and stop saying such nasty things. Ms. Rice has more writing talent in her little pinky finger than most authors out there put togetber.

Give this book a chance and do not listen to those horrible, cruel people.I am a devoted fan and will be always!"},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"While this book may have been short and lacking the usual poetry we have come to expect from Anne Rice it is, I feel our own fault. She states in the book that while MtD may have sold well, fans did not get it. Notice how up until Lestat's rant in the begining of BC she eluded to another book of his journeys with angels? She has realized that many fans don't seem to want to read what she wants to write. So she has written a book for the masses. She was trying to satisfy all the readers who seem to want a continuation of the story rather than her usual poetry. It is our own fault for not letting her know how awesome MtD really was. Shame on us for not supporting her when she wrote from her heart. Stan's death I am sure was a factor. But she has shown in the past the her greatest writing is done when she herself is at her lowest. It is her escape. We have no one to blame but our selves. Long live Lestat!!"},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"i haven't read Blood Canticle but i can't wait because i'm such a huge fan of Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles. I agree, Armand was just so so boring..i couldn't put myself to reading it. But wow..the reviews for Blood Canticle..i hope it isn't as bad as every one says it is. Though i would love to see Marius and Pandora back in."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Why 5 stars you ask? Well, I think we as readers sometimes fail to take everything into account. We merely read and forget to look at the literature, which we are lucky to have, as a great work of the mind. For most it is a simple escape...a fantasy. However, Anne Rice continues to stay true to herself and isn't that what we all constantly complain about...to find some author who won't be a big sell-out. She has an extensive knowledge of myth, folklore and history and she has continued time and time again to prove these books are a labor of true love. One could never accomplish these wonderous works she has given us time and again if it were merely her bread and butter. This is a really good book if you as the reader can take the time to appreciate all the labor she has dedicated herself to in order to give us intelligently written romantic horror fiction. Please take the time to take it all in and don't rush through for a small fix because she gives us a huge fix if we can find the beauty in her work once again."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"This book is great!!And I really don't see a problem in Ms. Rice's reaction to the harsh reviews, as a matter of fact I would react the same way. Offcourse you may not like a book, but to say it in the ways you do it, that is really harsh, so who are you people to judge Anne's reply?This just makes me mad, because yes, I love all of Ms. Rice's books (exept the erotica ones I think, but I did not read them and dont intent to as well, because I know it will not be my thing) but what if I would read the erotica books? What if unlike her other books I did not liked them? I wouldn't not dislike Anne Rice's other books for that, or tell everyone to not read any more of her books like someone here said. That was a real stupid thing to say!I think Ms. Rice has a great mind and creates great story's and she has the courage to write what she desires to write, I don't see a lot of writers who dare to do that, and I truly love her boldness in the stories.I love Anne Rice's books, and none of your harsh critisms will stop me from doing so.And Ms. Rice if you happen to read this, dont worry, there are tons of ppl who love your work, as you can see by the amount of postive reviews, and you really dont need to justify yourself to these kinds of people.

The rich, well drawn characters, need to return and hopefully, with responses from readers, she will go back and bring back our favoite vampire and his newest companions. I have read all of them, from the beginning, and have reread most, and reread Blackwood Farm before starting Blood Canticle, which I will reread. Please, Anne, more...more...bring back LeStat!Queen of the Damned was my favorite until I read Blood Canticle.I was very disappointed in the movie \\"Queen...\\", it was the longest book and was ill adapted as a story in a screenplay."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Ok, I would just like to clarify that I have not completely finished Blood Canticle. However, I was so upset by all the negative posts about this book, I had to write something before I finished it. Anne Rice is a clever writer and for anyone to say she is burned out or that she didn't even write this book is ridiculous! You can clearly tell it is Anne writing this novel, she is just bringing Lestat into modern times by switching his vocabulary. Remember, he loves humans, it's natural that he would mimick their mannerisms. I do admit that I could do without the &quot;!!!!!!!!&quot; over-exaggerated punctuations, but Anne is just doing something different. And having Lestat go on a quest to become a saint and end up being Lestat anyway, what do you really expect? Lestat is Lestat, he loves how he is and wouldn't change a thing. I would be terribly disappointed if he was redeemed and was cannonized. As for this being her last novel, you never know. Her husband died, her Lestat died with him. Maybe she will find another muse. Don't give up on Anne, and don't bash this book, she has written 25 amazing books (even if some weren't too good, I would like to see others do better) and has kept readers enthralled for years."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"It is my wont to not read reviews for books until after I've finished them. Often I find that I laugh at the vehemence of other readers over their feelings for the characters and authors they either labaste or glorify. Rarely do I find a book reviewed from such opposing poles as this one. I just had to throw my hand in.I fell in love with Lestat in 1988, when by some chance I acquired Interview from the Science Fiction Book Club at age 13. Throughout the years I followed his escapades, often devouring one of the Chronicles in the space of a day. I recall first picking up Lestat from the library and tearing through it with wild abandon in the summer of 1990. I remember thrilling at the antics of the Brat Prince through the intro for Queen Of The Damned when I borrowed it in softcover from a neighbor.Slightly disappointed as I was by Body Thief the first time I read it, subsequent perusal prior to the release of Memnoch showed a subtle power which rode me like a night hag through to the finale. Memnoch... Others seem not to understand some of the metaphorical depth there... But Faust is a tale that never grows old, and retelling old stories is stock-in-trade for all good bards. I find something new on each reading of it.The stories of the others... Armand, Pandora, and the inimitable and underappreciated Vitorio... Each brought joy to me and showed depths of character and skill in Ms. Rice... showed her growth, and the fact that she was as tired with the antics of the Brat Prince as we, her constant readers (To paraphrase Mr. King) were. I watched her find him again, fall in love with him again (as did I) in the final pages of Merrick.Sometime betwixt the reading of Merrick and the release of Blood & Gold, I tore through the lives of the Mayfair Witches... Julien will always be the icon of the consumate southern gentleman, Faust in his own way (and you know what they say... If at Faust you don't succeed... My appologies to the late lamented Mr. Zelazny). And Blood and Gold I consumed... twice in the week I purchased it. Marius ever was my favorite.Years pass... Five years have gone by and I've changed. I was in a bookstore last week and found a copy of Blackwood Farm. What the hell, I thought. So I bought it. It took me three nights to get through. After I went through and read the others once more. Yes. The Brat Prince was back. In all his glory.Yesterday at nine in the evening I started reading Blood Canticle. I finished it less than a half hour ago... 12:30 PM. Lestat's voice ringing in my ears once more... The same voice he used in his original autobiography. Changed, yes... But time changes us all. I laughed at his rant over Memnoch. Some might think it gauche, but I admire the guts it took for Ms. Rice to give us all a piece of her mind. I found myself laughing and weeping along with our hero and his companions, thrilled by the mixture of ghosts, action, and humor... Romance in the classical sense.And I smile at the idea of Saint Lestat.It is a fitting end to a long and beautiful story. Although I already find that I long for the voice of Lestat again, I accept that I will likely not again, any more than the words of Lazarus Long are likely to come to me from Robert Heinlein's grave.Nick Cave said it best:\\"And so I kissed her goodbyeSaid 'All beauty must die'And I leant down and planted a rose 'tween her teeth\\""},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I have recently read all of the Vampire Chronicles and Lives of the Mayfair Witches books, and I must say that I enjoyed this book. Lestat is back at it again, along, this time, with Quinn and Mona Mayfair. If you have not read the LOTMW series, then I recommend you do so, if you want to fully understand this book. I would like to comment on a reviewer who said that Lestat is a &quot;goody goody guy.&quot; He is indeed not a goody-goody, though he indeed talks about wanting to be a Saint. After what he has been through in Memnoch the Devil, it is entirely understandable. He has seen both Heaven and Hell, and is still a little out-of-shape from his experience. Fear not, potential reader, for Lestat is still most certainly the Brat Prince, through and through. He just has his moods, and so does everybody. But again, I warn you, this book covers a great deal on the Mayfairs and the Taltos. Also, give Anne credit where credit is due. She has produced a wonderful series, the best books about vampires that I have read, and she again delivers a good book. If you have previously read the other books in the Chronicles, then it might be good to read this book."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Challenge it, then.If you must. You obviously must. Where someone can go and how someone can feel. Right, well, after having spent the last half-hour reading the reviews I'm sure you'll find below... wow, some of you really trashed this piece of work. Please explain to me... devoted fan or first-time reader... what is so terrible about someone (fine, in this case, Lestat) contemplating the mere thought of being... and let's not get carried away here... GOOD. We are surrounded by the common, reasonable debates of goodness everywhere. Are we not deserving of a little unreasonable, passionate consideration of the subject? Someone brave enough to take it to extremes? If you are not able to handle the emotional and abstract wonderings of the heart and mind... then, Anne, is not the author for you. The book. It is an artfully worded journey on the above referenced contemplation. It's strange. It's a strange situation to begin with. Isn't that what makes it wonderful? The story itself... well, so, it's sad. Yeah, crime of the century. That characters might feel something as far fetched as dissapointement and frustration and the pangs of searching and hope. You wanted the sunset. Admit it. Well, it's Lestat. Creature of the night. The sunset is bound to be complicated. And Lestat, himself... well, he loves getting a rise out of people. And I think that if a piece of work can bring forth a discussion, a questioning, a disagreement, and passions as strong as those that are clearly here... then, it was worth it's time to the world. Otherwise, if this is your first Anne Rice book, don't make it your last. This woman is alive, bold, unafraid of description and adventure. All she asks is for you to be open to the same."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"This book was terrible!!!

Personally, I was relieved that this book brought entertainment back into the vampires' lives. Armand bored the hell out of me and then I was unfortunate enough to read Blood and Gold which seemed to me was the exact same book. My only disappointed lay in poor Merrick's fate after such a short time. If I were you, I would stop whining about Rice's writings. I thought this book a work of art, but then again I've always been fond of crossovers. Oh, and what the hell happened to Louis and David?"},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Oh, I \\"get it\\" alright. This book is rushed from beginning to end. All the descriptions, a highlight of most Anne Rice books, are complete asides, and even written in parentheticals as if to underscore that AR does not feel like describing things any more. I love the character of Lestat, and there may have been some minor advancements, but the best thing I can say about this race to wrap up the story of the Taltos was that it was a quick read. Lacks the density and richness of the other books. I was not crazy about Menmnoch, but still found it an interesting read."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I understand that over time we all use slang, but the amount in this book felt very forced. Like Lestat was trying to remind us how cool he is (or at least was). And I can even understand that he wants to be good, but saintly? From previous books the only reason Lestat would want to be saintly is to be worshipped. His reasons why seem more political than religious. At least we know he watches CNN. His saintly obsession just goes overboard.I was very disappointed that the book did not center on a more vampirical story. In Merrick, Lestat left with Louis, David and Merrick. In Blood Canticle, not a mention of why he parted their company just that he had been alone for months. It has been a long time since we have seen many of the vampires together. I was hoping that Maharet would come to see Lestat. The constant fighting and making up reminding me over a bad romance movie. Lestat was indeed bespelled by Blackwood Farm because his sauve nature sure melts away. Hasn't he used a computer before? Lestat and Rowan falling in love, I'm thinkging no. It felt like I was supposed to be feeling more depth between them, like an unspoken bond, but I just couldn't.Peace Keeper Quinn, the pretty backdrop. And with Mona is with like Rice was trying to combined Claudia and a young Lestat, but she apologized so quickly I just started to become annoyed.Yes, this is my 'stupid' opinion.

It is Random House and Anne Rice hoping that people will buy it simply because it is a Vampire Chronicle. But is absolutely the worst novel that I have ever read.Anne Rice has always been hit (Queen of the Damned) or miss (Blackwood Farm). But &quot;Blood Canticle&quot; is so bad that it defies even being cataorgized as a miss. Stupid, incoherent, and mind numbingly insipid, this book should be propping up the missing leg on your sofa.Characters are eviscerated. Well developed plot lines from previous novels are thrown away in a sloppy attempt to put to rest subject matter Anne Rice is bored with. It is so insulting and so base that will not ever waste my time with another Anne Rice novel."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Why waste my time with an extensive review? Anne Rice can't even be bothered to even attempt a half-way decent novel. I mean &quot;Yo&quot;, &quot;Little Bro&quot;... that's just stupid.Plain and simple, &quot;Blood Canticle&quot; is a disaster. Anne Rice's book contract should be torn up, and she should retire before she humiliates herself any further."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I absolutely loved the Mayfair witches novels - until &quot;Taltos.&quot; Then the series took off in a direction that can only be classified as &quot;tripe.&quot; Poor Anne Rice - I think she has finally run out of inspiration for her novels of the supernatural. Having suffered through &quot;Blackwood Farm,&quot; I thought, well, let's try one more time. Thank heaven Ms. Rice is putting the Vampire Lestate to bed (in fiction, at least - there's rumours of a Broadway musical, heaven forfend!). The legion of fans who have made Ms. Rice a best-selling author deserve better than this sloppy, boring, idiocy that passes for fiction. Pass it by and re-read &quot;The Witching Hour,&quot; if you need a Rice fix."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Oscar Wilde once said that there's no such thing as a bad book, just badly written ones. Well, this was definitely a badly written book. It's very inconsistant with the characters and personalities in the other novels and I certainly would not call what she's done with the character of Lestat maturing. A terrible, terrible way to end it. It should have stopped at Memnoch the Devil. There is such a thing as over kill.For those starting out The Vampire Chronicles should be read in order...Interview with The VampireThe Vampire LestatThe queen of the damnedThe Tale of the body thiefMemnoch The DevilPandoraVittorio The VampireThe Vampire ArmandMerrickBlood and GoldBlackwood FarmBlood CanticleYou want Lestat, take my advice, stick with the novel with his name in the title."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"First off, Lestat wants to be a wholesome saint....that will tell you something about this book. Anne Rice turned Lestat from our loving Brat Prince into....i don't even know what! Not to mention that there is way to much stuff about Taltos and Lasher. The entire book is centered around the now, meek Quinn and the bratty little fledgling Mona. No other characters are even in the book from the Chronicles besides Lestat and Quinn. And for the last of the books, shouldn't they be included. Louis is reffered to once, and not even by Lestat, and Maharet sends Lestat a letter. Come on!! The book is littered with Christian refrences that just ruin it. The book is slow and again, way too much about Taltos and Mona. I WANTED LOUIS, ARMAND, AND MARIUS AT THE LEAST. It was very dissapointing, and the only reason i read the whole thing through was in hopes that another Vampire would be included. Sigh. I could have written a better finale! Sigh. Oh Brat Prince, what a way to go!"},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I just want to say how much I was looking forward to this book (especially after hearing that it would be the final installment of the Vampire Chronicles). I own and have enjoyed all previous books in the series.That being said I was exptemely disappointed with Blood Canticle. Lestat began his &quot;change&quot; a few books back but I think it was taken to far. He's become boring, for lack of a better word.I like the combination of the Mayfair witches and the Vampire Chronicles. I was also looking forward to seeing what happened to the Taltos, but it just seemed all wrong for an Anne Rice book. It's like she rushed through it. There wasn't her usual elegant descriptivness about the things going on. I think there was too much going on for a book just over 300 pages long. I also didn't like how the Taltos story line ended (as far as Ash and Morigan were concerned).Aside from that, where were the other characters from the series? If this is indeed the final book it would have been nice to include something about some of the other characters (I don't think Loius wasn't even mentioned).Overall very disappointing...I hope Ms. Rice will take some time and come back in a few years with another of Vampire Chronicles if only to wrap things up more fittingly."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"This has to be the most forced out book I read and one that is total incredulous (vampire stories are anyway, but it still has to make sense). Heck, no one talks like the way Lestat talks! Get real! Slang is ok, but carried to extreme as AR does it becomes tiring and just plain irritating. It takes the focus off the story. I had to put it down after 50 pages. What's the matter with you AR? You've written enough books to know that. My guess is you needed the money to pay your bills and you weren't inspired or had any stories left in you. The BC, rather than being a labour of love is more like the results of constipation. I think I'll send it back to you for a full refund like you suggest in your litany and I hope other paying customers that you offend do likewise. Maybe you'll be more grateful and perhaps a little more humble."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"From the opening pages, I was like..\\"what is this nonsense?\\" Lestat, whom I love and adore, sounds so different and quite honestly, ridiculous. He isnt the same Lestat he once was. Rice has made him uninteresting, for the first time. I didnt even think that was possible! He is so subdued, and almost weak. No more strong, dangerous, sexy \\"force\\"? Well, i love him anyway. But Mona is way too predictable and it seems Rice was sort of stuck in a rut with her character, very repetitive and boring. Even Quinn's charisma was gone, he was almost like an afterthought. I didnt like the focus on the Mayfairs, I wanted and expected the vampire story line, not Taltos. And Lestat falling in love with Rowan? It didnt ring true at all, I couldnt connect with that. This book sounded like Rice was just trying to write and get it over with. It didnt even sound like she was into the story! Or even cared about it. Very disappointing."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"As for the Amazon service in getting me the book - they get an A+. As for Anne Rice's tale, well, she has done better. This one rambles around and fills the book with useless descriptions of New Orleans, but the story line is very weak. It is obviously an additional attempt to link the famous Lestat character with the Mayfair witches. Doesn't play well. This is one of Anne Rice's novels that could be skipped and not missed."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I recently wrote a review more of other peoples' reviews of this book. Now, I figure it's time to review the actual book, but since we can only write one review per item, I'm writing this under the paperback listing.I first read \\"Interview With the Vampire\\" twelve years ago, in the tenth grade. I have since read every Vampire Chronicle to be released. Just quickly, I'd like to say I felt the best volumes were \\"Interview With the Vampire,\\" \\"The Vampire Lestat,\\" \\"Queen of the Damned,\\" \\"The Vampire Armand,\\" and \\"Blood and Gold.\\"The other books were not quite what I've come to expect in this series, but that's not really for me to judge. Overall, it's been a wonderful series, and I truly am a little sad to see that she's closed the overall story.\\"Blood Canticle\\" was a very quick read, yet still full of her usual attention to details that give you a very good image of the characters, places, objects and events in her stories. The character development, though rapid, was ample.One of the things that has made Ms. Rice's Vampire Chronicles so interesting and engrossing has been her dealings with existence, spirituality, mortality, and other aspects of \\"human\\" life. Much of these dealings are missing from \\"Blood Canticle.\\" Almost the only thing I saw throughout this book was a dealing with lust. However, lust has been explored, in depth, and at great length, many times throughout almost all her works.The one thing I saw in this story that was unique to her dealings with Lestat was his refusal to give the \\"dark gift\\" to someone with whom he is deeply in love. This is the first time he has put his selfishness, loneliness, and lust second to his desire to see a generally good person continue to do good things with the abilities and resources available to her. He has seen the work she does, and he can comprehend just how vast and promising it is. He has deemed this far more important than his own needs and wants.This ability to put the needs of others before one's own is an absolute must for anyone to be deemed a saint. Perhaps Lestat took the biggest step he could have toward reaching sainthood.Ultimately, that's what this book was supposed to be about...Lestat's desire to become a saint. However, the story's dealing with this theme has been, until just this moment, as I write this review, seemingly nonexistent. It was never clear, as I read the story, that Lestat was doing anything in particular to achieve the goal he talked about, almost tiresomely, at the beginning of, and throughout, the book. However, I have to say that it makes me grin to think back on it now and realize that I didn't see the most saintly event in the book for what it actually was.But, since the event was treated with no more importance than anything else that happened in the story, I have to wonder, also, if Ms. Rice understood that she was giving Lestat his first true taste of sainthood as she wrote about his turning Rowan down for the dark gift, especially for the reasons he did so.This is the end of the Vampire Chronicles, as has been mentioned. Its ending, however, didn't feel at all like an actual farewell, let alone like an ending to a series that has now run nearly thirty years.As books go, without considering the complete body of works in the Vampire Chronicles, it was, I feel, a decent work. Some of her works have been much better, but some have also been much worse. However, her books, in general, are still considerably better than many works several \\"renowned\\" authors have turned out over the years.This book left me wondering what the next installment of the Vampire Chronicles will be like, but, as Ms. Rice has made unmistakably clear, she is finished with this series. So, I must admit there is a bit of disappointment in this last story, because I don't feel it fulfilled the role of ending the series. But, again, as a book in its own right, it's not bad.So, I'll end in saying that, considering the fact that you can pick up hardcover copies for pretty cheap at bookstores, you wouldn't be remiss to add it to your library. If you read it and find that you didn't like the story, well, put it on a shelf anyway. You may come to a point in your life when the story will make perfect sense to you, and you will come to love it. You just can't know until it happens, but if you never buy the book and read it, you'll never have the chance to know, either. I can think of far worse risks to take than giving this book a try."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I fell in love with Rowan Mayfair in Rice's previous works, but am disappointed with her character in Blood Canticle.

He seems petty, trite, and comical. I dont know. I feel a bit wishy about this so far. Mona doesnt seem right either, more like a trashy teen gone wild, which she always sorta was, but at least she had a better vocabulary ! Will revise this when I finish. I guess the other books held more mystery & history.12/1/03...okay I have been finsihed this book for a couple weeks now. I will say, to quote the author from Pandora: \\" If you so cling to reason,then in the passage of time reason may fail you,and when it does you may find yourself taking refuge in madness\\" I think Ms. Rice has done exactly this. Why ? She has totally destroyed the characters that we, her readers have loved. Sorry, this book was a disappointment."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I can't believe I spent good money on this book and then reading her disdain toward all of us for not liking this s@!@ bomb is just absolutely detestable. I can't stand her now and her Cannon books are only fit for toilet paper for the homeless YOU STILL NEED AN EDITOR. I've had email conversations with her through email and you would never have thought to see her as the kind of snooty deluded witch she really is after I read her answer to those of us who disliked Blood Canticle. Even though it is deleted off of Amazon thank God someone had the presence of mind to copy and paste it and put it elsewhere on the net so those of us who were not in the know about the Real Anne Rice are now. I bet mine gets deleted too the truth does hurtYou know comparing her comparing her writing to Opera singers is a hoot she has a high opinion about herself don't you lady the sin of pride gets us all eventually.Now to my review there are so many places where this book could have gone. If I remember correctly in TVL Lestat makes a statement about what it could be like if science got a hold of his kind and there could have been this huge battle ect ect this could have been that book but did we get that a big fat NO. Instead what we get is an Undead blood sucker spewing out Pope worship and how perfect and pure the Catholic Church is a BLOOD SUCKING CORPSE!!! Of all things we get a book that should have bern called The Catholic Church for Dummies through the eyes of a Redeemed Walking Corpse. Anne your a troll on here if you read this please PLEASE don't ever write another Lestat book let him rest in peace. He has been spayed and neutured by what used to have been the greatest writer ever and i've read your Christ books you still need an editor but her ego wont allow such a thing. YEAH THANK GOD THE VAMPIRES ARE DEAD!!! Cause now those who can cut it as a writer are writing about them now. Laurel K Hamilton, Kim Harrison, Brian Keene ect ect well Keene does Zombies but still dead undead it's all the sameWhat kills me is how open ended this book is theres no conclusions to anything she teased us with a possible war between the Talamasca and the Vampires in Merrick but what do we get in Blood Canticle we get a infomercial for the Catholic Church and a horrible love story between Rowan and Lestat that went NO WHERE. She had the perfect opportunity to for Rowan to steal his blood we could have had THE ULTIMATE ENDING TO A WONDERFUL SERIES but all we got is Catholocism 101 and the Brat Prince being so out of character and sloppily developed that he was totally unrecognizable. Where was Louise and Merric and the Twins and Armand and Marius and Lestats mother you RAPED US!!! She ripped us off with no complete ending to these books and this is the last one! She is pure literature death and has no buisness ever writing a Vampire novel! She can't do it anymore she is unable too which is why she turned to Jesus so she can milch the Christians now and dress up like a 1950's reject off of Leave it to Beaver. This book was a smack in the face to her fans Oh Great and Majestic One that she is. And then berating those fans who saw MTD as the piece of junk it was at the beginning of this book shows how full of herself she really is. I really think she believes she is above criticism of any kind she really believes she's just that good and above all of us You are NOT Stephen King you don't even come close to earning that title! Hey at least Hamilton and Harrison still meet with there fans and mail out requests for signed book plates and what not all we get from The Queen is a no thank you I can't be bothered im above all of you I made my money off of you now I don't need you I only write propoganda for The Catholic Church and Jesus. Fine who needs you your book sales will finally convince you you need us again someday when you can't pay your rent in your luxury homes. You can only keep making royalties off of your past glories before that well dries out. I bet anyone here she still makes a good buck off of Beauties Punishment and Belinda that im sure she doesn't mind hypocrit that she is she doesn't want to write about so called evil things but she doesn't mind making a buck off of it and she doesn't know what she's talking about Stephany Meyer created a wonderful Vampire world and she is a very commited Christian and her Vampires actually have morals and avoid blood so YES Anne it can be done your just not capable of doing it anymore.Blood Canticle sucks stay away from it go read Circus Of The Damned or This Witch For Hire there far more deserving than this lazy limp story from a washed out deluded author blinded by her own self worth"},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"About the protagonist in this particular piece of Rician fiction, it's not him.

AT LAST, we have Lestat speaking in his own voice again, and not the catatonic, or insecure, confused Lestat we've glimpsed from novels post-Memnoch, but the secure, strong, vibrant, life loving, motorcycle riding, powerful, macho, rich, witty, sexy BRAT PRINCE is back! And he's back in his full velvet frocks, dashing blonde mane, sensual french accent, and full lusting hunger for humans, my dears!! For this reason alone, the book is worth buying. But this book is about more than our favorite anti-hero, it's about the wonderful Mayfair witches, and answers the question many Rice fans have asked, \\"How would Lestat react to this dysfunctional brood?\\" She could have used Louis, she could have used David, or Marius, but she saved the best for last, and used Lestat. She chose a wonderful theme from which to introduce our hero into the 21st century, and Lestat implores us all to share in the pure FUN and joys of living in the 21st century.It's my personal opinion that there are many naysayers who have been naysaying so long, their minds are no longer open to pure entertainment. Which of course is what Canticle is... Pure entertainment. Don't look for Rice to answer any deep, philosophical questions here, for it's clear this was a pure joyride. The book has an upbeat, maniacal, life-affirming pace that many of the more \\"goth\\" Rice fans simply wont appreciate. BUt if you're a fan of the kind of book you absolutely loose youreself in, the kind of book in which one single character takes you on a ride from which you don't want to return, and if you LOVE Lestat DiLioncourt, GET THIS BOOK. DOnt even wait for paperback. Go to the library if you must, but instead of watching \\"American Idol\\" this week, meet Lestat again. He's here, and he is, as before, your every dream."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I took the time to read through a few reviews before writing my own, for the sake of not repeating what others have already stated. What a shock I found. No, this novel was not up to par compared to her early novels, but I see things differently than most of the replies out there. First of all, in real life, people grow and change depending on their experiences. So get this through your thick sculls: Lestat will not, could not possibly be like, his orginial character from book one. This is a vampire that has #1 blood in him making him stronger than almost any other (so hell yeah I would be scared of him if I was Mona, Julien, etc.) He has gone to Heaven and Hell and back. He's even lost his body. People, Vampires, change.Second, I don't know what book you all others read, but Mona was always a spoiled, brat, who was always jeolous of Rowan. Nothing changed there. The last time Rowan was in a story, she was showing signs of burn out. Anne Rice was following through with the effects of causes which occured in her previous books. Characters must change to seem believable, they don't always change the way you wish them to.Lastly, I think Anne WAS using Lestat as her voice. I would like to think she was telling Stan that she will join him when her work is done. Much like Lestat told Rowan he would come for her when her work will be done. Like I hope one day to join those I love."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I was sorely dissapointed with this book. It's the only book in the series which I didn't enjoy. While it has it's good/bad points, mostly bad, I didn't feel like it was part of the same series of books. It should have been part of the Mayfair witches series, guest starring 2 vampires! But, I respect her as a writer, and believe that no one knows the characters better than she, so it must be right. I wasn't expecting anything cataclysmic in the end, so I wasn't shocked by the ending...it left an opening for a new book, if she ever wants to pick them up in the future. Even though this book was horribly dull, &quot;slightly racist&quot;,about everything but vampires,and drenched with religion, I would still read a new book if she continued. In conclusion, die-hard fans only need read--and get it from the library, unless you're building a collection."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"What can I say? She is my favorite author and I'm glad she's &#34;back&#34;....just playing catch up with the few I missed."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"The story itself was wonderful and highly recommended for Anne Rice fans but the editing of the Kindle version was terrible. In addition to spelling mistakes there were also quite a few instances where whole words were replaced with incorrect ones! Examples; several times the word \\"mat\\" was used when it should have been \\"that\\" and \\"dunking\\" instead of \\"thinking\\". While I could guess the correct word it detracted from the story. Not sure how the editing process works for Kindle books but someone obviously didn't do their job on this one. Very disappointing."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"This book was ok. I started out liking Mona Mayfair, but by the end I couldn't stand her. Now don't get me wrong, it was nice to have the 'Brat Prince' \\"write\\" again, I think that Anne has given up on the dark side. She's gone spiritual. There's nothing wrong with that, but if you've read other books of Anne Rice's you'll notice a difference in this one. The first chapter was tedious and boring; it made me want to stop reading, right then and there! However it's a lot of babble so I skipped to chapter 2 like Lestat suggests. It does tie up the loose ends with the Taltos, which I always wondered about. I hope that if Mrs. Rice decides to do another Vampire book that she looks back to her original books. There was nothing wrong with \\"Memnoch the Devil\\" a lot of what is talked about in the first chapter, I just think that a lot of people didn't understand that she was trying to warn us that maybe we've reached the end with Lestat. This is the first book since \\"Memnoch the Devil\\" that has been written by Lestat, maybe she's out of ideas. I mean come on! How much MORE can he do? After you've been to Heaven and Hell and back, there's just not much left that seems to be so important right? I'm sure that's how she's looking at this through Lestat's eyes. So those of you criticizing Anne for being full of herself, you all are just silly! Overall the book was ok. Had its high points and low points. Not one of her best work but I will continue to keep it."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I am an avid Anne Rice fan. I have read and reread the Vampire Chronicles and the Witching Hour series. They are excellent. This final book, however, is very disappointing. First, Anne should be very careful when she is complaining through Lestat in the first chapter. It isn't Lestat, it's Anne, and it's obvious. I wished for so much more. I am rereading the Witching Hour just to get this book out of my mind."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Blood Canticle, the 10th and final novel in the Vampire Chronicles, is a little odd. Lestat is once again our narrator, but he starts off by chastizing the readers for not liking Memnoch the Devil, as well as the descriptive, flowery prose in the novels. He then compensates for this by speaking like a surly teenager throughout the rest of the novel (pa-lease, dude, yo, etc.). I felt this was Anne Rice's none too subtle way of saying everyone should have appreciated Memnoch and other recent chronicles that weren't receiving glowing reviews. I didn't really appreciate the message, not to mention that it was completely out of character for Lestat and an off-putting start to the book.Anyways, then we move back to Blackwood Farm where Mona Mayfair has recently been made a vampire and our real story can begin....except that not much happens. Lestat struggles with his nature and his feelings for Rowan Mayfair, Mona wants to find her Taltos baby, and Quinn is still pre-occupied with Blackwood Farm. When the action finally does get going, it has little to do with vampires and I'm not even sure how this can be considered a Vampire Chronicle, with the exception of Lestat narrating. A disappointing end to the series. Au revoir Lestat, I wish our parting could have been sweeter."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I would have rated this novel higher if it had not been the series finale. The tone of \\"Lestat\\" was all wrong. His voice and narration felt forced, the plot was OK but lack oomph, and the characters were lackluster.I ended up feeling like Rice wanted to end the series and did so in a rushed fashion. I understand that Ms. Rice's husband died around the time this novel was written. Understandably, her frame of mind wasn't in writing mode. I am not faulting her for that. I just think she should have waited until she could give the series a proper send off."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Geez...I get that feeling that I've read the same books over and over. I am still struggling with Blood and Gold, such a dozer. Merrick was substandard. Merrick who was not included anywhere in the Mayfair Witches becomes a vampire. Why tamper with something great like \\"The Witching Hour\\". It was such a great read - imaginative, piques your interest. I don't intend to buy Blackwood or Blood Canticle. And don't get me started with the \\"New Tales of Vampires\\" collection. Please, stop ruining your tremendous books, Anne. \\"Interview with the Vampire\\" gave me goosebumps...now it's just goose...."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I have not read this book yet (I live in a rural town that isn't selling it- about 8 copies of Blackwood are in the bargan box at the book store, when Anne was insanely popular here when I was in school). I was about to buy it, but Anne's obvously gone mad. Am I the only one who remembers that vampires can't see ghosts? Maharet clearly articulates this in QoTD. Yet ever since Memnoch and Roger's haunting (which outraged me) ghost have been in almost (if not every) future chronicle. Why?? no explanation is given for Maharet saying this nor for vampires like Armand who, if his story is to be taken serious, knows of ghosts. Anne runs out of ideas and breaks her own rules."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"A thought on this &quot;conclusion&quot; to the Cronicles--though this might offend. Did Anne's new religious bent get in her way to make the vampires straight prudes? First David (remember Carlos from ToBT with Merrick (and he turned out to be a child molester as well). Then Louis with that MarySue Merrick (So glad she's gone, but how does Louis feel?). Then Armand with Sybelle (of all vamps, Armand?). Now Lestat with that (impolite word here) Rowan. What gives? The Cronicles were goth favorites because of the adrogny (sp) factor. Also, why would a person like Lestat, with his love of being seen, clothing, etc like living in a Northern LA swamp? Has he turned into Louis and that is why Louis is not seen? Also, how does Petronia feel about her fledging bolting on her? And why would Kayhmen show up at Blackwood Farm for a visit? Is Daniel still insane and why did he get that way anyway? Just questions to ponder as you try to make your way through this swill of a book. Also, this is a Witches book, not a Vampire one, just so you know. (Maybe this was actually written by Anne's son--hmmm)."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I had real high hopes for this novel, as well as for Lestat himself. I didn't like Blackwood Farm, and I only assumed this was so because Lestat wasn't the star character. So when I heard Lestat was coming back as first person again, I was joyed, for he always brung life to Anne's novels from his own biography to the Tale of the Body Thief, my favorite out of them all besides The Vampire Armand.And yet the first thing I hear about is he wanting to be good and a missionary of some sort! It totally threw me off how different Anne Rice made Lestat! It's like Anne neutered him! He's no longer cunning, bad, or vain. He's just a goody goody guy. That thoroughly disappoints me. And since this is supposed to be the last book in Anne's Vampire Chronicles series, I expected so much more and didn't get any of it. I wanted a big reunion of some sort with all her vampires coming together once more, so we could picture the other famous characters that have starred in the Chronicles such as Marius, Armand, and Louis again one last time. But you don't see any of them, Lestat barely even mentions them. That upset me the most.But I'm speaking as a Vampire Chronicles fan. I've read all the novels in Anne Rice's vampire series, so I'm more attatched to the characters. Some of you may be reading one of her novels for the first time, so I'll split this into two categories:Other Anne Rice fans of the Vampire Chronicles-Great chance you'll be just as disappointed as I was. You don't see any of the other vampires but Lestat and his two 'ho- hum' new children, which are Quinn and Mona. The only good thing about Mona is that she sometimes in the book through anger somewhat changed Lestat back into the entity we once enjoyed, other than that, don't expect anything special from these two new vampires. They throughout the book follow Lestat around and call him 'Master' without any civil disobediance whatsoever, unlike Louis and Claudia so famously did decades back in Interview with the Vampire. You see no other vampires but plenty of Mayfairs, and Lestat turns into a drooling zombie over one of the Mayfair women that is twice his age throughout the entire novel. Mainly, say goodbye to the old Lestat you witnessed in the older novels. Don't expect any reunion like I did, because there's not even a hint of it, and the entire plot of the novel doesn't even dedicate to vampires, but to helping the Mayfairs, so don't expect to be knee-deep in seductive vampire conflicts, for there are none. Just the Mayfair witches of Anne's and their problems. My advice, read it about halfway, and if you feel you are enjoying it, then go on and read the rest. But if you feel disappointed, don't do what I did and read the rest, hoping something exciting will happen before you know it, for chances are, like me, you won't.For you viewers who aren't knee-deep into the Chronicles, this may be a good read for you, despite all my comments up above. It's a book of folkloric creatures, vampires and witches, whom embark on a journey to find the secrets of an ancient bloodline called the Taltos linked to the Mayfair witches. A bit of controversy, a dash of action, and an unfolding of ancient secrets makes this novel a good read for many.So for you readers who are just starting out in the Chronicles and this is one of your first readings, I would urge you to read this, because I'm sure I would enjoy it if I wasn't so involved with the other vampires she had other than Lestat. There were action scenes, especially the times when Mona angered Lestat, that made the book worth reading once.But for you Chronicle fans such as I, I strongly urge you to keep your receipt on the novel. Just in case."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I have read a lot of reviews that believe this book to be the worst of the vampire chronicles. While I see some of the reasons the book merits some of the criticism, I also would like to write a defense of this novel.First, Lestat's character has changed since Menoch the devil, which most fans seem to be split as to whether they liked this change or not. It is a little grating to see Lestat start with a chaotic rambling of \\"gangster\\" talk, but then again I don't think it was suppose to be permenant. In Blackwood Farm, Rice did acknowledge that Lestat still loved etiquette, as seen when he rebukes Quinn for spilling blood when Quinn tried to kill Stirling. This chaotic rambling can also be attributed to two things: Lestat is still in mourning for Merrick, and Anne Rice has (at the time of this story's creation) just lost her beloved husband Stan Rice. Stan Rice was Anne Rice's inspiration for Lestat, and perhaps with the loss of her inspiration, Rice might have meant for Lestat to appear distorted. (Rice's claim of inspiration is found in a published Houston Chronicle article.)As for the inconsistency between Lestat supposingly knowing about computers and then not knowing how to write a simple email: well I guess I do blame that on poor editing or lack of counsel.The novel is still written in Rice's magnificent writing style. There is indeed a clear beginning, middle, and end. Anne Rice's problem laid in the fact that she did not seem to find a stronger plot to merge the Vampires with the Mayfair withches. The love between Rowan and Lestat does seem to be a bit hard to believe, but then again they are both rather complex characters. Rowan's dark past seems to be paralleled to Lestat's own past, perhaps darkness seeks darkness because they understand each other. Michael is reduced to a duller and somewhat sad role, but this is not new. In the Mayfair witches triology, fans have seen that Rowan has taken him for granted by abandoning him at least twice. As for Mona's supposingly inconsistent bahavior, this is not the case. Mona's obsession with sex, computers, and immature behavior is still persistent throughout this tale.As for the role of Oncle Julien: he is a character that simply has been important and critical in the previous Mayfair triology. He played a vital role in being the ancestor of both the Mayfair witches in the Mayfair triology, and being an ancestor to Merrick who becomes one of Vampires. Merrick seems to have been the first link of fusion between the Vampire Chronicles and the Mayfair Witches.What we have here is a story that fuses three very interesting species: the Vampires, the Witches, and the Taltos. It also attempts to delve into religion's part in life itself. The reference to Saint Juan Diego is dued perhaps because he was one of the humblest saints in terms of orgin. It seems Lestat feels drawn to him because Lestat also started out with humble beginings, and since Juan Diego has attained sainthood then perhaps Lestat thinks he could also. Rice just likes to explore the afterlife in this novel, is there a heaven and hell, or is there a purgurtory-like plato like that of Quinn's twin or Oncle Julien's?The only major complain I have towards this novel is the Taltos storyline. The way that Ashlar and Morrigan (Mona's taltos daughter) ends is just hard to believe. How could they have been taken over by drug dealers of all things. I found Rice's obession with gangsters to be absurd.Perhaps it could have been written with more extravegence and a stronger plot line, but it still ends with a rather interesting and cliffhanger like ending. Much of the complain seems to stem more from ignorance of the Mayfair Triology then anything else. As a fan of the Vampire Chronicles and the Mayfair Witches, I support this story, and take it as a last gift of this marvelous series for there will apparently never be anymore of Lestat and Co. stories to be in awe of or complain about."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"To sum it up, Anne if you had not been a published writer this book would have been trashed. I can't beleive any one would pay money for this."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"It isn't often after I've read an author as long and as faithfully as Anne Rice that they can surprise me. Normally, I open their latest book like I put on my favorite shirt. Warm, comfortable, easy to relax in, but nothing startling or new. Anne Rice threw out my favorite shirt when she wrote \\"Blood Canticle\\".And I loved it.Although perhaps not her best (ask any Anne Rice fan, and they'll be more than happy to let you know what her best are), for the first time in years I saw her really taking risks as an author. Risks in voice, in style and in plot.Lestat finally had a voice! In \\"The Vampire Lestat\\" Rice descibed Lestat's narrative style as inconsistent and a cross between a \\"flat boatman and detective Sam Spade\\". And every time I've read those lines I've thought, \\"No, you don't. You sound like the same voice as 'Interview with a Vampire' as 'Witching Hour' as 'Servant of the Bones' and many other of Anne Rice's narratives.\\" In \\"Blood Canticle\\" I actually heard a new voice. A different voice. A voice peppered with pop-culture (granted perhaps not 21st century pop culture) slang and imagery. It was the voice of someone who had learned how to write from pulp fiction and the movies. From the first lines, I could sense Lestat tearing across the page--so much to express that not only his hand but his head could not keep up. It still had the richness of detail that I as an Anne Rice fan expect, but I heard--for maybe the first time--a distinct voice that was unique for the author.The risks she took in style really pleased me. The short vignettes of action and imagery were such a refreshing experience in one of Anne Rice's books. The chapters where it is pure motion--no thought, little characterization, little-to-no dialogue were wonderful and showed how much she learned in the experience of writing screenplays. For the first time she allowed action to truly dicatate the pace rather than characterization and theme, and it was a great surprise from an author with such a traditional style of story-telling.On the other hand, the chapters where she digressed to religion and other heady-matters could only have come from Lestat! None of her other characters would ever imagine we would want to know their opinions on religion and philosophy in such a direct fashion.[]As to the plot--no, it was not a typical Anne Rice supernatural yarn. I did, however, come away from this one thinking more about what had occurred than in her last several books. Yes, Lestat has changed--he's met the devil and perhaps God. He went insane for a period of years and has slowly crept back toward sanity. But who experiences a life-changing event and doesn't come out the other side a different person?Lestat's values have changed. Yes, he still loves adventure and sticking his nose in other people affairs. He still is the \\"brat prince\\" but now with a teenage daughter--a teenage daughter who gives Lestat a run for the title of \\"brat\\". A teenage daughter who happens to be a single mother. All you need do is read the last chapter and see the choice that Lestat makes to realize that values have changed for both Anne Rice and her alter ego.So, is \\"Blood Canticle\\" a book I'll go back and read time and again like other Anne Rice novels? Probably not.Am I sorry that for the final Vampire Chronicle Louis, Marius, David, Pandora and others never even made an appearance? Yes.Am I sorry she'll never tell us the \\"lost years\\" of Khayman (who has always been my favorite vampire) or the silver-legged Flavius? Absolutely.But I give her props for taking risks, trying something other than what her audience (obviously) expected, and allowing her life experiences (i.e. the death of her husband) to affect her \\"art\\". Yes, I would argue that this book pushed Anne Rice back from the brink of pop-fiction to something worthy of where she began as an artist so many years ago.So, read at your own risk. It's not typical Anne Rice fare. It's not the brat prince we knew & loved--and knew & loved to hate. But enter with an open mind and give an artist the opportunity to grow (and follow where their heart leads) and you might come away with more than you ever expected from an author's twenty-fifth novel."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"The best I can say is that it was good to finally put the wraps on a series I began reading in the late 70's when Interview came out, but it's clear MS Rice's heart was not really in this book. Probably a contractual fullfilment."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I am a loyal fan of Anne Rice. I've only just started reading her books about a year and a half ago, but I feel I'll never find a more talented author.Blood Canticle is said to be Anne Rice's last novel in the Vampire Chronicles, but I can't seem to believe it. Too much is left unsaid, unresolved. Lestat is still struggling to obtain sainthood, Maharet's life story between the time she became a vampire until Queen of the Damned is still a mystery, and what has become of all the other characters that once played a prominent role in Anne Rice's magnificient novels.Even with all these questions left unanswered, she still manages to tie up a few loose ends with Mona's reunion with the Taltos and the future of Blackwood Farm.There was something that seemed a little off in this book. I felt confined while reading it. One of the things I love most about Anne Rice's novels is that each one is a journey through time from the viewpoint of a different individual. This book didn't do that. It stayed right here in the present time. Also, while reading it, you think a lot is happening but after completeing the book you realize that not too much really did. I don't like how Rowan became so weak and that her love for Michael is disappearing (Most likely because I am also currently reading the Witching Hour). Mona doesn't seem to pay that much attention to Quinn anymore either. And even Quinn himself doesn't seem to do too much in the book.All in all, it's a decent novel but I feel that it lost some of the old charm that the other novels had."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"The problem with this book, is that it's set in modern day times, and there's not a lot that we don't know about the vampires now. The story is pretty much an everyday life tale of Lestat and his latest 'coven'. Of course there is the part about the Mayfairs and the unnatural offspring, but that part wasn't all that interesting to me. I wish that Anne would write more books about new and different vampires, older vampires from different places and tell their life stories. That is the books I like the best. Lestat has already told his story, so we know all about him and his spoiled self. A life story for Mael would be nice."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I've read just about everything from the &quot;Rice Collection&quot;, and this one, save the ending, was decent. The plot was nice, if a little distracted at times, but overall, it was a great read. I went through it in a little under 3 days.A bit of warning though. *possible spoiler* There isn't much of an end.And oh, to the one or ones who call the Queen of the Vampires a &quot;hack&quot;? Keep in mind what personal struggles Ms. Rice was going through, and probably still is.Great job Anne, wish you'd keep writing. Oh yeah, Memnoch was one of my favorites."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Our dear Lestat is back, and this time he's gotten hip with the times. (Sometimes to excess, but what can I say? It's probably intentional..) Like most of Mrs. Rice's books, this one reads through at a good clip, then allows you to go back and reread for the deeper meanings and complexities that exist in her novels. And Lestat's criticism of his &quot;Dear Readers&quot; was delightful! I laughed out loud. The plot may get a bit silly, with half human drug lords and such, but overall, our narrator ...well, narrates... with his unmistakeable style. If this is truly Lestat's last book , then by the end at least we all know that he finally did something RIGHT."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"I believe that there is one true love and one true faith that never fades and it all begins with blood! Instantly, the word blood brews a preternatural primeval verve in the veins. Why, because blood is a symbol of both life and death in one fatal and final word. I was enthusiastic about reading this great novel that is both popular and literary.The words were wielded with skill and attention to detail that few other writers endeavor. As soon as you begin to read the intellectual mind asked philosophical question about the nature of evil and moral insanity. Are these creatures we call vampires truly the protagonist of the novel or should we view them as the enemy, the antagonist that should be stopped?The primary focus of the vampire chronicles in general is to perceive the vampire as the reluctant anti-hero that is a slave and an addict to his need for blood. At times the reader is made to feel both stimulated and sympathetic for the vampire main characters. Lestat is an indisputable sex symbol to some and an unassailable villain to others, the appeal of Lestat is both ruthless and rueful murder of his vampire victims. Through the kiss of vampire death he makes the victim relish the thirst for blood and live forever."},{"Title":"Blood Canticle","review":"Ann is better at writing in historical settings. She is just not in touch enough with popular culture to attempt anything set in the present time. Having read all of the vampire chronicles, most of which I loved, I found myself very unsatisfied with this one. A lot of unanswered questions. Not enough character building. The newly introduced race of \\"Taltos\\", not very convincing. I put this book down about 20 pages from the end because it just fizzled out. It reads like a sketchy first draft of a third-rate novel."},{"Title":"Dead Aim","review":"This was a really good book. It had a little bit of everything.A little too much romance for me.

All her books are great.Amazon knows a great Author when they see one."},{"Title":"Dead Aim","review":"My first ever review! Although I've written a few novels, I'm new to writing reviews, so you're gonna get some honesty here.This is a fast paced novel. Not quite as ridiculous as \\"Angels & Demons,\\" nor as picturesque, but fast and kind of fun. I almost gave up on it a couple of times, but finally, after a lot of hard mental pushups, I started caring *just a little bit* about the bitchy heroine. Possibly only because she reminded me of my ex-wife with whom I am still, thankfully, amicable.OK, so it's fast paced, so good for a book on tape if you are commuting. The bads? In fiction you need to care about the characters, right? Well, OK, the only one you actually care about is the male lead, I think \\"Morgan.\\" You care about him because he's damaged enough that he puts up with the female lead, whatever her name was. All of the female \\"heroines\\" seem to be a bit short of estrogen. They are nasty, bitchy, and miserable souls. A couple of the men are OK but turn out to be double-crossers at the end, which is kind of a positive.Another thing: the writing is childish in its structure, giving up silly details that don't add any value. Not as ridiculous as the details that Dan Brown throws into his junk, but just as bad in a childish way. This surprised me 'cause I think this one wrote \\"Body of Lies,\\" which was a movie I much enjoyed.Wow, writing reviews is fun, I think I'll have to go back and write a review for an actual \\"good\\" book like \\"The World According to Garp.\\" : )"},{"Title":"Dead Aim","review":"I picked this based on the author like I do most book and I\\"m glad to say it was worth the read.

I found it exciting and enjoyed the characters. I also liked that she avoided the need some authrors seem to have to kill off some key \\"good guys\\" for balance.The only problem was, as our world seems to get stranger and stranger, that I wondered if parts of it were really fiction - that is, some things our government (and others) are doing may not be so different from what is depicted in the book."},{"Title":"Dead Aim","review":"Alex Graham, a photo journalist has seen something that she wasn't suppose to, while assisting in the cleanup of a \\"seemingly natural disaster\\".

All of these characters are reoccurring in the series, so you will recognize them, even Elena. Filled with romance, espionage, terrorist attacks, revenge and conspiracy, this is an entertaining read. Read along as Alex and Judd fight the clock to save the President's life."},{"Title":"Dead Aim","review":"I'm in 8th grade, and usually enjoy reading Iris Johansen's work, but this was a huge disappointment.First of all, I had trouble getting into the story to begin with, it all happened so fast, without much detail. A few parts of suspense lasted for like a page, is the only thing good about this book. When I hit the 200th page I threw it at the wall and hoped to God it would end soon. I do not recommend this book."},{"Title":"Dead Aim","review":"Acclaimed stage actress Kate Burton gives a dynamite reading to the explosive new thriller by this always readable author. Iris Johansen pictures a new take on terrorism, bringing it evermore near to home and hearth.Alex Graham is an acclaimed photojournalist. Her achievements are many, and her work beyond reproach. Now she finds herself at a disaster site in Arapahoe Junction, Colorado. As she digs through debris side by side with other volunteers in a frantic search for survivors the common thought is that an earthquake is the most likely cause of this devastation.That's too pat an answer for Alex who discovers that the carnage was not caused by an unruly force of nature but was the result of a ... plot. This knowledge places her life in jeopardy.Furthermore, there is a [theory]. Anyone who comes even close to the truth will never utter another word. By dint of sheer luck the first attempt on her life fails. She now finds herself under the wings of an unlikely protector - billionaire John Logan who assigns a bodyguard, tough, relentless Jidd Morgan, to make sure that Alex lives.However, Morgan has a few skeletons in his closet - bones that make someone want to dispose of him. How many wanna-be killers can Alex handle?- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"Dead Aim","review":"Dead Aim is a fun read...hard to believe but it could happen.Alex Graham, a photojournalist, is on location when a dam collapses in Colorado. The authorities believe it to be a natural disaster, but after several days of digging through the rubble to find survivors, Alex leaves the scene to try to get pictures from a better altitude. She becomes an unhappy witness to the destruction of the helicopter that is to pick her up and then overhears plans to cover up what has actually been a terrible sabatoge. The action picks up as her friend Sara Logan is wounded...We remember Sara and her rescue dog from previous Johansen thrillers. Sara is now married to a mega rich businessman with political connections all the way to the White House as well as contacts who are either CIA or former CIA operatives.The characters in Dead Aim have been introduced in previous Johansen books, and while it is not necessary to have read them, it makes understanding Dead Aim easier. Alex is an unlikely hero,however, she does save the country in the end. It's a fun, quick and easy read and would make a good mini series."},{"Title":"Dead Aim","review":"If you've read one Iris Johansen novel, you've read all of them. You have the strong willed, hard headed, and emotionally crippled heroine. And then there's the equally strong willed, hard headed, sexual, and martial arts/weapons trained mercenery/cop/independently wealthy through suspicious means hero. Put those two together and you got your typical Iris Johansen book. The first time I read one of her novels (\\"the Ugly Duckling\\"), it was very enjoyable. It's refreshing to see an author describe women as the aggressor and not another damsel in distress. It's also good to read about the less than perfect hero, though jaded and harden in their own way, tried their best to seduce the heroine with their intellect and heart instead of flawless goodlooks. However, after the 5th novel of the same type of characters, just with different names, I grew tired of the same old stories.What confused me most about this novel is that the heroine, Alex Graham, behaved with complete lack of common sense for a person in her position. If I was forced to be on the run, hunted by top US government agencies, and am protected by a trained mercenery (the hero) with years of experiences over me, I'd would do whatever I was told and not go against my protector's advice. It amazed me that 1) she hadn't been caught or killed within the first chapter 2) the hero hadn't slapped her for her stupidity 3) the hero actually falls in love with someone like her and 4) that after all the clumsy dumb moves she made dispite his advice, at the end he still had the patience to want her around.Also what confused me was the inability of the combination of Homeland Security, CIA, FBI, and a well trained North Korean assassin to take down one mere woman. Considering the vast resources of just one of those above mentioned agencies, let alone the combination of all three, how had it been possible that the characters had not been caught? It may be possible to hide out for a week or so, but I refuse to believe that as long as they lived in the US, with such detailed backgrounds on them as the government agencies had, that they can hide out for as long as the author discribed.Towards the end I had to constantly remind myself the novel is almost over with. When I did get to the end, it was as anti-climatic as could be. Definitely not one of Iris Johansen's finest work."},{"Title":"Dead Aim","review":"This is an easy read as are most of Johansen's books; however, I was disappointed in the story itself. Most of the book focuses on what is considered a natural disaster with the underlying theme being \\"whodunit\\". A government conspiracy involving the FBI, CIA and a congressman from Texas as well as &lt;gasp> the vice president of the United States! You spend most of the book getting pieces of information culminating to an anti-climactic, quick resolution.I enjoy the returning characters like Galen (and references to his now pregnant wife Elena), Logan, Sarah & Monty, Salazar and Andreas (the president). Sarah & Monty are only in for a short period of time while Galen has a more prominent role. John Logan is in and out and a powerful voice on the phone. Andreas re-appears as the president who's life is in jeopardy. This story focuses on Judd Morgan (still hiding and being tracked by a trained killer, Runne, as retribution for killing his father) and a new addition to the cast, Alex Graham, a photo journalist trying to discover what exactly happened in the mud slide that killed hundreds of people, how it happened as she witnessed an event that made her realize there was nothing \\"natural\\" about it and why all of a sudden she's being deemed public enemy #1 after trying to help in the search and rescue mission. She's also struggling with her feelings for Morgan (no surprise there) who was recruited by Galen (at Sarah's request to John Logan)to protect her.It gets a little confusing with all the CIA, FBI and congressmen's names as they refer to Z1, Z2 & Z3 (targets) and how all these people are linked -- especially to Runne who has been recruited for Z3 and to eliminate Morgan.Predictably, the guy gets the girl and they live happily ever after. If your a Johansen fan, you won't be disappointed, same-old-same-old."},{"Title":"Dead Aim","review":"I have been reading some mixed reviews about this book with some people loving it and some people (mostly longtime Iris Johansen readers) finding it not up to par. I have read 2-3 books by Iris Johansen and find that this book is one of my favorites.Dead Aim is about photographer Alex Graham who is taking pictures of what appears to be a natural disaster. She soon finds out otherwise--as she overhears the conspirators and witnesses them murder one of her friends. Alex is soon on the run from the killers and from the government, who mistakenly think she may have something to do with the disaster.Judd Morgan is a loner who is persuaded to help, protect and guard Alex. He is a man with a complicated past and is also on the run from an assassin as well as the CIA. Helping them is Galen and billionaire John Logan.I thought that the plot about conspiracy, terrorists and government was fast paced and well done. It is a suspenseful mystery as Alex and Judd find out who they can trust. Instead of focusing on international terrorism, the terrorists are actually working within the government...so no one is what they seem.It was nice to revisit with old characters like John Logan, Galen/Elena and Sarah/monty the dog. The ending was exciting as Alex runs from the killer and they try to stop a terrorist plot. Dead Aim was a great read and one that will keep readers turning the page!"},{"Title":"Dead Aim","review":"Okay! I've read three of the latest Iris Johansen books and I must say that all three were pure and complete drivel! Don't get me wrong, the plot was okay and I think it would have been more interesting if Robert Ludlum had been writing the book. However, the characters made me so angry, I actually threw this particular book at the wall in hopes that it would be dashed to pieces. Alpha males are one thing,but good lord! Morgan was absolutely ridiculous. And Alex!! What was her deal??!! That woman did not have the sense of a gnat. So far in all three books (And Then You Die, Body of Lies, Dead Aim) I have been severely disappointed in these women who are supposed to be tough, modern day women and they turn out to be stupid, hard-headed idiots! Imagine international terrorists coming after you and the government offering you protection and you refuse it because you don't want to kept in the dark. Sorry, sister. I'm staying in the dark if it means staying alive&gt; You feel me? Anyway, I didn't like any of the characters and the plot seemed very formulaic. As in,&quot;I've read this same story in another book. Only the names were changed.&quot; I shudder to think what the next book(s) will be like. This is my first and last time for this author. Sorry to those who are fans. I'll stick with Nora Roberts."},{"Title":"Dead Aim","review":"I'm sorry to say that I am a die hard Johansen fan. I'll read her stuff even if it gets a bad review from others. I can not believe how many people thought Dead Aim sucked. It's been a few years since I read this book, but found it on my book shelf and began skimming through it to refresh my memory. It has repeat characters in it that I've enjoyed reading about for some time. To have a president like Andreas would be a welcome change to the country. Galen is always enjoyable to read about. Sarah and Logan also have small parts, but Johansen still manages to introduce two new characters that capture your attention all the same. It also introduces a character that appears in Fatal Tide. Fans who started reading anywhere from the wind dancer series to the Eve Duncan series will find comfort in the reoccuring characters.As for the plot being unbelievable, who says that a photo journalist couldn't accidentally come across a terrorist's deadly plot? In today's day and age, anything is possible. Don't read fiction if you want reality and don't read romantic suspense if you don't like a happy ending to a relationship that seems unlikely in the first place."},{"Title":"Dead Aim","review":"First of all, I am an Iris Johansen fan and love most all of her work with very few exceptions. Secondly, I was shocked to see a review of this book by an 8th grader!! What is this kid's parents thinking? These are NOT young people's books but adult mystery/romance. Yes to some reviewers, Ms. Johansen does seem to follow a bit of a formula but I enjoy it.I especially enjoyed this story as many of the characters are from her other novels of this type (John and Sarah Logan, Sean Galen, Judd Morgan) and we as readers got to learn more about them.This story begins at a mudslide and collapse of the Arapahoe Dam where photojournalist Alex Graham is taking pics and digging for survivors along side her friend and ERT worker Sarah Logan and her dog Monty. It is exhausting work and depressing to see so many bodies and few found alive. Alex receives a call from her editor to hurry and send in her pics and the issue goes to press in a few days. After digging some more, she takes some shots around the work area and then decides it would be a good idea to get an overall view. She has her friend Ken, the Rescue team pilot, take her up in his helicopter and get some aerial shots and also has him set her down on the opposite hillside from the dam. She takes shot after shot going down the hill and into the trees for over an hour when she hears shouts and voices talking saying the name Powers and \\"let's go\\" so she starts coming back up the hill to the top where she sees a helicopter landing with no lights on landed and several men. Suddenly come the lights of Ken's helicopter and she sees the pilot of the dark helicopter with a rifle and he fires and hits Ken's 'copter so that it explodes. Alex screams and suddenly the men are after her. They shoot at her but stop and say \\"Let it bury the b----!\\" She runs down the hill toward the flood waters as her side of the hill suddenly seems to rumble and break apart. She goes into the water and manages to get to a floating rooftop and the next thing she wakes up in the hospital!!Sarah Logan is with her and no one knows anything or saw the other helicopter. Alex tells her and Det. Leopold from the police but they tell her no evidence of anything than an earthquake caused the second landslide and no evidence in the wreck of the helicopter that shows a bullet brought it down.Alex goes to the police station to look at mug shots with no results and starts on the way back to the dam with Sarah and Monty. Monty starts barking at a car following them and someone in the car shoots Sarah who is driving and they go off the side nearly getting all of them killed. Now John Logan is in the picture!!The rest is quite exciting trying to find out who, what, when, where and why with some romance between Alex and Judd mixed in.A great read!"},{"Title":"Dead Aim","review":"Ok. Can we please, please stop with the cookie-cutter books? I mean it's been girl gets in trouble. Male protects girl. Male has troubles of his own. Male beats up people. Female gets pissed. Female beats up people. Male and female get together when the female &quot;gives in&quot;. Male and female live happily ever after. Until for some odd reason Iris can't think up NEW characters so she recycles her old ones. Bangs head against table repeatedly. The last book of hers I read; I knew the villain when you first meet him. I mean c'mon. This road's been trampled to death. Either think up a new story or stop wasting trees."},{"Title":"Dead Aim","review":"Johansen books seem to be hit or miss. This book is definitely a miss. The characters reminded me of two teenagers trying to be cool, but just couldn't pull it off. Alex was too confident and pretty much told Morgan how it's going to be. Also, the constant sarcastic remarks between the two were overkill. There was no depth to the characters or plot. I think I will pass on reading anymore of Johansen's book. I'd rather spend my money on a hit."},{"Title":"Dead Aim","review":"How can I say this? I almost never read &quot;grocery store&quot; books, or what might otherwise be referred to as mass market paperback. But a few years ago I read an Iris Johansen novel, Reap the Wind, while on vacation in Mexico and was blown away. It's a fabulous book and I could't put it down. My husband even read it and enjoyed it, and he's NEVER read a action/intrigue/romance type novel. So I bought a few more and pretty much enjoyed them all up until about a year ago. Her last few books - it's hard to believe it's the same author - expect the same characters keep appearing in convoluted ways. Dead Aim is the worst yet. The story is not interesting and the characters are lifeless. It seems she's cranking out after another on auto pilot. Iris - Please - write something new and substantial. It's an insult to your fans to put out these crappy books twice a year. These recent Johansen books are about half as long as some of her previous work, with no where near the intrigue, romance, or refreshing writing style as some of her previous books. I almost thing they are being ghost written by a formula flunky.A much better choice is Reap the Wind which is a well developed page turner with real story and substance. Or if you're interested in historical fiction, The Tiger Prince. The same thing happened with Johansen's historical fiction. This one great book and then a bunch of &quot;crank it out&quot; junk. Iris needs to change genre's again if she can't do better than Dead Aim in the suspence/intrigue/romance genre. If Amazon had the option, I would give this book zero stars."},{"Title":"Dead Aim","review":"This is definitely a typical Iris book, great action, a little far fetched, but nothing absolutely stupid. She did jump a little too much in the final chapters, leaving characters practically mid-sentence, and then picking them up again after the climax of the scene. I didn't like that ploy, but I did really enjoy the book overall. It's a good light read, with enough action to keep your attention."},{"Title":"Dead Aim","review":"before i say anything else, let me say that before i read this book, i was a fan of iris johansen.so what has lead me to doubt that i will ever pick up another book of hers?first of all, every story of hers i have ever read, is exactly the same. it is this \\"similarity\\" in all her books that i have probably finally had enough of. we always start out with a woman who has some sort of secret and/or witnesses some really bad thing and now has to be protected because her life is in danger. enter: madman who wants to kill her. also, enter: big heroic ex-navy seal type who can really throw it around and knows how to handle himself in any and every situation. this worked for me for a very long time because i gave into the fantasy of this superhero protecting me from the boogey man. but then i began to notice the pattern in the females. they are always idiots who don't want the protection until they are practically killed. and then they decide to take superman's help, but only on their terms. to ice the cake, they continue to just be plain brainless damsels in distress by fighting superman every way he turns. for example, when he is about to go into the fray, the warning bells go off because you know the dippy damsel's going to insist on tagging along and is going to do something stupid to get them both hurt.so, my biggest beef with this story and all of johansen's others are that the women are portrayed as mindless idiots who couldn't think themselves out of a maze on a kiddie place mat at ihop and the men are just darn near perfect in every way. if it wasn't for the picture on the inner flap. i'd think a male chauvanist was authoring these stories. though, i'm still not completely convinced otherwise."},{"Title":"Dead Aim","review":"Why am I not surprised? Ms.Johansen confirms what I knew, my female collegues don't know how to truly write suspense. The golden retriever Monty is mentioned in connection with the search-and-rescue-team, but the main figure is a two legged friend Alex, the photographerix. She has guts, foul language and braves a lot of adversities coming from the Homeland Security Team, FBI, CIA etc. Why? Good question. They like to blow up dams and mines and the President, and of course Alex is opposed to that and is therefore on the wanted list. Makes sense? The whole story is clear as mud. Best you make a list of all the players at the start, because there are plenty and sometimes you meet them by their first name and sometimes by their last. Who is who? You go back and forth. See for yourself."},{"Title":"Dead Aim","review":"I read about 1/4 of this book and couldn't take it anymore. This is the first time I've read a book from this author and am not familiar with the characters. Ms. Johansen, however, does not give any good character introductions and the transition from event to the next is very sloppy. The book was so pathetic, I literally gave it away to a used bookstore before completion."},{"Title":"Dead Aim","review":"An interesting plot is rippled through the book like a rambling brook. On one side is an interesting adventure - on the other side is an idiotic romantic theme sprinkled by inane female remarks by the protagonist. If you listen to the audio book it is horrible. The reader is dreadful and takes your attention away from the story."},{"Title":"Dead Aim","review":"I have never written a review before but I couldn't let this go. I had heard good things about Iris Johansen's books so I thought I would give it a try. It was such a disappointment. I made myself finish it but actually started another book so that I had something thoughtful to read while working my way through her book. The characters were as cliche as I have ever read. The plot didn't excite me. Unless it was free, I would never read another of Johansen's books. She obviously rides on her past performance as an author and that is unfair to all those that pour their hearts into each book."},{"Title":"Dead Aim","review":"Following this series for quite sometime now I'd like to say this writer is still holding my attention."},{"Title":"Dead Aim","review":"I have been an avid reader of Iris Johansen for years and as the Eve Duncan series went on, it seemed the books got better. I was sadly disappointed in this book. I had hopes that is would continue along the lines with Sarah and Monty helping in rescues. My mistake was when I read an excerpt of this book and it was talking about Sarah and Monty at a rescue scene I thought that's who the book would be about. I was also hoping it would have something about Eve Duncan and Joe somewhere in the book. I lent it to a friend and she keeps asking me when its going to get good, it's a very slow read and disappointing one at best. Her previous book No One To Trust was also lacking, but that's another review. Maybe the time to wind up the Eve Duncan series is overdue."},{"Title":"Dead Aim","review":"I am so thankful I checked out this book on CD from the library rather than buying it. The narrator is terrible. She reads in a sort of low monotone voice. It's sad when a good book is narrated by a terrible narrator. I didn't get too far though before I realized this is not a good book anyway, so no big loss. If you want to hear a great narrator, try Sue Grafton's alphabet mysteries read by Judy Kaye. She is the best! I love to read, but I would almost rather hear Judy Kaye read these than read them myself."},{"Title":"Dead Aim","review":"She is not so well documented as Robert Crais or David Baldacci among others but this book will keep you reading, part of the story is the same as The Hammer of Eden by Ken Follett and that makes a little boring the story if you already read that book, that doesn't mean that you don't have to read this book if you already read The Hammer of Eden.The end of the book is predictable but very good, is an easy book to read, not a thriller but good enough for a long flight or a day at the beach."},{"Title":"Dead Aim","review":"I eagerly awaited this new book as I had read every one of her books before. I can only say that I feel really disappointed that this book is so below her other efforts. I kept having to check the author's name because I felt I was reading an Elizabeth Lowell story! All those phrases in italics is exactly how Elizabeth Lowell writes her stories. Come on Iris you can do better than this."},{"Title":"Dead Aim","review":"I like thrillers, I like political thrillers, I like romances. This book didn't succeed on any of those levels.The skeleton of the story was fine but it didn't go anywhere. It wasn't that it was far fetched, it's not like we haven't seen the supposed good guys doing bad things. It was that there were a whole lot of words but not a whole lot of substance. I felt like I was just passing through the story, there was nothing to grab the reader.Alex whined a lot (and we're supposed to believe she's this tough chick photojournalist but she whines an awful lot for a supposed tough chick), Judd brooded a lot, Logan (yes, we know he's a billionaire) ordered people around and said he'd do anything to save his wife a lot. There was panic, running and hiding, some action and mystery but it never fell into a cohesive and compelling storyline.I haven't read Johansen before, this was a impulse, the book was on the &quot;Your librarian likes&quot; shelf and I took a chance. It wasn't awful or poorly written, it just wasn't anything one way or the other."},{"Title":"Dead Aim","review":"Ouch! Three stars?? No way! This may not be as good as THE UGLY DUCKLING or some of her other books, but in my humble opinion it deserves at least 4 stars if not 5. Plenty of excitement, fast pace, maybe not enough romance, but all in all a satisfactory read. Can't wait to read FATAL TIDE."},{"Title":"Dead Aim","review":"Who could ask for anything more? Iris Johansen really delivers in this book. Photojournalist Alex is caught in a web of lies and intrigue when there is an assassination plot against the president of the United States. Judd Morgan is hired to protect her. They dislike eachother but are drawn to one another. They share witty remarks and a whole lot of passion. They come to trust one another despite themselves and fall in love. The ending leaves us satisfied but wanting more. I definitely recommend it."},{"Title":"Dead Aim","review":"It all seems a bit far-fetched. After photojournalist Alex Graham takes some shots of an earthquake scene, she stumbles upon two men who take some shots at her. She gets away, but not before she gets a hint from them that the earthquake is not a natural disaster, but mass murder. Soon, she becomes the target of the perpetrators, but no one believes her story except the billionaire husband of her best friend. He hires ex-CIA hit man Judd Morgan to protect her; Morgan proceeds to kidnap her and carry her around the country, trying to keep away from the hit man after him, as well as the ones after her. While they track down the truth, sinister forces within the government track them down. They seem to be caught up in a scheme that stretches all the way to the top of the government, and threatens to kill hundreds, if not thousands more, with \\"earthquakes.\\" All the while, the fugitives struggle with, and toward, each other. It all seems a bit far-fetched.At first. Until the Vice President starts spending a lot of time in underground bunkers around the country, and the hit man after Morgan turns out to be a North Korean. Then the bad guys spin doctor Morgan and Graham into terrorists, so that they can be shot on sight. Very cannily, Johansen touches on timely situations, and touches off our paranoia about personal rights, power, and freedom. She also serves the story well by never letting her dynamic duo, or the plot, settle into one place too long. The dialogue flows, the action hums, and the pages turn quickly in this thriller which takes us into the mind of a Southern congressman plotting to take over the country. But Graham, not the congressman, gets her man, and she does it with the help of the president. Of course, he insists on participating in the plan to capture the perpetrators. No doubles for him!Now, that's a timely portrayal, in a book that won't take you much longer to read than it took us to win the last war we started."},{"Title":"Dead Aim","review":"This was a very disappointing book. So much so, that I will probably never purchase another by this author. The plot drifts - the ending is virtually non-existent. The book conveniently skips over what could have been considered the climax of the plot. Instead, a chapter ends - and the ending begins --- saves so much time in actually developing a plot! Use words like --- Feelings! What am I thinking!? I can't feel that! ---- good grief! thin, thin, thin.....lazy lazy lazy...too bad the author is resting on her laurels - easy money, terrible product."},{"Title":"Dead Aim","review":"This book was very engaging from start to finish.

Can't wait to read the next book."},{"Title":"Dead Aim","review":"I am a fan of Iris. This book kept my interest. Plot was good. Constant turn of events. Answers were not answered until the end. The growing relationship between Alex and Morgan could have had a little more attention. As well as the ending turn of events, with a little more discription. Over all a good read."},{"Title":"Dead Aim","review":"One of the earlier reviewers used this phrase, and it is totally apt. I challenge anyone to tell me the difference between Joe, Logan, Galen and Morgan, or between Eve, Sarah, Elena and Alex. The fact is, there is no difference. All of her recent characters are interchangeable, and all of her plots are basically the same, with the same annoying and stilted dialogue. All that said, the author still somehow manages to create a fast paced and interesting story, and even makes the reader root for her copycat characters. This author is clearly just writing the same thing over and over again because it's easy and it sells. It's too bad because even this repetitive stuff is 3-star, but she could so easily be 5 star with a little freshness and ingenuity in her work."},{"Title":"Dead Aim","review":"She is a celebrated photojournalist who covers some of the most tragic news stories of our time.

Alex and Judd realize they are dealing with a conspiracy that has it's origins in renegade FBI and CIA officials and the executive office. They have to expose the conspirators before America experiences a deja vu tragic destruction of another Camelot.DEAD AIM is a fantastic action thriller that brings back beloved characters from other books written by the author. The two protagonists become romantically involved but that is a secondary plot that is overwhelmed by the non-stop action of the main theme. The respective vulnerability of both the hero and the heroine rings true and endears themselves to the readers but what is really exciting is how they travel different roads to take them to the same point. Iris Johansen will make the New York Times bestseller list with this dynamic and thrilling novel.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Dead Aim","review":"Like a previous reviewer, I won't read Iris Johansen again. I got sick and tired of Alex's stupid attitude of shunning any protection, fighting Morgan every step of the way, and then found it hard to believe they end up in bed. Even more unbelievable is the part where Alex dictates to the assasin Runne the terms under which she will meet him, arrogantly telling him she will kill him. SNORT! Give me a break! The only reason I finished this silly tall tale of a book is that I wanted to find out what Z3 is. Now, I'm through with this author and her ridiculous heroine."},{"Title":"Dead Aim","review":"Tough photojournalist Alex Graham has seen it all, but always through the lens. She's never been part of the story before, but now she is the story.

Okay, we can expect Alex and Judd to fall for each other, because it is an Iris Johansen book, after all, but the interplay between them only adds to the story. This five star book is a thriller of the first order, one you don't want to miss. I simply loved it."},{"Title":"Dead Aim","review":"I really enjoyed this book. I have read some of the other reviews written and I am not throwing stones -- to each his own. I just wanted to say that I have enjoyed all of the Iris Johansen books I have read so far. So what if you feel it's a little too unbelievable. That's why it's called fiction. A story doesn't have to be believable to be entertaining and keep you attention. I have enjoyed this book, and I like how Johansen introduces some characters as minor parts of a story then brings them back in other ones. all of her stories I have read so far (7) have all been good and have kept my attention. If it's entertainment and a good book your looking for...I really recommend this book."},{"Title":"Dead Aim","review":"After reading Ugly Duckling and Reap the Wing, which were both excellent and exciting from beginning to end, this book was hardto get into.

This one seemed to be a little too focused on updating the reader from all the other Eve Duncan books, but still missed a few characters. I think taking Galen in a new direction was not such a great idea because I did miss his usual presence in this book. He was there but in a different way."},{"Title":"Dead Aim","review":"She needs to hang up these tired, dried up characters that she has resurrected once again in another stale story.This time around a photographer stumbles on a cover-up and Judd Morgan decides inexplicably to protect her. Bad things happen to good people, blah blah blah, and the novel painfully limps to a conclusion. There was no real tension or chemistry generated by any of the main characters. I also had a hard time following who were the bad guys and who were just fill-ins. The dialogue was boring, action and plot were predictable and as mentioned above, the characters are just recycled and unbelievable. For example, who would believe that a billionaire's wife would go around to disaster sites with a search team full-time? Sorry, doesn't work for me. I would love for Ms. Johansen to go back to writing historical romance. I've read all of her books, contemporary and historical and with rare exception, her historical books are far superior. Failing a return to the &quot;good old days&quot;, maybe find a new set of folks to write about."},{"Title":"Dead Aim","review":"First, let me say I enjoyed this quick 'thriller'. Alex Graham as Wonder Woman, getting her own way = a lot = and even bullying her Protector who is supposed to be a No. 1 warrior. I admit IJ wrote him as a hunk and the dialogue between him and Alex was amusing, but you really had to bend reality and just enjoy the book.The only thing that disappointed, was the fact that we (and I hope this isnt too much of a spoiler) never experience the action when Morgan caught up with Runne to save Alex. After hearing throughtout the entire book and salivating how evil Runne was and what he intended to do to Alex in front of Morgan, it was somewhat of a disappointment not to be clinging to my chair, biting my nails, not answering the phone when I expected such a scary result. It seemed like I missed a few pages, when I really did not. It was all tied up too quickly. I guess I have to wait for Reacher's next book. :DThe Epilogue was very nice. (I am a romantic.) It's been a long time since I read one of IJ's books. I may try another."},{"Title":"Dead Aim","review":"Wow... what a crap. I can't believe trees were cut down to print this crap-o-la. Thank goodness I borrowed this book from public library. If I had spent $1 on it, that would have been regretful.Why am I bashing this book? From this book, I found author to be someone who is only interested in sensationalism to sell her books and make $ rather than creating a story together with some intelligence and care to tickle the mind of a reader.This book has as much value as Yellowpages from Afganistan."},{"Title":"Dead Aim","review":"Alex Graham is a photographer specialized in disasters, accidents and terrorist attacks. At the start of the book she is busy digging up people after a dam has burst in Colorado. When she tries to take a good picture of the disaster area, she witnesses something she was not supposed to see and a full-fledged manhunt to kill her is set into motion. Luckily one of her friends is the wife of a billionaire, who (against her will) provides her with a bodyguard, one Judd Morgan. He is unfathomable and Alex is a real tough woman, so they fight tooth and nail about Alex' safety and freedom of movement. It quickly becomes clear that the dam burst in Colorado was only the first event in a series and that there is nowhere where they are safe: the CIA, FBI and national security service are all trying to get Alex, so they constantly have to be on the move. And meanwhile a pathological killer tries to get his hands on Judd. In short, all the ingredients are there for a thriller, including some romance, but this book is not really outstanding because the storylines are too artificial."},{"Title":"Dead Aim","review":"I don't get it! I mean the mean reviews of this book. Dead Aim is a terrific story! Buy the book and see for yourself. This story rocks!"},{"Title":"Dead Aim","review":"I LOVE IRIS JOHANSEN!!!! ALL OF THE BOOKS I HAVE READ OF HERS ARE GREAT!!!!! READ THEM, YOU WON'T BE DISAPOINTED!"},{"Title":"Dead Aim","review":"This is the first and last Iris Johansen I'll read. I was expecting better. The plot is just silly and the dialogue is amateurish. This book reads as if it were written by an untalented high schooler for English class. Save your money, and read something by Janet Evanovich, Dorothy Gilman, Lee Child, Nelson Demille, or Dick Francis instead."},{"Title":"Knitting With Novelty Yarns : Exploring Color, Texture, and Style","review":"Although, this book is probably written for intermediate knitters, it is so inspiring, I'm trying out my beginner skills on the shell tops. Yummy looking yarns. The two authors present the same patterns with their own individual choice of yarns and colors. This doubles the information normally given for a single pattern. They have very different choices in the yarns they use which helps show the 'personality' of how the novelty yarn will look. Very instructive in helping me decide how much or little to use of these accent yarns. Yarns include boucle, brushed, chained-knitted, chenille, component, eyelash, nub, plied and ribbons. The book starts out with a quick review of knitting basics. It then goes on to discuss yarn types and shows examples of how different they look when knitted into the same stitch. As a beginning knitter, I've discovered how variable yarns can hide my lack of expertise on my first several projects. The \\"how to adjust your fit\\" and construction instructions are better than I've seen elsewhere. The authors present classic shapes (shell tops and matching sweaters) and use a variety of yarns to add lots of texture and fun. A very \\"can do\\" approach that is inspiring."},{"Title":"Knitting With Novelty Yarns : Exploring Color, Texture, and Style","review":"The first half of the book is decent, where it goes over different types of novelty yarn and fibers. The projects are not great, and would be expensive to replicate since they use several types of novelty yarns in each item. None of the patterns were my style. I bought it to learn about how best to knit the different yarns I see in the shops, but I didn't really feel there was enough information about the different yarns presented. A book you would look through one time and probably not pick up again."},{"Title":"Knitting With Novelty Yarns : Exploring Color, Texture, and Style","review":"Only a crafter will know what I am talking about when I say \\"Thumbs up\\" to this book.

One can almost feel the yarns texture from the lovely photos. This is one of those books that inspires even if you don't think there's another sweater in you. I can't wait to open up my stash and get going on one of these beauties."},{"Title":"Knitting With Novelty Yarns : Exploring Color, Texture, and Style","review":"I was totally prepared to love this book, but when I read it, I found it to be quite disappointing. Whilst it has two or three helpful tips for knitting with novelty yarn and a gazillion gorgeous closeups of totally luscious yarns, it doesn't begin to go anywhere near the &quot;Exploration of Color, Texture, and Style&quot; promised in the title. In fact, aside from a few swatches knit with novelty yarns, it doesn't explore anything at all.Much of the information in the book has to do with correcting faults in sweaters, information that is presented more thoroughly in many other books. I was expecting something of the quality of Sally Melville's Styles (an excellent book that delves into the many uses for oddments).This book just doesn't fulfill it's promise of being a creative exploration. It's just a pattern book with a tip or two on fit, nothing more. And quite honestly, the designs are mostly dated (unless you're on a 1980's retro kick), and some are downright ugly.I tried to like it, but it just didn't offer me anything."},{"Title":"Knitting With Novelty Yarns : Exploring Color, Texture, and Style","review":"I am the kind of knitter who avoids the conservative - for example, I haven't used sheeps wool to knit with for years (partly also because I am allergic to sheeps wool). As a knitter I am magnetically drawn to the profusion of &quot;novelty&quot; yarns that have appeared in recent years. Because of the high price of such yarns, I have even experimented with making my own &quot;component&quot; yarns using two or more sale yarns in my stash. This book is a must for knitters who want to get the best effect using such lovely and unusual yarns. The photographs of the yarn skeins and stitch swatches are guaranteed to leave you drooling and your fingers itching to pick up your needles. The text, as written by the two designers who started novelty yarn companies &quot;Prism&quot; and &quot;Trendsetter&quot; (common names to those who haunt yarn stores and finger beautiful, expensive skeins of yarn)is supremely informative. The first half of the book is given over to explanation of the different fiber types (ANIMAL: angora, alpaca, cashmere, mohair, sheeps wool; PLANT: cotton, rayon, linen; PLANT/ANIMAL HYBRID: silk; and SYNTHETIC: acrylic, polyester and nylon). and how the different types of novelty yarn (boucle, brushed, chained and knitted, chenille, eyelash, nub, plied, woven and component) will be best showcased depending on the stitch used. Swatches of four different types of yarn all knitted using the same stitch (see below) are photographed together, perfectly demonstrating the text. (The swatches are knitted in stockinette, reverse stockinette, garter, seed or moss stitch, simple slip stitch, tweed checks, linen stitch, half linen stitch, dropped long stitch and dropped cable stitch.) This, in my opinion, is the major plus of the book, making the cost worthwhile to keep it as a reference on my knitting shelf. There are also good sections on how the different fibers handle while knitting, what kind of &quot;hand&quot; the knitted fabric will produce, tips on working with unusual yarns, recommendations for needle size to get the effect you want, the fine points of fitting, a good section on making knitted or crocheted edgings, and, as always, the importance (I call it the zen) of swatching. The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is purely personal taste. I was disappointed that the sweater examples seemed busy and fussy to me, although some of the shawls/wraps were lovely. Even so, if you love to knit with novelty yarns, this book belongs in your library."},{"Title":"Knitting With Novelty Yarns : Exploring Color, Texture, and Style","review":"This book, written by the owners of Prism and Trendsetter yarns, is a fiber lover's delight! These folks know and love their fibers. The book is chock full of yummy yarns, beautifully photographed in luscious color. Not just a &quot;pretty face&quot;, it is also a great source for practical information about the novelty yarns that fascinate all fiber fiends! The book is well organized into sections detailing fiber types, basic fitting instructions, and construction techniques. The real joy for this knitter, however, are the sections on &quot;Knitting Successfully with Novelty Yarns,&quot; (including actual pictures of pattern stitches and the different results obtained with different types of novelty yarns), and the &quot;Flock Exchange&quot;; patterns for sweaters and wraps, worked two different ways by each of the authors, using different yarns, and sometimes different designing details. Both of these sections are especially filled with hints and tips on how to get the best results from the yarns. While this book will undoubtedly be criticized by some for using expensive, possibly &quot;harder to find in your local yarnshop&quot; yarns (they use their Prism and Trendsetter yarns), detailed schematics and gauges are given, and the possibilities for creating with novelty yarns seem endless. I thought this book was a bit pricey for a paperback, but found the photographs well worth it. I have already incorporated one of the slip stitch patterns, which showcases novelty yarn quite nicely, into a shawl I am currently working on. Cannot wait to try some more! If you enjoy working with novelty yarns (or just drooling over them), I hightly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Knitting With Novelty Yarns : Exploring Color, Texture, and Style","review":"I bought this book to solve a problem I have a fairly large backstock of a novelty yarn and when the purchasing haze cleared, I wasn't sure what I'd do with it. I was hoping this book would give me ideas....especially on work-a-bility of patterns with challenging yarn. That is perhaps not a fair test, I admit.This book is loaded with designs for fizzy, hairy yarns. As a result, everything looks very dated. I found almost nothing that would work with \\"my\\" novelty yarn, a slubby Gedifra number. I would wear almost nothing I see in this book."},{"Title":"Knitting With Novelty Yarns : Exploring Color, Texture, and Style","review":"I was looking for a primer on yarns.

The beautiful color images of the knitted pieces made from unique combinations of novelty yarns offered many ideas for my own work.

Excellent resource, I find I go back to it regularly for inspiration.A busy knitter."},{"Title":"Knitting With Novelty Yarns : Exploring Color, Texture, and Style","review":"This is an outstanding guide for using novelty yarns.

It shows examples of different stitches using a variety of novelty yarns. This is invaluable to choosing a yarn and a stitch you like without having to waste yarn trying things out.On the negative side, I would say the projects are a bit conservative and don't display the wonderful yarns to their best advantage. Every project is a sweater. For gorgeous projects that you would LOVE to wear, I suggest Exquisite Little Knits by Schreier & Kimmelstiel. Plenty of items that use only a couple balls so you can afford to make them.These two books together make a good starting point for novelty yarns."},{"Title":"Knitting With Novelty Yarns : Exploring Color, Texture, and Style","review":"Lots of good ideas.

She was not an avid reader of novels but she wound up reading this book from cover to cover and for days she raved about how wonderful it was. I thought so, too.

She moves the story forward logically and in a comfortable pace and ties up everything nicely in the end. A story about how people manage to move on, overcome hardship, and how people can help and support each other. At the same time, the book captures the time period and the feelings of young and old people in the beginning of the 1950s.

You can't stop reading because you want to find out why, and when you do find out, it explains everything. I loved Georgia Collins the same way I loved Katherine Paterson's character, Gilly Hopkins. As a teen writing teacher, I feel this book is a natural for the classroom as a springboard for discussions about what to do when you disagree with your best friend about something important, such as whether our country should be fighting a war. Woodworth has an amazing gift for putting complex, timely issues in a framework that kids can relate to."},{"Title":"Georgie's Moon","review":"Georgies Moon, by Chris Woodworth, is a great book! My daughter Missy loves being able to relate to the girls and boys in the book. Georgies dad is going away to war and she is sad about it. But Georgie has a friend to talk to and comfort her in a way that parents sometimes can't. My daughter loved the idea of the way Georgie was able to decorate her room in a way that helped her deal with her dad being away. There are many things about the book that she loves. She loves the way the writer tells the story so that characters just jump off the page in to a real life situation to her. I have heard about this book every day since they have started reading it. The author is visiting the school in Covington, Indiana during the time the kids are reading it and Missy is so excited. I would recommend this book to any one because it has a way to draw in the children so they can't put it down. Any family friendly book that can capture the mind of a child and entice them to read is a great book!

It's 1970 and the Vietnam War has taken him away and caused all kinds of repercussions - not unlike the current crises going on in our world today. Poignant and heartfelt at its core, Woodworth still manages to pepper her novel with humor and colorful characters, including two elderly women at a nursing home who mirror the relationship between Georgie and her only friend, Lisa. Grab a box of tissues and hunker down with this one - your heartstrings will definitely be plucked."},{"Title":"Georgie's Moon","review":"As an adult with grandchildren, I'm always interested in reading children's books.

This book is on the other end of the spectrum. Three major disappointments:1.) The book is physically small (6&quot; x 9.25&quot;) and only 300 pages in length. For the price, I expected a much larger treatise.2.) This is the worst production of a book I've ever seen; and I have a lot of specialized, scientific references from many different publishers.The type face is ugly and very difficult to read. Tiring on the eyes, too. The chapter and section headings have blurred edges on each letter. Perhaps the production manager thought this looked &quot;cute,&quot; but it is distracting. The typeface and fonts should not be noticeable by the reader. This one gets in the way.3.) The programs used in part 1 and provided both by listing and on diskette were written in 1988 in spaghetti-coded BASIC and never updated. No C code, no reference to the fact that even in 1992 (when the book was first published) most readers had PC's with more than 64K RAM and faster cpu's than a 4MHz 8088.Although the book has been reprinted three times, it has not been updated. The references to published algorithms date back to the mid-1970's and make no mention of modern ones (e.g., &quot;Numerical Recipes in C.&quot;)All in all, this book is terribly overpriced for the value of the content. Yes, this is probably still the best reference for understanding computer contouring algorithms and math, but it should be published in paperback for much less money.If you need the information, borrow a copy via interlibrary loan and make notes on what information you need."},{"Title":"Contouring: A Guide to the Analysis and Display of Spatial Data (Computer Methods in the Geosciences)","review":"In large part, I agree with Dr Shepard.

Also assuming the library's magnetic security system hasn't wiped it by now (ours have!).But that said, it's not a bad book as far as content is concerned.

One day, when I get time....."},{"Title":"Motown Bass (Bass Signature Licks)","review":"I have most of the other book/CD instructional manuals on Motown and R&B; bass playing (including Dr. Licks' \\"Standing in the Shadows of Motown\\" and Ed Friedland's \\"R&B; Bass Masters\\") and really prefer this approach.Rubin picks 15 absolutely classic Motown songs with bass lines ranging from fairly simple (\\"My Girl\\") to rather complex (\\"For Once in My Life\\" and \\"Reach Out, I'll Be There\\"). He breaks each song into easily-digested sections and studies them section-by-section.In the book, the bass lines are presented in standard notation and in tablature format and written discussions review the history of the song and pay special attention to the bassist's style and technique.On the CD, the music for each section is played by a band with the bass part solo'ed on one channel. The arrangements played are true to the originals and the bass parts are very accurate transcriptions of the classic lines from the original hit recordings. When the bass part for a particular section is complex, the CD features a slowed-down bass-only version so the person playing along can learn more easily.This approach is very effective! Sure, the \\"Standing in the Shadows of Motown\\" book is great because it gets into some more obscure songs and because it features famous bass players playing the songs. That approach, however, works more as an appreciation of a style or as a \\"master class\\" for more advanced bass players than it does as an introduction to that style. Rubin's \\"Motown Bass\\" is the great introduction that bassists have never had but always needed!"},{"Title":"Motown Bass (Bass Signature Licks)","review":"Excellent book.

The CD plays about 20 seconds of the tune then skips. I tried two different stereos to check. To bad as this looks like a great instruction book."},{"Title":"Motown Bass (Bass Signature Licks)","review":"I am very dissappointed with this product. I will start with some obvious errors in the text of the booklet. I will avoid commenting on the technical aspects because I am a beginner. However, I consider myself a fair historian with regards to Motown music. Some of my comments may appear nit-picky, however, I discovered quite a few mistakes in just a brief glance through the book. This makes me wonder about the accuracy of the technical portion. First, the choice of cover picture seems inappropriate. The title of this product is 'Motown Bass' with a focus on legendary bassist James Jamerson. Therefore, it would be more appropriate to at least have Jamerson's picture on the cover. The introduction to 'I heard it through the Grapevine' appears to contain erroneous information. Marvin Gaye actually recorded his verions first but Gladys Knight's version, while recorded about a year later, was released first (1967) Gayes version was released around 1970.'Gettin Ready' has Rare Earth boldly listed alongside it. While Rare Earth did record a cover of 'Gettin Ready', it was originally released in 1966 and was a moderate success for the Temptations, not Smokey Robinson and the Miracles, although it was written by Smokey. As for Mary Wells 'My Guy' the opening piece was actually lifted from 'Canadian Sunset' not 'Begin the Beguine'. Finally, James Jamerson was credited for playing practially all the bass with the exception of a few self- contained groups (Rare Earth and Jr. Walker and the All Stars), actually, Jamerson played on many of Jr. Walker's hits. It makes me wonder what types of errors are present on the technical aspects of this book. In addition, the CD was poor. There is a much superior 2-CD sampling of Jamerson (and Motown) work on Dr. Licks - 'Standing in the Shadows of Motown: The Life and Times of Legenary Motown Bassist James Jamerson. In addition, the soundtrack to the movie 'Standing in the Shadow of Motown' (Disc 2) featuring the Funk Brothers is excellent, highlighting James work along with the other exceptional musicians at Motown."},{"Title":"Motown Bass (Bass Signature Licks)","review":"If you are looking for a break down of mostly James Jamersons bass tech, it's not a bad book.

(#1)","review":"I would like to start by saying that this compilation(2series')does not live up to the infinity gaunlet series. I enjoyed this compilation very much but there are certain high and low points. The low points: The 2 series' contained in this compilation do not directly overlap; you have to switch back and forth and even then there are repetitions in the stories. The action is minimal. There is only one direct fight with the magus(the main villian of this saga) and that is in the last issue. There are series of clones who do most of the fighting and despite featuring characters such as Galactus, Eternity, and Infinity the action still does not overwhelm you. They spend an entire issue introducing us to Gamora and giving us her background, but its basically 20something pages of filler you could have done without. I did say there were high points. The High points: Adam Warlock who i enjoy as well as Thanos, play large rolls in this series. The comic replaces action with cunning and manipulating schemes. Even though i would have liked some action, the indepth plots are enjoyable. The art work is a given with Lim and Medina so there's no surprise there. All in all I would recommend the series to anyone who wants more out of the series, but if youre counting on it living up to the infinity gaunlet series, you will be disappointed. Enjoy."},{"Title":"The Infinity War (First Strike!) (#1)","review":"First off, this book is PACKED! It will take you a while to read this complete collection of the 1990's Infinity War mini-series which was the follow up to the excellent Infinity Gauntlet series by Marvel.In addition to the Infinity War series there are numerous extra issues included. The problem is they are included out of order. This book should have been sorted where you could read it front to back and have the story in chronological order, instead, you read the Infinity War series then you run into the individual issues with more of the back story.Still, there is so much material here for the price it's almost like an omnibus. I just wish they would have put the issue in chronological order.The story itself is much weaker than Infinity Gauntlet but stronger than the follow up Infinity Crusade, but I love the cosmic powered Marvel characters and they all play major roles in this book including: Eternity, The Living Tribunal, Galactus, Death, and many more.This book also features dozens and dozens of Marvel characters in cameo roles. If you had a favorite character from the 1990's then odds are they make at least a brief appearance here.A lot of content but the chronology makes no sense what so ever."},{"Title":"The Infinity War (First Strike!)

(#1)","review":"I remember collecting these when i was a kid, and even when i was 14 i thought this was the dumbest most needless series ever written. I LOVED the Infinity Gauntlet and was excited to read this new tale of Adam Warlock, Silver Surfer, Thanos and such. So do me a favor and look at all those marvel superheros....they are all just scattered around the story adding no depth what so ever. As a matter of fact almost all of them could have been left out, its hard to sell books that way though. Better put Wolverine and Captain America on that cover, Adam Warlock doesn't ship enough units on his own. Do yourself and me a favor. Ignore this, and GOD HELP US if they ever put out \\"The Infinity Crusade\\" as a trade, its the only turd bigger than this train wreck. THIS is the kind of thing that killed comics in the nineties."},{"Title":"The Infinity War (First Strike!) (#1)","review":"Don't get me wrong. I love the stories of Warlock written by Jim Starlin, illustrated by Ron Lim, Angel Medina et al; and I'm happy Marvel has collected these books under one cover. That's the good. The bad?You sure do have to flip around a lot, back and forth, in the book, if you want to read the stories in chronological order! Marvel has grouped the \\"Infinity War\\" miniseries together, followed by the 4 tied-in issues of \\"Warlock and the Infinity Watch\\", followed by the Thanos back up features that ran in Marvel Comics Presents. BUT the issues of \\"Warlock...\\" occur concurrently with \\"Infinity War\\", chronologically \\"Infinity War\\" #1 should be followed by \\"Warlock...\\" #7, followed by IW #2, followed by W #8,and then IW #3, then the Marvel Comics Presents (Thanos Backup feature), the IW #4, W #9 and so on. The \\"I Thanos\\" feature from \\"Marvel Comics Presents\\" is problematic, as takes place within the time span of IW #3 (within a panel of that issue, even) and overlaps with W #8. The Thanos Christmas story at the TPB's end? I'm not even sure when or where that is.Marvel has released their X-Men \\"Age of Apocalypse\\" Trade Paperbacks in chronological order. It's a shame they couldn't do the same for \\"Infinity War\\"."},{"Title":"The Infinity War (First Strike!) (#1)","review":"Marvel has a poor QC record on its collections, due to easily avoidable things such as bad resolution, faulty coloring, and missing pages or text. After finishing the INFINITY WAR trade, I can say that improper story order can be added to the list. The trade collects Infinity War #1 - 6, Warlock and the Infinity Watch (WATIW) #7 - 10, and Marvel Comics Presents #108 - 111, in that specific order. The only problem is, that's not the order in which the comics were released, and it's certainly not the order in which the story moves. The Infinity War issues comprise the main story, and they can be read on their own, for the most part; however, the WATIW issues provide many important plot points that are essential for understanding why events proceed as they do in Infinity War. To print these stories out of their chronological order, as if WATIW serves as an appendix, is just plain stupid (they even reference which Infinity War issues they come between, so why have them out of order?).Unfortunately, this organization problem brings Jim Starlin's excellent storyline down quite a few notches. While I have maintained that Starlin's INFINITY GAUNTLET should have been \\"the last Thanos story\\", INFINITY WAR provides a good follow-up, focusing on a changed Thanos as he joins forces with Adam Warlock and the Infinity Watch (Gamorra, Pip the Troll, Drax the Destroyer, and Moondragon) to battle Warlock's evil double, the Magus, who is now in search of the Infinity Gauntlet. In addition, Eternity has been removed from the playing field, and Galactus must find out how and why, with the help of the Living Tribunal. The story provides many excellent perspectives on Thanos' personality, showing how his brush with omnipotence in INFINITY GAUNTLET affected his views on life, loyalty, and his purpose. The only problem I have with the core story itself is the fact that this had to be a company-wide crossover to boost sales, so of course the heroes of the Marvel Universe, who are largely ineffectual in a cosmic event such as this, only serve to provide big two-page spreads of fight scenes, while the aforementioned cosmic types do their thing. But then maybe it wouldn't be so bad if we weren't stuck with having to look at the \`90s versions of these heroes. This decade was certainly the dark age of Marvel costume revamps!As for the art, Ron Lim's work on the Infinity War issues really bugs me. It's too stiff - characters are drawn in a limited range of poses, and they frequently look as if they're uncomfortable with those poses that they're in. He also has no understanding of shadow, so everything looks flat and boring. Contrast this with the work of Tom Raney, who provides the art for WATIW: it's absolutely beautiful. Very detailed work, reminiscent of Art Adams, and Raney is defninitely a guy who understands how to use shadows. It's a shame he didn't do the whole book!In short, if you're really looking to save some money, you may want to just buy the INFINITY GAUNTLET trade and leave it at that. That book has a great story, and much better art by Perez & Lim. I would suggest INFINITY WAR only for someone who is a completist, or a big fan of Marvel's cosmic storylines."},{"Title":"The Infinity War (First Strike!) (#1)","review":"The limited series had a six-issue run from June to November 1992, which is bolstered in this volume by Warlock and the Infinity Watch #'s 7-10 and Marvel Comics Presents #'s 108-111.Written by Jim Starlin and illustrated by Ron Lim, the story line focuses on the ultimate villain Magus and the plot to gain power in the Marvel Universe. The first to fall are Reed Richards and Iron Man, while the battles build on Earth and in outer space. Magus seems to have the perfect plot, as evil doubles appear to doom the heroes to a bitter defeat.The plot is deftly composed and Lim's art is impressive.

(#1)","review":"Jim Starlin, Marvel's go-to architect of cosmic storylines throughout the '70s and '80s, was at the top of his game in this story's predecessor, The Infinity Gauntlet. It should have ended there. The plot of this one is not easily summarized, but here goes: Evil versions of Marvel's superheroes begin popping up everywhere, created by Adam Warlock's evil persona, The Magus, in an attempt to replace the Marvel universe with his own dark, twisted version. Ironically, it falls to Thanos, villain of the previous story, to team with Adam Warlock's Infinity Watch to save the day. Nearly every Marvel character appears in this one, from street-level (i.e. Spiderman, Daredevil) to cosmic (Galactucs, also acting heroically in this one, and Eternity). What Infinity War lacks that Infinity Gauntlet had is good character development. Infinity War is fairly shallow, which is a shame given the story possibilities of a penitent Thanos saving all of reality. It's also not plotted particularly well. This is a crossover where I often found myself having to reread things several times in order to figure out what exactly was going on, and that shouldn't happen; this is a comic book superhero story, not a 1990s crime thriller.Based purely on completeness of the trade, I would award an extra star. Included are issue #1-6 of The Infinity War miniseries, as well as several crossover issues of Adam Warlock and the Infinity Watch, short Thanos stories from Marvel Comics Presents, and brief text summaries of the various crossover issues. Marvel often does a good job of completion in their collection of major crossover storylines; however, while everything but the kitchen sink is included in this volume, it's poorly organized. The crossover issues (many of which provide those character moments, pivotal plot points, and even comic relief lacking in the main story) are included at the end of the trade, making for a rather disjointed reading experience. The art is worth a look, however."},{"Title":"The Infinity War (First Strike!) (#1)","review":"In 1992, I was 11 years old and just starting to collect comic books. I didn't have a background in Marvel's cosmic stories, but this story became a high point of my existence. I loved that the main story was so big that all of my favorite characters needed to get involved, and it even had impacts on all of their regular titles too. As an adult reading this collected edition, I see some major flaws in it, and I'm wary of line-wide crossovers in general, but I still love it.I love that Starlin was able to write an Adam Warlock story that was compelling and mysterious (I've never liked the character), that brought in many other heroes really just as extras (since no one outside of the Infinity Watch and its expected supporting cast had much influence), that put plenty of humor in an otherwise dark tale (I'm thinking mostly of Kang and Doom teaming up while trying to outsmart each other and bickering back and forth - it's brilliant), that brought out so much of Thanos' character in a random tie-in issue of the Infinity Watch... This is a fantastic story, with great Ron Lim art in the main title, and even for all the valid complaints about how it's inaccessible for anyone who wasn't reading it when it was published, and how all the cosmic stuff is undefined and whatever.. I just love it.I wish this collection had arranged the issues in a more chronological order (the book is all six Infinity War issues, THEN the Infinity Watch tie-ins, THEN a short series from Marvel Comics Presents, then a terrific textual run-down of the major events from the crossover issues, then a bizarre Christmas story about Thanos and Gamora, because you can't have Christmas without raisin-face and the woman who would kill your entire Christmas party with her bare hands if she felt like it... I think a more chronological arrangement would have been more effective), but the story is one that I like more, and for different reasons, the older I get."},{"Title":"The Infinity War (First Strike!)

I relied on the first edition of this book for the hike, but I own this second edition as well, so I can vouch for it. If you are planning to walk the APR, you should definitely buy this. The APR is covered in Lonely Planet's \\"Walking in Switzerland\\" as well, but Kev's book does a better job of giving you a feel for how the route meshes together as a whole. That said, the Lonely Planet book is worth a look, but consider borrowing it from your library and writing down the most useful bits in your travel notebook. You DO carry a travel notebook, right?Kev describes the route in its entirety, and in splendid detail. By necessity, he cannot document every little twist, turn, and rise of the path, but you really wouldn't want him to spoil all the fun. His sidebar anecdotes (which I assume he must have extracted from HIS travel notebook) add a good dose of humor and personality to the material.One thing I absolutely love about this author is his ability to put an optimistic, positive spin on every aspect of the walk. If you choose to hike the APR, the Hoht&uuml;rli is probably the most physically demanding section, and Kev tempers it by reminding you that with every step, you are gaining valuable elevation. Such is the character of this book.So, should you decide the APR is for you, buy this book well in advance, read it cover to cover at least twice, and carry it with you on the walk.

I'd have to say he delivered the goods on that one, and here the style and format is the same, although some of the graphics are cleaned up a little here. Obviously one can't do it with just the book, as the excellent Swiss maps are required as well, but he does a great job of referring to map details in his unfolding instructional route narrative, so you can almost always tell where you are. I haven't found a better source, but then again, I've never felt the need to look any further.

In works of this sort, if the size is to be manageable at all, the authors have to decide whether to go with breadth of coverage or with depth. Kaplan and company have chosen to go with breadth, and attempt to cover a whopping 800 decks, mostly pictorially. They try to counter the unavoidable superficiality of most of this coverage by doing selected depth coverage of topics such as the Tarot of Marseilles and decks with Egyptian motifs, not to mention an extraordinary 1 page article entitled \\"Does the Tarot Work?\\" Although I find myself often wishing there were more detail, (or more color photography), in the last analysis, I think they made the right choice: I wouldn't sacrifice any of the decks covered for additional detail.

It lists published and unpublished decks, Rider-Waite and Tarot de Marseilles-influenced decks, Japanese and tarocchi decks. As an example of research, it is overwhelmingly broad, yet disappointingly superficial. Missing are the supplementary articles that made previous volumes so useful: the origin of the deck, the current locations of all extant Visconti-Sforza cards, information on tax stamps (to aid in identifying older decks), a biography of Pamela Colman-Smith, a list of all known early references to Tarot, and many more than can be listed here. While volumes I through III certainly contained an overwhelming number of decks themselves, the extra material placed the Tarot in a historical and scholarly context. Especially interesting was the article in volume I listing notable omissions in ancient lists of games, gambling, and fortune-telling where the Tarot should have been mentioned had it been in existence at that time.In place of this fascinating and useful information, the sole supplement in volume IV is a one-page essay \\"Does the Tarot Work?\\" That's it. Hasn't any new historical data become available in the past decade and a half? What about a survey of the uses of the Tarot in modern society? Has there been any psychological research into the effect of archetypal images on the human consciousness? One is left with the conclusion that nothing new has come to light, that all the available information has already appeared in the first three volumes; that the only progress in Tarot has been the production of a staggering number of new decks, possibly more than the potential number of buyers.Of course, this isn't true - there have been an enormous number of books on the Tarot published in the past 15 years. In fact, a trend has emerged where new decks more frequently come with their own detailed softcover book in place of the traditional \\"little white book.\\" It wouldn't have taken much to at least comment on this.I can recommend volume IV only to those who require the largest possible catalog of decks. The exhaustiveness of the list can be educational: for example, I had long been puzzled by the imagery on Giorgio Trevisan's \\"Renaissance\\" Tarot; volume IV informs me that it was based on the Landsknechts, the 16th century mercenaries.

This book is largely an answer to those who would contend that Lincoln showed little promise of greatness before supposedly stumbling into the Presidency, where it is acknowledged even by those critics that he rose to the heights demanded by the times. The author certainly admits to the elements of circumstance in Lincoln's ascent. He was a Whig, or a moderate, in a state Illinois that had become increasingly important in national elections.While it may have appeared that Lincoln was politically dormant in the early 50s, his behind-the-scenes political activity became obvious when he became a key anti-Nebraska activist in 1854. As a Whig, Lincoln lost a very close contest in the Illinois legislature for the U.S. Senate (legislatures elected senators in that era). From 1854 to 1856 it had become obvious that both the Whigs and the upstart Know-Nothings could not deal with the slavery issue, which led to their demise. By 1856 Lincoln had finished second in the running for the Vice-Presidential nomination at the first national Republican convention, and in the process had firmly established himself as a leading Republican in Illinois.It was the continued Kansas crisis and the Dred Scott Supreme Court decision in March of 1857 and the reactions to them that put Lincoln on the national stage. The court decision had affirmed the repeal of the Missouri Compromise in the Kansas-Nebraska Act under a principle of Congressional non-intervention in territories. But Senator Stephen Douglas contended that his doctrine of popular sovereignty continued to hold. Both Lincoln and most Republicans found the indifference or neutrality of popular sovereignty to the spread of slavery to be repugnant. Thus began a series of exchanges and seven formal debates between Douglas and Lincoln before the elections of 1858.As a senator from mostly anti-slavery Illinois, Douglas had been forced, at the end of 1857, to denounce the machinations of the proslavery element in Kansas in trying to force their constitution on a mostly slave-free territory. In a shrewd and unprecedented political move, Illinois Republicans nominated Lincoln for the U. S. Senate to counter the infatuation of Eastern Republicans with the newly recreated Douglas. Lincoln fired the first shot in the senatorial campaign with his famous \\"House Divided\\" speech where he insisted that a nation divided over slavery could not stand.One of the more controversial ideas that emerged from the debates was Douglas' Freeport Doctrine. In skirting Lincoln's question of whether territorial legislatures could exclude slavery, Douglas claimed that such a legislature's failure to pass laws that favorably policed slavery was tantamount to formally excluding it. The Democratic illusion that non-intervention and popular sovereignty were benignly equivalent had been exploded. According to the author \\"Southerners could see the walls closing in on them, and the defection of Douglas vividly dramatized the growing isolation of slave society.\\" Ignoring Dred Scott, the South began to insist on the enactment of positive slave codes for the explicit protection of slavery in territories.Lincoln narrowly lost the senatorial contest in Illinois in 1858, but the issue of slavery had been discussed on the national stage, as it never had been before. While Lincoln had asked the hard questions about slavery, he remained a moderate in Republican circles, and, as such, perhaps the only Republican that could have been elected President in 1860. It is clear that Lincoln had no intention of attacking the institution of slavery in the South. The Southern demand for slave codes applicable to territories was simply irrational given the fact that it was generally agreed upon that no territories were even suitable for slavery. It is most clear from reading this book that had the extremists of the South permitted Lincoln to exercise the fundamental decency and strength of character that he had, that there would have been no reason to precipitate the destruction of an entire way of life."},{"Title":"Prelude to Greatness: Lincoln in the 1850's","review":"After losing his Congress seat in 1849, former Whig representative Abraham Lincoln did not hold any public office for 12 years. He lost two Senatorial elections - but in 1861, he was elected as the first Republican president of the United States of America.The main thrust of &quot;Prelude to Greatness: Lincoln in the 1850s&quot; is the attempt to explain how that happened. This is not a biography - rather, it is a collection of interconnected essays exploring, among other things, the importance of Lincoln's Illinois background, his transformation from Whig to Republican, the House Divided speech, and above all, the contest between Lincoln and the most important politician of the 1850s, Stephen A. Douglas.The late Don E. Fehrenbacher was one of the best scholars of American Law & Politics in the 19th century, and of its relations with slavery. He is best known for his study of the Pulitzer winning account of the Dred Scot Case, but has also written books about the Secession Crises in the United States and about the relations of the US Government to Slavery.Those who have read Professor Fehrenbacher before will reencounter not only his masterful prose and careful analysis, but many themes that he has written about elsewhere - Slavery in the territories, the &quot;Freeport doctrine&quot;, the Dred Scot Case, etc. But the greatness of Fehrenbacher was his ability to offer every time a new insight into these issues, widening and deepening your understanding of it.This time, the focus is on the interplay between the ambitions and ideals of Abraham Lincoln and Stephen A Douglas. We see the famous &quot;House Divided&quot; speech as Lincoln's attempt to distinguish between the Anti-Lecompton Douglas (the Lecompton constitution was a fraudulent pro slavery creation, which Stephen Douglas opposed because he felt it violated the principle of popular sovereignty) and the Republicans: Republicans saw slavery as evil, whereas Douglas treated it with indifference.Fehrenbacher maintains that the 'House Divided' speech was less revolutionary then it sometimes appears. &quot;The bright promise of ultimate extinction [of slavery] was one of the consequences expected to flow naturally from a settled policy of restrict[ing the expansion of slavery]&quot; (p. 76). So Southerners could supposedly be satisfied that, beyond restricting its extension, no further steps against slavery were intended. Yet, as Fehrenbacher points out, Lincoln believed in a national policy against slavery, treating it as an evil (p. 148). For Southerners, who saw Slavery as a matter of the States, and who have come to appreciate it as a positive good, that was unacceptable.Yet, at least with the benefit of hindsight, The South promoted the worst policy possible, if the defense of the &quot;Peculiar Institution&quot; was what it was after. By their insistence of the repeal of the Missouri compromise (forbidding slavery in the part of the Missouri territory north of the Mason Dixon line), a harsh fugitive trade law, and accepting the fraudulent Lecompton constitution, Southerners agitated the Northern public about the slavery issue, thus strengthening the Republican Party.When Stephen Douglas, courting his Northern audience, adopted increasingly anti-Slavery positions (interestingly, Fehrenbacher here sees Douglas's position as entirely opportunistic. Later, in 'The Dred Scot Case' he saw Douglas's motives as a mix of calculation and principle, see Fehrenbacher, Dred Scot Case p. 465), the South's alienation from Douglas made it even more extreme - thus, the &quot;Freeport doctrine&quot;, which said that the people of a territory had the ability to reject slavery by unfriendly legislation (essentially, the observation that unpopular laws are difficult to enforce), initially acceptable to the South, became anathema once it was identified with Douglas.Lincoln's rise had much to do with Stephen Douglas. Without the Lincoln-Douglas debates of 1858, he probably wouldn't have become president, at least not in 1860. But Lincoln's triumph in the Republican convention in Chicago was based on his apparent moderation - the leading candidate William H. Seward, was far too anti-Slavery; and his public opposition to nativism was also objectionable.Lincoln was elected because he was a compromise candidate - his public profile of moderation, essential for winning over the lower Northern states, and being a representative of Illinois, one of the crucial states in the election. But he also won because of his careful political maneuvering. Lincoln certainly 'grew' as a president, but facing the most crucial presidency in American history, Lincoln was already the right man."},{"Title":"Prelude to Greatness: Lincoln in the 1850's","review":"As a long time admirer of Lincoln, I've often been a bit puzzled about how he rose so quickly from relative obscurity to prominence. This little book shows some of the paddling under the surface. It also sets the background of a minor ,although principled, politician, who later rose to the sublimity of the 2nd inaugural speech.Lincoln was always a \\"work in progress\\", and this shows the ground work being laid.Well written and therefore easy to read...a tour de force!"},{"Title":"Challenges of Human Space Exploration (Springer Praxis Books / Space Exploration)","review":"The title of this book is very misleading. It does not examine the &quot;Challenges of Human Space Exploration,&quot; but presents the research conducted on the MIR by US researchers using NASA astronauts on the Russian built MIR Space Station. In spite of the misleading title, I found this book to a good addition to my collection of books on the space program.Unlike the book Dragonfly by Bryan Burrough, which presents the ugly, but real side, of the Shuttle/MIR missions, this book examines the research conducted by NASA astronauts on the MIR for various researchers and research organizations. In addition, many of the results and their use for Earth based applications are presented.The book opens with two preliminary chapters. The first chapter examines the Skylab program and the results of the experiments conducted onboard this space station. The second chapter deals with the MIR space station, what the Russians learned and Shuttle-MIR partnership. The next few chapters dealt with the experiments that were conducted by the NASA astronauts which focused on a variety of life sciences experiments such as, plant growth, protein crystal growth, and the bioreactor (cell tissue growth). The final two chapters summarize the lessons learned from MIR and how these lessons learned are being applied to the International Space Station.This book gave me a new perspective of the Shuttle-MIR missions that I have not seen elsewhere (and I work for NASA) and pointed out the many positive benefits from this space program. For example, several spin-offs, such a portable heart difibulator, have already made their way to the marketplace. Furthermore, rapid advances have been made in many areas of medical research, such as diabetes and cancer research.While the sections devoted to the positive aspects of the research were extremely interesting, I did, however, find the lessons learned chapter quite disturbing, but interesting in its own right. It seems that while NASA spent millions of dollars and many man hours on research facilities and operations training, very little if any effort was devoted to the psychological problems that could develop in such a closed, isolated and culturally different environment. It seems that at least some the criticism that this NASA program has received is clearly justified.While this book may not before everyone, it definitely was a refreshing change from other more critical books written about the Shuttle-MIR program. It should make you realize that the Shuttle-MIR program has and will have some important benefits to mankind and that is was not just another pork barrel government project."},{"Title":"Challenges of Human Space Exploration (Springer Praxis Books / Space Exploration)","review":"Healthy mix of history and scientific information.Very detailed scientific account of Mir's story, that couldn't be found anywhere else."},{"Title":"Maidensong","review":"I was privileged to read this book in manuscript form, and am very eager to get the actual book in my hands. Diana Groe has a fresh perspective on romance writing, and I especially liked her true-to-life characters. Part of the story involves a long journey from the northlands to the fabled city of Constantinople; this was a fun departure (pun intended!) from the ordinary. I have no doubts that many readers will be glad to discover this exciting new author, and will look forward to other books from her (including the sequel to this one, called \\"Erinsong\\", due out this fall!).

In the assault they kill her renowned story telling father, the skald Magnus Silver-Throat and capture amongst others his two children, Rika also a skald storyteller and her brother Ketil as slaves of the Jarl of Sogna. The ruler's younger brother Bjorn the Black led the raid that imprisoned Rika, who vows to kill him.Bjorn decides he wants the courageous skald, but knows he must ask his sibling for permission. Instead of showing his appreciation the Jarl displays his jealousy of his brother's success. Still even as Rika and Bjorn begin to fall in love, the Jarl promises her to his Byzantine trading partner as he loathes his sibling and gives him nothing even what he earned.This exciting Dark Ages romance takes the audience on a deep tour of Scandinavia and the Byzantine Empire with a deep look at the societies of both. The story line is action-packed as the two lead protagonists fall in love while landing in one escapade after another due to the betrayal by the treacherous Jarl, however, whose loathing seems cartoonish.

Maidensong had me in tears many times feeling the heartache of the characters. I became edgy in the combat scenes, and uplifted in those tender moments. The only reason I had to put the book down so many times was because I was so taken by the emotions, that I had to give my poor heart a break.For an author to make me feel THAT intensely, . . . All I can say is BRAVA!If you like historical/norse romances, and if you LOVE Josie Litton's work, don't miss Maidensong! It is a true romance, with surprises, and twists that I have come to expect from such a talented author."},{"Title":"Maidensong","review":"This was my first encounter with the writing of Diana Groe and I was enchanted...I cared about the characters, their trials, romance and travels.

Rika's mother died birthing her and her father, maddened by his grief in losing his wife, put the newborn Rika \\"out\\": Wrapped her in a blanket and placed her on an ice floe to die.But a famous skald found the baby and raised her as his own daughter. Rika has an adoptive brother who is simple-minded. When the village they're visiting is raided, their father is killed. Bjorn the Black, leader of the raiders, takes Rika and her brother as slaves.Bjorn is a second son; his older brother is the jarl. Their father was murdered a year ago and, even though he swore loyalty to his brother, Bjorn isn't too keen on some of his brother's decisions. But Bjorn claims Rika as payment for the raid and his brother isn't happy about it.Nobody believes Rika is a skald until she storytells and proves her worth. Bjorn wants to marry her. His scheming brother forces Rika to accept a marriage offer from an Arab ally. Bjorn escorts her to Constantinople to wed the Arab.The first half of this debut book was very good, fast moving, somewhat brutal and unforgiving as the Viking life was. After they arrive in Constantinople the story wasn't as good. Didn't measure up to the Viking part. Also Rika was too erratic - one minute she's sweet and the next she's a shrill harpy. She spurns Bjorn time and again then caves completely to the jarl's coercion? Didn't work for me. Oh, and a \\"maidensong\\" is a love story."},{"Title":"Maidensong","review":"This actually read like two different novels. The first half was wonderful. The heroine, Rika, is a storytelling maiden who finds herself and her adopted brother enslaved by Vikings. Her captor, Bjorn, claims her as his own and tries to woo her into accepting him as a lover. Rika is beautiful and catches the eye of Bjorn's older brother, the jarl. There is bad blood between these two brothers and Rika is caught in the middle.The Jarl sends Rika to Constantinople to marry an Arab trading partner. She agrees to the marriage to protect her brother from the jarl but she is in love with Bjorn and he with her but she does not tell him that she is being coerced into this marraige and contrary to her natural feistiness submits to the jarl. This personality switch was a little jarring. This is the proud defiant skald who stood toe to toe with Bjorn but suddenly acquiesces to the jarl?The trip to Constantinople allows Rika and Bjorn to become lovers but she is still determined to marry someone else even after Bjorn's confession of love. Again, this seemed out of character. She did not want Bjorn's help at all, she's defiant with him but not the jarl.While in Constantinople she joins the harem and intervenes to protect Bjorn but again stubbornly wants to go through with the marriage. For a smart girl this makes no sense. She has no proof that her brother is living a safe life back with the Norsemen so wWhy go through with this marriage, especially when Bjorn is ready to defend her and avenge the wrongs against her?I really liked the first half of the book. The Viking village and the relationship between the main characters were well written. Once Rika set her mind to a forced marriage and left on her journey, the book lost some of its charm. Rika had such a personality shift from determined and smart to stubborn, illogical and distrusting that it felt like I was reading about another character."},{"Title":"Maidensong","review":"Quite vividly written. Awesome story!!q"},{"Title":"Maidensong","review":"This was Diana Groe's debut novel followed by ERINSONG, both Viking romances. No date is given for this one but it mentions a character named Halfdan who lived in the late 5th-early 6th century. It is set in Sweden and Constantinople.Born a jarl's daughter but rejected by her father at birth because of her mother's death in childbed, Rika is set adrift on a slab of ice by the midwife, expected to die. Instead, she was found by the famous skald, Magnus, who raised her like a daughter and taught her his storytelling craft. When she is grown, a Viking raid ends in the death of Magnus and her capture by Bjorn the Black. Bjorn claims her as his bed slave but then falls in love with her and desires to marry her. Meanwhile his twisted brother has other plans.This was a good story that held my interest but slowed when they got to Constantinople. There a few plot developments didn't go so well. It was not clear why Rika insisted on following through with the marriage to the Arab she didn't want when she had a clear out and Bjorn wasn't intending to return North. And then there was Gunnar's perfidy that, once known, should have changed everything. It just didn't seem natural to me that it would happen that way. I noticed other reviewers pointed this out, even saying the second part of the story wasn't as good. The story recovered toward the end and had a nice finish.

I taught myself how to cook using cookbooks so I believe a good cookbook is one that inspires and should be understandable and reasonably easy to use; with that in mind I love this cookbook.A big reason I love this book is because it does not try to trick you into believing that a great meal will just magically appear in 30 minutes. This book educates you on how to organize your kitchen so you will be able to produce gourmet meals with minimal cooking time. This includes practical suggestions on how to stock your kitchen pantry, refrigerator and freezer. Detailed time-saving techniques on how to prepare herbs, spices and other ingredients ahead of time so that their flavor is preserved and you have minimal prep-time when cooking. There is also advice on equipment and a lot of time is spent on techniques; each individual technique or set of techniques are explained step-by-step and illustrated when necessary.I find that knowing my skill level helps me to determine if a cookbook is written for me; so far my stages of development have been total disaster, occasional disaster or novice, beginner, experienced beginner, advanced beginner/almost intermediate, and now I consider myself an intermediate cook. I am not a gourmet or professional by any means. I would not recommend this cookbook for a novice or beginner but for an experienced beginner through intermediate cook who wants to expand his or her repertoire and wants suggestions on technique, food preparation and stocking up their kitchen.

Although he would become a leading diplomat in later years, he first turned to literary activities, of which The Rise of the Dutch Republic played a major role. Published in 1856 it became very popular among European and American readers and was translated in many languages,including Dutch and Russian.This work not only describes the history of Holland in colorful and eloquent terms and with a sense of sympathy for the Dutch, but also instructs in well documented ways how the Dutch built their Republic and a political system which still today influences Dutch society. Moreover it offers lessons to a modernday world which continues to grapple with dictatorships, disfunctional governments and failed states.

The Jewish ethical work called Ethics of the Fathers 1:2 reports that Simon the Just said that the earth endures because of three things, two of which are religious: \\"Torah, divine worship, and acts of loving-kindness.\\" However, in 1:18 of the same volume, Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel offers a practical idea, \\"the world rests on three things: truth, justice, and peace.\\" Henrik Ibsen has a similar view.The protagonist in this excellent play is Bernick, is a highly respected owner of a ship building business. Bernick lives in a society that he controls because of his wealth and the prestige that wealth produces. He donated many items to his community and placed his name on them. At one point in the play there is a mass demonstration of citizens praising him.But Ibsen shows us why we should despise him. Bernick insists that his community follow the traditional ways, meaning the behavior that the masses sanctioned for some generations, notions that they read into the Bible although a fair reading would not find them, ideas that stagnate human development and societal advancement, thoughts that enlightened people reject. He views women as inferior to men, childlike, foolish, unable to understand, beings that should be subservient to men. He talks down to his wife during the few times that he talks to her. Outrageously, he says to her at one point, as if he were speaking to a wall, I have no one to talk to. Dina, a young woman who he squashes because of his view of women, says that her life in this city is \\"so proper and so moral\\" that it is impossible to live with these people. Lona, another character, comes to Bernick's house, to \\"let in fresh air.\\"Ibsen shows that Bernick is a hypocrite, a liar, a crook, a man who intends, in a Bernie Madoff fashion, to steal from people who trust him, a man who could care less about seeing people die if he can make money. He persuaded a close relative into taking the blame for one of his crimes, and this individual suffered for more than a decade because of it.Ibsen ends his book by saying that the true builders of society are not people, but \\"the spirit of truth and the spirit of freedom,\\" the very things that Bernick squashed."},{"Title":"B-29 Superfortress in Action - Aircraft No. 165","review":"This being my third Superfortress title from Squadron/Signal, I was suprised to find that Larry Davis managed to find things that Steve Birdsall seems to have left out.

Even if this book isn't widely read, it is quite important in the history of political ideas.&quot;Reflections on Violence&quot; is a little difficult to read sometimes, because it was the result of many articles that the author had written regarding many subjects. When he finally put them together he didn't rewrite them, because he believed that to be good, reading must be an exercise that implies a certain amount of work. Well, as a matter of fact he achieved that aim, but all the same the book is well worth the effort.In &quot;Reflections on violence&quot; Sorel gives great importance to the idea of social myth, because according to him, myths can lead everybody's energy towards a given aim. In his opinion, there is an enormous difference between myths and utopias, due to the fact that myths don't only describe an ideal, but try to reach it. Through utopia you tear yourself from the world, with a myth you transform it (and transforming it you find yourself, because man is creative activity).Sorel thinks that myths are not rational, and because of that they cannot be judged intellectually. One of the myths he studies is the myth of the general strike. He believed that particular myth could give the proletariat (through syndicalism) enough strenght to fight against the bourgeoisie. Sorel also affirms that violence is positive, because while force gives the workers chains, the violence directed at that force frees them.In conclusion, I must say I liked this book. When he highlights the importance of myth, I guess he also somehow stresses the tendency human beings have to dedicate their life to an ideal, a cause. And that ideal is likely to be of the utmost importance to us, because our beliefs make us. That is the reason why it is so important to choose the right ideal, the right cause.The problem is that Sorel doesn't measure the truth of each myth, but merely its efficacy, and by doing so opens the way for all kind of disasters. How can we expect even a little bit of rationality from social life if the ultimate end of that life cannot be evaluated rationally?. And if we cannot understand intellectually our aim (the myth), how can we realise if it is legitimate?. If you can, read this book... It'll make you think !!!Belen Alcat"},{"Title":"Reflections on Violence","review":"Today, George Sorel is virtually unknown. A century ago, this French political thinker was quite notorious. Shortly after the October Revolution in Russia, a Swiss newspaper accused Sorel of being responsible for it. The aged philosopher took it as a compliment, and wrote an article called \\"In Defence of Lenin\\". What Lenin himself thought of the episode is less clear, but in a work published long before the revolution, he called Sorel \\"a notorious muddlehead\\". Now, you don't get a reputation like *that* without reason!Sorel's ideas are difficult to summarize in a short review. Indeed, many scholarly works have been published on the man, who considered himself to be a socialist, while being seen by many as a forerunner of fascism. Sorel claimed to be a Marxist, but his Marxism wasn't the Marxism of Marx, but rather a strange blend of revolutionary syndicalism and ideas adapted from a long range of \\"bourgeois\\" sources. While initially a supporter of the left-wing syndicalist CGT, he later collaborated with right-wing monarchists, and seems to have praised both Lenin and Mussolini at the time of his death.\\"Reflections on Violence\\" was originally published in 1906, and later revised and expanded. It remains the most important text by Sorel, and the natural place to start for those interested in his thought. It should be noted at the outset that Sorel's text isn't particularly exciting, all the hype notwithstanding (as in the editorial review at this product page). Lenin and even Trotsky wrote worse things than this, and so did Nietzsche. Nor is Sorel's text an easy read, although it's better than its reputation. Sorel admitted that the text wasn't particularly systematic, and that it was really a collection of notebooks. He does loose the red thread a couple of times, but the main ideas are still easily discernible.\\"Reflections\\" was written during Sorel's left-wing, syndicalist and ostensibly Marxist period. What immediately strikes a reader familiar with socialist texts, is that Sorel's booklet doesn't look very \\"socialist\\". There is very little of the rethoric typical of such texts, and Sorel frequently references works by non-socialist authors, including Tocqueville, Renan, Bergson and Cardinal John Henry Newman (!). It's clear that Sorel was an independent thinker, a \\"Sorelian\\" if you like.In the introduction, Sorel explains that he is a historical pessimist. He believes that pessimism is the only truly revolutionary position. Optimists become reformists, in the vain belief that society can be reformed according to their hair-brained schemes, and when they realize that this is impossible, they simply stick to it, accomplishing nothing but corruption and decadence. A pessimist, on the other hand, realizes that society is rotten to the core, and must be revolutionized en toto, at a single stroke. Sorel compares the revolutionary labor movement to ancient Christianity and 16th century Calvinism, two other pessimistic movements. The introduction also deals with Sorel's theory about myths, also mentioned in the main text of \\"Reflections\\".One of the main themes of \\"Reflections on Violence\\" is that reformism actually works, and that this is a bad thing! The bourgeoisie, its politicians and the Church have become timid, cowardly and frightened. They no longer want to fight the proletariat. The labor unions and workers' parties can easily scare this cowardly bourgeoisie into making concessions. This benefits the reformist labor leaders and politicians, who will eventually become a corrupted establishment group amongst others. Meanwhile, both the economy and society at large degenerates. The solution to this unhappy state is proletarian violence. At one point, Sorel writes that such violence should be directed in particular against \\"good\\", philanthropic employers and other upper-class do-gooders, to show them that the workers are ungrateful. Violence separates the classes, the proletariat from the bourgeoisie, and it will force the bourgeoisie to become more war-like, heroic and dynamic, something Sorel considered a good thing. Curiously, for a very heterodox Marxist, Sorel actually accepted the most \\"pro-capitalist\\" part of Marx' thinking: the idea that the capitalists are historically progressive since they develop the productive forces, make the economy more efficient, while simultaneously creating their own grave-diggers (the proletariat). Thus, the revolution simply takes over a productive apparatus perfected by capitalism. Sorel feared that a timid, decadent bourgeoisie wouldn't fulfil this historic mission, and that all of society would decline as a result. He compares this to the decline and fall of the Roman Empire. Thus, the violence of the workers actually forces the bourgeoisie into completing the task assigned for it by history, a task that will inevitably lead to its destruction. And no, I haven't misinterpreted Sorel. He actually does say all this!The revolutionary syndicalists in France called for a general strike to usher in socialism. Sorel supports the idea of the general strike, and he seems to suggest that it's a necessary corrective to the errors of traditional Marxism. Sorel admits that society haven't become polarized between two classes, something predicted in \\"The Communist Manifesto\\". What economic forces alone haven't accomplished, will be accomplished by the general strike. It will polarize society between workers and employers. Sorel also believes that workers lack a revolutionary impulse, and might be by nature conservative. Once again, the idea of the general strike is intended to cure this. Notoriously, Sorel calls the general strike a \\"myth\\". It doesn't really matter to George Sorel whether a general strike is possible or not, or perhaps only partially possible. What matters is the *idea* of a general strike, an idea that energizes and mobilizes the proletariat, turns it into a class of Homeric warriors, and spurs them on to heroic action. In passing, he even seems to admit that his concept of myth borders the religious, but doesn't seem to consider it such a bad thing. Indeed, Sorel seems fascinated by the power religion has over its adherents, Catholicism in particular. Since the myth cannot be rationally analyzed, this particular Sorelian notion has come under much criticism. What if the myth of the general strike is dropped in favour of another myth, say a nationalist one? Was this why Sorel so easily transitioned from the far left to the far right?Sorel was, if not muddleheaded, at least very contradictory. There are many unresolved tensions in \\"Reflections on Violence\\". One is the tension between Sorel's elitism and ouvrierism. On the one hand, he feels nothing but contempt for vulgar, useless people. On the other hand, he eulogizes the workers, especially the poorer ones. He seems to have regarded the working class as potential heroes, while the intellectuals, politicians and philanthropists were worthy of nothing but scorn. Another, more serious, tension is between centralization and decentralization. Sorel admires the captains of industry, large-scale factories, and the industrial revolution, at one point scornfully calling England \\"medieval\\". But Sorel also has a libertarian, decentralist streak. He opposes the Jacobins, and believes that the French Revolution simply captured the centralized state apparatus of the ancient regime. (His main source for this analysis is Tocqueville.) Sorel opposes the centralization of the labor unions, since this would make them easier pray for reformist politicians. Indeed, Sorel's ultimate aim is to abolish the State, and it does seem that he wants to accomplish this task more or less immediately after the revolution (no gradual \\"withering away\\" here). But if the state is abolished, and the labor unions are decentralized, how can production and distribution still be centralized and large-scale? This is never explained.But the most obvious tension concerns the view of violence itself. As already noted, Sorel actually opposed Jacobin terror, and hoped that the proletarian revolution would be less bloody than the bourgeois revolutions. Indeed, there is a strong streak of moralism in his text. Sorel clearly felt moral revulsion at the corruption of left-wing politicians who sold out their ideals, partisan patronage in the civil services, the use of police spies even by a \\"liberal\\" government, etc. He also believes that the task of the proletariat is to create a new, higher morality (which sounds like an idealized version of old, conservative morality). So where does violence fit in all this? Sorel tried to distinguish between two kinds of violence, the one heroic and Homeric, the other brutal and decadent. The former kind of violence, in combination with myths, gives the proletariat a sense of the sublime, and saves civilization. The second kind of violence is simply destructive. A century after the publication of \\"Reflections on Violence\\", it's easy to see the problem: \\"heroic\\" violence for a \\"sublime\\" \\"myth\\" very easily becomes brutality, terror and oppression."},{"Title":"Reflections on Violence","review":"Sorel's most famous work is an interesting conflation of Marxism and XIXth century Romanticism. Like most socialist literature it idealizes the \\"worker\\" as an heroic figure standing astride history.The book advocates syndicalism (a system in which industrial workers' unions are the vehicles of political power), but it eschews the pseudoscientific rhetoric favored by Marx and Lenin. Sorel is not particularly strong on economics, and he knows it.What he does know is cultural history and he advocates political rebellion through violence and mythmaking. The book is essentially a broadside against Jaures and the calculative, creeping parliamentary socialism of fin de siecle France. He finds Jaures and his methods to be too meek and compromising. He characterizes parliamentarism (accurately) as a system of endless debate, dealmaking and \\"selling out\\". Sorel advocates revolutionary violence as a means to both power and the creation of a new mythic order. He correctly observes that the Jacobins were violent and bloody, yet they managed to create a mythology for the French Revolution which still held a strong cultural resonance in his day.Direct action, mythmaking and ruthless bloodshed were the means Sorel recommended for revolution. His ideas went largely unacted upon in France, but the anarchosyndicalists of Spain took him quite seriously.His greatest disciple however, was a young socialist named Benito Mussolini. Mussolini's Fascist movement was based upon direct action and inspired by a myth of a resurgent Roman Empire. Mussolini made explicit reference, again and again, to the importance of myth in revolutionary struggle.Sorel inadvertently became the prophet of revolutionary Fascism.Two asides: (a) there is no reason for corporate executives to keep this book by their bedsides - it contains nothing of economic value, and its ideology is thoroughly exhausted and devoid of contemporary relevance; (b) Sorel is one of the few French intellectuals besides Tocqueville who seemed to have a healthy respect for America and the American economic miracle."},{"Title":"Reflections on Violence","review":"I think I made it through a couple pages before I stopped caring. Dont take a class with this book in it. Leave that for the kids who come to school in skinny jeans, with a spotty beard, shaggy hair, and a longboard."},{"Title":"Reflections on Violence","review":"No World Wars had happened when Sorel wrote this book; no death camps, no Predator drones. In this context, his comments on violence are naieve. But his sense of the role of intellectuals in history is brilliant - being, primarily, that the cycles of social change are only marginally touched by them. His concept of mythos bridges the gap between Jungian archetypes and action in the world."},{"Title":"Reflections on Violence","review":"This book, should be studies in conjunction with books on violence. It illuminates that despite today's pacifity within the labour movement, circumstances (as exist in these modern times), justify resorting to 'activism'. A reading of Sorel's expose of the machinations of Socialists, the Middle Classes, et al clearly show that in these years of 'Neo-Liberalist' ideology and the guises of Capitalism under the new cloak of 'Globalisation' ..... nothing has changed for the great swaith of working poor, dumbing down or buying off Trade Unions etc etc.This book should be required reading of anyone who aspires to a pro-active approach to conditions surrounding work and Labour.It would be useful for corporate executives and polticians to keep this book permanently by their bedsides."},{"Title":"Reflections on Violence","review":"This a book that influenced both communism and fascism. Although it was written from the perspective of the political left, its most enthusiastic reader was probably Benito Mussolini. It shows the compatibility of certain aspects of communism and fascism. It is surprising that it is not widely studied in courses on fascism. For more books on totalitarianism I have created a Listmania list.The book itself is not easy to read. It, however, is important to read this in order to get an understanding on underlying philosophical forces that produced modern totalitarianism."},{"Title":"Reflections on Violence","review":"An excellent exposition of revolutionary syndicalist thought, quite in contradiction to statist Marxism, and infused with the spirit of the labor movement. Long before Michael Foucault, Georges Sorel pointed out that ethics are determined by the ruling class.Those who are squeamish about Sorel's unabashed enthusiasm for class violence will remember that all societies have been ushered in with violence. The present capitalist society was created in bloody revolutions that saw the rebelling bourgeoisie cutting off the heads of their fuedal masters left right and center! America is founded on revolution. France is founded on revolution. Britain is founded on (limited) revolution.In class terms, Sorel argues, might makes right.

Upon visiting this wonderous city for a business trip years ago, I was fasinated and intriquied by the dreamlike quality this city exists in. A strange mixture of past and present, of mixed cultures and traditions and the feeling that ghosts are at every corner. I found Lyle Saxon's book at our local library by accident, the version published in 1928. The first chapter had me glued to a book for the first time in years. Reading about his own adventures in New Orleans, abet generations before my time, brought a familiar sense that has stayed with me since that first visit. it may be difficult to read this book and visualize if you haven't been, and if you have been, it's like remembering a beautiful dream or a part of your childhood you had forgotten.

Cheers!"},{"Title":"Four Plays: The Bald Soprano, The Lesson, Jack or the Submission, The Chairs","review":"I am directing the Bald Soprano soon. One of my major battles has been this: How do I translate Ionesco's ideas to my audience. Ionesco did not write his seemingly meaningless text to be a funny piece of sensless fluff. Ionesco saw in his work a profound meaning with deep implications. He shows us six people, whose interactions with each other are completely absurd and meaningless. The characters speak to each other in endless non-sequinters and cliches. They cannot communicate with one another. Their inablity to communicate unltimatally leads to conflict and the end, not only of the play, but of the lives of these characters (made alive only as long as the play lasts) the audience laughs at this. They look at these characters on the stage and think, &quot;What aweful people they are.&quot; What they don't realize is that they are laughing at themselves. It is infact they who scurry about the earth speaking to one another with meaningless words, and in cliches. They are trapped in a world of political correctness, and useless sayings. They don't communicate, but say only what they are expected to say. They fight about things that have no eternal significance, and they fight until it is impossible for either side to win. The Bald Soprano shows us ourselves. The tragedy of the Bald Soprano is that we laugh at it, because we except that our relationships and indeed our existance is laughable. The tragedy is that we don't even know that we are laughing at ourselves, because we are blind to our own faults. WE don't allow ourselves to see that we are talking without speaking, and fighting without winning. The difficulty to the director is: How do we make the audience see Ionesco's point. If we made it completely obvious, than it would lose it's comic value, for who could laugh if they knew how desperate their circumstance was. And if they don't laugh, than the play loses it's tragedy. It would be simple if Ionesco had given us some text at the end to wrap it up, and tell the audience the meaning. But Ionesco didn't see the need to. To him, it was not possible for humanity to change. Even if he had made the audience understand that the characters were showing them themselves, they would not have been willing to change. To IOnesco, the world was headed on a downward spiral, so we night as well laugh about it, even if it is at our own expense."},{"Title":"Four Plays: The Bald Soprano, The Lesson, Jack or the Submission, The Chairs","review":"These four one-act plays of bleak absurdity and startling originality place Ionesco alongside Beckett and Pinter as one of twentieth century theater's most enigmatic iconoclasts.\\"The Bald Soprano\\" begins as a seemingly placid comedy on proper English manners, but then weird things happen -- irregular clock chimes, contradictions with no logical basis, non-sequiturs -- which build to a crescendo of chaos like a dissonant string quartet. Corrupting every convention of traditional drama, defying every expectation of the audience, it is exactly the \\"anti-play\\" its subtitle suggests.In \\"The Lesson,\\" an aging professor's excessive zeal for a particular subject, made incomprehensibly esoteric by his own obsessive study of it, is the downfall of many a hapless student.\\"Jack\\" is the age-old story of a boy who disappoints his family by not wanting to marry the girl they have selected for him, but, like a surrealist painting, the proceedings are rendered grotesque by nonsensical lines and colors. As though to accentuate the banality of the underlying plot, the actors go to dramatic extremes as if they were acting out a \\"real\\" drama.But I feel that the most engaging of the four plays is \\"The Chairs,\\" in which two actors not only must play a nonagenarian couple hosting a roomful of people who have assembled for a lecture, but must pantomime the presence of the (invisible) guests. The bitterly ironic (and very funny) \\"lecture\\" given at the end affirms MacBeth's notion that life truly is a tale told by an idiot.I think these plays are more about form than content, as Ionesco is experimenting with visual and verbal imagery and challenging the audience's sense of comfort with the theater, intending to evoke unusual and unpleasant emotions like awkwardness or embarrassment. To get the most out of reading the plays, it is best not to read them as literature but to visualize them being performed, paying close attention to every detail in the stage directions and the instructed mannerisms of the characters."},{"Title":"Four Plays: The Bald Soprano, The Lesson, Jack or the Submission, The Chairs","review":"I sort of grew up with Ionesco. This crazy Romanian turned Frenchman with his absurd stage plays, the Bald Soprano and stuff like that, was synonym for art trash in yahoo speak. He wrote like abstract painters painted. Good honest citizens detested that kind of stuff and complained when theatres and museums who were subsidized by public funds played or diplayed it. Ionesco was the equivalent of Picasso in my home town red neck cultural perspective. (Please note that I am German, not Kentuckian.Apologies to Kentucky, should I have said Oklahoma? Anyway, German backwoods are no different.)Then I take a big leap with the time machine. No encounters with Ionesco since maybe the 60s. Plenty with Picasso though, who became one of my heroes (and one of my favorite writers, P. O'Brian, wrote a good biography, which I reviewed here, but I pulled the review out since nobody was interested).And now my daughter, who is doing her IB with drama as elective subject, chose The Lesson for her graduation stage production. I read it first and told her she is crazy. Nobody can play this mad professor who kills his private students after endless absurd monologues on philology (which leads to calamity, as the maid says). As any self-respecting 18 year old would, she ignored my ignorant advice and did it anyway. She found a fantastic actress to do the mad old professor, a 16 year old American Chinese girl who must have been born for this part. And perfect fits for the pupil and the maid as well.I have not had so much fun in a theatre for a long time. Hail to old Ionesco! And kudos to the producer and director of the play on this day!"},{"Title":"Four Plays: The Bald Soprano, The Lesson, Jack or the Submission, The Chairs","review":"This book, being one of Ionesco's greatest, is without a doubt the epitome of the Theatre of the Absurd. I read this in a college french class of mine a few years ago and loved it. One warning for those who are unaccustomed to the tenets of this genre: this book does not make sense to the normal mind! nor does it intend to. The lesson this book teaches us is about the extent to which we take our language, and the reality behind it. Ionesco shows us, with alarming ease, that our language as we know it is useless, and ends up leading us in nothing but circles. Futility is a very crucial theme for this type of literature, and it is expressed by Ionesco wonderfully. If you'd like to try something with &quot;a little more to it&quot; , so to speak, Jean-Paul Sartre is a good place to start. Enjoy this book, this genre, and the lessons they provide."},{"Title":"Four Plays: The Bald Soprano, The Lesson, Jack or the Submission, The Chairs","review":"I've seen The Bald Soprano and The Chairs performed, and it has been on my list for quite a while to read them both.

Ionesco and his feel for the absurdities in language is always charming, but the Chairs combines that sense of fun and the absurd with some very real pathos.I was not familiar with Jack, and was glad to have a chance to read it.

Absolutely brilliant - do yourself a favor and pick up this book."},{"Title":"Four Plays: The Bald Soprano, The Lesson, Jack or the Submission, The Chairs","review":"These four plays of Ionesco, among the very first that he wrote, already show him preoccupied with themes that will concern him for the rest of his career in theatre: the futility of language, the terror of ideological conformity, and theorizing about the play within the framework of the play itself. This volume includes \\"The Bald Soprano,\\" \\"The Lesson,\\" \\"Jack; Or, The Submission,\\" and \\"The Chairs.\\" Needless to say, giving a summary, insofar as one could eve be adduced, would go against the spirit of absurdism generally speaking. After all, the plots are not the most interesting things in the plays.Ionesco got the idea for \\"The Bald Soprano\\" while trying to learn Assimil method. His textbook had two characters, Mr. and Mrs. Smith (who also appear in his play), and who, despite being married to one another, feel compelled to describe one another's physical appearance, tell one another that they are both English as if all of this was genuinely new information. Mr. and Mrs. are the epitome of the English bourgeois, speaking in stock phrases and clich&eacute;s (How curious it is, how curious it is, how bizarre, and what a coincidence!\\") so worn with use as to be devoid of any meaning. The dialogue between the characters provides a discursiveness with which he points to the emptiness and futility of language, the hopelessness of communication.Ionesco describes \\"The Lesson\\" as a \\"comic drama,\\" though I found difficulty founding anything comic in it. In this play, he takes on the subject of authoritarianism as a professor of philology (which \\"always turns into calamity,\\" according to his maid) relentlessly and unmercifully lectures a female student. When she proves unable to understand much of the material, he grows increasingly violent, with the student ending up dead. At the very end of the play, we learn that she is the professor's fortieth victim. And another one is walking in the door. So much for the victory of Reason.Unlike the work of other absurdists, Beckett for example, Ionesco's plays are ostentatious, full of lively dialogue, and never inward-looking or contemplative, although many of Ionesco's themes are also Beckett's. The narrativity of drama, or the lack thereof, or even the possibility thereof, is a subject of both of their work.At least for me, these plays are fun, but only in small doses. The constant litany of illogical non sequiturs and trying to keep track of all the characters that have similar names can become a little taxing and grating if the exposure goes on for too long. Nevertheless, these plays have aged remarkably well, and they remain one of the best introductions to the Theatre of the Absurd for the uninitiated."},{"Title":"Four Plays: The Bald Soprano, The Lesson, Jack or the Submission, The Chairs","review":"I have to admit the first time I read this in its original french I was irritated.

The first is the outward, ridiculous humor-the humor from the spontaneity of the characters and there seemingly nonsensical actions. The second humor is a deeper one that can be found by examining the phrases Ionesco uses. They seem to be random and pure nonsense, but they actually seem to come from a method of learning English. When taken out of context they can be put together in very funny ways.

It was one of the best experiences I've had with literature in a long time. The wonderful thing about Ionesco is that it works on two levels. It can be interpreted as a serious, absurdist work about the meaninglessness of conversation and much of human existence. Or, if you want, it can be read as a hilariously funny piece of absurdist theatre with plenty of quotable lines to drop into any conversation. (Favorites for this include the Fire Chief's &quot;fables&quot; and the final scene. Go nuts.)I would recommend, though, that you read this in French if possible.

The most rewarding experience I had was letting a junior/senior cast loose with a script of The Bald Soprano. They had a ball and so did I. It was entirely liberating. They took it where they wanted to, which is Ionesco's point I think. Ionesco embodies this freedom. His scripts are not roadmaps, pointing to what an actor should think or feel. It is not as if he is providing a &quot;fill in the blanks&quot; master plan. The director and the actors are free to provide their own interpretation. Freedom of expression is boundless.

At that point in time, I gobbled up anything with the mention of the word in the title, and in a small bookshop to my misfortune, this was it. I had quite a strong reaction to this book - and not a very positive one at that - and now I bet you are wondering what the heck it is about it that caused me to feel this way. I can sum it up in one word: hypocrisy. This is simply the most hypocritical \\"Wiccan\\" book I have ever discovered.The book opens with an incredibly fluffy and feel-good description of Wicca in its introduction: \\"Wicca is respecting and living in harmony with all living things. Wicca is light. Wicca is love\\" (ix). Chapter One, entitled \\"Gerina's Grimoire,\\" begins directly with the Wiccan Rede in italics, and she follows by explaining its implications,\\"It is imperative to bear in mind the Wiccan Rede before performing any magickal spells or rituals, especially those which may be considered unethical or of a manipulative nature. [. . .] If you deliberately harm or manipulate another person through black magic or any form of evil, you will pay for it by having the evil returned to you threefold\\" (1-2). Perhaps Ms. Dunwich should take her own advice since she apparently believes it is wrong to violate the free will of another, yet has no problems blatantly supplying spells that do just that.This type of spellwork that Gerina has previously denounced is especially present in the section devoted to love magic. For example, one spell begins, \\"to gain the affections of [. . .]\\" (15). Another spell intended to make a love secure requires a lock of hair or fingernails of one's spouse or lover (10), and one to reunite parted lovers instructs,\\"write his or her initials next to yours and then draw three circles of blood around both initials\\" (17). All of these spells aim to coerce another human being, the \\"object of your affections,\\" into loving or being sexually attracted to you against their will (13). One spell even calls for the blood of a white dove, and Gerina follows this with a caveat suggesting that in order to gain this ingredient one should,\\"find a dove that is already dead. Never kill a live dove! [. . .] Most Wiccans and modern day Pagans agree that the deliberate taking of life in unnecessary and [. . .] is in violation of the Wiccan Rede\\" (14). I live in a forested area, and have all my life, and I can say that I've never come across a dead dove. I wonder how some young person interested in completing this spell intends on obtaining dove's blood - I can just imagine some fourteen year old going to their local petshop and asking if any of their white doves have passed to the Summerlands recently and then requesting if they can \\"borrow\\" the feathered corpse. But I digress....The next section that clearly provides spells that do not respect other living things are \\"spells to deal with an enemy.\\" Yet again, Gerina states that black magic violates the Wiccan Rede and stresses that despite one's anger at another, one should \\"never resort to the use of black magick or sorcery\\" (32). Amazingly, the next few pages contain spells that require the use of photographs, names, and birthdates of enemies which are all used to bind them (31-4). Overall, the book presents this statement to the reader: Never, ever resort to black or manipulative magick because it's evil and violates the Rede, but here are all the spells you need to do so anyway!There are Witches and Wiccans (not necessarily the same thing, mind you) who fall under all shades of the spectrum in regard to hexing, binding, and all other forms of magic that may interfere with another's free will. But even those who have absolutely no qualms about using magic in the defense of themselves and their loved ones, in other words, those who are willing to use magic as an assertive means of protection in extreme and grave situations, would not resort to doing so to curb something as petty as a gossiping neighbor! Admittingly, gossip is an annoyance that can have an effect on one's reputation and can cause much social discomfort, but if one is immature enough to feel that they must resort to magic to bind their gossiping peers, I don't believe he or she is mature enough to perform magic at all. And yet, The Wicca Spellbook provides such a spell, as well as similarly petty and/or impractical ones including how to break a curse placed upon you by a sorcerer (can we say paranoia?), and how to force someone you dislike to move away. It contains nothing to handle a situation that may actually warrant something like a binding or hexing, and nothing to deal with a serious threat to someone's life.Gerina went through all the trouble to stress the evils of manipulative magic and seemed careful to document the consequences of violating the Rede (all in classic fluffy-bunny, white-light style) and then proceeds to contradict her own warnings with blatantly manipulative magic. To make matters worse, when she did insist upon breaking with her own philosophy of \\"harm none\\" as stated earlier in the book, she did so for some really stupid reasons!I suppose this book got on my nerves because it identified itself specifically as a \\"Wiccan\\" spellbook, which implies that it is intended for those who follow Wicca. Obviously, not every person or group that engages in magical practice is Wiccan or follows the Rede so if this spellbook had not indentified itself as such, it probably would not have affected me in such a negative way. As stated earlier, not even all Wiccans/Witches concur on the interpretation of the Rede and how far it should be taken. However, Ms.Dunwich made such a big deal throghout the book about following it and not participating in any form of negative magic - and so there is no excuse for such an arrant discrepancy between what she apparently believes and what she does."},{"Title":"The Wicca Spellbook: A Witch's Collection of Wiccan Spells, Potions, and Recipes","review":"I am a Witch and I would recommend this fine book to all Witches of the world.

I found it to be very informative and it answered many of my questions, giving a detailed definition of Wicca, factual explanation of karma, many useful spells, rituals and sabbat ceremonies, and a glossary of many of the &quot;tools&quot; needed to practice such an involved religion. She also included a listing of shops and mail-order catalogs for places to find anything and everything the modern Wiccan could ever need! A very informative book for anyone, from the apprentice with a thirst for knowledge, to the seasoned witch simply wanting to add to his/her grimore."},{"Title":"The Wicca Spellbook: A Witch's Collection of Wiccan Spells, Potions, and Recipes","review":"As many reader's have said this book is definitely not for beginners. Even though I had gotten my copy when I was starting out, I never used any of the spells. There just were some things in the book that didn't sit well w/me, for example the way some spells didn't comply w/the Wiccan Rede of \\"harm none\\" and that the inverted pentacle was sometimes used for a higher degree witch. I do like the recipes and the \\"folksy\\" feel of the book. Unfortunately the examples given above made me leery of Ms. Dunwich for a while, but her other books have not disappointed me, so give her another chance! As for the reader that said this is dripping w/evil, witchcraft is about darkness and light, this book isn't as \\"light\\" as some and that's what makes it different. The author doesn't \\"fluff\\" it up."},{"Title":"The Wicca Spellbook: A Witch's Collection of Wiccan Spells, Potions, and Recipes","review":"I noticed alot of belly-aching reviewers posted as \\"A Reader\\".I think it's just sour grapes on their part.Why not post with at least a 'Magickal Name'?This book is geared for the 13-23 year old wiccan practioneers.This book had many solid tibbits of information on spell-work,wiccan recipes, and pagan-potions.It was a quick and enjoyable reading,only 180 pages.This book helps the curious novice arouse an interest in the calling of Wicca.This is not Aleister O'Crowley's realm of divinity or his area of fluffy interest.One can read this in an afternoon's time.I would have to recommend reading this first,before you read 5,000 more sophicated spells.A wonderful primer for new spell-casters."},{"Title":"The Wicca Spellbook: A Witch's Collection of Wiccan Spells, Potions, and Recipes","review":"If you're just starting to learn about wicca, don't delve into this book. I don't agree with the title: &quot;The Wicca Spellbook&quot;. &quot;Wicca&quot; shouldn't even be in it. Wicca does not condone love spells like the one Gerina Dunwich suggests (the Aphrodite one), as it manipulates another person's free will. Also, a lot of herbs, such as Lucky Hand root, are hard to find. Please, read some material on the ethics of magick before reading this one."},{"Title":"The Wicca Spellbook: A Witch's Collection of Wiccan Spells, Potions, and Recipes","review":"This book contains spells for almost any occasion.

This was the first book i seriously read on wicca (i have always been interested in the occult since childhood, but im talking about when i discovered Wicca as a religion) but i definately dont recomend it for the beginner. I say this because it has virtually nothing on the religious side of the Craft,HOWEVER it is a great reference for finding the properties of herbs, gems, amulets etc., and has some quite good spells for everything from impotence to winning a court case.

I changed it a bit to suit my needs, since I don't believe in making someone love you. I have also used the love mojo bag, in which I have found it brings dreams to you also..if you put it under your pillow before you go to sleep.

Also, it does give the Wiccan Rede but obviously she doesn't follow it as there are spells that go against the Wiccan Rede. There are spells that go against the free will of others. For that, I would suggest to look elsewhere because this isn't a book to be trusted, and as far as a spellbook goes, there is much lacking.

Mojo magic, for instance, is something you're just not gonna see in most Wicca spellbooks. I enjoyed Ms. Dunwich's &quot;Exploring Spellcraft&quot; a bit more because of the wonderful stuff on Bast-Wicca especially the beautiful descriptions of the kittening ceremony (as a cat lover, I couldn't read some of Your Magickal Cat because of all the horrid things that cruel ignorant humans have done to beautiful felines in the past). The counterpart here is the Wiccaning ceremony for babies. As someone with little interest in children and loves Wicca partially for its emphasis on the maiden and crone, NOT JUST the mother (unlike almost every other aspect of society and spirituality which only respects women as breeders)I really didn't think there needed to be EIGHT PAGES of this, but I know I have a minority opinion here, so there's no need for me to launch into my environmentalist's overpopulation speech.

What would you say? How would you act after 15 years? This is the dilemma facing Billy Dixon and Lenore Foxwood college sweethearts who, after realizing their professional dreams and enduring some personal nightmares, are thrown together. Another college friend dies and leaves them each other as a provision of his will. Lenore, a college professor, stands to inherit $1 million for a scholarship fund if she can spend a week with her first love, the man who broke her heart and changed her life. Billy is now a successful songwriter, singer and producer who sees Lenore as something more than the &quot;one who got away.&quot; Fifteen years and thousands of miles hasn't done anything to diminish their attraction or to break down the walls Lenore has erected. Felicia Mason's novel takes what could be a very contrived premise and injects humor, style, emotion and even a few surprises."},{"Title":"Rhapsody (Arabesque)","review":"Billy Dixon, aka Buster D, a great musician, was still able to make Lenore's heart sing after years of separation. But how could Lenore's heart forget Billy, when there would always be a reminder of him in their son, J.D. &quot;Rhapsody&quot; was about the love of two people that through earlier misunderstanding had tried to bury their true feelings for each other. However, Billy could never forget Lenore Foxwood. He had dreams about her. Lenore was his music. She was the reason for his music. He lived and breath Lenore in his music. &quot;Rhapsody&quot; was about their unsung and unfilled love. When Billy and Lenore finally reunite and let their emotions surface, the love that flows is like sweet music and eventually overshadows all obstacles that are still in their path and must be moved away. With Lenore's help, Billy's secret about his music is revealed, but does not ruin his career. Instead, because of Lenore, Billy's musical talents are heightened and indeed, there is a 'Rhapsody for Lenore'."},{"Title":"Rhapsody (Arabesque)","review":"Rhapsody is wonderful. Felicia makes you ponder &quot;just where did she come up with this story&quot;? They are too realistic. I am a loyal and faithful Felicia Mason fan for LIFE. She continues to EXCEED EXPECTATIONS. After reading Felicia, NO other writer makes the cut. Just read the book!!!!"},{"Title":"Rhapsody (Arabesque)","review":"I can appreciate a good writer, even when they do not produce their best work. I am a Felicia Munson fan, but not a fan of this book. It has an unbelievable premise, and the language is very cliche. To be fair, there are some nice moments and a few spots of interesting imagery, but it depends on a lot of description that could have been lifted from any romance novel, and the dialog is wooden. I recommend the author but not the book."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I am of Polish Catholic decent, and had relatives at Buchenwald. They would never speak of it, and now that are gone. This book made me see the reality of what my relatives went through, and why they could not speak of it.

It's about the level of man's inhumanity to man, and the need for each of us to \\"be our brother's keeper.\\" It reminded me that the evil spirit behind the Holocaust lives on...We have seen it in Rwanda, in Darfour, and in so many other places. It is so easy to get caught up in our own lives and world, and ignore what is happening to others, but this book challenged me to open my eyes, ears and mouth for the sake of humanity, everywhere."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I have always admired Mr. Wiesel's work and this first book of his gives so much insight into his life's work. There is so much here that is just almost too frightening to imagine. I have toured the Holocaust Museum in Washington, D.C., and, with this books and others I have read, still find it so difficult to understand how people could commit such cruel acts against other people. It is a book that is sad and inspiring; frightening and hopeful. This should never, never, never, happen again in any form and it has happened again in many forms all over the world. We must continue to read, and study this and other tragedies so that we will make the inhumane activities of man will stop!"},{"Title":"Night","review":"This most harrowing account of the circumstances leading to his imprisonment, the loss of his family, and his own precarious existence housed in several Nazi death camps is a vivid reminder that this barbarism occured in our lifetime. \\"Night\\" should be required reading in every home and school. I fear similar horrors could occur even here in our so-called free country. We are all aware that religious intolerance, racial prejudice, and persecution and denial of basic rights toward gays and lesbians is sadly commonplace behavior. I am appalled most of the time that we cannot live in peace and harmony. Whatever happened to \\"Do unto others as ye would have them do unto you\\", and can we please remind ourselves to live by that rule?"},{"Title":"Night","review":"This short novel or novela can be read in one sitting. The newer translation has print three times the size of the original translation and for that reason alone I recommend it. The translation is excellent. This is a good story about one teenage boy's experience in the concentration camps. I gave it five stars, because it was fleshed out enough for a long short story or a novela. Yet had the characters been more developed this would have made a first rate novel. I have read more well written fiction and nonfiction about this experience. Still it was gripping and a fast read. It is important to note that the author received the Nobel prize for Peace and not for literature. There is a reason for that."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Horrifingly great book. Had to keep reminding myself it was all real. I can't even imagine the terror all those people went through. Don't read it before falling asleep."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This book shows the harsh realities of what happened to most of the people involved in the holocaust. From the creation of the first ghettos to the jews being liberated this book gives first hand knowledge and accounts about how the experiences really were. This book has impacted my views on the holocaust and I believe that if you want to learn more about the holocaust and get a first hand experience you should read this book."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I purchased this book after Oprah made it a book club newcomer. I was amazed that so many people had read it in High School and/or college. It is a must read! It is a remarkable life story of trying to survive in the most unimaginable situation. I commend Mr. Wiesel for telling a truthful story that makes everyone look at the evils of the world."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This book is a must read for all people of all ages.

Night is a haunting tale of survival and the sad reality of how the Jewish community was treated. If you're thinking about reading this book I suggest that you do."},{"Title":"Night","review":"On rare occasion I feel pulled to read a book twice. For me, to read a book once I feel satisfied. The first time I read Night it was 1994. I was in the 7th grade and had just finished reading Anne Frank. My curiousity about the Holocuast was insatiable. While I read Night that first time I cried through most it. I read it again during a Holocaust lecture series that I worked on in college. And read it again a year or so after I graduated. The two other books that I could read over and over are The Giver and The Alchemist."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Small book that packs a powerful message: Humans are the cruelest creatures on the planet. I want to thank the author for writing this book."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Even though this book was originaly published many, many years ago; this revised version is still a very compelling read. It brings the truth and horror of the Holocast down to a level accessible and identifiable to people who were not in the Army in Germany at the end of WWII and witness the liberation of the Death Camps first hand or who themselves were not the lucky survivors of the Death Camps. This book lets the reader get a feel for what went on there, the pain, the anguish, the daily terror and the occassional heroic manvuorers by a caring few who dared to be brave enough to risk being killed themselved to save anyone they could. If anyone has any doubts that these events took place (i.e. the President of Iran) this should be required reading."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This book broke my heart, made me angry, and then saddened me to tears. What Mr. Wiesel, and other Jews endured at the hands of pure evil is astonishing, and revolting.This book was difficult to read, but not because the writing was hard to understand, rather it is the subject of the book that is difficult to read about. Were this a work of fiction, one could easily breeze through it, but that it is not fiction, but the retelling of an actual event in history makes it unbearable, yet all the more important to read. So that we will never, ever forget."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Mr. Wiesel provides details written with such clarity that I was cringing as I read this book. The most poignant point is how could have this been allowed to continue then, and then we see Darfur today and its easy to realize that our leadership often takes a 'no see no do' outlook on world events."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Night, by Elie Wiesel, is maybe the best piece of writing I've ever read, and it's definitely the most powerful. In 117 pages, he shares his personal story, a survival (if you can call it that) of a Nazi made ghetto, cattle cars, Birkenau, SS, Auschwitz, Gleiwitz, Buchenwald, and much, much more. Surrounded by death and hardship, he finds himself and looses his faith and looses himself and finds a different kind of faith and learns about guilt and victory and survival and defeat all in the shadow of a god who forgot him.Night is depressing but inspiring. It's well written. It's an amazing read, and one anybody wanting to write well should read. Those who don't care about the art of good writing, well, they should read it too."},{"Title":"Night","review":"\\"Night\\" is a gift to humanity. The haunting story is told in such a way that the most evil time in history can be understood. Elie Wiesel opens his heart and the result is a treasured piece of literature. Amazing."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Some encounters in this book really shocked me as to what went on with the war with Germany. The book gives great detail from time of moving into the ghetto's and to the rescue of all the jews in the camps. If you want details I recommend this book because it gives it all in this author's real life experience."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This book is very intense and heart wrenching.

She'd been begging me to read it as well. When I was reading it I could hardly wait to turn to the next page. It was absolutely heart-wrenching to &#34;see&#34; what this young man and his father went through at the horrific concentration camps. It allowed the reader to experience them first hand through his eyes. I would highly recommend this book to people from teen years and up. It's an eye opening experience.

My daugter's class read it in 8th grade and all students whould be required to do so."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This book is a real look at life as Elie lived it as at the hands of the Nazi rulers. You get the feeling of what life was like as a teenager being thrown into a dark world and put into a concentration camp. Beatings, hunger, seeing death around you, watching his father get beatten and then watch his death, working endless days just because he was a Jew. I do admire this man \\"Elie Wiesel\\",for letting us look into his painful past.My grandparents talked about their families being sent to concentration camps and talked about very few members of the family making out alive. No one wanted to share details with me as a child and now I am finding out more details from books like \\"Night\\".Never Again...I pray history will not repeat itself!"},{"Title":"Night","review":"I bought this book at the end of my freshman year for my summer assignment, and I'm definitely glad that I had this assignment.

I received the book in excellent condition, and it still is in excellent condition (I'm now a college freshman, so it's been a while [:) Anyways, I would recommend this book to my family and friends, especially if they want to learn more about the Holocaust."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This book was recommended by George Otis Jr of the Sentinal group and shows the absolute resolve of the Jewish people. An inside view of the conditions not only physical but emotional and the dismanteling of the human spirit by Hitler. And yet, they prevailed and he failed.The thought that this part of our history could be removed or ignored by \\"revisionist\\" history is not to be tolerated. This small book will open the eyes of the world to the necessity of praying for the nation of Israel as the same evil is brewing against them once again."},{"Title":"Night","review":"WOW! This is an AMAZING book! This was a required read for my methods of teaching social studies class for college, but I know many individuals who read this during their social studies curriculum in middle school. Everyone who I've discussed this book with has absolutely loved it. Elie Wiesel does a fantastic job of putting such horrific events in perspective and leaves readers feeling like they were with him in the camps. I definitely recommend this book for everyone middle school aged and older!"},{"Title":"Night","review":"This is a disturbingly honest portrayal of a Nazi concentration camp during World War II written in a young captive's own words."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This book is not long and it is well worth the read.

Now that I have, it hit me the same way it did 11 years ago. It's sad, but so strong in wanting the ready to understand. It made me thankful and at the same time more merciful. This will always be a favorite of mine."},{"Title":"Night","review":"My wife is an English teacher for the local high school and this is required reading this year. I wasn't impressed with the introduction, but continued anyway. Kind of glad I did. It was a journal that was kept by the author as he made his way through the concentration camps as he grew up. It was moving at times and never did my interest sway. Nice quick read."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Like all of Oprah's Book Club books, this one is a must read. It is a very terrible story of a very terrible event in our history, however, it is a story of hope. If a young boy can surrvive that, I wonder how much I am truely capable of. The book was very well written and translated. Elie Wiesel really turned one horrible event of his life into pure art."},{"Title":"Night","review":"My daughter brought this book home from school because she had to do an essay about the Holocust. She asked me for some guidance, but I told her that had never heard of the book, but I would try to help her. At first I just glanced at a few pages to get an idea about what the book was about, and the next thing I knew I had read the whole book. This is a book that should be required to be read by all students. I think it will open there eyes to what it is like to be hated just because you are considered different."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Night is the most sincere book I've ever read. Wiesel has a way of captivating the reader. I read it years ago and I'm glad to have read it again."},{"Title":"Night","review":"probably the shortest, and yet the single most moving and effective attempt to communicate the incommunicable abomination that was the Holocaust.I first read this book in high school, then reread it again 20 years later to find that it still resonated deeply in a way that very few books that I enjoyed at such a young age still do.It is unsparing and merciless in plunging us into that world, yet never becomes mired in bathos, pathos, hatred, self-pity or self-righteousness. There is something beautifully and painfully REAL in these 144 pages that no Hollywood film can ever hope to capture.Should be required reading in all high schools."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I recommend this book because of its powerful images of a young Jewish boy during the end of World War II. Ellie is faced with many questions of how the tragic events of the war could happen. The moving story of his struggles afterward, gave me a greater understanding of humanity."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Night is perhaps the most powerful book I've ever read. That this could be a true story is a reality that stuns. The cruelty so vividly portrayed in this book is beyond belief yet \\"Night\\" is a great teaching because upon reading it, one must believe what we are capable of doing to each other. Wiesel suffered and rose to tell the tell. Now we should make the effort to hear his words and learn"},{"Title":"Night","review":"It was overpriced and contained no extra material like the physical book. It was a ripoff and I do not recommend the ebook copy."},{"Title":"Night","review":"It is extremely rare for me to get chocked up, even rarer for me to cry (except when I hear the song, \\"I will remember you,\\" in conjuncture with that animal suffering commercial that requires the channel to be immediately changed); the final pages of Elie Wiesel's memoir, \\"Night,\\" provoked several tears from me this evening. But if the Big Lebowski has taught us anything, and it most certainly has, it is that \\"strong men also cry.\\"\\"Night\\" is story of Elie Wiesel's experience in Auschwitz concentration camp. The book narrates Wiesel's and his family's abduction from their home in Sighet, Transylvania to Auschwitz and then eventually to Buchenwald. In great solemnity the reader trudges along as Wiesel helps us to penetrate the walls of one of Hitler's strongholds of human suffering. The crematoria wherein numberless Jews were sent to the heavens as billows of ashy clouds become more than historical facts, they become symbols of what the human soul can become under the aegis of despotism, symbols of hate and malice.We learn how easy it is to become numb to suffering, and how difficult it is to remain religious during times of supreme neglect. Wiesel remembers hearing previously pious men lamenting God's absence, \\"For God's sake, where is God?\\" On another occasion another says, \\"I have more faith in Hitler than in anyone else. He alone has kept his promises, all his promises, to the Jewish people.\\" Anyone who would dare criticize these mens' waning faith in God must be among the more ignorant. How simple it is for us to believe in deity when our children, parents, brothers, and sisters are safe from starvation, and the constant threat of death by human ovens!At Elie Wiesel's acceptance speech of the Nobel Peace Prize he says:\\"I explain to him (his son) how nave we were, that the workd did know and remained silent. And tha is why I swore never to be silent whenever and wherever human beings endure suffering and humiliation. We must take sides. Neutrality helps the oppressor, never the victim. Silence encourages the tormentor, never the tormented. Sometimes we must interfere. When human lives are endangered, when human dignity is in jeopardy, national borders and sensitivities become irrelevant. Wherever men and women are persecuted because of their race, religion, or political views, that place must - at that moment - become the center of the universe.\\"If you, like I, frequently arrive late to intellectual endeavors and have yet to read this work, avail yourself of the opportunity and experience this book. It takes no more than 4 hours. If you can read, you must read \\"Night\\" by Elie Wiesel."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This personal account of the holocaust by Elie Wiesel's book is a horrifying story of the Nazi death camps. The author tells the story in a simple manner, yet it is easy for a reader to end up feeling haunted by the accounts in NIGHT. It stirs sadness and profound questions in the bosom of a reader. The lessons from this book about the evil side of fallen human nature and the faith, courage and moral strength to fight the evil must never be forgotten. I recommend this book to any reader interested in the holocaust and the specter of mass killings plaguing the world today.Survival In Auschwitz, Disciples of Fortune, Triple Agent Double, Anatomy of a Nightmare,The Gulag Archipelago are also recommended reads to help have a better understanding of threat humanity faces from the evil ideologies of hate."},{"Title":"Night","review":"\\"Night\\" by Elie Wiesel tells the horrible experience of a young 15-year-old boy who was taken away in 1944 into the concentration camps during the worldwide known Holocaust. In \\"Night\\" Elie describes his life in the concentration camps and all the unimaginable things he witnessed. He witnessed hundreds of people being beaten, killed and cremated, etc. Early on he was separated from his mother and three sisters, leaving his father and himself to stay together. Elie overcomes surgery on his foot, golden crowns being pulled out of his mouth, given extremely small rations of food, barely livable and a long forced march. Even though Elie lived throughout the Holocaust, his memories continue to haunt him.Continuously throughout the book, Wiesel uses many forms of figurative language. I found one form of simile very important to the book. When the Jews were going on the horrible forced march, the book says, \\"I was putting one foot in front of the other, like a machine.\\" (Pg. 85) I found this quote important because it shows how pushed the people were, to the point that they weren't even able to control their bodies.Wiesel's purpose for his memoir was to show the world his almost unimaginable experiences during the Holocaust and to make sure something like this never happens again. I think he definitely achieved his goal, it touched my heart and I found my self feeling sad at some parts of the book. I wouldn't change anything at all about the memoir, I think Wiesel is the only person who can tell his story the way he remembers it. Overall, Elie Wiesel did an amazing job and I give this book a 10/10 I would recommend it to anyone and I would read it again! Job well done Wiesel!"},{"Title":"Night","review":"I read 'Night' (after seeing it on Oprah's book club) shortly after I finished \\"My Life with Dr. Martin Luther King\\" by Coretta Scott King and they are both amazing stories! In 'Night' Elie tells his story of pain and heartache and it is absolutely mind-boggling and heart-wrenching. It is incredible insight into what they went through at that time and once you start reading it you won't want to put it down. In a strange way, it will also inspire you to be your utmost best because if they faced that kind of adversity and prevailed so should you."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This book narrated by a survivor is important for all to read who as decades pass may forget the tragic and horrific imprint the Holocast has made on our civilization."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This is the first book I read from writer Elie Wiesel and I absolutely loved it. It was very moving and it made me realize the horrible experience he went through. It brought tears to my eyes. It is hard to describe the feelings and emotions I went through while reading this book.I would strongly recommend it."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This rather small book can easily be read in a day or two but the affects will stick around with you longer than that and that's good. We need to ingrain it in our consciousness that things like this happened and are happening and will continue to happen as long as any one of us is holding anything against our fellow human beings.As long as we continue to think that other people are different, that certain religions aren't right, that some people don't deserve to be here, the longer we will continue to have these \\"crimes against humanity\\".We have to realize that what we do to others, we do to the whole. We have to deeply understand that even a seemingly innoucous remark about a person or a group of persons is still hatred and as long as there is a shred of hatred in the human heart these tragedies will continue to happen.We fight wars for peace. What a joke. Peace isn't found by fighting wars. Peace is found within by the individual looking for peace. Peace is not something external to our being, it is always with every decision and with every choice. Do I shake my fist at the guy who just cut me off or do I silently bless him?Night will make you cry. Night will make you uncomfortable. Night will make you think twice before you say that off-color joke about someone else.The truth isn't found in any one religion or philosophy, the Truth is found in the knowing that everything and everyone is beautiful in their own way.Read Night and let it haunt your psyche until you wake up to the Truth that only individuals can change the world."},{"Title":"Night","review":"As a teenager and young adult, the holocaust was just something that occured in conection with a war. It was the movie Schindlers list that first opened my eyes, when my children were young teens.This book is amazing, bravo for the reprint,bravo to Mr. Wiesel.The courage and strength he must have to live with these painful memories, to put on paper for the world to see and share and most importantly to never ever forget, must now and forever be applauded!"},{"Title":"Night","review":"Elie Wiesel showed us with almost unbearable clarity how inhumane and barbaric those terrible nazis displayed their power.

I could not put this book down! The details in the writing bring to life the horrible events of the holocaust and gave me more respect for a nation of people that I wasn't quite familiar with. I knew coming up as a child the bad that went on during that time in history but never knew the 'behind the scenes' details until now. I have recommended this book at least 100 times to friends and strangers alike. Of all the required reading in school I had, this book stands out beyond the rest. It is definitely more than worth the price of admission!"},{"Title":"Night","review":"I HAVE THE HONOR TO KNOW PERSONALLY ELIE WEISEL THROUGH THE UNIVERSAL ACADEMY OF CULTURES THAT HE FOUNDED IN FRANCE AND WHERE HE SERVES AS CHAIRMAN - HE HAS UNITED A LARGE NUMBER OF NOBEL PRIZE WINNERS (HE BEING A PEACE NOBEL LAUREAT) TO WORK FOR UNIVERSAL PEACE - HE IS A GREAT HUMAN BEING - A MAN THAT LIVED AS A CHILD THE WORSE EVENTS THAT A HUMAN BEING CAN FACE IN HIS LIFE - HIS HAS EMBARKED IN A CRUSADE OF PEACE AND LOVE INSTEAD OF REVENGE AND RESENTMENT - IT IS IMPORTANT TO FORGIVE BUT NEVER FORGET TO AVOID THE REPETITION OF FANATISM THAT ONLY LEADS TO DESTRUCTION - A MUST TO READ FOR ALL AGES"},{"Title":"Night","review":"I began reading Night by Elie Wiesel when i was asked to do a nonfiction project for my ninth grade reading project. I was so excited. I believed this was going to be a great book, and it was! it was extraordinary! The details he writes brings such excrutionating imagery. It brings another aspect to the holocaust and more light then the most known book for that; Anne Frank. I loved the relationship with him and his father. They were there for each other and they tried to keep the spirits of others alive when people asked them if they knew if those peoples family were alive. I would recommend this book to anyone. I loved it and i even cried. Elie Wiesel is a very talented writer and i am so glad he wrote this book. It is very touching and makes you realize what those people went through and the difficulty of their life. The irony of such thing was that the people loose their feeling throughout and they don't feel sorry for each themselves. I don't want to spoil the end of the book. Please read it.

Perhaps he's going to close with the idea that no sin is beyond forgiveness and that he has let go of his anger toward the terrorists in WW2 Europe? Maybe he's going to discuss how the horrors of the Holocaust made his faith in God waver but that he never lost it? Maybe there's going to be some other poignant message?\\"Nope. Nothing. Here's 115 pages of sickening misery, with no commentary to put it in perspective. I appreciated his pro-Israel remarks in the Nobel-acceptance speech at the end of the book but this piece of work has been around since 1958, long before he was awarded the prize. Most readers couldn't have finished with the acceptance speech section.I also found myself doubting the complete authenticity of some of these events. If every single part of Wiesel's account is true, that's fine, but that just makes the writing look worse.Just over halfway through the story, Elie tells the reader about a day in camp when he was beaten badly by a guard, and a French girl who he had worked next to in the camp comforted him. The entire time he had known her, he was under the mistaken understanding that she could not speak German, and because he could not speak French, they never had a conversation. But, on the day when Elie was beaten, she whispered to him (in perfect German according to him) some words of consolation. Then, abruptly, he tells the reader that many years later, he was sitting in a caf&eacute; in Paris when he saw the same woman walking by, and they spoke. They both remembered each other and acknowledged their time together in the concentration camp. Then, immediately back to the story.WHAT?!?! Imagine please that you are in the midst of enduring the worst possible torture that you can experience in your life, an everyday existence as a slave, treated like an animal because of your ethnicity or religious beliefs. You befriend someone in this circumstance, which would create a bond almost impossible to replicate in any other scenario between two people. Of course, once you're separated, especially in that time period, there's virtually no way to find each other again or to reunite. So... despite that, you are befallen with the terrific and miraculous fate of just happening to pass by each other years later in a city as gargantuan as Paris. Can you even fathom the gravity, the emotion, the significance, the disbelief, the VICTORY of that moment? Could you have written more than a paragraph about it clumsily spliced into a story about human suffering with the emotion of an inanimate object?Moments like that happen once in a lifetime (if even that frequently) and I find it curious that a man who is clearly a natural born writer would dispense it like it's a near meaningless paragraph or an editorial formality.I still am experiencing some confusion over why \\"Night\\" is so acclaimed. Please don't get me wrong, if you loved the book, I have no problem with that. It probably speaks to a lot of people in a way it can't speak to me. After all, I am a White American Christian male born in the 80s, part of a generation that has experienced virtually no oppression or hardship (by the world's standards) and has simultaneously been severely desensitized to violence and human suffering thanks to modern entertainment.Still, I see that it was part of \\"Oprah's Book Club\\". I see that Wiesel won the Nobel Peace Prize for the book. I can't figure out why someone would want to recommend the book to other people, or how it contributes to \\"peace\\" on a world scale. If Wiesel's intent was to simply chronicle the horrors of the holocaust by opening first-hand wounds that other survivors simply could not bring themselves to do, then the book was supposed to be a pure documentary about the holocaust. But this book is not about the holocaust, it's about Wiesel. It reads like a personal story.A story, fictional or not, has to have a purpose, a goal in mind, an intended effect on the reader. \\"Night\\" has no conclusion. It reminds me of the scene in \\"Adaptation\\" when Robert McKee tells Charlie Kaufman \\"Wow them in the end, and you've got a story. Give them an ending.\\"Tell us about your victory Elie."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Night is a good read, but I think that Dawn explores some more interesting ideas.I feel sorry for you people who need Oprah's say-so to read a good book. But at least you're reading."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This book is well-written. It is easy to read and keeps your interest in general, although it is sometimes a little repetitious and slow. I guess the author repeats the point to make sure you get it.Some of the author's ideas are new and thought-provoking, but you have to wade through some material which sounds like every other book on this topic, as well. In any case, if you are patient you will take away some neat new ideas that you will find yourself using and referring to.I like the examples and anecdotes he/she uses to illustrate his/her points - they are really interesting and I have found myself using the examples and referring to them in everyday conversations with people, which is great. I only wish that there were some more examples because it is not always easy to see the point when no example is offered."},{"Title":"Night","review":"The story is darkest than its title (Night). It is no use trying to describe it. I think everyone should read and discover it for him- or herself... I think it is only good that it is a rather short story. It is too heartbreaking to make it any longer. I respect Oprah to find the most meaningful stories for her Book Club."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This is the most depressing and boring book I have ever read.

He does have my deepest sympathies as does everybody who lost relatives in the Holocaust. Elie's writing illustrates his loss of faith and his anger at God for allowing the Holocaust to happen in the first place in their own countries and Europe in general. It was like a wake-up call for the European Jews to see the deportation, the stripping of identity, the torture, the labor or death, the burning of human bodies, the stench in the camps, the lack of human dignity. Wiesel should realize that these events didn't go away. Genocides have been around since the beginning of time just as racism, anti-Semitism, sexism, discrimination, ageism, etc. Wiesel's book asks us to ask questions about God, existence, and life purpose. Elie's book asks those same questions. Some of us are comforted in our religions, our families, our relationships with other human beings, etc. The Holocaust destroyed countries in Europe. Poland has never fully recovered. On my trip to Warsaw in 2000, we visited the tallest building in the city and there was a newspaper in the 1930s about the upcoming Jewish New Year, Rosh Hashanah, before the war of all wars. Seeing that photo there is an understated memorial reminding us of what might have been than what is. Poland's post-war Anti-Semitism had a lot to do with the Soviet Communism. Now, I keep thinking about my two aunts who never married and the fact that my father who lived in Siedlce, Poland watched half of his town be massacred by the Germans in 1941. My father didn't tell me that they were killed because they were Jewish. He just knew their names, their faces, and they were his friends and neighbors as well. Poland tries to move on with the future instead of being dragged down in the past. Sadly, Wiesel has to remember the past to move on with the living. More and more Holocaust survivors are dying each day. Survivors like Wiesel have been blessed with survival as well as guilt for being a survivor. After my father died in 1991, I went on a quest to understand death and I don't believe in it after all. I believe that God does exist and I could hate Him for my own personal reasons but I think He wants me to learn my lessons in life. That's why I prefer Victor Frankl's book on Man's Searching for Meaning after his Holocaust experiences, he focuses on the positive and surviving and living better and being alive without feeling so guilty for it."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This should be a must read for all high school students. What happened with the Jewish people during the Second World War was horrific. Wiesel's \\"diary\\" was heart wrenching."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This book was delieverd in perfect condition and was delievered in amazing speed! Great buy!"},{"Title":"Night","review":"The book arrived in a timely fashion and was in great condition. I'll definitely order from here again. I've always had good luck and service!"},{"Title":"Night","review":"This was a very good book. And I would have given it 3 1/2 stars. As a work of fiction written with the backdrop of the holocaust, or as a completely non-fiction book it would merit 5 stars. But it was published as a fictionalized account of MR. Wiesels experiences. Therefore, if the story of the Angel being hung, or the young violinist playing his last Beethoven concerto before dying, or young Eliezer's denial of his Father in his time of need, are part of the fiction the book loses some of its overall power. I'm not saying that these episodes were part of the fiction, its just that not knowing whether they were or not diminished some of the book's impact on me. Please realize that I have complete sympathy for all the victims of, and I'm not doubting any of the horrors of the holocaust(Gas Chambers, crematoriums, selections, 6 million killed etc:). I am critiqueing the book, not the event."},{"Title":"Night","review":"It amazed me, while reading Night, at how complacent the Jews were while being placed into the ghettos. This is probably because I knew what was going to take place for them after the ghettos.

A must read for those who care not to see this history repeated. Further, it has exceptional cinematic potential --by Paul D. Cohn, Author, \\"Sao Tome.\\""},{"Title":"Night","review":"Compelling story read by a very expressive story teller. It was difficult to turn off. Tragic autobiography of a halocaust survior not suitable for kids."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I have always avoided reading about the Holocaust knowing that it would make me inconsolably depressed. However, this attitude is immature and irresponsible. Night was troubling to read but what makes it unique is that it addresses the questions that you always think about when reading about the Holocaust: How did you survive? What did you think about and focus on that made you want to survive? In his story, Wiesel discusses the journey, what happened, and his thoughts on each step of the way.Read this book, you will not forget it. It will also make you realize how precious life is, Wiesel survived to be able to tell this story for those who cannot."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Nobel laureate, Elie Wiesel's memoir moved me to tears.His first person account of his people's sufferings informed me and changed the way I thought about the holocaust.I never doubted it happened. I just never realized the truth of it all. Words don't express the emotions I had during the reading of this book.Every American should read this lovely, bitter, moving memoir."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I recognize the power of this little book. The events narrated here are horrific and memorable. We all should read this and vow not to repeat this in our history. However, stylistically speaking, the writing is not super exceptional. It may just be the translation."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This is the journal of a young man who has lived the through the holocaust.Its history and first account of the horrors faced, rightly won Nobel Prize.It should be required reading, in high school."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Book arrived in great condition and very quickly from when it was ordered.The story is a very sad one, and very moving. Definitely deserved the Nobel Peace Prize that it received.I was very glad that the author had the strength to speak out, even after all he had been through. He gave the other workers at the concentration camp the courage and strength to speak out against Hitler. His story lets America know the true story of what happened at Auzswitch. I think it took amazing courage to write about something so painful and profound. This story is true and reaches to the depths of ones soul. I recommend all Americans read this, even though it is a painful story to read."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This was a non-stop read, could not put it down (except for the kleenex). Would highly recommend this book to anyone - it should be a must read for our High School students."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Every human being should read this book. Emotionally speaking, it's hard to get through. Otherwise, it's amazing how short, how powerful, and how readable it is.After I finished Night, I had a chance to read another first-person account called Doctors from Hell. If you want to learn more about this period in history, the history of medicine, or man's capacity for atrocity, you'll enjoy it. Like Night, it's upsetting, but you'll be glad you read it."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This is an obviously amazingly powerful book. One thing I do want to point out though is this is 100% nonfiction. This is his autobiography. The other books in the Night trilogy are fiction which is what is getting people confused. This book is 100% true. It tells the story of his life as a Hollocaust survivor which is part of what makes it so amazingly moving."},{"Title":"Night","review":"The author gives the reader a heads-up in his introduction that his story has been doubted, especially in the first edition. I don't doubt his story. He has a voice that can only come from someone who experienced such pain and hardships."},{"Title":"Night","review":"\\"What do you recommend?\\" I asked the bookshop attendant, \\"I like Hemmingway...\\"He immediately rushed for this book. The pulitzer peace prize winner and oprah book club selection. That was yesterday evening. It's done now. Absolutely riveting."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Incredibly well written book that will get you very close to experiencing the high magnitude of horror that humans are capable of creating. Although it can be a bit painful reading this short book, I believe that it provides the reader with a very profound view into the human soul and the unconscious world that we live in.I am certain that most Germans, including the ones in the Hitler's army were not completely wicked as I am sure there were many courageous Jews who would fight an honorable war instead of walking into their miserable deaths. What is alarming, however, is the power of deception and manipulation that can steal peoples souls and reduce them to harming others (the Germans), accepting and living with mortification (the Jews), and turning a blind eye (the rest of the world).The holocaust may be over but ethnic cleansing still goes on in many parts of the world."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This book is amazing. I could not put the book down once I started reading. I would also recommend reading the complete trilogy: Night, Dawn, and Day (previously titled The Accident)."},{"Title":"Night","review":"After reading Night, I believe the author distinctively wrote out a very well description of what had gone on at the Nazi concentration camps. He strongly depicts the pain and suffering Jewish people had to go through during this time. Elie left some \\"breathing space\\" for us to form our opinions of the situation, but also just stuck to the truth, which was a strength of his. He directly told us the story, but meanwhile our hearts do get suck into such a story when we realize people just like us were going through this horrible hell on earth times. Another one of his strengths was we can imagine ourselves in the story, and I felt almost like I saw it all happen rather than I was just reading it. A weakness I would have to recall on would be that I didn't feel much attachment to the characters as much as the trouble they had to push through.I've read this book twice, both for assignments, but I'm glad I got assigned to it because I understand the Holocaust and the tragedies that tie along with it so much better than if a teacher was to stand by the board and tell us about it. Night helps people in today's world to understand the message calling out to us through this novel so maybe we can be more considerate and not discriminate over heritages, races, religions, or color. We all are humans. The novel was written extremely well, and I believe there aren't many weaknesses in the author that I can point out. I feel like everyone should read this book because it clearly has told what happened, and to help us remember to never forget."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I just finished reading this book in one sitting, and I must say that I absolutely loved it. I was expecting for a tearjerker, and although I didn't exactly shed any tears, it was good all the same. I was truly moved by this well written novel and was able to connect emotionally with the main character Eliezer. Through this novel, Elie Wiesel greatly depicted the ideas of discrimination, god, silence, and brutality amongst men with great intensity. When the author killed someone off, I felt as if I were standing right at the sight watching the exact scene happen right before my eyes; when the characters were drowning in their tears, I felt my own heart break into pieces along with them. I could go on forever, but I don't want to waste anyone's time. If you're still reading this review and haven't read the novel yet, take my advice and read it. It's a rather short novel, but fulfilling all the same. Enjoy."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Night by Elie Wiesel was a required reading assignment for my 8th grade English class. The novel is about a teenage boy and his family who were sent to a concentration camp during the Holocaust. When they arrive at the camp Elie and his father are separated from his mother and sister. The majority of the book is about their life in the camp.I believe that the author's main purpose for writing this novel is to inform people about the cruelty of this event in history. I believe he also wrote about the cruelty so hopefully it will never happen again. I do believe he achieved this goal.The author's main message is that without something to live for in life it will be harder to live. Your life must have a purpose. Elie also used good figurative language in the book to show solid things as something else. This element gave the effect of the seriousness of the situation. An example is when Elie said, \\"Never shall I forget those moments that murdered my God and my soul and turned my dreams to ashes.\\" The author did a good job in describing the conditions in which he and the other prisoners lived.The only thing I would change about this book is I would have the author go into more detail about the work the required of the prisoners. He stated that they worked in factories but I would have liked to learn more.I would recommend this book for a person who likes to go in depth with a book and wants to learn more about the Holocaust. If you like to read for entertainment I don't think this is the book for you. If you like to read to educate yourself on history or past events this book may be good for you."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Words do not seem capable of describing this book: I am generally of a pessimistic nature when it comes to humanity and, sadly perhaps, this book confirms how depraved, inhumane and heartless we can be -- and this was less than 70 years ago; not 100s or 1000s of years ago.It is not an 'enjoyable' read, for how could it be?, but a deeply profound, captivating and emotional read that I found hard to put down. In parts I thought it brief, but then could I have handled more? and I am thankful Elie Wiesel wrote what he did as I cannot imagine it was easy. The raw honesty of Elie Wiesel is to be commended, and cherished, and I am thankful he had the strength of character to write this and share with those of us who may feel removed from those times: may we never forget and may we strive to change [but I feel such events will, horridlyy, return]. We need the Elie Wiesels of this world to keep us on guard, as best and as much as we alone can do."},{"Title":"Night","review":"The whole world should read this work. A remarkable work written by a remarkable man. It shows the depths man has sunk to. It also shows the capacity that the human will has to survive, even when you couldn't imagine why you would want to survive. May the rest of us listen to the words in this book and take them to heart everyday for the sake of humanity."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I first read this book my sophomore year of high school as a reading assignment and was heartbroken at the tales Elie told. His graphic descriptions stay in your head and when you put the book down you almost have to catch your breath. I read it again most recently for my sophomore theology class in college and as I read more deeply into the book it has more meaning than just discussing the concentration camps. Elie puts us in his eyes as he witnesses his whole family destroyed by the camp and how his religion is forever affected. I was thrilled that Oprah had put this on her book club, but I think it should have been on there much earlier."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I've never been too much into studying the Holocaust. I know it happened, I know its awful and I was like everyone else, just put that on the shelf and was part of the problem. Dont get involved. Well this guy put me in my place. This is a really great book that will open your eyes. It is a quick read but it takes you there first hand to the horror of seeing your Mother and Sisters taken away to the gas chambers and seeing first hand other children being put in the fire and flames. You can feel this book as you read. Read it and never forget."},{"Title":"Night","review":"As a second time reader, of the novel, Night, I fully enjoyed reading it. It's real, it's the truth, it actually happened. Elie Wiesel wasn't afraid to tell his story. He put his memories out there, as they were, harsh or not. He didn't hold back. Through his memoir we can better understand and acknowledge the almost unimaginable events that happened. These events of the Holocaust being so horrifying and inhumane it's hard to grasp the concept of it actually being real and having occurred only six decades ago.Ellie Wiesel puts his life story out there, because it is his \\"duty as a survivor.\\" He includes every detail before his words make the reader go completely weak in the stomach. From the \\"smell of burning flesh\\" being in the air, or being chosen like \\"cattle or merchandise.\\" Wiesel also used strong emotions to give the actual reality of what they were feeling and the depth of it. At one point he said, \\"Terror was stronger than hunger.\\" He also was true to himself as to letting us know that at some point his faith was dimming. \\"It's the end. God is no longer with us.\\" Although, now, his faith being fully alive, Ellie never once forgot his past and didn't hesitate to share it. This book is his; it's his life on paper. It's what makes it a great read compared to a historian's view on something he or she did not experience firsthand."},{"Title":"Night","review":"As Oprah had said, \\"I believe all should read this book\\". It was so unbelievable that all of this took place and someone actually lived through it to tell the story. Night was very heart wrenching and makes anyone happy that we can live the day to day lives that we do."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I OFTEN BUY AN EXTRA BOOK FOR MY FRIENDS. I CALL THEM LENDERS.

For baby boomers like myself who have read other books like the Diary of Anne Frank, it was a reminder of what happened in this period in history. By making it a bookclub selection and \\"marketing\\" to school age children, Oprah has invited a new generation to read about this period of time, and hopefully in some way experience the tragedy that occured. THere are so few left that lived through this and can share their experiences. It would indeed be a tragedy if we forgot."},{"Title":"Night","review":"\\"Night\\" is written so well that you actually feel you are there experiencing the horror, the sadness, the hurt, and the physical trauma.

Great book!"},{"Title":"Night","review":"While this was an emotionally difficult book to read, it is an important book for all of us to read. We must not forget what happened in order that we don't repeat history's mistakes."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I was happy to see that this book was added to Oprah's book club, this ment that millions who never knew of this book would read it or at least hear it's story. I read this in college as part of the debates on wither the US should have entered WW2 before 1941. When I was done I felt that I had been robbed. Not that I didn't enjoy the book but that noone had told me about it before. I would rather have read this in Middle or High school then some of the junk books they forced on us, and while Romeo and Joilet is a fine work I belive that the story Wiesel gives us is more timly and would give kids something to think about.The story of Wiesel and his Father in the camps should make anyone who reads this book take note of what happens when Fascism and National Socalism are given a foothold.Sadly we are having to learn some of this lessons again, hopefully we learned then well enough to stop another Holocaust."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Very well written. Gets to the point. This is the FIRST book I've read (other than Diary of Anne Frank) about the concentration camps & the horrific plight of those who endured them. I CAN say - Weisel does an excellent job of conveying what happened during the years being confined and moved among camps. And fortunately for us - he paints a good enough picture of the experience without having to go in to more details that he easily could have. It makes you want to go back in time & CHANGE what happened. It makes me NOT want to read anymore on this subject b/c of the unspeakable horrors that existed & no one did anything about."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I've been meaning to read \\"Night\\" for a while. I see it every time I pop into a bookstore. Plus it's only 115 pages and can be read over a few hours. I suspect it's taken me this long to read it because I knew it would be disturbing. How could a story of surviving Auschwitz be anything but disturbing?I finally got around to reading it today and it is well worth the uncomfortable feelings it elicits. Wiesel writes in a spare, journalistic style. He depicts his harrowing journey with surprising swiftness -- he and his family were transported from a Transylvanian ghetto to Poland during 1944. Stories were already circulating about the Russian front making strides to liberate them; many of Wiesel's comrades were hopeful they would be spared. All hope died when they arrive by cattle car to the camps. The scenes depicted here -- of starvation, cruelty, senseless death -- are not easy to read. Most wrenching is Wiesel's relationship with his father. By saving the very personal to the end, Wiesel holds off on fully engrossing the reader until the bitter end. This is a powerful style choice -- just as you're finishing the volume, you're overcome by the pure evil of what has transpired."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Night is truly an extraordinary book. The author is an amazing writer because you feel as if you were right beside him in the boxcars and when he was in the concentration camp. I am the same age that Elie was during the time of the book. I can't imagine how hard it must have been to experience the barbarous treatment that he endured. The part that I can not imagine is being a witness to the murders of children.In the spring of 1944, the Wiesel family along with other Jewish families were deported to a ghetto. Not wanting to accept the grim reality of their future, many people thought this was only a temporary situation. However, the animosity of the soldiers soon showed them that deportation was not a farce. The Wiesel family arrived like cattle in train cars to their first concentration camp, Auschwitz. There they separated the men from the women. Elie and his father stayed together. That was the last time Elie saw his little sister and his mother alive.Elie and his father\`s year in the concentration camps was a horrific time. The toll of starvation, beatings and death was unimaginable. Though they had strong faith, they began to doubt that there was a God anymore; even the rabbi was beginning to believe that God was no longer with them. I believe that if I were in that position, even with my strong faith, I would have also doubted my faith in God just as Elie did.One quote that stuck in my mind was, \\"Here there are no fathers, no brothers, no friends.\\" These people were brought down to such a low point that the only way to survive was to fend for themselves. That was their only hope for survival. Even Elie was to the point that he was beginning to think that it would be easier if his sick father would just die so all his energy would be used on himself. What a horrible situation to be put in where you were thinking about letting your own father die so you can go on.The death of his father left Elie's life in a blur until the liberation of the camp. It was a sad ending because his father died a few days before the camp was liberated. Elie would not talk about his experiences for 10 years after the horror.I can't say I enjoyed the book, because of the horrible events that happen. It made me aware of the historical events that we all have heard about, but did not know the details until now."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I loved this book!

But, it is sad to think that mankind can be capable of such horrors."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I have been to Germany, toured Dachau and have been interested in reading about the holocaust ever since. Reading \\"Night\\", was nothing short of amazing. There wasn't one page where I lost interest and by the end, I felt conflicted. I was happy that such a sad story was over, but sad that such an amazing book was done. Elie Wiesel is hero, a survivor, an excellent son and a gifted author. It's so sad that all this greatness came at such a personal cost. Would I ever love to sit and talk with this man... amazing from cover to cover."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Regardless of how many times I return to this book, it never fails to shock and inspire. An indispensable recollection of the horror of the Holocaust and one survivors struggle to reconcile his experience and his faith."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This book is definitely one of my favorites. I was really sick with a stomach flu one time and I read the entire trilogy start to finish. I have never done that with any other book.The imagary is amazing. Wiesel has a way of creating an environment of such hostile conditions that you feel it in your soul. Any other person would want to repress such horrid memories, but Elie brings them to the forefront of his mind, and I was left with such a feeling of gratitude when finishing this book it was overwhelming."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Night, this book went through my soul.Elie Wiesel described the pain, that many others and I have, in words that would be impossible for me to do."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I read this book back in high school and it stayed with me ever since."},{"Title":"Night","review":"In \\"Night\\", Elie Wiesel has shared his life and tragedy with those of us who could not in our wildest dreams imagine what the victims of Hitler and Nazism endured. All my adult life (I am 64) I have heard stories of the holocaust and how Jews as well as others not to Nazi liking suffered. Until I read \\"Night\\" I was in darkness, no pun intended. Everyone should read this short presentation if they wish to understand just how evil man can be to each other, and just how important it is that we NEVER forget. I also cannot imagine how I would have reacted if I were in the same situation. I cannot imagine I would have had the courage to survive. I am not prone to attach the label of \\"hero\\" to many humans, although I do recognize individual acts of heroism on occasion. However, if not for his courage and his survival, then certainly for his openness in sharing his story with the world, his continuous efforts to educate those who do not know, and his tenacity, I will declare that to me, Elie Wiesel is a hero. I spent only a day reading the entire book. I will not forget him, for the rest of my life. I know of no \\"hero\\" I would rather meet in person than this man. This book is also excellent material for teachers who wish to introduce their students to this part of history. (Note: The copy of the book I read has nothing to do with Oprah's Book club although the Amazon listing says it does.)"},{"Title":"Night","review":"This work about one teenage boy surviving a series of Nazi concentration camps is haunting and poignant. There are scenes that will stay with you for the rest of your life --- even if you would wish to forget them. (What really shocked me was the sheer selfishness of the inmates, this \`every man for himself' mentality as family members ultimately turn on each other.) In a sense, there's little to be said about what is a lyrical poem about living in as close to hell as anyone has ever had to suffer through.That said, I wish I knew what genre this book is in. I would have a better sense of my own emotional reaction if it weren't for the controversies surrounding the book. At first blush _Night_ appears to be a memoir. But finding out that it is part of a trilogy in which the latter two volumes are explicitly described as novels gives pause. And that the translation changes some of the meanings, most famously the paragraph about sex and revenge on the last page. I can't read Yiddish so I don't know whether the original really said \`rape'. All I can say is that the paragraph in English doesn't make any psychological sense, which makes me wonder whether the translation is in fact accurate.It also gives pause to find out that that _Night_ is a redaction of an 800+ page manuscript. Cutting a work by over 80 percent can have several effects. First, it can create meaning by implying cause and effect where there wasn't necessarily any (e.g., making two events appear close together and thus connected). Similarly such redaction can completely change the emotional tenor of a work. When a year of the most evil torment are turned into a hundred pages, an editor is likely to select the most awful or memorable moments. This compression can make the experience seem surreal. Also, such drastic cutting can make the reduced text very choppy.All of these qualities are present in this text. Much of it, especially towards the beginning, seems rather literary --- like the work is going to be a theological parable. Everything feels so laden with irony and foreshadowing. Then the story becomes scattershot and ultimately collapses into selfishness amongst the inmates. I suspect the individual sentences are literally true but the meaning of them might have been obscured by the massive editing. The inmates turning on each other so fiercely for instance might have happened but have caught the editor's eye precisely because it was so rare not because it was so common. And for the randomness of the middle of the work, is this Wiesel trying to convey the sheer gratuitousness of the violence and the absurdity of the Germans trying to organize such misery bureaucratically? Or is it simply the editor trying to select out passages designed to describe something in detail and giving them more weight than they originally had? It frustrates me that I can't tell.Ultimately what I got out of this is a better understanding of the experience of the psychology of the concentration camps. Writers seem to react to the Holocaust by often adopting a strictly realist style. The facts of the situation are so overwhelming that words that try to explain what it felt like to experience seem hopelessly inadequate so authors chose flat description. _Night_, however, takes a different approach. It does try to convey the interior experience, like how otherworldly the billowing and rank furnaces made entrance into Auschwitz feel.It seems almost tasteless to have to put a star ranking on a work about the Shoah. What could such a ranking possibly mean?"},{"Title":"Night","review":"I could not put the book down! As soon as I opened the package I started reading and was finished with it a few hours later! I am usually a few pages a day kind of reader.There was some terminology that I didn't understand, but that didn't stop me from reading!"},{"Title":"Night","review":"When a teenager, Elie Wiesel was taken from his home, and he and his family were put in a series of concentration camps over several years. Night is the haunting record of that experience, as bleakly unflinching a memoir as has ever been written. Few can know the horrors of not only spending teenage years in such a place but also seeing family members and many others die and countless others suffer. Needless to say, Wiesel's own plight was also tragically great, and he unsurprisingly lost both innocence and faith. The experience touched him so deeply that he was unable to write of it for over a decade. When he finally did, he had great difficulty getting published; the events were still very close, and the world wanted to forget rather than being reminded. However, when published in 1960, Night was an international sensation, reawakening interest in the Holocaust and all it stands for. It was not only a literary triumph but the first step in Wiesel's core belief that we must always remember the Holocaust so nothing like it ever happens again.The book remains undeniably compelling, a masterpiece on many levels. Perhaps most immediately, it is a stark depiction of evil's height, showing humanity at its worst. This is valuable in every sense from philosophical to sociological but above all in destroying hollow optimism epitomized in the belief that things will take care of themselves and all will work out for the best. Night leaves no doubt that, left unchecked, human evil grows exponentially; it is our duty to curb it, and the awareness raised by such works is a very important part of this. Second, it is an invaluable historical document, one of the best - most thorough and readable - primary sources of the Holocaust's unparalleled miseries. As such, it is one of the darkest works ever - all the more so in being true; even the blackest imagination could not conceive such atrocities, which says all that need be said about this aspect of Night and the events it records.Yet there are several strong senses in which the book is not bleak. First, it is an artistic masterpiece; unwavering honesty and vivid description raise it above mere memoir, putting it with the most harrowing and unforgettable first-person accounts ever. Its biggest strength in this way is unadorned yet highly effective prose. Wiesel has no time for dizzying metaphors, lush descriptions, or other fancy writing; he has a bitter story to tell and tells it as plainly and - in the best way - as simply as possible. This makes it clearer and more memorable than it could ever have been otherwise, forcing us to focus on the events rather than the writing. The story speaks for itself as few can. Though barely one hundred pages, it has more of substance and significance than nearly any other book. The words are few but the implications endless.Perhaps more fundamentally, though Night is a savage condemnation of human evil, it is also a tribute to human endurance. Like a surprising number of others, Wiesel survived the Holocaust despite everything, showing just how far human beings can be pushed and live. Such determination and perseverance is truly incredible, a testament to the indomitable human spirit that is at least as astonishing in its way as the evil that confronted it and far more awe-inspiring. Wiesel not only lived but, in a long career starting with Night, has admirably devoted his life to exposing the Holocaust's monstrosities to guard future ages against recurring evil.Night is a profoundly important document in this and many other ways, a must for anyone even remotely interested in the Holocaust, World War II, Judaism, or the depths to which humanity can sink - as well as, in one sense at least, all that it can rise above. It is nothing less than one of the most important and valuable books of all-time. Though a very painful read, everyone should read it if only to see just how painful life can be - and hopefully to avoid passing the pain on to those lucky enough to have been born after the nightmares it faithfully records."},{"Title":"Night","review":"After reading \\"Night\\", I realized that it is the first book I've read that was authored by a Holocaust survivor. I was so absorbed by Elie Weisel's tale of absolute misery and despair that it only took me a little over an hour to read the entire book ... and I've found myself thinking about it's contents ever since. It is also the first book I've read that actually made me feel the authors pain.The books starts with the feeling that Germany's defeat was imminent, Weisel conveys a sense of complacency in that it appeared he and his family would be spared the worse with the Red Army's rapid westward advance to Germany. Even when Germany invades Hungary in the spring of 1944, Weisel and his family appeared content to wait for the Russians. This proved to be a grave miscalculation as the Nazis begin deporting Jews from the ghetto to labor camps in Poland ... at this point, Weisel and his father are separated from his mother and younger sister. The remainder of the book is about survival based on ingenuity, fate and others' misfortunes. As he and his father trudge through the hell of Auschwitz; it isn't until later that Weisel begins to assume the fate of his sister and mother.Throughout the book, death is both random and a frequent sight, with the lines of people plodding to the chimneys that endlessly spew the ashes of thousands upon thousands ... a constant reminder of his inevitable fate. Weisel frequently contemplates his faith in God, because there is no way, he believes, that God would allow such inhumanity on such a grand scale. When the thundering artillery of the approaching Red Army are actually being felt, the Nazis crudely force the inmates of Auschwitz on a death march to Germany that only the strong could possibly survive. At this point Weisel sees and feels how the bonds of family become unglued when starvation becomes extreme and how the endless dead are unceremoniously disposed. Buchenwald is the final destination of the death march and it is there where Weisel experiences his ultimate loss and eventual liberation by the Americans.At 120 pages (including a transcript of the author's Nobel Prize speech), Weisel didn't need many words to bring forth the pain, suffering and loss he experienced and witnessed. I found myself constantly putting myself in Weisel's shoes, often wondering how he had the will, at sixteen years of age, to endure such horrific circumstances. I intended to be critical of this book in that it left me with so many questions, mainly follow-up questions, like Weisel's thoughts looking back. But, with the book still making me think several days after I read it, I accepted and appreciated \\"Night\\" for what it was ... a nightmare that became reality for a teenager ... a capsule of that particular moment in time, no more, no less."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I had the good fortune of seeing Elie Wiesel speak years ago. I remember him as a very inspirational speaker and, ever since then, I've been meaning to read Night. Now that I've finally read it, I can't believe I've waited this long.My biggest fear in writing this review is that my extreme use of hyperbole will do it a disservice. Nowadays, we are constantly bombarded with book blurbs telling us how profound, astonishing, and incredible a novel is. Well, all of these adjectives--and many, many more--can and should be applied to Night. What's more, when they are applied to Night, they actually have meaning.I certainly hope that most of us have some sort of awareness about the Holocaust. Still, for all that I've read about it and for all the movies I've seen, nothing really prepared me for this book. I think what struck me most about it was its searing honesty. Wiesel is brave in many senses of the word. He certainly deserves to be called brave because of what he went through during his internment in death camps, but he should also be lauded as brave for telling a very unadorned truth. I think I learned more about humanity in the pages of this slim novel than I ever before have.At one point in the novel, Wiesel says that he became nothing more than a stomach. It is the starkness of words like these, his very bleak and matter-of-fact way of describing his experiences that has the most impact. The novel isn't very graphic, but nor does Wiesel hesitate to describe the horrors that were inflicted upon the Jews on a daily basis. It's easy to see how someone in such a situation could simply give up, could simply lay down, close their eyes, and let it all end forever. What's difficult to understand is how anyone could continue to find the strength to carry on in the midst of such unimaginable savagery.There is no doubt in my mind that there is real power in reading survivor accounts such as this one. The statistics about the Holocaust are certainly horrifying, but they have an even greater impact when they have a human face. Wiesel truly survived a living nightmare. It sounds cliched, but this is a work that shows that the human spirit can triumph over any evil. I don't see how it is possible not to admire a man such as Wiesel, a man who refused to let trauma break him and, instead, used that trauma as the impetus to devote his life to protecting the safety and dignity of others. And, yet, travesties similar to the Holocaust are visited upon people even today. It is for this reason that this work is particularly important. Wiesel has devoted his life to ensuring that the systematic torture and elimination of millions of people won't be forgotten. It is our responsibility to heed his word and to make this our crusade as well as his. The world will never be a truly just place until every human being refuses to sit by idly while the basic rights of others are violated."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I am not going to review this book traditionally since I believe it far too profound and important for me to comment on the writing and story. This book changed me as a person, and provided me with more knowledge and hope for mankind than I had prior ro reading this. What a brave man, and thank you Mr. Wiesel for sharing your experience and not forgetting."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This beautifully-written book provides emotional, physical and spiritual insight into what is a hellish nightmare. At times its haunting images and perspective are overwhelming so I can only read a chapter or two at a sitting. Night is a short yet very powerful book."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I did enjoy this book. However it seemed to have missing parts or something of the like. I understand these events occurred quite some time ago, and that any recollection as time goes on is a wonderful work of art,but in the 'gaps' of recollection that seemed, I would have liked more of a description of the surroundings and people.I would highly recommend this book. Even those not terribly schooled on the Holocaust are able to follow quite well."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Night is an amazing little book, filled with horror and pain. It really raises the question of where God is in the midst of unimaginable pain and cruelty. There is no real answer to this, although I choose to believe that God is in the midst of all the horror. God (and humanity) are changed by experiencing such horror, either directly as participants in the horror, or indirectly by reading works such as Night. They do change us by, unfortunately, feeling the grotesqueness to which humanity can sink. Hopefully we are changed by the experience of reading Night, as I believe that God was changed by the suffering of the holocaust. If so, then the book is a success."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I bought this book at Borders and was under the impression that it was 100% true. Nowhere on the cover nor inside is it mentioned that this is partially fictitious. Therefore, I feel like I've been duped. I didn't know that this book was considered a \\"novel\\" until I came onto this website and read the other reviews.This fact does not diminish the power of the book, however. It is a sad, depressing, and difficult read, but worth it. Mr. Weisel addresses one of the most universal theological questions: Why do bad things happen to good people? If God is just and loving, how could something like the holocaust even come to pass? The young narrator cannot answer these questions, and neither can we. The final scene between the narrator and his father is heartbreaking. He \\"denies\\" his father in much the same way that Peter denied Jesus in the New Testament. I'm not sure whether the author intended this parallel or not, but the comparison is chilling.The most frightening thing is that there have been many \\"holocausts\\" since this one--in Rwanda, in Eastern Europe under Milosevich, etc. Is the desire to hurt and kill others, the desire to make war, an instinctively human trait? We hope not, but this book reminds us of the horrors one human being can bestow on another.This book iillustrates both the limitlessness of human suffering and the limitlessness of human cruelty. However, it also shows how a person can rise up and move beyond his past. I would highly recommend this book and wish it had been read in my high school instead of the junk they assigned to us back then. I am just a little upset that this book is marketed as nonfiction when it is not 100% true. I will think twice before I buy another book from this publisher. I don't appreciate being misled."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This book makes me feel ashamed to a human - and it still goes on all over the world."},{"Title":"Night","review":"You cannot be human, and read this book, without being horrified and moved. Something in you changes - most frightening is that this could happen such a short time ago. Hell, it's happening now - but if the country is not considered a strategic \\"player\\" the powers that be tend to ignore it. Doesn't anyone remember President Carter saying we stood for many things, and one of the most important was Human Rights? God help us all."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Show me a person who can read this book and not be profoundly affected and I will show you a person without a soul."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Mr. Wiesel wrote a book that will not leave me alone. It touched me to the core. While the young Anne Frank only had a deeper belief in God, Eli lost faith. Of course, Eli went thru the horrible experience before he wrote the book, and Anne Frank wrote her's from the saftey of the attic (the journal part.)Wiesel made me very sad for him and even sadder that he lost his faith. I wish I had answers for him about why and how God chooses to work...or even why he allows some things to happen.This is a book worth reading. It will stir feelings in you and it certainly will give you many \\"nights\\" to ponder the meaning of God and faith; Searching your own soul for answers you thought were already settled.Please read this book."},{"Title":"Night","review":"what can i say, this book is simply the best. Everyone should read it. Amazing...."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This should be required reading as an accompaniment to the teaching of the Holocaust. It's really more of a novella, because of its brevity, but don't let length fool you. This book has a very powerful message; I would say 8th grade level and above would be appropriate."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This is the story of a Transylvanian Jewish boy's total emersion into the hell of the Holocaust. It flows dramatically like innocence caught in a raging river of hate. When I finished the marathon of hopelessness, I read it backwards like the Hebrew book it is. I retraced in slow-motion the journey from the concentration camp back to its source--the boyhood home of the Wiesel Family. Reading it forward and backward opened me to the deepest parts of my own soul. This is a book you can never forget. If you have the courage, read the Diary of Anne Frank along with it. Somewhere in that Black Hole of humanity, you will see the glimmer of the light of your own Hanukkah."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Elie Wiesel's story of his time in one of the Nazi death camps and his treatment at the hands of his captors is an absolutely incredible story.

It is a haunting tale of man's inhumanity towards his fellow man, and should be read by all as a bulwark to keep these types of atrocities from ever happening again."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I'd recommend this to all, a story we should all never forget.

The problem is that I don't know if I would have been a former prisoner, or guard. I have always fantasized that I must have been a prisoner ('cause I'm a good guy and can't imagine torturing people, even in a former life), but there is a part of me which has to accept that it might have been otherwise. But I have had a fascination for the Holocaust and stories of the Holocaust for as long as I can remember.I suspect that the \\"shock\\" value of this book is more for people who perhaps have not thought or read much about the Holocaust. To read with brutal honesty what happened to human beings -- men, women and children -- in our world, in our lifetime (well, my lifetime anyway) is gut-wrenching.\\"Night\\" tells in painful detail the story of Wiesel's life as an adolescent in a small village in Romania, living with his family, studying his religion and hearing tales of the approaching Nazi troops. We watch the family torn apart, shoved into boxcars and arriving at Auschwitz, where he sees his mother and sister for the last time, not knowing it was the last time.The story follows the struggle of the young man and his father to stay alive, in Auschwitz, Buna, Buchenwald and Gleiwitz. It recounts the father's ultimate loss of his life, literally days before the camps were liberated. The book also tells of Wiesel's survivor guilt, being the only one in his family to have come out alive.This book started Elie Wiesel's lifelong project to bear witness for those who died, stating that \\"to remain silent and indifferent is the greatest sin of all\\" (a message which rings as true today as it did then). His passion for bearing witness earned him the Nobel Peace Prize in 1986.\\"Night\\" is, indeed, a gripping story, and mirrors so many other similar horror stories.\\"Let us remember, let us remember the heroes of Warsaw, the martyrs of Treblinka, the children of Auschwitz. They fought alone, they suffered alone, they lived alone, but they did not die alone, for something in all of us died with them.\\""},{"Title":"Night","review":"This is a book that all should read, thus we never forget the atrocities of the Holocaust."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I thought I had heard everything there was about the this troubling time in history but Elie Wiesel presents a new view and a different point of view from the trauma that a thirteen year old experienced. It is still so amazing to me how strong the hope is that everything will be okay when the world around is falling apart. This is a fast read that will cause to re-examine how something like this could happen and how so many could be involved in the torture. While I rarely read Intros and forwards, this is one not to miss."},{"Title":"Night","review":"A five star rating doesn't give Night the credit it deserves. My hat is off to Oprah for bringing this classic to the forefront again. It's time for a new generation of readers to experience Night.I met Elie Wiesel when he came to St. Andrews Presbyterian College in the early 80's. I was on the faculty and he made an appearance as part of a winter term course of the Holocaust that was taught by Dr. Alvin Smith and Professor Carl Geffert. Night was required reading. After reading Night on my own and then meeting Mr. Wiesel I was struct by the absolute positivity of the man. For someone who had been through what he had, his message to the students was both filled with darkness and yet bursting with hope. That's the real message of Night. No matter how dark the world seems to get, better times are on the way.People shouldn't read Night who are looking for an easy read. This book will most likely keep you awake at night. Read it for a lesson. When good people ignore cruelty and evil, we are all touched by them.Night should be on the reading list of books that prepare you for life."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This was a moment in time i really felt like i was actually there to experience what the author's memories of his past. your heart will feel the suffering for the people and the of Elie's pain.

I am glad that Oprah picked such an unforgettable book."},{"Title":"Night","review":"The enormity of the deeds related plainly and simply here is beyond us to comprehend. I am amazed that Wiesel survived at all, and as he says in the preface to this new translation, he feels it was pure idiot chance, not fate or destiny. He does not know why he wrote this account. He does not speak for all the dead. No one can. His only thought is that for the children of today and tomorrow, \\"he does not want his past to become their future.\\" But one feels the loss of so many thousands, one feels the hatred, the pure animal madness, the utter loss of reason in these pages, and one is left speechless, or else shrieking. Even to say \\"never again\\" is not enough to make any of this meaningful. Certainly I would have lost all faith in any kind of God if I had somehow managed to live through this horror. As it is, reading this account in itself tests one's faith. One also must say: It's a great thing that Oprah put this book before the public again, especially now when our country is moving it seems inexorably toward violent and totalitarian solutions to our problems. Here is my concluding thought: All we have that makes us human is love. That is the other side of Night."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This novel was beautifully moving and you could feel the heartache of the Author as he wrote what he had survived. i cried for him and the others that survived and those that didn't. he is quite right when he says that these atrocities should never be forgotten."},{"Title":"Night","review":"For decades Nobel Laureate Eli Wiesel has served as conscience to the world, dedicated to the idea that it is the responsibility of every human being to stand as a witness to evil in order to prevent its spread. This mission has taken Wiesel from Cambodia to Darfur, always lending his powerful words to confront the world on events to which, all too often, they would rather turn their back. In his memoir Night, Wiesel tries to make us understand the terrible repercussions of evil and brutality once unleashed.Night follows Wiesel's experience as a young pious Eastern European Jew who, along with his family, finds himself dragged into the horrors of the Nazi death machine. Without going into detail of the events he recounts, I can tell you that the book rends the reader's emotions, often bringing tears. Wiesel writes in a lilting, often poetic style that pulls one leaving the reader transfixed by his suffering. Yet we never loose sight of the fact that we are witnessing these terrible events through the eyes of a teenager.Some may be taken in by this book's short length. Yet this work requires a slow reading, for the author explores many topics requiring deep thought. What is the nature of suffering? Where is God to be found in a place so bereft of light? You may agree or disagree with the author's answers to these questions, but by his experience and the quality of his prose, they are answers that we cannot ignore. In these times where evil seems on the march and many despair, Wiesel's work stands as a beacon. Truly, its current wide reading can only raise up the conscience of our nation."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I rated this book 5 because of the attention it draws to such a sad time in our history. My parents lived through the Blitz in London and the surrounding areas. My father lied about his age and joined the British army at 15 just in time for D-Day. After that he was made a sergeant in the English army and served in Burma fighting the Japanese. His troops were one of the first's to liberate the concentration camps used by the Japanese where over 4000 troops and civilians died to build the Burma Road and the railroad to the River Kwia. What he saw has never left him, he still to this day will not discuss it, I only know from what my mother relates to me. My dad is going to be 80 and my mother is 77. If this book helps to bring to light those times and places so we don't forget with every generation then it has served it purpose...."},{"Title":"Night","review":"How do you think you would feel having everything you have grown up with taken away from you and move to a place where you are criticized and tormented because of your faith? This is what happened to Eliezar (Elie) Wiesel. Just because Elie was a Jew, he had everything taken away from him when he and his family were forced to move to a concentration camp. This book gives you a better understanding of what really happened in the camps and what the people living there went through.While reading Night you follow Elie and his dad's journey through the concentration camp and every struggle they were put through. Throughout their journey they meet many new people, and reunite with some old friend's, things like this helped give Elie and his dad hope to keep pushing forth. This story takes you through their fight getting beaten, starved, enslaved, and transported hundreds of miles from their home.During the fight to save their lives, they want to give up so many times. Everything they went through drove them closer and closer to giving up. The reason why they continued living was for each other. The book shows you that it was not only Elie and his father who wanted to die, but most of the other people too. After all the things they were going through, some people did not have the strength to go any further and would give up. Not only did the Nazis just take away their freedom but their identity, will, and drive. This book does a great job of portraying everything that went through their minds.The author Elie does a fantastic job of painting a vivid image for you while you read the book. The way it is written makes you feel like you are there with him suffering too. Elie uses bold words to keep you drawn and tuned into the book. Though this book may be very sad, it gives you a sense of hope and makes you thankful for all that you have. The next time something in your life goes wrong think of what these people had to go through, how many horrifying things they saw, and how things changed their life forever, and then remind yourself how fortunate you are."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I read the other reviews for this book and went right out to my library to check it out.

Very moving story. Good for 8th grade through adulthood."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Elie Wiesel was fifteen when he was taken from his home in Sighet. In April 1945, when he was sixteen, Wiesel was liberated from Buchenwald, a Nazi concentration camp near Weimar, in Germany. Night, the first book in a trilogy, is Wiesel's 'deposition' of what he experienced during that time. It is a harrowing, careful, terrible masterpiece, a quiet outrage of a novel that is required reading for anyone who is not only interested in the Holocaust, or in fine literature, but for anyone who is interested in living.Sighet, a small Hungarian-Romanian town, has vague ideas about the Second World War, the Germans, and the Russians. They are mostly unaware of what is happening to the Jewish people of Europe. When Moishe the Beadle, a man who 'was as awkward as a clown. His waiflike shyness made people smile.', is taken away for being a foreign Jew, the town barely gives it a thought. Upon his return, 'the joy in his eyes was gone'. Moishe pleads with his fellow townsfolk to listen. He implores them to flee, to run as far away from the encroaching German empire as possible. But, nobody listens.Soon, the Jews of Sighet are taken to Auschwitz. Wiesel and his father are separated from his mother and younger sister, Tzipora. He never saw them again.Slowly, the adolescent Wiesel comes to learn the ways of Auschwitz. If asked, he is to tell the SS officers that he is eighteen, not fifteen. You must say that you are in good health, even if you are not. Bread, when it arrives, should be eaten sparingly. If you can save some for later, do so. New shoes will be confiscated. These simple rules become his life. He learns quickly that there is no time for hope, or for dreams. When existence is boiled down to its very essence, when a swallow of water or a crust of bread becomes the most important part of the day, there can be nothing but hunger and sleep in your life. Wiesel measures time with his stomach, his entire being becomes focused around hunger.What happens to those who are not strong, or who are too young, or too old? What happens to those who talk back, or rebel, or fail to work? With calm, precise sentences, we learn that they are shot in the head, or burned in a furnace, or poisoned, or gassed. How can a fifteen year old learn such horrible things? How can anyone? Wiesel was at an age when he should be learning of death and sadness in literature and music, not inhaling the black cinders of his fellow Jews as the furnaces belched their evil smoke.We follow Wiesel as he travels with his father from Auschwitz and then to Buchenwald. Wiesel grapples with his faith, wondering how his God could permit such a thing to happen. But there is also something more, and less, that his conscience has to ponder. As his father becomes progressively weaker, as more and more men die and are discarded, he must decide whether to support his father, or to ensure his own survival. There are times when '...a thought crept into my mind: If only I couldn't find him! If only I were relieved of this responsibility, I could use all my strength to fight for my own survival, to take care only of myself...Instantly, I felt ashamed, ashamed of myself forever.'While the majority of the novel is spent with Wiesel and his father, there are times when we learn the flashes of other men's stories. We learn of a man who was forced to shovel his own father into the furnaces. We learn of another man, an old man, who hoarded some bread for his son. But his son thought he was keeping it from him, and they fought, and the old man died. Killed by his own son for a piece of bread. Was it justice then, that the son was killed by other men, desperate for food? No. It can't be. There is no justice in a concentration camp.Wiesel writes with short, simple sentences. There is nothing overly complicated in the way he writes, perhaps because the subject matter is complicated enough. There are a number of reasons why the language used was so universal. Anyone who is capable to read, can complete this work - a child could understand the words, though not the meaning. But more than that, by distilling what happened into mundane, everyday words, the experience of Auschwitz and the concentration camps becomes something that we can all, in some way, understand. Flowery language and cumbrous metaphor would have diluted the impact of the words, as readers struggled to understand the meaning behind the prose. But this way, the clean simplicity of the text allows it to be understood in clear, defined terms. There can be no mistaking the horror of what has happened. There can be no mistaking the impossible sadness.Wiesel's novel stands as a chronicle of a terrible time in the history of man. With a steady hand and clear vision, Wiesel has portrayed the terrors of the Holocaust in a manner that does not seek to judge, but to teach. As a youth desperate to understand, Wiesel uses the text to contemplate what it is that would allow such an event to occur. Where in man lies the core that created Auschwitz, Buchenwald, furnaces and mass graves? Wiesel doesn't - cannot - give an answer, but what he has given us is a measured, reasoned plea that we should not forget.From his Nobel Peace Prize lecture, in 1986: 'We must take sides. Neutrality helps the oppressor, never the victim. Silence encourages the tormentor, never the tormented.' The great sadness of World War II was that we knew, but did nothing. We knew, but remained neutral. We knew, but chose to ignore. There is no excuse grand enough for such behaviour, and it is with this book that Wiesel condemns those who looked away. We must face what darkness emerges from the depths of men, we must face it and we must defeat it, lest another Auschwitz - or worse - occur. It is our duty, and our responsibility."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Read it. Everyone in this universe should read it.

I highly recommend this book - I believe if we do not learn from history, we are destined to repeat it. I believe humanism is re-defining morality in America, just as it did in Germany. I believe we must comprehend how political correctness is robbing us of our freedom of speech. This book shows the end result.Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. (1929 - 1968) said:&#34;We should never forget that everything Adolf Hitler did in Germany was 'legal' and everything the Hungarian freedom fighters did in Hungary was 'illegal'.&#34;There comes a time, when silence becomes betrayal. &#34;The day we see truth and cease to speak is the day we begin to die.&#34;"},{"Title":"Night","review":"My review will be short; frankly I feel a bit foolish appending any comments at all to Mr. Weisel's memoir of his time spent in the concentration camps at Auschwitz and Buchenwald. My main reason for reviewing at all is simply to add another voice to those who have already praised the book as austere and powerful, and hoping thereby to help bring the book to the attention of an even wider audience.One point I am surprised by is the fact that some reviewers have chastised the book for its 'pointlessness'. They seemed to have been expecting a summation at the end which would impose an structure on Mr. Wiesel's experience. It seems to me that the pointlessness is entirely the point. So be forwarned, Mr. Wiesel's story in this volume will end upbruptly, and will not provide any catharsis. And I believe it deserves to be read not in spite of that uncomforting thought, but because of it."},{"Title":"Night","review":"When I see people presuming to rate and criticize Night by Elie Wiesel, I think of what I read in a short review on the back cover of the edition I had.

It's amazing how little students tend to know about the Holocaust in today's day and age, and watching them go from novices who state that they would simply fight off the Nazi's to understanding the enormity of the Holocaust, the dehumanization, and atrocity of WWII, is amazing.Of course, Night is a heartbreaking tale that always leaves me an emotional wreck. It's very hard to fathom that people could really do such horrible things to each other, and my generation is very lucky to have never experienced anything like it. But this also makes our younger generations very nave and confused when it comes to understanding what really happened in the Holocaust, why it went on for so long, and why we study it in school. We truly can never allow future generations to forget, especially as survivors are now few and far between, and soon, firsthand accounts will be no more.I've found that this novel really touches those who read it, even the most reluctant student. Though they may not admit it aloud, the story has a way of opening up the reader to the atrocities, and it explains what happened in such a way that it's impossible not to connect to it. Wiesel is an amazing, exceptionally strong person, having survived such an ordeal, and his message to never forget it plainly and aptly stated. With its vivid descriptions and short, pointed sentences, Wiesel does a phenomenal job not only telling his story, but showing it to all who read it, allowing them to experience it through his words as well."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Night by Elie WieselI have had Night sitting on my shelf for years. My mom bought it for me and read it right away. I stuck it on the shelf and forgot about it. Despite being Jewish, I've never been a fan of Holocaust literature, whether fiction or non-fiction. It's not that I'm not interested in learning about it. I definitely am. It's a part of my history and being informed is the way only I can inform others and explain away the misconceptions that people have about that period in history. Everything I know about the Holocaust is self-taught, because it was only glossed over in the history classes that I took. So for me, anything I read about it is in a capacity of educating myself.Night takes us through Mr. Wiesel's time in Buchenwald and Aucshwitz, during World War II. His simplistic writing style takes us through major events in such a way that we feel as if we are there. The simple language is deceiving, because usually that means something is easy to read, but in this case, it's not. The horrors he experienced are such that it makes hell seem like a walk in the park. Imagine being crammed in a train with hundreds of other people, not knowing where your next meal, if you can call it that, is going to come from. Imagine being surrounded by the dead and dying and not being able to give people a proper burial. He had no idea what happened to his mother and sister after they were separated.Night is the first in a trilogy that continues with Dawn and ends with Day. Wiesel has called these last two transition books. He has said \\"In Night, I wanted to show the end, the finality of the event. Everything came to an end - man, history, literature, religion, G-d. There was nothing left. And yet we begin again with night.\\" I haven't decided yet if I will read the remaining two in the series. If I do, it will not be right now. Reading Night was difficult. I only read a few pages at a time, partially because I couldn't handle it and partially because I needed time to think between sections. It's a lot to take in all at once.The entire time I was reading it, I had Matisyahu's song, One Day, running through my head. If you haven't heard the song, stop now and listen to it.Okay. Now that you've listened to it, you can probably see why I had that song running through my head. I firmly believe Night should be required reading for everyone.5 out of 5 stars.Copy obtained from my personal library."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Just thinking of people in the modern age, who might have endured suffering, pain and agony and understandably may have been terrible, unspeakable, unthinkable, yet who still have had the opportunity to read this book, have a computer with internet connection and then type up and post a review of it...yet can still critique writing style and include a dismissiveness based on that?That leaves me speechless but reaffirms my observation that many of those who have not really suffered the unimaginable, yet have such access, continue to be the ones to negatively or poorly rate a work of personal, agonizing minimalism which contains such profound revelations and truth.I stopped to reread \\"Night\\" this week, and it places in great perspective whatever mundane pain, thought or complaint I might have in life right now, in general. Don't get me wrong, it doesn't negate anyone's current situation, but it does give you a wider range in which to observe your own life.I am a student of WW2 and Holocaust literature and history. I am also a person who was born and spent much time in Germany interacting with and interviewing those who remember firsthand, or those who were 1st gen survivors or ones who directly remember on a variety factors: NOT just because their parents might have been involved, but those who survived and endured the \\"survivors guilt\\" that maybe they shouldn't have.One of the things I've noted is that, because the events have replayed to the level of infinity in their minds, sometimes when they recount, it does sometimes come across as bloodless, or too cool. This is part of the psychological mechanisms of the brain which enact to protect that person. Sometimes the level of self-absorption and intentness of having some kind of entertainment from works of horrific history, or a desire to learn of ugly history but not really wishing to \\"know\\" of it, actually horrifies me."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I want to thank Mr. Weisel for writing this book and sharing his experience.

What happens to humanity when the insanity of war takes hold?I avoided reading this book as I knew I would be left with a feeling of dismay. However, I did read it as I felt rather obligated to. I can't say I enjoyed it, but it isn't a book meant to be enjoyed. The lesson....we must remember. We must not close our eyes in complacency.

This time, I just got angry.We talk about never allowing this kind of thing to happen again....and yet it does, time after time ...a different ethnic group, a different part of the world. Chasms between government actions and the desires of its people have never been deeper. The type of government a country has , whether Republic, Theocracy, Monarcy (Absolute or Constitutional) or other, has little or nothing to do with HOW power is acquired, used and abused. Corruption has never been more visible.By now, one would think we would have made huge advancements from the ugliness of this side of mankind. Read any newspaper or watch any news program and you will note that we have not made much progress at all.Dr. Wiesel is a shining example of what human beings CAN be.

Unfortunately, it was a extremely sad and disturbing story but I really think it made me realize more so than ever how grateful I should be for the things that God has given me in this life.

The bottom line is that we are all human beings created by a much greater force than us lowly people!

I read this one because I wanted to know how a person could go through it, how he would have to adapt himself, make himeself numb into a human robot, seeing nothing, feeling nothing.Elie Wiesel was far from the automaton I had imagined a person would have to become to live in such conditions. He isn't overly emotional. he dosen't try to make the situations seem pathetic, trying to draw the readers' sympathy. It was an honest account of the disbelief and horror he experienced at all that he saw and experienced around him.The struggle for faith , to believe in a reason to live, is one he has put across well.The account of the experiences was worse than I expected. Many times I had to close my eyes and imagine the horror, the extremity of suffering and the struggle for survival.

It is so horrible that it is beyond the human perception.A great book, worth reading, worth remembering."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I thought this was a very factual account of Mr. Wiesel's early life. Not a fun read by any means but a necessary one. In some ways it was dry in the sense that he gave you the facts without much emotion but looking back on it I appreciate that he wasn't trying to work up a frenzy of emotion. He simply gave his account of the horrific things that occurred.I was at the dental office a few weeks ago reading a book and the receptionist asked if I had any recommendations for books that were true. I suggested this book saying it was a rather short book about the holocaust... her response... \\"what is the holocaust?\\". Unbelievable but true. She was in her late 30's. I think this book should be required reading in schools so no one else asks such a question."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Night is an autobiographical book by Elie Wiesel based on his experience, as a young Jew, of being deported from the village of Sighet in Transylvania to the German death camp at Auschwitz, and later, to the concentration camp at Buchenwald.Wiesel was 17 years old when Buchenwald was liberated on April 11, 1945 by the Sixth Armored Division of the U.S. Third Army. Having lost his faith in God and humanity, he kept his story to himself for ten years, and contemplated suicide, but during a meeting in Paris in May 1955, Franois Mauriac, the French novelist and Nobel laureate, persuaded Wiesel to start writing. Forty-five years later, Night ranks alongside Primo Levi's If This is a Man and Anne Frank's The Diary of a Young Girl as one of the bedrocks of Holocaust literature, and possibly its most powerful description of humiliation and despair.The interlocking themes of Night are what Wiesel saw as the death of God and mankind in the concentration camps, reflected in the inversion of the father-child relationship as Wiesel's father declines to a helpless state and the teenager becomes his increasingly resentful caregiver. \\"If only I could get rid of this dead weight, so that I could use all my strength to struggle for my own survival, and only worry about myself. Immediately I felt ashamed of myself, ashamed forever.\\" (101)Wiesel employs a sparse and fragmented narrative structure, with frequent shifts in point of view, a fusing of fact and fiction, lending the structure of Jewish folklore to that of the modern novel. (Fine 1982:7) \\"It is the style of the chroniclers of the ghettos,\\" writes Wiesel, \\"where everything had to be said swiftly, with one breath. You never knew when the enemy might kick in the door, sweeping us away into nothingness.\\" (Wiesel 1996:321)In telling his story, Wiesel sees himself as seeking redemption, reflecting the importance Judaism attaches to the power of the word. (Fine 1982:29) \\"In Night, I wanted to show the end, the finality of the event. Everything came to an end -- man, history, literature, religion, God. There was nothing left. And yet we begin again with Night.

It is great for all genres of readers. It gives you the setting of what it is like to actually live through this tragedy, without scaring you so much that you need to put the book down and take a breather. The book is wonderfully written and puts you right in the heart of the holocaust. The more and more you read you have to keep reminding yourself that this is real, this book is not fiction, or exaggerated the least bit. It is a window into the society of life that was inside the camps.Everyday is an effort for survival, not to mention food, water, or any of the necessities. It is horrible to think that MILLIONS of people had to go through this. After reading this book it makes you take less things for granite knowing how easily everyday things were stripped away from Elie. His powerful message of survival is clearly put forward throughout the whole book and it makes you think of how much you have."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I would describe this book as a very blunt, simple portrayal of the suffering and mistreatment that went on in the Jewish concentration camps. It is obvious that this book was not meant to be a dramatic story of survival. Elie Wiesel did a brilliant job of showing the true pain and suffering that went on in the camps without exaggeration. He kept the language and storyline simple, making it easy to follow. The substance given defines the experience, without extra and unneeded details. It does not show hate or give revenge to the suppressors. The novel was not written for money or even to provide entertainment for its readers, but to send a message to the world. It shows the kind of racism and extreme genocide that went on, in hope that it will never have to be experienced by any other group or person ever again.I liked this book, and I found it to be sickeningly fascinating. Once I picked it up, like watching a scary movie, I found it impossible to put down, though at many parts I wanted to, because unlike most scary movies, the suffering that went on in this novel actually happened. I feel as though the book although simple, was well written for its purpose. If Elie Wiesel had been planning to write the book for more of an entertainment purpose, to write a good dramatic story that would really emotionalize his audience, I think he could have involved himself and his own feelings more. The material he had to work with had the potential to make a real heartfelt and rich novel and he seemed to almost stop short of what the novel could have been. After waiting ten years to write it he seems to have left out gaps. Though the story is generally about him and his own personal experience, throughout it he seems to stay dissociated from his experiences. Since his intention was to get out the truth of what really happened, without his own judgement and pain getting in the way, I think it worked in this sense to write the story from his characters point of view, rather than his own. It is almost like a history book, but there is much more too it. This was a wonderfully written and depressing story that will stay with you years after reading it."},{"Title":"Night","review":"The risk inherent in writing about the Holocaust is that today's readers have a hard time believing it. Those of us who did not experience the horrors of living in a Nazi death camp cannot begin to understand what it was like. Battered women and severely abused children living today, trapped in circumstances they cannot escape, may come close.But most of us have no frame of reference. Nothing in our experience even remotely compares.This \\"I can't believe it\\" mentality was also common among non-Jewish civilians who lived in Germany during the Third Reich--when Adolf Hitler was in power (1933-1945).Even as \\"night\\" descended on Wiesel's little town--Sighet, Transylvania (Hungary)--the Jewish people could not believe what was happening. Moishe the Beadle was \\"deported\\" by the Hungarian police, crammed into a cattle car and taken to a forest in Poland to be executed with other Jews. Incredibly, Moishe escaped and returned to Sighet with his story:\\"The train had stopped. The Jews were ordered to get off and onto waiting trucks. The trucks headed toward a forest. There everybody was ordered to get out. They were forced to dig huge trenches. When they had finished their work, the men from the Gestapo began theirs. Without passion or haste, they shot their prisoners, who were forced to approach the trench one by one and offer their necks. . . .\\"Moishe escaped by a miracle. He was wounded in the leg and left for dead. In Sighet, he went from house to house, telling his story, but the people refused to listen. Even the young Elie Wiesel did not believe him.The denial continued. In Jewish families about to be transported to Auschwitz, \\"the women were boiling eggs, roasting meat, preparing cakes, sewing backpacks.\\"Wiesel does not challenge us to comprehend the gas chamber deaths of his mother and little sister Tzipora. Instead, he writes what we can grasp: \\"Tzipora was holding Mother's hand. I saw them walking farther and farther away; Mother was stroking my sister's blond hair as if to protect her. And I walked on with my father, with the men. I didn't know that this was the moment in time and the place where I was leaving my mother and Tzipora forever.\\"Wiesel describes with remarkable restraint a vicious beating he receives from a Kapo:I felt the sweat running down my back.\\"A-7713!\\"I stepped forward.\\"A crate!\\" he ordered.They brought a crate.\\"Lie down on it! On your belly!\\"I obeyed.I no longer felt anything except the lashes of the whip.\\"One!. . . Two!. . .\\" he was counting.He took his time between lashes. Only the first really hurt. I heard him count.\\"Ten. . .eleven!. . .\\"His voice was calm and reached me as through a thick wall.\\"Twenty-three. . .\\"Two more, I thought, half unconscious.The Kapo was waiting.\\"Twenty-four. . .twenty five!\\"It was over. . . .\\"Listen to me, you son of a swine!\\" said Idek coldly. \\"So much for your curiosity. You shall receive five times more if you dare tell anyone what you saw! Understood?\\"I nodded, once, ten times, endlessly. As if my head had decided to say yes for all eternity.Elie Wiesel's magnificent NIGHT bridges that enormous gulf between \\"I can't believe it\\" and the mind-numbing, horrific sinking in of the realization of \\"Oh, dear God, this really happened.\\" His account is straightforward, almost matter-of-fact, with a minimum of frenzy, inordinate dwelling on flames of infernos, prolonged death throes, or metaphysical discourses about evil.He does talk about his relationship with God throughout the ordeal. And of course about his father, who was with him in Auschwitz and Buchenwald.Why did Wiesel write this book? He tells us:\\"There are those who tell me that I survived in order to write this text. I am not convinced. I don't know how I survived; I was weak, rather shy; I did nothing to save myself. A miracle? Certainly not. If heaven could or would perform a miracle for me, why not for others more deserving than myself? It was nothing more than chance. However, having survived, I needed to give some meaning to my survival. . . .\\"In retrospect I must confess that I do not know, or no longer know, what I wanted to achieve with my words. I only know that without this testimony, my life as a writer--or my life, period--would not have become what it is: that of a witness who believes he has a moral obligation to try to prevent the enemy from enjoying one last victory by allowing his crimes to be erased from human memory. . . .\\"I am grateful for this book and for Marion Wiesel's excellent and sensitive translation of her husband's memoir. Some great literature has come out of the Holocaust. In my opinion, Elie Wiesel's NIGHT is the best book, and certainly one of the most deeply moving, among these works.Arlene Sanders"},{"Title":"Night","review":"I read a lot of books and just re-read this one for about the 5th time. IMHO, the 2 most poignant books that we have about the Holocaust are this one and Anne Frank: The Diary of a Young Girl. Interestingly enough, both were written from a child's perspective. If I were teaching a course on contemporary history on the subject of the Holocaust, these are the 2 books that I'd assign to be read.Whenever I've read this book (and it usually only takes an hour or 2 to finish), I find myself experiencing several profound emotions: anger, heartbreak, sadness, joy at Elie's liberation and a strong feeling of empowerment from the triumph of the human spirit against nearly impossible oddsThe number of Holocaust survivors, a small minority to begin with, is dwindling every day. Thankfully, Mr. Weisel and others have left a great gift so that future generations will always remember what happened to those unfortunate enough to be trapped in the clutches of a monstrous regime.Not only do I recommend this book highly, I'd go further to say that if you don't know much about the Holocaust, you're doing yourself a disservice in not reading it."},{"Title":"Night","review":"My English 10 honors class was assigned to read this book a couple weeks ago. It is shorter than all the other novels we have read, but the most powerful one in my opinion. This a a non-fiction story where Elie Wiesel talks about his time in concentration and death camps during the Holocaust. This book is a must read. It isn't long at all, around 80 pages in fact, but it really makes you think about life and what the Jewish people went through.Elie Wiesel and his family are from little town Sighet, Transylvania. Elie, the voice of the books, starts of describe Moshe the Beadle, who was this kind and gentle soul that everyone liked. He takes care of the town's synagogue at night, offered others comfort and found great happiness in his religion. Now, by this time it is the start of WWII. Moshe the Beadle, before anyone else in the town, was taken away first because he is a foreign Jew (meaning he was a Jew from a different country,) but he manages to escape and comes back months later. Instead of the once happy person he was, he has become a person filled with sorrow. He tries telling the town the horrors he saw at the camps, but no one dare believes him. They all think he's gone crazy.However, they learn that wasn't the case. The Nazi's quickly entered the town and strip the Jews of their laws and they are soon placed into Ghettos. Eventually, they are all hauled up into the little trains and are taken away to the concentration camps. When they get to Auschwitz, Elie's mother and his sisters are almost immediately sent to be burned to death. Elie lies about his age (now 15) to be able to stay with his father. Through the course of the many, many months of going to different concentration camps, they must face selection (where the Nazi doctor determine who lived and who died,) being malnourished, very bad health, and so many other unimaginable things.There were a couple things that just really stood out to me. The first was when Elie -who was in the little hospital ward at the time for an injured foot- and his father made the choice to go with the others to the next concentration camp instead of staying with the people in the hospital who were too ill to move. Elie and his father thought they would be killed if they had stay. They learn that those who had stayed behind had been liberated. That just broke my heart. Of course, how were they supposed to know that. Another thing that stood out to me was when Elie loses faith in his religion. With all that is going on, Elie can't believe that his God could let something like this occur.Reading through his experiences at the concentration camps create so many feelings at once. Mostly heartache for him and his family and for what MILLIONS of people had to endured during the Holocaust. You find out that one of the reasons the book is called Night is because that is the time when Elie and all the others would be forced to get up and go to the next camp, and it is one of the things he remembers most."},{"Title":"Night","review":"\\"Night\\" is Elie Wiesel's account of his time with the Nazis, from seeing them arrive in his small town in Hungary to being liberated from a concentration camp, standing in front of a mirror wondering who the person looking back at him is.The beginning of the book is fascinating as most people at the time didn't believe the Nazis were out to get them all. This is 1943. One of the townsfolk is taken by the Nazis yet escapes and makes it back to the town with horror stories of the camps yet nobody wants to believe him so he is ignored. The Jews throughout are always saying to themselves that things will get better, God will protect them, the Allies are coming, and crushingly at every turn they are proved wrong. It's that feeling of hope that's so devastating to read about, the reader knowing what's coming to them all.Elie and his family are taken and sent to Auschwitz. He's separated from his mother and sisters but is happy to be with his father. He never sees his mother or sisters again.The camps are punishing. Hard work coupled with little to no food yet somehow he survives. In one strange scene, his father and himself along with 98 others are moved from one camp to another. While working in a factory he sees a Polish officer working for the Nazis with a Polish girl at the back of a factory - he realises the Polish officer has moved 100 prisoners just to be with the girl. Elie laughs at this and the officer sees him. Elie is punished by being whipped 25 times. The juxtaposition of love and hate in one scene is powerful.Strange moments like that fill the slim volume - 115 pages - such as during an air raid, a cauldron of soup is unattended in the middle of a yard. Scores of prisoners' eyes stare hungrily at the cauldron but nobody moves until one man decides to crawl over. When he reaches the cauldron and stands up and stares at the abundance of food after months of starving - and screams. Alerted, the SS shoot him and he dies face first in the soup.The most powerful moments come in the closing months of WW2. The camps are evacuated and the prisoners are destined to camps closer to Berlin. Elie's father is desperately ill and yet the SS force all the prisoners aboard a train ride with no food or water. The situation is so bad that out of the 100 prisoners in Elie's carriage, only 12 survive. Then the night march begins. The night march through the snow was the most shocking part of the book. Macabre images of skeletal figures shuffling through snow, eating snow to stay alive, huddling amongst corpses to stay alive, as if using duvets made of human remains. Then Elie sees a friend, another teenager, who brought his violin with him. During the night he hears a fragment of Tchaikovsky and then silence. In the morning his friend is dead. Shortly after arriving in camp his father contracts dysentry and then dies. Months pass and then the camp is liberated. There isn't much to read here as Elie says he felt nothing and remembered nothing during those months.I urge anyone and everyone to read this book. It isn't life changing but it is life affirming and an absolutely devastating read. A true classic of world literature."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This is a deeply moving autobiographical account of the authors survival as a teenager in the Nazi death camps of WWII. Young Wiesel was passionately dedicated to telling his story so that the world would never forget what inhumanity humans can inflict on one another. It is important from an historical perspective, but also from a human one. This is so powerful and I will never forget his story."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I have read this book with my 8th graders for 3 years. They always like thebook and feel they really have a better understanding of the holocaust. Itis real, gritty, and captivating. I am so glad Elie had the courage to write about his ordeal."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Elie Wiesel's true story of his Holocaust experiences is undoubtedly a profound book. It is a must-read for anyone, especially those with an interest in history. Almost everyone will be impacted by Wiesel's narrative: certain sections have the effect of bringing tears to your eyes while others force you to ponder universal questions. This was required reading for me in high school, and it was one of the few assigned books I actually enjoyed. Is it sad? Yes, but it is well worth it and I think that readers will grow from the experience of reading this selection."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Elie Wiesel has not forgotten and through this text he ensures that the rest of us knows what happened - and do not dare to forget. Written in simple prose within a thin volume, \\"Night\\" speaks as loudly now for the murdered millions as it did when first published more than 50 years ago. It's a memoir but so much more than a recounting of a single life. The writer is subtle and economic in this tight history of the largest documented mass murder. By limiting full graphic depictions and allowing the imagination to fill in the gaps of conditions in the concentration camps, the reader counts and mourns Wiesel's family and neighbors as if they were our own. So well does he draw us into the scenes that while reading \\"Night\\" we smell the crematorium's smoke and feel its heat. Weisel's Noble Peace Prize acceptance speech is at the end of this new translation of \\"Night.\\" Delivered in 1986, it is the perfect anchor to book. The speech addresses the injustices worldwide that followed the Holocaust and warns against allowing the holocausts that inevitably have come to pass between 1986 and now. \\"Night\\" is being read in many colleges. It should be required reading in high schools. Generations across the world should not be allowed to forget."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Some books, it seems, are almost beyond mere review. NIGHT is about Elie Wiesel's time in Nazi concentration camps. Really, what can one add? The description alone says an awful lot. So let us not focus on subject and instead focus on readability.NIGHT is very readable. It is not, however, a scholarly study. Many other books provide much better detail and history of the Nazi camps designed either to exterminate undesirables outright or, alternatively, work them to death. NIGHT, rather than being scholarly, is personal. It does not bring the concentration camps to life. It brings Elie Wiesel to life as he lived it in those camps and, more ominously, the life he led before them.That life before heading to the extermination camps is of equal importance to the life in the camps itself. A basic yet terrifying rule of totalitarian ideologies and the political movements that bring them to fruition is that they do not advertise the barbaric methods that will ultimately be employed in order to achieve their ideological goals. Concentration camps were such extreme institutions that, even given the generations of anti-semitism, they seemed beyond belief until it was much too late. Wiesel and his family (and others in his village) were indeed warned as to what was awaiting them. Yet the stories were so far out there, so incomprehensible, that they were scoffed at. That is perhaps the most important lesson of the book.At a little over 100 pages, NIGHT is actually a bit skimpy in its descriptions. Yet it provides enough. It provides the big pictures - endless work, ravenous hunger, brutality of the guards and other prisoners and, most distressing, the slipping away of one's own humanity as survival becomes so precarious that one's concerns even for loved ones slips away in the face of self-preservation.Part memorial, part warning, NIGHT was Wiesel's first book. It could have been his last and his reputation would still be significant. It is a dark but worthwhile read about a very dark time."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Having read a number of holocaust memiors before, I knew Wiesel's night would be a difficult but important read to further deepen my knowledge of these events we must never forget. He manages to give a poignant and concise account of his experience, incorporating objective views of what occurs around him, which includes the saga of his father's time in the concentration camp with him. His tale of survival is nothing short of inspirational and I was moved by how strong he was not only to go through all he details, but to be able to put it all on paper in such a compelling way.If you are interested in more riveting accounts of the holocaust, Sala's Gift provides a detailed account of a woman's struggle to survive through the brutality which occurred."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I couldn't put it down. You should send a complimentary copy to Mel Gibsonb"},{"Title":"Night","review":"I recently picked up this book and The Shortest Day and they have both been two of my favorite and most meaningful books I have ever read. I like these types of books because they focus on crucial history that many people in today's world do not have enough knowledge of. While one honors the sacrifices made by the soldiers fighting on D-Day, this one focuses on a teenager's recollection of living through the Holocaust. This is truly a masterpiece and deserves all the attention it has gotten. You are immediately drawn into the book and no one has any reason to feel guilty about surviving something that many didn't. My father survived WWII and even today feels he doesn't deserve to be living and it breaks my heart because these are the people who deserve living more than any of us. Night is a perfect example of a work of literature that gives readers the most detailed account of what it was like being a victim in the Holocaust and I praise Wiesel for creating this gift that I hope will be read for generations to come!"},{"Title":"Night","review":"Wiesel's powerful tale is that much more effective for its harsh glare of reality. And yet, he could have been much more graphic, without going over the top. His descriptions are inescapably matter-of-fact, sheltered within a lurid universe. Wiesel lives in a society gone mad with a terrifying hubris that nurtures mass murder. What can one say about a culture that averts its gaze while gassing millions of \\"undesirable\\" groups? Wiesel marches steadfastly through layers of degridation, humiliation and becomes a non-person. The world should read this and behold a pattern of life to avoid. Night can and must make all of us better people.Reading about the Holocaust is difficult at best. We cringe in the terror of mankind's worst events. Wiesel's timeless, terrifying memories will now always be with us. But, will the memories change us? Perhaps our best hope is that Holocaust readers will become incerasingly aware of the fact that genocide continues in the present. As if we learned nothing from the Holocaust, we were forced to see it again in Cambodia, Rawanda and Darfur. Perhaps more needs to be done to educate young people about the horrors of genicide, least Wiesel's tragedy go unnoticed. That would be the greatest tragedy of all.Chuck (Ohio)"},{"Title":"Night","review":"This book is well written. I understand that it is a true story and has been revised for a clearer interpretation. However, too much has been cut from the story. It's like an overview. Not much detail or substance."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I would have never read this if it hadn't been on Oprah's list, not to mention---it being a very short book.Eli Wiesel does a spectacular first-person account of what it was like to experience the Holocaust, when he was a young child.This is essentially the story of a father and son, set against the backdrop of the evil concentration camps.The story begins in the Jewish Ghettos, and the Jews thinking that everything will be ok, that the Germans won't really go that far. Of course, Kristellnacht happens (the night the Nazi's burned down the synagogues). And the Jews' worst nightmares come true.What's interesting is the rather dispassionate, almost clinical, emotion-less way Wiesel writes about some of the most evil atrocities. It's almost like he has a third eye and is witnessing the horror from above.In other words, there is not much melodrama, or cloying-sentimental-emotion. With this much atrocity and evil, talk is cheap, I guess. And, cheap sentiment would only trivialize the horror. The cold, clinical way Wiesel describes the gruesome-ness seems to make it all the more horrific, actually.Again, the emphasis is on the father and son relationship during all this, and what does it mean for a son to watch his own father's rapid mortality (much too soon) set against the back-drop of these atrocities. Should the son save himself?, or honor his father? Can anyone be saved?\\"Night\\" asks so many interesting questions, not the least of which....why this whole thing happened in the first place, and what it means to be a survivor.You will never be the same after reading Eli Wiesel's \\"Night\\"."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Elie Wiesel was a victim of the attempted extermination of the \\"Jewish Race\\" by the Nazi German State under the leadership of Adolf Hitler.Adolf Hitler actually had a bigger plan than the extinction of the \\"Jewish Race.\\" His larger goal was to eventually rid the world of all inferior breeds and types of people - weather they were members of races or not. He was going to purify humankind of all of its miscreants. The Jews were simply first. He explains these goals in his book Mein Kampf.It always amazes me that here in the United States there has only been one political party that has ever been outlawed - the Communist Party. As far as I know even today, you can be a member of the Nazi Party but not a member of a Communist Party.In principle and theory the Nazi Party advocates the extermination of all inferior peoples for the eventual goal of the purification of the species.The Communist Party in principle and theory (despite the leadership of many misguided brutes and dictators and murderers) has advocated fair treatment for the poor and working class.In the United States we have outlawed the Communist Party but not the Nazi Party.Harry Truman in one of his memoirs states that in his opinion Communism was a worse philosophy than Nazism.To say the least I'm confused.But \\"Night\\" by Elie Wiesel is not a book about Nazism or Communism. It is a book about people and the human race.The copy of \\"Night\\" that I have was previously owned. And the original owner has written several of his comments or questions in the margins.On page four he writes; Why would you allow yourself to be shipped off? On page seven he writes: Total denial of worsening conditions by the Jews. On page 27 he writes; So many Jews and so few SS. Why don't the Jews just take over? On page 37 he writes: A psychological feeling of depression controlled the Jews. He has other comments but they get fewer and fewer as the book goes on.What do you think about these questions?I wonder why this last reader is questioning the behavior of the Jews and not the behavior of the Germans.There is not one question written in the margins of this little book asking how the German people could do such a thing to any group of people.Like the battered housewife, everyone asks; Why did you stay with him? Why did you allow him to treat you so?No one asks: What was wrong with this man?Is it because we as human beings are so conditioned to abuse and torture and mistreatment in this life that we see nothing unusual about the abuser?And this brings us to Mr. Elie Wiesel's constant refrain throughout this book; \`Where is God? Where is He? Where can He be now?'As a philosophical student of the classical problem of the existence or non-existence of God, I find this argument basic. This is the moral argument against the existence of God - How can a moral God create an immoral world?Leibniz said that because God is good and moral - this is the best of all possible worlds. It must be. God can not make mistakes.Voltaire wrote Candide as the disbelievers' response to Leibniz.The believer will say that the evil of the Holocaust was not God's evil but the evil of man - it was created by the German people. This was human evil not Divine evil - as if human nature could somehow be separated from a Divine creation.Once again we see the victim getting the blame while the abuser is exonerated.This seems to be the human condition.To continue with this philosophy of \\"beating up on the victim,\\" I suppose that the non-believer could say to the believer: Why my friend do you chose to believe in an abusive God?Richard Edward Noble - The Hobo Philosopher - Author of:Mein Kampf - An Analysis of Book One"},{"Title":"Night","review":"An agonizing contribution to the first-person testimonies of the Holocaust. The author's despair and hopelessness are deeply touching, and one can hardly bear to read about some of man's inhumanity to man (and woman and child). Wiesel asks, \\"How could God allow such suffering?\\" My guess is that most of those who lived through the same experiences must have had similar questions. I found myself sorrowing, and carrying a form of depression around with me long after I read this book. For me, the title was appropriate, as I felt dark and anguished while reading it. Not recommended for youth who are still struggling with emotional ups and downs.

It sounded as if I was there. The story was very adequate, accurate, and appropriate because the information was from the author, Elie Wiesel, and he satisfied me. When I finished, tears came to my eyes and the story made me believe the subject. The story does relate to the topic because the is scary and the parts that I read in the story were realistic, scary, and sad. Night is a young Jewish boy who had to be the witness of the death of his own family, the death of his own innocence, and, quite sadly, the death of his God.

Wiesel delves into your soul with this dark, engaging, necessary autobiography."},{"Title":"Night","review":"One of the main circumstances that made the Holocaust possible and still fuels the doubters that question whether it happened is that it is so unbelievable. The idea that a modern nation would develop the policy to simply exterminate an entire race of people was inconceivable before it happened. When the Jews of Wiesel's hometown of Sighet were told that the Nazis were killing all Jews, they reacted with disbelief. This was not just simply denial; there were many logical reasons to believe that it was just a vicious rumor. They could think of no reason why the Germans would kill off a valuable human asset, one that could aid them in their battle with their enemies.Unfortunately, as any intelligent person now understands, it was a brutal reality. Wiesel was a teenager when he and his Jewish neighbors were rounded up and taken to Auschwitz. Their lives immediately changed from one of neighborly assistance to one of every person for themselves, where the most precious item was food. Like so many other people, Wiesel was willing to barter everything he had, including the golden crown on his tooth, for more food. Children beat their own parents in the struggle for food and the most common thought when someone died was concerning whether they could get their food ration. Death was with them constantly; people lived for one day at a time.As a student of history, I know that the Holocaust took place, yet there are times when I find it difficult to fathom. The idea that people, including children, could be tossed into fires like old newspapers and that assembly line tactics would be invented to kill people is a difficult one to accept. My daughter read this book in her high school language arts class and she recommended that I read it. After doing so, I am happy that it is part of the reading curriculum, as it is a story that must never be forgotten. While this will not guarantee that it will never happen again, it will reduce the chances."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This was an amazing book. Anyone wanting to study WW2 and or just the Holocaust, this is the book to read. I rate it right up there with the Diary of Anne Frank. It is an amazing story that pulls you so you can't put it down!"},{"Title":"Night","review":"There was obviously no joy for Elie Wiesel in writing this grisly memoir of life in a concentration camp. These are not moments to savor, to cherish, to grinningly share with the grandchildren. The darkest period of human history is recounted with no sugar coating; laid out stark and cold so that all of humanity can bear witness.To find a reason to carry on when your world is systematically stripped bare and your soul is skewered without explanation is a challenge for even the greatest of heroes. However, Wiesel offers himself up not as a hero but rather as a subject of self-excoriation, examining the flaws of charcter that separate mice from men even in times such as those depicted. The keen observation of a teenager in the maws of death; its perfect reflection manifested in print from the perspective of later age; and the tragic but poignant description of the bonds between father and son were all reasons I could not put this book down. Wiesel reminds us with poetic gravitas of all the reasons why a nightmare such as Nazi Germany must never happen again."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I learned four things from this book. First; people are capable of doing the most horrific of deeds to each other. I seriously hope I would never do those types of things; but I have never been put in that type of situation. Second; other people are able to allow these things to happen without intervening. This is trickier, because it happens all of the time; we know bad things happen far away and feel others will take care of it. How would I react if it were happening in my own community? Third; we have a hard time accepting extremely bad news. The Jewish community had first hand accounts of the atrocities being committed, but didn't believe them. I've always wanted to believe the best and am not sure I would have acted any differently than the majority of the Jews from his little town. Fourth; some people are capable of surviving the most horrific and trying things. I'm not sure I would have been one of the survivors; it would have been easy to just give up and die. I'm so very glad that there were survivors to tell the story.It is very interesting to see different reactions to horrible suffering as seen in the Holocaust. Wiesel documents his loss of faith in God; which would be easy to understand. As a contrast; I would recommend Victor Frankl'sMan's Search for Meaning; which documents another survivor and how he dealt with the horrors around him.This short book is a must read. It got me thinking."},{"Title":"Night","review":"In this true account of a man who has lived trough one of history's biggest atrocity, you'll find a boy facing a cold world. Forced to grow up much too fast, he becomes a man, who has to ask the important questions and has to live with the answers no matter how vague and how inconclusive. I don't know how he still believes in God."},{"Title":"Night","review":"The beauty of this book lies in Elie Wiesel's ability to turn everything we know inside-out. He succeeds in taking something so extraordinary large as the Holocaust, and transforming it into something intimate and extremely personal through his restrained voice.Through his eyes, in equal turns subjective and dispassionate, the banal becomes terrifying, the terrifying becomes everyday\\"normal\\". In a heartbeat, hope gives way to despair, but despair just as quickly can give way to hope. Wiesel's world inside the concentration camps is a world gone mad, that he manages to contain in a strange sanity that helps us, the reader, grasp and understand a small bit of what he and others experienced in Nazi Germany.Best of all, Wiesel's restrained voice makes this book suitable for a mature, young adult reader. The story is terrifying, but it is not told with the intent to terrify the reader. The ultimate message of the work is one of hope, survival and humanity.I listened to Night unabridged on audio CD, performed by Jeffery Rosenblatt. Rosenblatt succeeds in the ultimate task of a performer for a work like this - not going over the top, staying true to the author's voice, and letting the words and story speak for themselves."},{"Title":"Night","review":"If you come across someone who wonders whether or not human beings are totally depraved, hand them a copy of this book. Night is a short book describing Wiesel's year in Auschwitz and Buchenwald.The book begins with Wiesel's family living peacefully in Transylvania during the later years of World War II. Trouble seems distant though rumors abound. The Jewish community in Sighet continues to live and love just as before. Wiesel tells about a devout Jewish man who had witnessed the horrors of a concentration camp and escaped. Upon arrival in the village, he began to warn everyone of the impending danger. But the villagers scoffed at his warnings. They did not believe that humans were capable of such evil. Even after the Jews were moved to the ghetto, Wiesel describes his family as still hoping and trusting that nothing worse would take place.Then, the concentration camp. Wiesel describes in horrific detail the \\"chimney,\\" - the place where Jews (even babies) were thrown alive into a blazing fire. Wiesel rebels against God. He refuses to fast on Jewish holy days. He questions the existence of God. The human evil of Auschwitz is too overwhelming to comprehend. Wiesel claims that human words cannot express the suffering he experienced.Throughout the narrative, Wiesel expresses shock and dismay at the evil of his persecutors. But intermingled into his account is his surprise at his own depravity manifested in his basest instincts. His recollections are littered with regret, with anger, and remorse.Wiesel's account forces the reader wrestle with questions about human depravity, God's sovereignty, the reason for suffering. The most disturbing scene in the book takes place when an innocent boy only 12 years old is forced to die, though he did not commit the crime for which he is punished. He and three others are placed on the gallows and hanged. The rest of the prisoners are forced to walk by and look squarely into the faces of the executed. But \\"the third rope was still moving. The child, too light, was still breathing... And so he remained for more than half an hour, lingering between life and death, writing before our eyes...\\"\\"Behind me, I heard the same man asking, \`For God's sake, where is God?'\\" And from within me, I heard a voice answer: \`Where He is? This is where - hanging here from this gallows...'\\"This account is a turning point for Wiesel. In his thoughts at that time, God is dead. Yet, as a Christian, I sense something deeper in this story. In the midst of human suffering and evil, I too look to an Innocent One dying an excruciating death. And when considering the depth of human evil and the love of a good God, I too ask, \\"Where is God?\\" and then see the form of a cross. \\"He is here, hanging on this tree...\\""},{"Title":"Night","review":"This short book, which is largely autobiographical, reads like a nightmare. It will shake you, even if you are fully aware of the evils of the Holocaust. This book should be required reading in high school or college. In this book, mankind is forced to confront the issue of evil. This is a philosophical concept but real-life evil of man against man. Only when we understand mankind's capacity to commit Holocaust can we stand against it in the future. Thank you to Elie Wiesel for the courage to tell these stories to the world in the hope that something like this will never happen again."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Love this book! Not a happy, feel good read but something that everyone should read and understand. It's hard to imagine the horror faced by the author but he does such a great job describing the events."},{"Title":"Night","review":"The book \\"Night\\" describes some of the horrors that took place in Auschwitz during World War II, more specifically it describes the tragedies Elie Wiesel faces during his year-long stay at the camp. It describes how God is \\"murdered\\" to the young boy as he watches the heartless Nazis torture those around him, which include family, friends, neighbors, and etc. The book is written from the perspective of Elie Wiesel, A young, Hungarian, Jewish boy, who expresses the Jewish culture through the diction of the book. He uses phrases such as\\"to travel by rail\\"(pg.11), which most American-English speaking people would not use. Also, the Jews are portrayed as very optimistic (at least for the position they're in), throughout the book they hold on to every bit of good news given to them and even try to sing hymns to lift their spirits. Also, the Jews are polite when talking to each other even in a time of extreme distress, which you wouldn't find among many cultures. Also, the Jews speak much more formally than in many cultures."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This is an eloquent book about a very sad episode in European history, about how a substantial number of civilized people raised on Christian principles did their utmost to kill everyone raised on earlier religious ideals.Wiesel presents eloquent testimony about the terror of this era; but, he fails to explain \\"Why?\\" A few years earlier, much the same fate befell Armenians in Turkey. In the 19th century, the ultimate sport in Newfoundland was to kill a Beothuk, a greater challenge than simply killing deer. The last Beothuk was a young girl killed for her scalp.But what of Rwanda, as UN forces stood aside? What of the Balkans 10 years ago? Or Darfur in recent years? Or the Sunni versus Shiite suicide bombings now? At least Count Vlad Dracul, from the same region in which Wiesel was brought up, dealt with the dishonest.Why? Perhaps this question has no answer. Much involves attitudes to others; Beothuks were considered as less than real people. Many Europeans who took part in the Holocaust regarded the Jews as less than human; nothing infuriates a bully more than a victim who refuses to resist.But then, how does one explain a Bernie Madoff who took the funds Wiesel had raised for his foundation and lost them in vast fraud. Why would one Jew treat another in this manner? Madoff can hardly say that Wiesel \\"should have known better.\\"The horror shown by Wiesel shows what people do; one telling example is bystanders throwing bread to starving camp inmates to watch them fight over scraps of food. He compares it to a rich tourist on a cruise liner tossing coins into the water to watch children fight each other for these little bits of money.Why? The tourist explained, \\"It's charity.\\"Such examples make Wiesel's story relevant; as history, and as current events. Perhaps the frightening answer is that there is no answer. Liberty is doing good for others; the love of power over others is the love of oneself. Then what is our future?Wiesel's night didn't end when American forces reached Buchenwald; we still live in the night of horror."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I have known for a while that I was going to read this book memoir for a while, as it is part of my schools curriculum. So, I knew I was going to read it, but I was never prepared for what I would be reading.Our school's experience is very special during our time reading this memoir, along with many other works on the holocaust. We have holocaust survivors visit, send our art pieces to be displayed in the Holocaust Memorial Museum in DC, and even write back in forth to Elie Wiesel. Night is a big part of our learning.Night was originally written in Yiddish, Elie's native language. That is the reason I suspect the writing is not the best I have read. I don't blame Elie, I blame the translators. But even though the writing is not amazing, the story is unforgettable.I really had no idea what really happened during the holocaust. But now that I have read Night, I will always know. And I will never forget. This memoir is so extremely raw, it doesn't water anything down. I am so thankful for this because when there are no survivors left, the world will need works like this to get a feel for what really happened. Of course, few people will ever really know, but if they read this, they can at least see what it was like from the eyes of a survivor.I will never be able to know what really happened in those concentration camps, where millions of people were ruthlessly tortured and killed, but now that I have read Night, I will never forget to remember."},{"Title":"Night","review":"What can I add to the many great reviews about this book...it's a fast read, written in simple yet powerful and honest words. It's been a few weeks since I read \\"Night\\" and one sentence has stuck with me as if I were the witness of the horror described in that one sentence - such a despicable act performed by fellow humans, absolutely horrific. You must read this book to really understand what Holocaust survivors went through, what they saw and what they felt. Many of them refusing to believe that such hatred and suffering was taking place in the 20th century, yet there it was before their eyes, ripping out their souls."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I was glad I found it on Amazon, all the local bookstores were sold out. English classes were reading for book report. Thanks Amazon"},{"Title":"Night","review":"Night is an absolutely heartbreaking memoir. It short and it is simple. The writing does not flow lyrically and is unembellished. The truth is that none of this matters. The voice of Wiesel....the voice of a man who has suffered loss, pain, and suffering that is incomprehensible to anyone who has not been in his position....makes this book what it is. He writes not only with his own voice, but also with the voices of the millions of other Jewish people who experienced the horrors of the Holocaust. Night is an account of Elie Wiesel's time in the Nazi concentration camps during the Holocaust. Wiesel writes with a voice that recalls loss in it's most tragic sense...loss of family, loss of humanity, loss of belief. It is hard to describe how I felt when reading this account...because as sad and horrified as I found myself while reading, I still know that what I felt was nothing compared to the sadness of the families that were there. No words really seem to be strong enough or raw enough to describe the book. I feel strongly that this should be required reading for everyone. My reason for feeling this way is the same as Wiesel's reason for writing this memoir. Humanity can never be allowed to forget what happened during that dark hour of the world's history. Allowing the world to forget would be a disrespect to the people involved....those who survived as well as those who were murdered at the hands of the Nazis. We are at a point in time where the number of survivors is dwindling quickly. Wiesel felt that this book was needed so that the world would never forget....because to forget would open the door for something like that to happen again. Night serves as a reminder of the terror that happened during the Holocaust...a reminder of our responsibility to prevent such an event from ever happening again"},{"Title":"Night","review":"This book speaks only of the facts, your soul will provide the horror and despair.Like the Elie your left with the skin and bones of what happened. This book should be required reading all over the world"},{"Title":"Night","review":"I read this book and was captivated. I recommend this book to everyone when they ask me if I know any good reads. Honestly, this book is amazing. I was speechless throughout the entire book."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Wiesel describes how his family and the jewish community of Sighet sleepwalk into the holocaust. The war has left them relatively unscathed and as the stories defy belief, they dont believe those who tell of the German anti semitism and atrocities.Then Hungary comes under nazi rule. Transportations begin,rumours abound but this is the 20th century, and there is God... In 1944 the Wiesel family join the millions on a cattle truck bound for Auchwitz, Birkenau and Buna...Another vital document on the holocaust,a crime so huge and disgraceful it still challenges the mind as to how it happened;perpetrated by a nation of culture, of Beethoven, Gothe, Hoffman and had much contributed to it from its jewish citizens.'Night's' enduring message must be about the evil of politics and how political power needs to be checked at every point. When debate goes, so does freedom. One must never allow politicians to impose 'The Truth' on a nation where it jails, condemns as madmen or even causes the 'disappearance' of dissenters. Even if you're 100% convinced on creationism/ climate change/abortion/life , if you outlaw debate and discussion you're allowing something very sinister to occur and you could be its next victim...This book was -for me-not as powerful an account as Primo Levi's 'If This is a Man' (perhaps because Levi's was the first time I read about the holocaust-hence its impact) but 'Night' can be accessed and read by anyone from the age of 10 onwards; a very good age to be made aware of how evil man and his political dogmas can be."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I first read \\"Night\\" in college during the mid-80's. It horrified me and several of the events of this book have stayed with me for years (as well they should).Now in my 40's, I recently went back and re-read it. My son is 14 years old, about the age of the author.Hearing the author's description of events, and how he and his father stayed together for as long as possible, was, from my viewpoint as a parent, even more horrifying ... if that's even possible.An excellent, excellent book. Very few books have spoken to me across my life.This one has.An absolute must-read."},{"Title":"Night","review":"The most moving and troubling thing you remember about \\"Night\\" is the author's voice--mature yet teetering on the edge of breakdown. This extraordinarily soul-shaking autobiographical account allows the reader to accompany teenage Elie Wiesel as he takes his first steps into Auschwitz, and into Hell. The book follows the author from a state of unknowingness, as he innocently enters the concentration camp without having a clue as to what lies ahead, to his tremendously moving spiritual transformation where the author's faith in a Higher Power begins to crumble. As the days pass, the reader FEELS Wiesel's absolute incredulity -- because how could such a world truly exist? How, honestly, can one human being do this to another? Readers who are afraid to approach this book because they do not want to read graphic and gory details about concentration camp life, need not be worried. The book offers many important and horrifying details, but the true \\"horror\\" of the book does not lie here. The true terror of \\"Night\\" is watching the narrator, merely a teenager, transform from one who is deeply devout, to one who is raging against the whole universe, against any Higher Power who could have allowed the Holocaust to occur. This book is absolutely not anti-religion, and it does NOT promote any one religion, so readers need not be worried that this book is promoting religion or atheism. Instead, \\"Night\\" is existential; it shows the true absurdity of the human condition, a human condition where we all live on absolute faith that if we are good, we will be rewarded, and yet... and yet the Holocaust occurred and basically cleaned the assumption away. After reading this review, readers might be wondering why in the world they would even want to read something so depressing. The reason is simply that this book will literally change your world--it pretty much altered the entire structure of my own neatly organized universe. Because ultimately, this book is a book about a hero. When you've lost everything, as Wiesel does, when you've lost your faith in the world, faith in humanity, faith that there is any sort of justice in the world -- and then after THAT point of absolute despair, if you are able to pick yourself up and find a way to go on living, find a way to give meaning back to the universe by helping others, that is true heroism. Wiesel, following the camp experience, has gone on to publish dozens of books, and is a professor at Boston University. He won the Nobel Peace Prize and has infused his own life with meaning by devoting it to others. Please read this book. It will change your world. It's the greatest book I have ever read."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Though not Jewish, I found this book hard to put down. We should be ashamed of the way we treat other human beings. Mr. Wiesel, has written his account of the time he spent in Auschwitz, and it is not pretty, but a must read book. Mr. Wiesel was recently attacked in San Francisco!!!!!!!! Unbelievable!"},{"Title":"Night","review":"Its been a long time since I have read a good book. This book touched me in ways I never thought it would.

Thank you."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I was expecting so much detail, but it lacked. The book felt rushed, so maybe the longer version held more in depth descriptions. There's so many questions while reading that should of been answered, but they never are, you can only assume. What gave this book 2.5 stars, was his determination and courage to share his experience and his actions in the book."},{"Title":"Night","review":"The lessons in life are taught here with thought provoking horror. Every emotion, feeling, human instinct or impression, is challenged here. Love, hate, fear, doubt, loyalty, dishonor, guilt, grief, pain, hope, dispair, death...its all here. Told in a beatifully clear voice with no wasted words. A haunting tale that will stay with me forever."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Elie Wiesel's account of the suffering and murder of the Jews during WWII cannot be explained or even described, but I can only exhort you to experience the story through his words.The audio version is expertly read/performed and seems to make the words and images more moving.This 2006 translation and published version contains the author's speech when accepting the Nobel Peace prize in 1986 and an epilogue/preface to the translation after these many years since its original printing.This story serves as a witness and memory of the horrible atrocities committed by the Nazis and their supporters and those who looked away. It also testifies to the evil existing in our sphere, even the evil rearing its head in the daily news as we have countries threatening to exterminate the Jews while nations ignore the threat and look the other way.You may think you don't want to read about or think about the holocaust and the concentration camps, but after listening to this book, I think that you must.Craig Stephans, author of Shakespeare On Spirituality: Life-Changing Wisdom from Shakespeare's Plays"},{"Title":"Night","review":"You have to read this powerful book for yourself and come up with your own words to describe the experience you have while reading it. I fully recommend it! It pulls at your heart and your soul!"},{"Title":"Night","review":"Elie Wiesel's accounts are heart shattering, yet so important for humanity to know about. His experiences make you wonder how any member of the human race can lose all heart and be so imhumane. His journey is one that once read, you'll never forget, and that is why this book is so important. Humanity must remember, for all races, all religions and all people to hopefully deter the horrors he endured, so it can be deterred for anyone who ever lives on earth. This is not just a moving book, it is one that will hopefully move into the hearts of all."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Night should be a reading requirement for every human being. The reader feels like they are right there with Mr. Wiesel as he enters the concentration camps and as he struggles to keep both himself and his father's body and spirit alive. You will not be disappointed in this book!"},{"Title":"Night","review":"What marks this book from so many on the annihilation of the Jews in death camps is its brevity. The book is so spare that it is hard to understand the horror without reading it so slowly that you are practically reading it aloud. There are really vivid characters in it, who evolve in just a few paragraphs, a truly masterful encapsulation of lost lives. While there is nothing particularly remarkable about his writing style, Wiesel has created a classic here that will stand the test of time. It is so scary and devastating that I will never forget it.A teacher friend of mine began his class with a close reading of this book, and allowed me to witness the discussion. It moved children of all races to pose questions, both about history and what men are capable of and about themselves and their identities. It was brilliant.Highest recommendation."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This book is good, educational, emotional, and thought-provoking. So short, it can easily be read in a couple of sittings, but I found myself spreading it out over several days because of the weight of the material. After only a few pages, I would feel somewhat overwhelmed by the images conjured up and the hopelessness the author so perfectly communicated. Certainly a contemplative work. I highly recommend."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This review is for the unabridged CD version of 'Night' by Elie Wiesel. The narrator, George Guidall, reads/performs the story of Elie's time in Auschwitz beautifully. His words are haunting, moving and heartbreaking. Mr. Wiesel tells his story in the simplest and humblest of words that are so descriptive they remain with you long after you finish the book/CD. This is not Hollywood's version of what happened during Nazi Germany. It is a real life account of the horrors and atrocities of the Holocaust.I highly recommend this book/CD to anyone of high school age or older."},{"Title":"Night","review":"THIS WAS GREAT BOOK I FINISHED IT IN ONE DAY CAUSE I JUST COULDNT PUT IT DOWN"},{"Title":"Night","review":"This book was excellent.

He repeatedly uses the symbolism of fire and of nighttime, with excerpts that could move someone to tears. He says that he would never \\"forget that night... which has turned my life into one long night.\\" He would \\"never forget those flames which consumed my faith forever.\\"Most of the book however, simply tells a story. It relates terrors with no particularly pretty words or fancy writing. Usually it reflects limited anger or sadness, but simply says what must be said."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I felt an instant love for this book, from page one. It gives you and incredibly thankful appreciation for the hundreds of simple things in life we take for granted. Such as being well over fed, warm at night in our beds, and knowing that our loved ones are alive. People in all corners of the world have worries about things that we would never even think twice about. We live in a country that is so well off, that the worst thing we see is homeless people on the streets. Reading this book will give you a renewed opinion on life and daily wants that are often thought of as needs. In Night, you will discover what it would have cosisted of to be a condemned Jew in the early 1990's."},{"Title":"Night","review":"In Elie Wiesel's Night, he recounts his horrific experiences as a Jewish boy under Nazi control. His words are strong and his message is very clear. Wiesel uses words such as hunger and death to display his days during the World War II. Wiesel's main purpose is to describe to the reader the horrifying scenes and feelings he suffered. Younge readers today find the actions of the Nazis almost unimaginable. Like me, I never would've known anything of that sort would ever happen to me. This story has opened my eyes to the reality of torture in those days. We read just an excerpt of this story in English class which made me very interested in the story.Ofetn, the reader can forget that the story really happened. The emotion is the strongest by far. It seems almost impossible for a reader not to cry at the words of Wiesel. Elie paints a portriat of life in the camp, which included hours of difficult labor, fear of being killed, and an overall theme throughout the book: starvation and death. I have always been interested in what really happened in the concentration camps, but now I feel no need to relive that horrible event. His description of a child being hanged, how he was still alive, \\"struggeling between life and death, dying in slow agony under our eyes\\", truly shows the depressing things that happened in the death camps. Also, his desciption of himself in a mirror as \\"a corpse\\" gives the reader the overwelming sense of how this event affected the victims of this time. This book provides dramatic and tearful events of what happened in our world just a little over fifty years ago. This story provides a lesson that no history book could ever show you."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This memoir is among the finest written in the world. If you read it before or own it already - be sure you have this most recent tranlation from French to English done by Wiesel's wife.

A book that's taught to millions of high school students each year, and always appreciated by even apathetic teens for its power, is going to get notice. Finally. Thanks Oprah.

The Book Came Just As It Was Described In The Summary!!! Thank You So Much!!!"},{"Title":"Night","review":"Told in a tone of appropriate melancholy and sadness, Wiesel (who wrote an earlier draft in a far more angry, bitter tone) writes a first-hand testimony of the Holocaust and in doing so he becomes the Job of our time, as he struggles with the question: How could God remain silent in the face of such evil, cruelty, and suffering?As we experience Wiesel, the 15-year-old boy full of faith, putting his God up to this question, we see that the Holocaust is a new era for religion and the way we see faith in the context of man's capacity for evil.However, Night is not a nihilist book. The account itself implicitly tells us that being a witness to injustice and caring about the nature of our faith compels us on a road to meaning.Two excellent companion books are Viktor Frankl's Man's Search for Meaning and Ron Rosenbaum's Explaining Hitler, a meditation on the nature of evil."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This is my second copy of this book. I purchased it as a gift, and this edition arrived on time, in perfect shape, and with a decent spine that will withstand several hundred readings.I will admit to preferring this book in hardcover, as opposed to the softcover I ordered. Some say these little aesthetics make very little difference, however, with a book as meaningful and profound as Elie's true account of his holocaust experiences, a hardcover older edition somehow brings the words to a frighting crescendo.This book does not ask you to read it, but demand it of you as a human. Only through the true acknowledgment of our past can we move into the future with open eyes."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I read this book on the recommendation of a friend. You will be forever changed by this story. It is one man's account of his experience as a Jewish person during WW2. Everyone should have to read this book. We have no idea of what evil lies w/in humanity. Remember the past or be destined to repeat it!"},{"Title":"Night","review":"While I found Night to be a gripping book, I cannot recommend that everyone read it. For one thing, the graphic depiction of the Nazis' brutality is much too violent for young readers; for another, the Holocaust in general is not an appropriate topic for the young. I would, though, highly recommend this book for mature junior high students, and for sure for anyone high school age and above. While Wiesel, does use some Hebrew words and refer to several Jewish customs, these do not get in the way of the reader's ability to follow the story.Elie Weisel's first-hand experience of the Holocaust makes it clear that intolerance cannot be accepted. Whether it's bullying of a classmate, referring to another race by a derogatory term, or calling those with opposing viewpoints names, we have to step up and confront those actions. Although I did not like how the book ended, I understand that it was an honest depiction of Weisel's feelings as a Holocaust survivor. The ending wasn't poorly written; it was just so depressing - but how could a story about the Holocaust not be depressing? Because I think it's important that everyone learn what actually occurred during the Holocaust, I highly recommend this book for mature readers and would give it a superior rating for its honesty and the raw courage it took to share such an appalling experience."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Elie Wiesel was in his mid-teens when he was taken from his home in Transylvania during WWII.This was a gripping book, definitely not for the weak of heart. Wiesel's memory is quite vivid of his months in Auschwitz, then in Buchenwald. It was terrifying for him. And terrifying to read.I've read a few Holocaust books, and this short read is by far the most graphic. I am further horrified by man's hatred for his fellow man, but more specifically, for God's Chosen People.What stays with me the most from this book is the denial in the Jewish neighborhood that anything bad was approaching. And when the Germans had occupied their streets, a certain delusion of safety remained in every house.This forces me to reflect on the dangers of sin in our own lives and how we deny its danger. We are often delusional about the safety of sin's cold occupation.I recommend this Nobel Peace Prize winner by Elie Wiesel. The wrongs of humanity must be reviewed, not forgotten, so we may resist the evils when they arise again.D.I. Telbat"},{"Title":"Night","review":"We read about historical events, and we watch documentaries and movies. But to make it real, we read personal accounts. A well-written and personal account of the Holocaust is found in Elie Wiesel's book, Night.Wiesel, as a teenager, was removed along with his family to Auschwitz. The words used to describe the experience are breathtaking in the sense that it leaves you speechless or in tears. In fact, the words are many times written without emotion yet evoke emotion from the reader. As they arrive in camp, Wiesel writes, \\"A truck drew close and unloaded its hold: small children. Babies! Yes, I did see this, with my own eyes...children thrown into the flames.\\" There are no useless adjectives or adverbs. The author states what happen as though watching it all on a film in his mind.To be able to get through two pages without tears forming in the readers mind is nigh impossible. The most intense passage stops you cold:\\"Never shall I forget that night, the first night in camp, that turned my life into one long night seven times sealed.Never shall I forget that smoke.Never shall I forget the small faces of the children whose bodies I saw transformed into smoke under a silent sky.Never shall I forget those flames that consumed my faith forever.Never shall I forget the nocturnal silence that deprived me for all eternity of the desire to live.Never shall I forget those moments that murdered my God and my soul and turned my dreams to ashes.Never shall I forget those things, even were I condemned to live as long as God Himself.Never.\\"There is no wonder that Wiesel struggled with why God allowed all of it to happen. He recounts the last moments he saw his mother and sister and how he watched his own father beaten death without lifting a hand. The reader cannot help but feel each emotion that Wiesel experienced.This is one of the most excellent books that you can ever read on the Holocaust. It is short while giving you volumes to take in. No library on the Holocaust can be complete without this magnificent piece."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This was the first time that I ever read Night by Elie Wiesel. Wiesel does an excellent job of showing the raw brutality and suffering caused by the holocaust. My generation has not had the opportunity to really experience anything of this scale. I really enjoyed following Wiesel through the entire story, and I feel that I really felt like I understood his relationships.Three things that I enjoyed greatly about this book was the way that Wiesel showed his experiences, instead of merely telling about them, his \\"never give up\\" attitude, and the love which he showed for his father. His vivid imagery of the death camp that he was in really struck me. In the current generation, mine, people rarely suffer at all. We can line up in stores to stuff shopping carts with it. If we want to eat, we drive to a McDonald's and order a \\"Big Mac\\". We have homes to go to, and we are safe, defended by our military. Elie Wiesel had none of that. His life was a day to day battle with starvation, the elements, and worse, the Waffen SS. Wiesel never gave up, a trait whihc I greatly admire about him. I know that nine out of ten teenagers herded into a cattle car, separated from their family, and sent to dig ditches for twelve hours a day, would not last for a week. Elie clung to life, and that's a reason why I admire him. Another is that he loved and honored his father. Three times, he was seperated from his father, and each time, at great personal risk, he either smuggled, or joined his father; risking his own life for his father's slim chance at one more day, one more breath. This is what makes Night different than other books. This is why I admire Elie Wiesel.There is one thing that I dislike about this book. this is y biased, personal, illogical reason. It is the first book in five years where I really felt empathy for the character, and it brought me to tears.If you ever become tired of reading about Vampires wearing body glitter, and want to try reading a true story about life, death, and the true meaning of love then pick up a copy of this book. I promise you, you won't regret it."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I like the Holocaust because it gives Jews power. Let me be completely blunt. If it weren't for the Holocaust, Jews would not have such tremendous power to make feel guilty and hand-deliver US institutions to them. Holocaust is the greatest thing to happen to the Jews since we killed Jesus Christ. As a proud Jew, I am proud of that, in the same spirit of Rabbi Kimhi from Medieval Spain who used to boast about killing Christ. We won, they lost. Let's celebrate!"},{"Title":"Night","review":"Well, this is a very important book, although it makes for such painful reading. At the age of 15, Wiesel and his parents and his little sister were rounded up by the Nazis and sent to a series of concentration camps. When an SS guard barked, \\"Men to the left! Women to the right!\\" he lost his mother and sister forever. He subsequently clung to his father, although he was ashamed of dishonoring him by not standing up to the Germans who beat and humiliated him. In this excellent translation by his wife Marion, Wiesel offers up a horrific and extremely personal account of the Holocaust. He relates his own pain at being a deeply observant Jew who comes to feel abandoned by his God, unable to comprehend the absolute evil that mankind has wrought, with no divine intervention to answer even the most desperate of prayers. Eventually, his father gives up all hope because of his extreme suffering and dies, just before the Allies liberate Buchenwald. A shattered Wiesel, who would remain tormented by his memories for the rest of his life, finally becomes a free man and goes forward to tell his eyewitness tale so that this shameful era of history will not be forgotten. Many years later, in 1986, he accepted the Nobel Peace Prize in honor of the Jewish people."},{"Title":"Night","review":"A must!!! should be read in every school , for in could enable some children to understand what lies waiting for humanity when it lacks awareness and compromise with life, (respect for others, the weak, the old, the different etc)."},{"Title":"Night","review":"In the 1940's young Elie and his Family were forced from their home.

You are not complete until you read this part of history."},{"Title":"Night","review":"\\"Once you have witnessed it there is no skepticism; no denying your beliefs away. For it knows no separation.\\"In a world of uncertainty, tragedy is inevitable. So often we try to convince ourselves we have so many comforts, and because of them, we are content. But there is always something pulling at our \\"concrete conclusions,\\" and it doesn't stop until we have come to no uncertain realization. The last comfort we have, only after the tragedy is overcome, or at least history, is to learn from it; so that what made it happen never happens again. This is how we honor its memory but impersonal forces, such as history alone, are not enough to make complete and accessible again, the lessons lurking behind the mute faces and human smoke of an already desecrated universe, a universe in which the voice of God doesn't seem to be heard anymore. We owe to this inability, our need for certain teachers to educate our souls, to give us knowledge of the terrible and true; and what we ask of them, more often than not, is to carry deep inside them but one qualification: the experience of the knowledge they seek to impart on us forever. In other words, they must have been witnesses, because - as I indicated as much at the beginning of this review, in the form of a quotation - to become a witness means, in part, to know \\"no skepticism\\" nor to allow the heart either to know any \\"separation\\" from conviction, having become \\"prisoners of truth.\\" That is why teachers are also witnesses and that is why Elie Wiesel, once a poor persecuted Romanian Jew, with no voice in the world became our eyes to an era of evil without equal. That is why when he wrote \\"Night,\\" he gave us that voice which seemed to have been silenced so long ago by chaos, always one of the many \\"totalitarian conveniences\\" used by the dictators. Elie Wiesel is a \\"prisoner of truth\\" and a victim of hatred. This book is a child of his mind, just as much as it is of his soul. It is his eternal confession, his painful admittance of \\"knowing why the voice of God cannot be heard anymore.\\" It is not simply a piece of historically inspired writing but a philosophical diary too of a young man confused by chaos into confessing his desire to know why \\"Hitler's voice rose above the others, moving on to become a promise to the Jewish people.\\" The book is slim, but so too is life, and as anyone knows, who has lived life long enough to know it, \\"it isn't actually that short.\\" For the wounds are infinite and the pain sometimes beyond either health or hope. There is indeed no happy ending here, the world lives with questions, not answers. One thing is certain, though, we need books such as these more than ever now, and with their presence, perhaps, they can help us to go on remembering why forgetting is almost as devastating as the actual killing. If you have learned from this book, as I have, both from the author, in my personal correspondence with him, and from the book, I suggest checking out Akiva Israel's \\"Scholar by the Warsaw Fire.\\" Like \\"Night,\\" there are no shortcuts. We simply have to start at the beginning of a question, \\"Where is God? How can the world go on?\\" And continue, even if, at the end of all our searching, all we have left is \\"a necessary terror to be experienced.\\" Indeed, the philosophical personalities of the two authors seem compatible, for it was Author Akiva Israel's words I used to begin this and now, having come to the ending, I'll finish on that note, quoting from one of the characters in Mr. Israel's \\"Scholar by the Warsaw,\\" \\"...unfortunately for the rest of us, truth is hearing the voice of God when it is already too late. I guess that is why it wouldn't have made a difference if either you or I had actually heard it. ...What is worse about being right is when nobody listens, for those who listen do not understand, and as for those who did not, or could not, they adapted to what was wrong, and made that right. And in all this confusion, one man's shouting becomes far more coherent than one god's silent weeping: This is where the power of the question begins.\\""},{"Title":"Night","review":"The book was delivered in very good shape and got here in a very timely fashion.

I doesn't seemlike it can be, but it is."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I was not looking forward to reading this. As much as I am a history buff, I thought I had read too many holocaust horror stories, and so imagine my dismay when I read this for an English class sometime back.How wrong I was. In fact, I was hooked from the first paragraph.Elizer Wiesel lived in Sighet, Transylvania in his childhood. Being Jewish, he and his family were snatched from their home when he was 15 and taken to a series of concentration camps, where he and his father were separated from their family. Subject to malnutrition, near-hypothermia from his clothes being off so much, running to the point where he couldn't, and anorexia- all under the order of the Nazis, surviving this was not without its difficulty. And Elie managed to do so.Night is a book I will NEVER forget. Normally I am a quick reader but I intentionally read this slowly because the story was so captivating. The whole time, this book was playing out like a movie in my head. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time. I was horrified at the descriptions of life in a concentration camp. I often imagined myself as Elie, which made it all the more scary. It's just amazing that Elie lived through all of it. I can't even count the times I was on the verge of tears.In short, this is the book I've been needing to read all along. In a time of crappy vampire romances and fantasy wannabes, this book is QUALITY. If you want a protagonist you can care for, if you want a story you feel the need to continue the whole time, if you want quality literature, buy this book NOW. It's the most powerful book I've read.

Told through Wiesel's viewpoint as a fifteen-year-old boy, \\"Night\\" shows not only the horrors done by the Nazis, but also the dehumanization that caused the Jews to even turn on each other at points. It is unflinching in its honesty, depicting Wiesel's love for his own father that also comes close to disdain in the midst of the hardships. I've read numerous books about this time period, but Wiesel adds new dimension to the horror and humanity, sharing insights and realities that only someone who was there could convey. I appreciated that his own heritage, as an Eastern European, brings to the forefront the struggles many of that culture faced.The second factor (the trilogy element) caused me some frustration upon finishing the book. It ends so abruptly that I admit to a bit of disappointment. Wrapped up in this harrowing true story, I hated to be dropped so suddenly--which, perhaps intentionally, made the book's revelations that much starker in my mind. I will definitely go on to the second and third books, and may find this to be one of the most riveting and best-written accounts of the war. (On the fiction end, it reminded me at times of the brilliant \\"The Book Thief.\\") I can hardly imagine the difficulty of pouring these memories onto the page, and I admire Wiesel for having done so."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Are there ever words to say after reading about events as tragic as the Holocaust? Is there ever a way to go back to a life of living in the shadows or denying the truth after reading a book like NIGHT? The answer will always be the same. No. NIGHT, by Elie Wiesel, isn't the fluffy version of the hardships Jews went through during the Holocaust like all of the textbooks used in middle and high schools tell us. NIGHT is reality. It isn't a story, but a heartbreaking life taken, put into words, and bound up in a book. After reading about the horrid events that befell Mr. Wiesel, every waking moment, which was a great deal more than normal due to the mind-boggling things that occurred, was dedicated to trying to sort out all of the events that he endured. Even if I wanted to, there is no possible way that I could criticize what he has written here. He has told us point blank in an engaging way his struggles as a young Jew in the Holocaust. Never once was I bored and longed for another source of entertainment. His way of making this book so personal and his ability to put you in his shoes made it impossible for me to put the book down.

Night by Elie Wiesel is so much more than a book of dates and events. It is the story untold by those who were murdered in the Holocaust. It is the raw experience of a young boy who was forced to live through it.Wiesel describes the physical burden throughout his very own persecution but also the mental and emotional agony of everyone around him. He captures the hope of children and parents along with the sorrow of the damned. Wiesel lives through the Holocaust to tell his story but not without hardship. Besides fighting the weakness and pain of his own body, he internally battles with himself. The liberation of death is always on Wiesel's mind. His faith in the one God he has devoted his life to is questioned.This short book will grip all readers past the last page. It is the voice for all those not as lucky as Elie Wiesel.

I randomly picked up this book and instantly fell in love with it. This was the first book that I have read about the Holocaust and Wiesel's words were so powerful I felt like I was seeing it with my own eyes. The book is a thing of great beauty describing the extreme tragedy that many Jewish people endured in the 1940's. The book is quite painful and deeply saddened me to think that I live in such an evil world where not only something of this nature could take place, but also that people try to deny that the Holocaust ever happened. I will never forget any part of this book, especially the words describing babies and children being thrown into fiery pits or thrown into the air and used for target practice. Also, the people being beat to death and treated like worthless animals. The imagery of this book will be forever burned into my mind. Wiesel's aspiration was to keep the memory of the Holocaust and those who suffered alive and he does a brilliant job of doing so.I would highly recommend this book to anyone, whether you are deeply interested in the Holocaust or not.

However, stories like this are necessary for everybody so that we may never forget what transpired in our \\"enlightened\\" twentieth century, and how quickly a person's life can change.Wiesel's account of his time from his youth in Transylvania to his enduring the concentration camps is spare, but filled with so much horror and brutality that I think a more detailed account would have been almost too much. That Wiesel's experience was just one of millions who suffered under Hitler's \\"final solution\\" is unimaginable.Wiesel sees himself as a less than perfect victim, and often refers to himself as \\"selfish\\", most notably in his dealings with his increasingly frail father, yet who can really blame anybody for acting the way they did under such circumstances? The myth of the noble victim is one that we have grown up with (starting with the Book of Job), but the reality is that an experience like the concentration camps will make anybody do what they can to survive.There is no true happy ending to this story, and how can there be? Wiesel may have survived his ordeal, but he came out of it having lost a lot more.This edition of the book also includes Wiesel's 1986 Nobel Prize acceptance speech and, luckily for the reader, a new preface by Wiesel.I also recommend Art Spiegelman's award-winning \\"Maus.\\""},{"Title":"Night","review":"The genius of this book may be in its simplicity.

How can someone who lives in such times worship such a God? Where is God? Where is humanity?The time period covered by the book is one of the most horrible time periods in all of human history. Such systematic horror on such a scale is and was unprecedented. To fully understand this time period it is important we read and re-read this novel.The book offers no easy answers as there were no easy answers for those who survived. I was left with a sense of emptyness after I read the novel. Even today, 12 years later, I am still haunted by the images painted by Mr. Wiesel.

Sure, I've read the Diary of Anne Frank, and watched TV specials on the Jewish holocaust, but I haven't ever read or heard a detailed account of one person's horrific struggle of surviving the holocaust.The word \\"history\\" tends to lend an idea of seperation, as if something written in textbooks could not happen now, as it happened \\"so long ago.\\" The truth is, the holocaust only began a little over 70 years ago, and many people have memories of the 1930's & 40's. Yet, already, the individual struggles of the holocaust have already been overshadowed by the large scale idea of the holocaust (not the details), devaluing the girls, boys, women, and men that lived their last days starving, scared, beatened, and then burned alive. People forget how the cruel and deplorable conditions that masses of individuals lived in for so long - if they lived at all.People think of the holocaust and most-often picture crematoriums, starvation, and tattoo-bearing prisoners (and even the prisoners are seen as a number, not at individual human beings). People think of the holocaust on a large scale, the sheer waste of it all, the absolute disgusting nature of almost eradicating an entire race. People also think of the holocaust, and instead of remembering the millions of Jews that died as a result of extreme racism, they think of Hitler, the man responsible for it all. Shouldn't we think of the little girl who was burned after being ripped away from her mother, the babies used for target practice, or the old man mauled to death over a piece of stale bread?Night forces one to focus on the struggle of one single boy, from losing his faith in God to losing faith in himself. It exposes exactly what it was like to live through the holocaust as an individual, not as people. Elie Wiesel, the author, conveys his emotions and actions, his regrets, and his losses in a way that will make even the most cold-hearted person shed tears. It's a short read, but well worth it."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Hunger, fear, fire, lashes, selection, and chimney are all words that relate to this story. This story is a record of Elie Weisel's terrifying experiences that he went through in the German concentration camps as a teenage boy. He and his family were taken from their home in Sighet, Transylvania by German officers to live in the Jewish concentration camps. Elie's family got to the camp with everyone together, but as Elie saw his mom and sisters walk to the right with the women and children, he didn't realize he would never see his mom and sisters again. Elie lived in fear everyday and the only comfort he had was his dying dad. This intriguing story will send shivers down your spine when you realize that this event didn't happen that long ago and nothing was done to stop it."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I love reading books about real events, so I really enjoyed Night. Elie Wiesel was born in Transylvania Hungary. He was a teenager in 1944 when he and his family were taken from their home and sent to a concentration camp in Auschwitz Poland. He spent a year in a concentration camp and where he witnessed people being hanged and burned to death in a furnace daily.Wiesel survived attacks and whippings from the guards. Life was so desperate in the concentration camp that people resorted to eating snow to quench their thirst. A simple thing like the gold crown in Wiesel's mouth were of such great value, because it could be sold for money by a dentist or a guard who wanted it and ultimately got it.Wiesel not only tried to keep himself alive, he also tried to keep his father alive too. Wiesel taught his old father how to march in place to prevent him from being attacked and killed by the guards. There are many words about the Jewish religion in Night. I thought were interesting, even though I am not Jewish. One Jewish reference is the word Kaddish. A Kaddish is a prayer praising God. It is also prayer of thanks for one's life. Another interesting concept is that of Kabbalah. Kabbalah is a branch of the Jewish religion that tries to answer the question of what is the purpose of man's life on earth. Wiesel's srong faith in these Jewish ideas kept him alive and determined to tell his story. He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1986 for Night, and his acceptance speech for it is included after the text of the book. In the speech, Wiesel said he wrote Night so that future generations would never forget the victims and survivors of the Holocaust. Night is a short book and a fast read, but the experiences are very powerful and vivid. I enjoyed it very much."},{"Title":"Night","review":"These anecdotes startled me and made me angry. The narrator's father's reasoning in the beginning was utterly sympathetic; how many of us would think the same way, \\"Things aren't so bad, so long as I can keep my kin together,\\" while the noose tightens over a period of weeks. And then the narrator's thoughts while his father grew sick in the concentration camp troubled me too. How soon other people's cruelty makes us act like animals! This book should be required reading, if only to learn from history about the dangers of self-deception."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Whether you are approaching this memoir as a student or as a lay reader, it's message of hope against all odds and every depravity makes it a testament of the human spirit worth reading. Wisely choosing a spare style, Elie Wiesel lets the horrors of the Holocaust speak for themselves. Nevertheless, he brings a poetic ear to the proceedings with some arresting moments, such as the \\"Never will I forget...\\" refrain that comes with his first night at Auschwitz. His curse is our blessing, and although we shall never forget the experience, either, it is for a different reason. This riveting account of one Jewish boy's trip (with his father) through five concentration camps in a year toward the end of the war speaks to us through the screams, the fire and smoke, indeed the ages, making it a modern classic of the memoir genre.In addition to the concentration camps, the terrain of the human mind is part of Wiesel's subject. He explores how he and his fellow Jews dismissed warning after warning -- refusing to believe the storm clouds on the horizon in his idyllic Hungarian youth -- until Hungarian Jews were put first into ghettos and then into cattle car transports and it was too late.In the camps we face one physical crisis after another as we meet players high and low, noble and depraved, in a system of killing that quite simply worked and worked efficiently. Wiesel's Jewish faith is put to the test, and the author explores such deep topics as the far-reaching effects of dehumanization and loyalty to family under duress. Readers turn pages horrified but spellbound -- for what Wiesel's contemporaries refused to believe could happen in the 20th century, probably we are equally sure could never happen in our own 21st. If that's the case, we haven't learned Wiesel's lessons. The seed of evil is there. Darfur is reality. And genocide is always a threat in an age rife with religious and sectarian hatreds as well as more and more expedient ways to dispose of human life. It is for us to stand guard, to make sure that history of this sort does not repeat itself while we stand by silently.Wiesel's long, metaphorical night will prove enlightening, then. Perversely so, perhaps, but so nonetheless. Read it both as a cautionary tale and as a testament to hope and survival. But please, read it!"},{"Title":"Night","review":"this book was amazing.

Use tissues as a bookmark!"},{"Title":"Night","review":"Before I read Night, the holocaust was a distant, terrible thing that I never wanted to think about. Elie Wiesel's story makes the events of something that happened sixty years ago come alive, whether we would like them to or not. We see the terrible world of the Nazis and their concentration camps firsthand; I have read several holocaust books but none of them have been as powerful as Night. The ending sentence, more than anything else, clarifies the search for God that Elie experiences in Auschwitz, Birkenau and his life afterwards."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Everyone should read this book. It only took me about 2 hours to read, but its words and images will forever remain with me. Very powerful. A must read."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This book is a easy read, but its message is very powerful and eye-opening. As the book begins, Elie Wiesel first describes his family's heart-wrenching separation when they were taken away by the Nazis. He then goes on to desrcibe in vivid detail his experiences in the concentration camps, how he watched hundreds of people being slaughtered before his eyes, and his own close encounters with death. As you read, you can visualize everything that Wiesel describes as if you were actually there. It really gives you a perspective into the horrors of the Holocaust. By the time the book is over, the reader is left deep in thought and hungry for more. Overall, a must read."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This book is one of the most touchingingly realistic accounts of the Holocaust I have ever been introduced to.

It begins with the description of a thirteen year old's spiritual innocence. The boy, Elie is the author and he writes at a twenty-year remove from the experiences that he retells.You probably know the story: it has been recounted in a hundred different settings. First some of the Jews are rounded up to be shot in the forest. Then the freedom of the remaining ones is restricted. The rumors and eyewitness accounts begin to circulate back to the Jews of this town or that, but no one believes them. Then more are taken-this time to centralized death camps- and for most of those who are transported, there is nothing but unspeakable cruelty and death.At the beginning of his story, Elie Wiesel tells us what his teacher told him: Every question possesses a power that is lost in the answer. Wiesel is one of the few survivors of Auschwitz and Birkenau and his questions are: 'where was God' and 'for what purpose did I survive?'The second question is answered in part in the sequel to Night, the claustrophobic Dawn. The first question is answered slowly in Night itself: God was there in the suffering.Business has taken me to eastern europe several times in the last couple of years. Somehow, I find myself drawn to the synagogues that remain intact in Prague, Vienna, Budapest, Pecs. They are now 'centers of Jewish culture' or 'museums of Jewish life', relics of Judaism with no Jews alive anywhere near them.I understand that there is even a museum at Berchtesgaden and I plan to visit it too.Most of these places are cleaned-up and have the feel of a Williamsburg or a Venice. They look like parts of a world that stood still while everything else moved on. That is, of course, a lie. They are feeble witnesses to the planned murder of the men, women and children who lived in them. But the buildings have no voices and the story, particularly today, is heard less and less.Night is the voice of those people, the story that should be playing from those buildings and the source of questions that need to be asked again.--Lynn Hoffman, author of THE NEW SHORT COURSE IN WINE and the forthcoming novel bang-BANG from Kunati Books.

By telling what his day to day existance was leading up to and then in concentration camps, you can relate to what he endured. It is easier to comprehend what occurred by seeing it through the eyes of one person and then multiplying it by millions of human beings who suffered in the same circumstances. It reminds me of the impact of \\"The Diary of Anne Frank\\" in being able to relate to this one girl and then realize she was one of millions. The book is a fast, easy read but contains so much. It is heart wrenching actual history that should never be allowed to happen again to anyone. It should be required reading for every high school student not only in the United States, but in the world."},{"Title":"Night","review":"in a world where jew hatred continues to thrive, where people are using their disagreement with Tel Aviv to fuel/ justify their anti-semitism, this book is essential readingI would've given it 5 stars if I hadn't just read The Seamstress, which for me was even more moving in that it relates more of the social context of anti-semitism, as well as her personal struggle to survive, and how solidarity with others was key in this struggle, as well as luck.But Elie Weisel's profound honesty of his personal experience, the inner psychological pain and anguish, in addition to desribing the horror that caused it provides a very personal and moving account.I'd also recommend The Jewish Question by Abram Leon which delves into the roots of anti-senitism, and explains why it's still with us today."},{"Title":"Night","review":"One of the most moving books I have read."},{"Title":"Night","review":"The book was particularly poignant being told by someone who had to endure the pain of loss, and disregard for his family. Being separated from his mother and sister was exceedingly difficult. But, having to watch his father being brutalized and treated as less than human had to be even worse. At an age when we see our parents as being strong enough to take on the world for us, and keep us safe from those who might want to harm us, it is even more devastating when we see our father, of all people, emasculated before our eyes. The reality of being totally powerless strips away all our defenses.Elie has to deal with seemingly losing the same feeling of protection from God. He has always trusted God implictly and thought his greatest desire would always be to serve and honor this God. He didn't realize in his youthful simplicity that circumstances of life could compromise this seemingly settled relatonship.What ultimately strikes us is man's inhumanity to man. We must always be vigilant. Unfortunantly, we always want to think it will not happen again. If we just give in a little, if we can appease our adversaries perhaps they will leave us alone. No one really wants to cause us harm, do they? The stark reality, at any age, is that for whatever reason, there are those who simply have no regard for others and will have what is ours if we offer it to them as an offering of appeasement, or if they have to take it from us no matter the consequenses.And what ultimately is worse? Loss of life, loss of dignity or loss of illusions? Each are equally devastating. Perhaps Elie was right, grabbing the electirc fence would be the easy way out. No one should ever be put in that position.That Elie should win a Nobel Peace Prize is the ultimate vindication. Wouldn't it be wonderful if his story could helperadicate the perverse behavior he, his family, and millions have endured, and continue to endure? Would to God it would even make a substantial impact.Regardless, the stories must be told, and heard. I loved this book, and the forward by Francois Mauriac.

Each time I read this, I gain a different perspective."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This short, depressing and harrowing tale is very well written. The text flows smoothly, thoughts are well addressed and the horror is very well conveyed. My main issue is that once you've read it you're just left in a depressed mood with no real insight or revelation just a bleak reminder of a very horrific tragedy.It's gruesome scene after gruesome scene on every page and by the end you're mentally exhausted from imagining the toll of terror that had taken place but that's it. You just feel bad and that's not a read that I'd recommend.I had been recommended this book by several people and I saw it was very famous of several lists so I was hoping for something a lot more. I was not aware this was a trilogy until after I finished reading this first book so I will finish the series and hope that it gets better along with some more depth and purpose. The excuse I saw one lecturer reply with was \`sometimes we need to feel bad for the sake of feeling bad'. I strongly disagree that that statement would apply to this book, yes, feeling bad can be eye opening for certain occasions but this is not one of them"},{"Title":"Night","review":"I read this book,and it gave me a sense of what my ancestors had gone through. My mother's family had almost been extinct after the holocaust. Even now, we have no idea how my ancestors were killed, we know which camps they were sent to, but we will never truly know what their fate was. I read this book and it gave me a deep sense of appreciation for my family and my relatives. The author's story is the same story that most of the holocaust victims would tell if they lived through it. This book touched me very deeply. I was kind of disturbed when I was reading through some of the reviews. I can't believe there really is that many ignorant people out there that believe that Jews deserved to die. I guess they think taking little infants from their mothers and throwing them into the fire and laughing is something these children deserved. I am just glad that I never have to deal with these people in everyday life. I live in an area where everyone is educated and not ignorant. Ignorance just saddens me. I am sure it is hard living day to day with such hate for others, I am happy to be accepting of all others and live a happy Jewish life.I highly recommend this book to anyone, Jewish or non.

I saw an interview with Elie Wiesel on Oprah about this book and I have to say...he is amazing. Although I was not alive during the holocaust, and will never know how it felt to go through all of that pain and torture...this book will really open your eyes, and give a much better understanding of what they went through."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Night is a very touching book. A book which I believe everyone should read once in their lifetime. The contents of this book are complete. One would not want to change the memories of a holocaust survivor, but the ways in which it is expressed do have some flaws. The biggest blemish of Night is the gaping holes in time. The shifts from one time period to the next are abrupt and left me feeling startled. While this may have been his intent in the first place it left me wondering if anything interesting had been left out. Why leave holes like this in your work? You wait ten years and you limit yourself in this way? This cannot be that large of a demerit to the book because it does add tot eh experience of reading Night. One should not feel totally comfortable reading such matter.This book really shines in its descriptions. While the book is not three hundred pages long it does do an excellent job of capturing the reader. You can almost feel as if you are there all along with Elie. It's extremely disturbing when he writes about the hangings and killing, because once again you feel like you are right there with him. But what do you expect with a book of this nature? I feel that this book has enlightened me so much more than any history book will ever be able to do. If you want to really get a feel for what hell the Jews had to go through this is the book to read. Let the travesty of the holocaust never happen again."},{"Title":"Night","review":"In his introduction to NIGHT, his first of many books, Elie Wiesel worries that he has never found the right words to express his first-hand experience of the Holocaust adequately. Let us try to understand his worry. The phrase \\"cattle car\\" carries one set of connotations in its customary usage to describe a highly ventilated, sometimes roofless railroad car for carrying livestock. It connotes a terribly different environment when such a car is filled with 100 starving, rag-dressed human prisoners being transported through the teeth of a blizzard from one concentration camp to another. Or take the word \\"chimney.\\" Often of attractive stone or brick, it is a functional and often picturesque funnel for lifting stove or factory smoke into the sky where winds can dissipate it. But how do we react to that word once we understand that the smoke it lifts comes from the charring bodies of children thrown living into the furnace at its base? Perhaps human language has yet to evolve words that can express the emotional impact of such experiences.The limitations of language notwithstanding, Wiesel has produced, in only 141 pages (counting the introduction, the foreword, and his Nobel Peace Prize acceptance speech, none of which should be missed), an account of human suffering, torture, deprivation and death that every living human should read. It won't take much of our time to go through this book. I finished it in two sittings, my wife in one. Perhaps it is the feeling of incredulity that carries one from page to page so rapidly, for the reader can scarcely believe the extent of the atrocity unfolding before his eyes and hurries onward, searching for something that will relieve the horror growing in his consciousness.\\"Oh,\\" you say, \\"the book sounds like a real downer. I don't want to read something that's going to depress me.\\" Permit me, if you will, to quote from Wiesel's speech in Oslo in 1986. Referring to himself, Wiesel speaks:\\"And now the boy is turning to me. \`Tell me,' he asks, \`what have you done with my future, what have you done with your life?' And I tell him that I have tried. That I have tried to keep memory alive, that I have tried to fight those who would forget. Because if we forget, we are guilty, we are accomplices.\\" This, I think, is why we should read this book, with its horrific description of the Kingdom of Night, a night so black and unrelieved by any starlight, a night so interminable, a night so cold yet filled with such searing pain, that it destroys every vestige of human care and love and faith, leaving only a primal will to survive-until that, too, crumbles before the batons and the rifle muzzles and lies abandoned on frozen, blood-soaked ground.First written in Yiddish with the title \\"And the World Remained Silent,\\" Wiesel's autobiographical narrative was eventually translated into French as \\"la Nuit,\\" and from there into English. This edition is a new translation by Marion Wiesel, who, her husband says, \\"knows my voice and how to transmit it better than anyone else.\\" She has done a fine job, but, even so, isn't this nothing but old history now? Why bother with something that happened in a war that most of today's readers did not even experience? Wiesel himself answers us in his Oslo address:\\"There is so much to be done, there is so much that can be done. . . . As long as one dissident is in prison, our freedom will not be true. As long as one child is hungry, our life will be filled with anguish and shame. What all those victims need above all is to know that they are not alone; that we are not forgetting them, that when their voices are stifled we shall lend them ours, that while their freedom depends on ours, the quality of our freedom depends on theirs.\\" No, this book is not about an old event at all; sadly, its lessons are all too current.If I leave this book depressed, it is not because of Wiesel's experience and all the lessons that we have yet to learn; it is that there are those who claim that it was all a fiction, that history never happened, that all the problems in the world today are the result of the \\"Trilateral Commission and the Worldwide Communist-Jewish-Catholic Conspiracy,\\" which I really and truly overheard spoken in a restaurant in Dallas, Texas one day. Wiesel's book will make little impression on that speaker; for the sapient beings in the world, however, I recommend it."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This book is required reading in many American high schools. And now that Oprah chose it for her book club, an even wider audience will have access to it.I read it almost eight years ago, my freshman year of high school, and it is one of the most singularly powerful books I have ever read. You may not like it, you may not agree with the ideas presented, you may cringe and want to close your eyes, but you should read it. Wiesel's book is not about redemption or forgiveness or friendship. It takes a hard and painful look atwhat happens when people lose hope, lose faith, and are forced to view everyone around them as a potential enemy.This book was written to get a point across. And to shake people awake to what can happen in the world while people stand and watch on the sidelines. Wiesel was quoted once as saying that the world can fight hatred- but how can one fight indifference? In almost anything quoted by him, he talks about how the opposite of love and life and culture is not evil or hatred, but indifference.His book, Night, is a testament to that. You don't have to like it, you don't have to hate it, but you ARE forced to *think*, and to form an opinion about it, one way or another. And in that way, Wiesel thoroughly does his part to fight indifference."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I recently read the book \\"Night\\" for my highschool English class, and I found the novel to be incredibly powerful, despite it be being a rather short book.

I had to finish it thinking something positive would come at the end. But only death came; and not soon enough for some.

Because he emerged from Hell to tell it, the book also is a guide for all of us about going through suffering in life without hating or losing or humanity.At one point, this book was hundreds of pages long, but Elie Wiesel has wisely let silence speak as loudly as words in this memoir.

Not that I haven't MET people with the numbers tattooed on their forearms.This book was a PERSONAL story of the holocaust and he had the audacity to put this all on paper after it happened.This is a MUST read....may actually make you more tolerant."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I just couldnt put it down, I had read it when I was in highschool back in the 80s, but now that I re-read it it is just horrifying to think that this actually happened, babies used as target practice, horrible, inhumane!Well written and easy to follow.It is very strong and cruel, I do not know if this is a novel or a memoir, but it is horrendous.A MASTERPIECE"},{"Title":"Night","review":"\\" Never shall I forget that night, that first night in the camp, that turned my life into one long night seven times sealed.\\" Elie Wiesel makes this statement on page 34 of his memoir entitled NIght; this sentence showed me that Elie's life was forever changed by the concentration camps he was forced to endure.Night tells the story of Elie and his father during WWII while they were imprisoned in Auschwitz. This powerful memoir gives a first hand account of the inhumanity that was endured by the prisoners of Auschwitz and other concentration camps.Night is the most powerful book I have ever read. To think that these horrible things happened to humans at the hands of other humans sickens me. On page 32, Elie states \\"Babies! Yes, I did see this, with my own eyes....children thrown into the flames.\\" How could people be so evil and apathetic? Did they forget that these people were human just like them? Elie states in the preface of the book that he wrote this memoir to honor those who lost their lives, remember those who survived and ensure that something like the this never happen again. I think that these goals are accomplished through this book.We must never forget!"},{"Title":"Night","review":"Night is a memoir of Mr. Wiesel's horrible experience during the Holocaust. I read this book during my middle school years, and I vividly remembered one particular section of the book very clearly, even 10 years after I had read it. It is a section where Wiesel describes how a couple of German SS agents were hitting his father, because he was so weak to move. He recalls how he didn't even move a finger to help his father. Part of him even wished his father would die so that he didn't have to carry the burden of caring for his father.The next morning, Wiesel awakened to see the empty bed of his father, whom had passed over night and been moved out early in the morning. This exeperience alone would haunt even the strongest human being and probably ruin anyone's possibility of even a remotely bright future. However, Eli Wiesel understands that the days of the Holocaust and WWII were not just any other days. They were days when human beings no longer acted like human beings. Pain, evil, and apathy ruled the Earth during this time.This is certainly not the only section of the book that is graphic and almost too painful to read. The entire book is full of such events. It is extremely important for us to keep books and movies that re-tell the suffering of the Holocaust fresh in our mind so that we may never allow ourselves to comitt the same mistakes. Suffering of this magnitude should never, ever, ever, ever afflict any human beings ever again. Please buy and read this book, you will not regret it.Note: I suggest reading this book along with the Diary of Anne Frank and watch Schindler's List. Together, they will offer you at least a small glimpse of the hell that was the Holocaust."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I read this book well before I found out it was on Oprah's book club. My tenth grade English teacher had us read it for her class when we did a segment on the Holocaust and do a report on it. Like everyone else in the class I was reluctant to read it mainly because this teacher was known for given out poor quality books on subjects that were either boring or not powerful enough. And usually when it comes to the Holocaust you can count on the book being good.But this one surpassed the rest. Not only was it moving and an honest tear jerker but it was a quick read, one that could be read 50 times over and still never the power of the words. If you're in the mood for a good book that will tug at your heartstrings, pick this one up. He captures the Holocaust in a new, moving light and you'll never forget it.I'm just upset that this book is now famous only because Oprah says it's \\"cool\\"."},{"Title":"Night","review":"First, a piece of advice for reading this version of the memoir. Mr. Wiesel has included a preface to this translation. Read it LAST!! I was very glad I did. The preface not only gave away a key aspect of the book, it explained the book in such a way that had much more meaning having read the entire book first.The book itself is written in stark language that sets a tone appropriate for the subject matter. Coming in, I thought this was a book I should read as an account by a participant in the Jewish Holocaust. It sat on my nightstand until my reading list was open. However, today it is actually much more pertinent and poignant than a mere account of the brutality of the Nazis to the Jews in the mid-twentieth century. Considering the on-going diaspora and genocide going on today throughout the world, especially in Africa, Night resonates much more than one would expect 60 years after its events transpired.The brutal honesty of the author makes this much more than a day-by-day account of the hellacious experience. He relates what the effects of battling to just stay alive had on his relationships with his God, his religion and his father. There is something in that trilogy to which every reader can relate regardless of race or religion. Mr. Wiesel's candid introspection raises this account above any historical account I have read of the Holocaust - fiction or non-fiction.This is highly recommended for anyone interested in a moving memoir, the Holocaust or surprisingly, current events."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Wiesel's work is an amazing recollection of his experience during the holocaust. I need to preface my review by saying that I find holocaust literature fascinating so that should be taken into consideration while reading my review. For me the most amazing part of Wiesel's book is his ability to capture such a detailed photograph in words. This is only further enhanced by the fact that there are no wasted words in this book. It is brief and powerful."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I bought this for my grandson to read. It is on the required reading lists for many high schools.

Must read. I definitely would recommend to anyone if they are interested in the holocaust."},{"Title":"Night","review":"There are no words to describe the emotions that I felt when I first read \\"Night\\". Distressed... haunted... ashamed... do not even begin to express the feeling of reading Wiesel. I had never known that 100 short pages could terrify me so much, but they did. This short book haunts me to this day.While the images that it presented were terrible and awful to imagine, they are not what pains me. The twitching foot of the child hanging in the gallows for protecting a man suspected of sabotage fazed me, but the utter hopelessness in Eliezer's voice as he answers \\"Where is [God]? Here He is-He is hanging here on this gallows...\\" (62, 1982 edition) destroyed me.This book describes the reason that so many in America today (and even culture itself) have rejected God. They cannot understand how an all-loving and all-powerful God could have allowed this. How could God just sit back and let this happen? Why did He not step in and deliver his promised children?The truth is... I don't know. No one knows. Those who say that they know are probably trying to something. What I do know is that God does exist. I know that He is all-powerful and all-loving. I do know that He could have stopped the Holocaust. I know that He could have saved Elie Wiesel from the despair and hopelessness of feeling rejected by God and of rejecting Him back, but He didn't.I could preach that God did this to draw people to reliance on Him, but that wouldn't do anyone any good. What I will say instead is that God wants these questions. He wants us to angrily call out to Him. He wants our confusion. As Moshe the Beadle says, \\"Man raises himself towards God by the questions he asks Him\\" (2, 1982 edition). God can take your questions. He can take your despair. The Bible promises that He will be your Comforter. He promises that He will turn your sorrow into thanksgiving, \\"To grant to those who mourn in Zion-- to give them a beautiful headdress instead of ashes, the oil of gladness instead of mourning, the garment of praise instead of a faint spirit; that they may be called oaks of righteousness, the planting of the Lord, that he may be glorified.\\" (Isaiah 61:3 ESV)."},{"Title":"Night","review":"One of the most profound reflections on The Camps and the Holocaust.

I remember how haunting this book was back then; how strongly it affected me. It affected me so deeply, I began an intense study of the Holocaust(at least, it was intense for a 9th grader). When I read it this time, I felt the same haunting feeling and a desire to know more. A desire to learn all I can so that my grandchildren never forget what happened. The book is clearly written, with a strong, obvious, and dynamic plot. It was shorter than I remembered, but that is probably due to the fact that I read it over a semester all those years ago. Loved it! Should be used in every English curriculum."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Night (Oprah's Book Club)This book was spellbinding as I had never read a book that told the story as well as my neighbor who was a survivor of the death camps.

This book was amazing and can't believe I have missed it this long..Will continue on with more of his books as he tells the story well"},{"Title":"Night","review":"Night is a terrifying book about the horrors, as lived by the author, in the German concentration camps. It's a very powerful book that stays in your mind for sometime after completing it. I have read it twice now and I was as moved during the second reading as I was the first. It is a true story that portrays the young teenager's struggle with his innermost feelings and conflicting thoughts about life, family, basic survival, and his God as he lives through the hell to survive. This should be required reading in our high school history classes, as the best way to prevent history from repeating itself is to make yourself aware of it."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This book is basically beyond criticism; it is so utterly terrible and horrifying to read of the things that happened during the Holocaust, and the book itself is at times extremely painful to read. Although the writing style is a bit choppy, Wiesel's account of the Holocaust is so powerful, emotional, and thought provoking that it should not be turned down simply on account of it being uncomfortable. Wiesel's narrative takes you right into the heads of the suffering Jews, depicting their losses of hope, faith, humanity, and in some cases, sanity. It is a harrowing personal account of what it was like to be a Jew living in a concentration camp. I think that we owe it to the people that had to live through this evil episode in human history to read their story and experience their anguish with them. It is required reading in most High Schools, and though it is horrific, I think it should remain required reading, if not just to make certain an atrocity like this never happens again. It will definitely raise big questions. Again, this is an extremely, terrifyingly powerful novel, so be sure you are ready for such subjects before you pick up this book."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Seriously, if you are spending your time reading reviews of this product, you are wasting your precious time. Go ahead and buy it, because you will surely love it. The premise of the book is all of his war experiences. Wiesel is one of the best authors who ever existed. This book is the masterpiece of modern literature, and it should be read by everyone. It will make you cry, but it will give you a great measure of hope for the future and the world. Wiesel's experiences touch the heart, mind, and make you think a lot about your own mortality. It is a book to be read and reread. Please buy and be touched by Mr. Wiesel!"},{"Title":"Night","review":"This is an incredible story! I'm not a fan of the Oprah Club, but have read this story several times. This is a great one for young readers too. It is, of course, graphic in its description of the prison camp and the treatment of prisoners, but the only word of caution I might give for younger readers is for a short scene that mentions an officer and girl being discover in a barn together. I recommend this book for people who want to make WWII come alive, and as something other than \\"Diary of Anne Frank\\" to use with their teens."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I have read lots of books on WWII but never from this perspective.

The details were described in plain, everyday language so that the reader could envision the different scenarios. You envision a town where neighbors are well acquinted with each other so that when rumors start floating throughout, you experience the anguish. As the book progresses, taking you into a living hell with the writer, you come to understand how human survival and the will to live are innate. Also, the bond between son and father and the nurturing and caretaking was incredible."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Gripping novel. We should all read so we will never forget.

Not only did it relay one man's account of his experience during the holocaust, I think it was a powerful message about human nature, and the struggle to do what it right when your every instinct tells you to survive. I believe underlying is the story of a boys relationship with his father. A very powerful story."},{"Title":"Night","review":"When I first ordered this book, I thought I would not enjoy reading it but Oprah said it was an excellent book to read. The fact is I read it in two days. You actually could picture yourself in that time. The courage that this man and his father had knocks me right off my feet. I do not know if I have the courage they had. I have started to pass the book around so other people can also have the impact this book made on me. My daugther is now reading NIGHT."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This is a short book. The words are chosed as carefully as a Haiku poem. There are many excellent works on the holocaust (Primo Levy's expecially) but this goes beyond most to capture the feeling of a chilling event that even our souls dare not see. There are books with more details, more facts, more stories, more agony; but this stands out as probably the best I've read for capturing a moment in time."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I liked the book, but I was sad throughout the book. I still can not believe that another human being would do to others as this book reveils we did do. Great writing style. I felt I was there and could visualize everything Mr. Wiesel wrote."},{"Title":"Night","review":"With most great literary works it is the minute details that make these masterpieces so fantastic. Ingenious metaphors and comparisons are used to describe everything and to engross the reader. The lack of these elements helps Night to be so incredible. Elie Wiesel describes his experiences so bluntly that it shocks the reader. He does not try to describe the events in such a way to lessen the impact of them, but tells them as they happened, letting the full force of these horrible acts hit you. It is because Wiesel describes his experiences frankly that he is able to captivate the reader; you become engrossed in the life of this young man who goes through so much.While some may say that Wiesel is too direct in retelling his story, he has to be that frank. Night would not be as powerful and moving if Wiesel had tried to protect the readers. Our society needs to be aware of the horror of such events as the Holocaust. While there are many books on the Holocaust, novels and non-fictional works, Night may be the best of them all with its strong message and gripping portrayal of the life of a Jew during World War II."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I haven't read too many Holocaust books in my lifetime but I can honestly tell you that \\"Night\\" was quite the eye opener. My tag line explains my thoughts in general very well. \\"I never would of thought that such a terrifying novel could be so moving.\\" This book is no fictional, imaginative story, better yet it is an unreal but real portrayal of time spent in a place that no human being imagines possible. I don't usually think about people being burned, and people being tormented, or hurt, or beat, or even starved, because its not something normal. Its difficult to read a book and say to your self, \\"this just can't be possible, its not normal, and how could someone think up such a plan and put it towards human beings?\\" What I'm basically saying is that although his writing is rather straight forward and blunt, I think its better that way. If someone wants to learn about the Holocaust I don't think its right to sugarcoat things and make it seem okay, because it's not. What happened needs to be told the way it happened so people can read it and see it in there minds. The only difficult part is telling yourself that this story is no story, it's real.Throughout the whole story you see Elie's struggles and mental processes put out there so truly and fully. Everyday a teenager has to wake up to an inhumane barn of beds that most likely aren't easy to sleep on. Everyday a teenager has to wake up to terrible food and work every single day or be killed. Everyday a teenager has to wake up and keep himself strong knowing someone in his family might be dead by now. Those are the mental processes that I'm talking about. Thought's that need to be put out there, and are to the fullest extent. Wiesel holds back nothing, and lets go of every scene of horror that has been implanted in his mind forever. The main point that I'm trying to get at is that the best upside of this novel is the fact that we are getting a real life experience, the real thing. The only downside of the novel would be how short it is. It seemed that even though he had very detailed context, there were a few missing patches in the story that could have been filled in if the book were a little longer. I would have enjoyed to read fifty more pages of it, not because I enjoy seeing brutality towards people but because it's something that's important to learn about our history, and that there's a book in front of me that has it all. This is probably the shortest and best book at once I've ever read."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Night is a haunting and horrifying autobiography of a teenage Jewish boy's recollections of surviving Nazi concentration camps. Written in 1972, Night is still relevant today as genocide takes place in remote areas like Darfur and memories of genocides in other locations such as Rwanda are still fresh.Night is the first of a trilogy of books written by Wiesel and the first of his works to be published. In the foreword to the 2006 translation, (translated by his wife Marion), Mr. Wiesel does not claim to have survived out of any miracle or heroism or, for that matter, any rational reason whatsoever. His stated reason for writing Night was \\"...that of a witness who believes he has a moral obligation to try to prevent the enemy from enjoying one last victory by allowing his crimes to be erased from human memory... For the survivor who chooses to testify, it is clear: his duty is to bear witness for the dead and for the living. He has no right to deprive future generations of a past that belongs to our collective memory. To forget would be not only dangerous but offensive; to forget the dead would be akin to killing them a second time. \\"Wiesel's account of his time in concentration camps such as Auschwitz and Buchenwald is chilling and mesmerizing. While it was incredibly difficult to read because it was so horrifying, Night simply did not allow me to turn my head and ignore, as is often human nature to do from uncomfortable truths and images.Night begins in 1942, when Wiesel was a fervently observant Jewish teenager living under Nazi rule. Before the Jews under the Nazi regime believed that they could be rounded up en masse and killed in round-the-clock acts of genocide. In fact, what is horrifying after the fact is how much the Jews ignored the signs, mainly because they could not seem to grasp the possibility. When a Jewish man whom Wiesel had previously respected was taken away and later escaped from the concentration camps to return to the village, no one in his small village in Transylvania believed the man's \\"ravings,\\" believing him mad.The book goes on to detail how the Wiesel, his family and neighbors were gathered up, put onto cattle cars like stock and sent to the concentration camps. What struck me most was how dehumanized the survivors (including Wiesel) had to become in order to just survive. Sons turned on fathers, friends turned on friends, yet Wiesel's ability to stay close to his father throughout most of the time he spent in the concentration camps was likely what gave him the will to live. The horrors Wiesel witnessed throughout his year in the concentration camps led him into despair as a deeply religious Jew who saw true evil on a daily basis. However, the book does not demonize all the captors while sanctifying the inmates. Wiesel wrote about random kindness and helpful advice from other inmates that saved his father's and his lives as well as kindness from some of the guards. Soon after reading about a kindness or a rare moment of peace, the reader is faced with a heartbreaking description of how desperate inmates tried to strangle each other over rations of bread.Anyone who has taken a European history class encompassing World War II is aware of what happened in the concentration camps under the Nazis. What Night does incredibly well, is take the facts out of the history books, out of well-meaning books and movies like Schindler's List, by using one person's experience of such atrocities and how it affected him then (and now) and how it should be something that all people are outraged about, then and now.I can't say I enjoyed reading Night because it forced me, yet again, to accept that people are capable of doing such terrible things to other people. But, it is a book that will stay with me for years to come and that I plan to have my kids read when they are older. \\"Because if we forget, we are guilty, we are accomplices.\\" It forced me to face what man has done in the past and recognize that it is still happening today, despite the attempts of people such as Elie Wiesel, and to try to take some action to help prevent it from happening in the future.Oprah Winfrey recently chose Night for her book club, hard on the heels of the James Frey Million Little Pieces debacle. Despite not having read Frey's work, I feel safe in saying that Night is a memoir that will go down in time as one of the most influential and thoughtful, while Frey's book will become a mere footnote of self-aggrandizement and intellectual dishonesty."},{"Title":"Night","review":"As the book begins, you are dropped in the middle of a day in the life of young Elie.

I can say that it had a profound impact on me & I will never forget it."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This book was so very moving and touching. It is a raw accounting of a child's journey into adulthood through harsh circumstances. To have to see and hear the things the author went through would have been devastating to most people. The author lived through this event in his life and now lets people know what happened during this time in history. This book contains no conjecture, no fiction, it is all fact based and written as though he relives this every moment of every day. To that end he probably does. God Bless him."},{"Title":"Night","review":"....to describe this narrative. Whom among us would dare to critique a work such as this? Night is so much less an autobiography and more an experience.....Night chronicles in vivid detail the experiences of a young Polish boy (Elie Wiesel) whose life in his small town of Sighet, Transylvania, is full of his family and of his strong Jewish faith....until the German soldiers arrive. What follows chronicles his personal experience of the holocaust...from the expulsion of he and his family, friends, and Jewish neighbors from their homes to the restrictive ghettos. Their deportation to the various \\"work camps\\"..... for those that survived the inhuman journey. Upon his arrival at Birkenau, Wiesel tells of the separation of the men from the women....he and his father moved to the left, his sisters and mother to the right; that was the last time the author saw his mother and sisters. He and his father survive a series of concentration camps and the abuse that accompanied each...the work, the starvation, the abuse, and of course the \\"selections\\"...... where \\"doctors\\" determined with a flick of the wrist who would live and who would be \\"exterminated.\\" Shocking details amass in the book of sons turning against fathers, neighbor against neighbor. Details of a proud, religious people being reduced to unheard of acts of depravity because of thirst, hunger, cold. And throughout there is a young boy who, so pious in the past, struggles to find evidence of a God in the midst of such random killing of innocents. Having read this book decades ago, I am once again chilled to the sense of my being that man has the ability to be so evil..and my heart is full with the loss of so many men, women and children. How can a world sit on the sidelines and allow this to happen? How can a world continue to do so (Bosnia, Rwanda, Sudan)?A must read for all members of the human race....we owe the 6 million angels at least that much.DYB"},{"Title":"Night","review":"I'm new on the block.

( 5 to 10 is the norm for me)I couldn't wait to see what Wiesel was going to share next. I also couldn't wait for the punishment to be over. Having just discussed \\"Night\\" with a friend over coffee, we both agreed that one good thing about this book, is that it will cause most of us to see that what we feel are terrible, dreadful problems, might not be that bad afterall.

However, God has deemed it necessary to also give us the capability to do pure evil. Just as I am glad that we all learn about Shakespeare, Beethoven, engineering, law, etc, I believe it is our moral duty to remember what sorrow humans have brought upon each other. My fear is that time will erode our memories of the holocaust. My father was born in 1941, so, technically he was alive during the holocaust, although he may have been too young to remember the freeing of the prisoners from the concentration camps. I am the first generation to be born after the end of World War II. To my son, the holocaust may seem like ancient history.Elie Wiesel provides a no nonsense, somewhat detached eye witness testimony to what humans are capable of doing to each other. As a young boy (age 15), Wiesel witnesses the descent of human life from that of a pious teenager in a mundane rural village into a Godless skeleton. Like a nightmare, Wiesel recounts the horror of humans being reduced to \\"automatons,\\" fighting each other over scraps of bread. By the end of his ordeal, he no longer capable of sensing pain, emotionally or physically.I hope that people do not avoid reading Night because they are afraid it will make them feel \\"depressed.\\" Although emotionally provoking, \\"depressed\\" was not my response. Rather, upon completing it, I hugged my son and felt a deep appreciation for what I have. I hope people read this book as a reminder of the evil side of humanity. We should never feel so secure in the advancement of human culture that we deceive ourselves into believing that Auschwitz could never happen again. We must make certain, through our memories, that it will never happen again."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I have always loved this book. It is an amazing chronicle of an absolutely horrific time in history. For those being thankful that it is short or insinuating that Weisel might have fabricated his story I find that in really poor taste. If you have issues with James Frey maybe that could be taken up elsewhere? There are photographs in print of Elie Weisel in a concentration camp. The photos are rather famous and if you want more info perhaps you should look into it elsewhere. As for the book it is an amazing portrayal. I would have read every last word of weisel's story had it been 1000 pages or the short read that it is because he tells of a time in histroy that is important that we all face. Genocide is not simply a one time occurance. It is something that continues to repeat itself.

Wiesel's presentation moved us to tears, and moved us to anger, and moved me to want to follow up on his words by reading what he had written.This is written a style that seems to be typical of many modern Israeli novelists; it is so close to the truth of the actual events that transpired in Wiesel's life that it might as well be treated as autobiographical. Thus, it seems to some to be more a work like a novel than a memoir, but Weisel describes it himself as more of a deposition. It isn't autobiography in the traditional sense, but that is what helps give the book its power. Weisel remembers the events here, This is actually part of a trilogy - Night, Dawn, and The Accident - although each element stands alone with integrity. (Dawn and The Accident are works of fiction, but also draw on Weisel's own recollections and feelings.)How does one deal with survival after such atrocities as that at Birkenau and Auschwitz? How can one have faith in the world? How can one accept that a people so closely identified with a powerful God can ever accept that God again? Where is God in the midst of such things?Wiesel himself as spent his life in search of such answers, but doesn't provide them here. Why then would one want to read such accounts as these? Wiesel was silent for many years, until he was brought into speech and writing as a witness to the events. Wiesel proclaims that there is in the world now a new commandment - 'Thou shalt not stand idly by' - when such things are happening, one must act. One must remember the past in all its personal aspects to both honour those who suffered and to forestall such things happening again (which, given the the depressing repetitive nature of history, is a difficult task).This is the longest short book I've ever read. It is one that has stayed with me from the first page, and I've never been able to shake the images brought forward, the misery and suffering, the existence of evil and brutality, the sadness and desolation. We live in a culture that likes to gloss over pain and suffering, mask it with drugs and other things, and always end the story with a happy ending.There is no happy ending here - even Wiesel's own survival is a questionable good here. How does one live after this? How does the world go on?One thing is certain, we must never forget, and this book is part of that active remembering that we are called to do."},{"Title":"Night","review":"In a world that often feels like it is teetering toward relenting madness, Elie Wiesel's vividly haunting 1960 memoir still reminds us that there was a precedent for the deranged mindset that justifies acts of terrorism. In a concise, unadorned manner, he relives the spiraling insanity that surrounded the Jewish population of Sighet, Transylvania, as insulated a world as one could imagine and certainly a community who understandably could not embrace the insanity of the extermination occurring around them. Inevitably, they are taken to Auschwitz and Buchenwald, two of the most infamous concentration camps, where Wiesel provides painfully palpable detail of the day-to-day living conditions. He not only records the brutality and inhumanity of the Nazi guards toward the Jews, as other have, but more tellingly, describes the inhumanity of the camp inmates toward each other for the sake of survival.It's a stark peek into the nature of evil that is at once uncomfortable to acknowledge and invaluable to read and absorb. The propagation of evil from forces unexpected is what makes Wiesel's book resonate today. As we consider the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia, the Dili and Liquica Church massacres in East Timor, the 1994 Rwandan genocide (dramatized in the superb film, 2004's \\"Hotel Rwanda\\"), or most pertinently, the detention camps that exist today in North Korea, it is obvious that the Third Reich did not have a monopoly on justifying such slaughter. With his two older sisters, Wiesel was able to survive the camps and share his devastating story with future generations. Compressed from a much larger memoir Wiesel wrote in Yiddish, the book represents a powerfully affecting treatment that edits the key moments of his existence to their essence. The result is elliptical and startling. Like Art Spiegelman's \\"Maus\\" series, William Styron's \\"Sophie's Choice\\", Thomas Keneally's \\"Schindler's List\\" and of course, the most heartbreaking, Anne Frank's diary, Wiesel's work lends yet another piercing look into the unanticipated breaches of the human soul during one of history's most dire times. Strongly recommended."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I recently finished reading Night for a school project. This was my second time reading it and I noticed so much more detail this time. While it was a good read, I was wanting more. I wish Elie would have included more about his life. Also, I would have loved to know more about his sisters and other family members. I did some research and found out that Elie was actually reunited with his sisters! You would have never known when reading Night, I thought they had perished in the Holocaust. I also would have liked to know about Elie's life after the Holocaust. What were the long term effects? What does he have to say to the world about his experience? What advice does he have to offer to the world?"},{"Title":"Night","review":"Elie Wiesel's narrative of his own one-year experience spent in a concentration camp has appropriately become a classic in the field. Read it to find meaning in a seeming meaningless life. Read \\"Night\\" if you are going through your own \\"dark night of the soul\\" and want to find an answer to the perennial question, \\"Where is God?\\" Read \\"Night\\" if you think deeply about life and how it often falls on us and crushes us. Don't read \\"Night\\" only if you have a queasy stomach or the need to think that this life is a bed of roses.Wiesel discovered that, \\"God is there in the suffering.\\" His explanation is anything but trite. Instead, it grapples candidly with the confusion that life can and does bring. Fortunately Wiesel's candor leads to hope--the confidence that behind the evils in this life there resides a good God working out plans in a mysterious, yet glorious, way. The inner depths and black darkness of \\"Night\\" call us not to squeamish forgetting but to stark remembering. For only in remembering will we insist, \\"Never again!\\"Reviewer: Bob Kellemen, Ph.D., is the author of Beyond the Suffering: Embracing the Legacy of African American Soul Care and Spiritual Direction ,Spiritual Friends: A Methodology of Soul Care And Spiritual Direction, and Soul Physicians."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Two days after reading this book I am still staring at the computer screen speechless as I write this. Less is more and in 100 pages Night leaves me with the same feeling it left Elie Wiesel, not looking for revenge, but in a state of hunger to stop standing idly by. Every president that ever leads this country should be required to read this book to understand the deepest evils humans can possess."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Elie Wiesel's Night is truly a book for the decades. The emotional impact that this book creates can be overwhelming at times since you realize that Wiesel lived through one of the worst nightmares ever to grace the Earth. Somewhere deep inside us, there is a reservoir of determination, hope, and will that won't let us quit, no matter how horrendous the things around us. Few of us ever find it, but Wiesel did. He survived, and if his words can help one or two out there to survive trauma and darkness, then we can never thank him enough.I first read this book 14 years ago in high school and I cried when I finished. This book is that impactful. Brilliant choice."},{"Title":"Night","review":"\\"Night\\" by: Elie Wiesel...was a breathtaking read.I came across \\"Night\\" as a school assignment. Which=a major grade. I started to read it as a chore...but as I dove deeper into the depth of the this novel..it was like a gift of appreciation. The appreciation of \\"FREEDOM\\" that we take for granted everyday.When you read this book...it is literally like you personally, were shipped off to a German Concentration camp. I recall feeling a deep sympathy for the unexpecting Jews. Noone should be treated as these people were...and we take the Freedom that we have as a given. But, what happened in \\"Night\\" just goes to show, that we can not take this free life that we live for granted. God can test your faith just as he did these Jews...but the challange is on you...to see if you will with hold on your FAITH.I recommend \\"Night\\" for anyone of any age to read. It is definitely an \\"Eye opening\\" experience that i am thankful to have come about."},{"Title":"Night","review":"What impressed me most after \\"Night\\" was Elie Wiesel's ability to retain a pure heart. I can't imagine living through so much evil and still having the ability to love. \\"Night\\" tells of Wiesel's horrifying existence in the Nazi death camps and pays tribute to his overwhelming desire to survive. I cried through each page and can't imagine the strength it took to come out of that nightmare alive. To see what Elie Wiesel has done with his life since has been miraculous and life affirming.This is not a book for the faint of heart as it is a real account of the horror endured by Wiesel and his family in the Nazi death camp. I thought I knew about the Holocaust but now I have a deeper understanding, something I was missing before. I applaud Elie Wiesel for his courage and perseverance and for sharing that with us in \\"Night.\\""},{"Title":"Night","review":"Imagines described from this book still ring in my head. I read this in one sitting today. I think it is supposed to be unforgettable. To do away with a whole class of people is horrid and I was just in shock at the treatment.Do you pray for the end to come or to outlast? What a moving piece of work. I think this book is one to be read, never to be forgotten and to remember what others have gone through. God Bless Mr Wiesel."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Night provides the reader glimpses of horrors that the rest of humanity forgot. I read it in one day, yet its message will stay with me for the rest of my days. It is powerful and thought provoking, making you re-evaluate/re-establish your views of the Holocust and your sense of duty to human kind around the world. Elie Wiesel magically takes you there not only in sights and sound, but in spirit. Everyone should be exposed to Night."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I am a high school teen who had to read this story for literature class. I was regretting this assignment. After starting this book, I was truly hooked from the very beginning. Reading about a teen just like me having to go through all that pain and suffering and at the same time losing faith in his Lord he so long had trusted. I can honestly say that after reading Night, I enjoyed every bit of it from beginning to end."},{"Title":"Night","review":"In the introduction to E.W.'s powerful book, he explains that his wife, Marion, has translated this edition to be a more accurate and complete version of his original Yiddish manunscript. In the intro, he provided new, expanded versions of the book's beginning, the section on the death of his father, and close. However, when one reads the book, these modified passages are not included. I was very confused by this. Were others?"},{"Title":"Night","review":"When I first read this book, it was by force from my English II teacher in High School. I thought that this book was going to be like all the other books forced onto us, boring with absolutely no plot line but has advanced vocabulary words. How wrong was I! This book has a very powerful moral lesson, and gives readers an inside view on the happenings of the Holocaust. It is a very powerful and emotional book, and I recommend it to mature readers who can understand the significance of telling this tale."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This book is a true account of a WW2 concentration camp survivor. There is so much emotion within this retelling of Wiesel's experience and the quality of the writing is impressive. Despite the beautiful writing, the content is disturbing and haunting, however. Elie captured what happened to him so eloquently that it is poetic and the poetic nature of the prose is a sharp contrast to the horrific nature of his experience. The result is a biographical tale that illustrates both his helplessness and the tragedy of his ordeal and a story that also is a great artistic endeavour."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I was one of the few who had not read \\"Night\\" in school. When Oprah put it on her list, I was anxious to read it because I'd always had an interest in WWII and the Holocaust. As I've come to expect from an Oprah selection, the book was impressive and left an impression on me.Even though the book was only a little over 100 pages, upon finishing, you feel as if you've been on an endless journey. Obviously, what occurs in the book, Elie's account of his experience, is tragic, upsetting and it's beyond words; as he himself says. I guess what compells someone to read this book and take something away, is that this was a true story, this happened and learning from it is what any of us can do to right any part of this horrible event. If nothing else, we should never forget."},{"Title":"Night","review":"God bless Elie Weisel, the author of \\"Night,\\" for sharing with others a sense of what it was like to try to exist behind barbed wire in a Nazi concentration camp. Such unconscionable inhumanity should, in of itself, confirm the notion that \\"Evil\\" does exist in the world, and can rear its head if given the opportunity to do so & is not resisted. How many times must this lesson be learned? Cambodia, Rwanda, Bosnia, and now in Sudan. It's not the possibility of \\"evil\\" that is our problem though. It is our unwillingness to recognize it swiftly enough so that we may be able to do something about it in time. With Sudan look how the world continues to give that government the benefit of the doubt as thousands are exterminated---with first Colin Powell & then President Bush calling it what it is: genocide. Yet the world....papered over reports of Lenin & Stalin's butchery until such dirty deeds were completed by said dictators; looked the other way in Cambodia; ignored Rwandans; and stood up for Saddam Hussein even after 17 United Nations' Resolutions declaring him in breech of international law. Mass murder by brutal regimes may be impossible to prevent in all cases, but we sure can try our best therein & books such as Mr. Weisel's---showing the face of evil, so we can better recognize it for what it is---are must reading, consequently. I'm heartened that many teenage students are exposed to this book in schools across the USA annually; for only through education can people become men & women \\"of the world\\", intellectually speaking; and only by becoming such can come \\"to conceive of minds of men markedly different from themselves\\"---ie., ones instilled by evil. The words are Soviet historian Robert Conquest's, one of the few lonely voices who sought to enlighten the world vis-a-vis Stalin's murderous behavior, when liberals and leftists excused such away with the notion that \\"one has to break a few eggs to make an omelette\\"---the idea that building socialist ends outweighed treating humans as living/feeling beings. That's why Elie Weisel so often speaks publicly that to forget what happened in Nazi Germany is not going to help us prevent incarnations of such behavior from occurring in the future. We are not living up to his admonitions, of course, but---thankfully, we are beginning to make some headway of late, but hardly enough. The African Union, Russia & China continue to stall forcefull measures against the murderous Sudanese government. At some point the issue concerning whether taking action outside the United Nations is warranted. I think we have reached that point already, and it is thanks (in part) to the consequences of inaction (or ever delayed action) conveyed by Mr. Wiesel's experiences that Mr. Weisel's book/experience/words remain ever relevent still. P.S. I listened to the audio version of \\"Night\\" and hearing such words that make up this book were perhaps more moving than had I re-read them (having first read the book some years back). Hence, I offer up the suggestion of considering the audio edition of this book as an alternitive to the bound version. (05Feb) Cheers!"},{"Title":"Night","review":"Night is filled with integrity, captivating realism and wisdom. They say that if we don't remember history, we're doomed to repeat it and this book stands out more as a first person account of a terrible atrocity than as a work of \\"fiction.\\"This harrowing tales takes us through the struggles of a young man who is torn between what he believed in and what he experienced in the Holocaust. A riveting, timeless tale of desperation that leads into hope and a call to action.This stunning work of fiction is more like a self-revealing autobiography. With his faith and belief called into question after his horrific stay in the Nazi war cells, witnessing atrocities that are hard to describe, but this author does so incredibly with an eloquence that both renders you helpless from actually feeling the pain of the victims to a bit skittish in the stomach (not for the tender stomached people).This book will be one you can put down and is a must have for any history buff or anyone for that matter. You will never forget this one I am certain."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I just finished reading this book in one sitting, and I must say that I absolutely loved it. I was expecting for a tearjerker, and although I didn't exactly shed any tears, it was good all the same. I was truly moved by this well written novel and was able to connect emotionally with the main character Eliezer. Through this novel, Elie Wiesel greatly depicted the ideas of discrimination, god, silence, and brutality amongst men with great intensity.This book does more than tell a story it teaches and warns us about the evil that lurks among us. Hatred is a monster none of us can afford to feed, but there are those who do. Oppression continues to this day. Stories of horror continue to write themselves and most of us, too many of us, do nothing about it. I've learned from this book that silence is a deadly weapon easily welded and often used. I hope and I think it's the author's hope that we disarm that weapon and speak out. Do something...even if it's recommending this book to a friend as I do to you. Read this book."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I've read and seen different accounts of the Holocaust, but Elie Wiesel's story is very moving. In his words, he takes you through his experiences. Sometimes I felt overwhelmed by the horror and other times I felt such sorrow. A book is excellent when it can draw out your emotions."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Night by Elie Wiesel is a terrifying book. It gives you a first hand account of what life was like in the concentration camps in Germany. The book is only about 120 pages long, but it gives you an amazing story. Wiesel shows us how life was like down to the food, the harsh words, the leaders and the hospitals. From the book, you can truely see how hard and difficult life would have been.The book has amazing power. It is a book that you would read and think about why this happened, who could do something this awful? Why? The book gives you a sad, true and terrifying account of several different camps from the day that he arrived, to the day when the camp was liberated. Even though he was not at the camp for the entire war, you can see the impact that it made on him."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Of course, there are many accounts of Jewish suffering in the Nazi concentration camps, and some may be more bloody and gruesome than this one. However, you must take into account what Wiesel did afterward. Instead of become an embittered, reclusive vagabond, he took what he could learn from the experience and spent the rest of his life trying to help others and sharing lessons that could actually make the world a little better place. So, though the account is brief and rather matter of fact, it holds within it the heart of a champion for peace. In place of emoting self-pity and angst, Wiesel tells his story simply and deliberately, and we must be thankful that this was only the beginning."},{"Title":"Night","review":"NIGHT by Elie Wiesel is a piercing account of the horrors of concentration camp, which impressed an incredible toll both internally and externally on his being. As a young adolescent, he is ripped from his home, plummeted to the depths of suffering, and driven to the edge of his own humanity. Mr. Wiesel openly shares with readers the tremendous weight of these experiences etched within his soul. His courage in doing so should be lauded.From Mr. Wiesel we can learn that regardless of the burden from the sins of others imposed upon us and our own sins, it is possible to endure - and even to help others do so.In that vein, I would recommend another memoir to readers of NIGHT - called A BEAUTIFUL WORLD, written by Gregg Milligan. It is a book you will not be able to put down - a deeply moving account of the indomitable human spirit as seen in the heart of a young child subjected to severe physical, mental and sexual abuse.In the author's own words, he shares his story to help others \`buckle down and bear the ride' through their own hell - and know that they are not alone. A BEAUTIFUL WORLD is an incredible testament to the perseverance of hope. Exquisitely written and heart wrenching, it is an unforgettable story.Both A BEAUTIFUL WORLD and NIGHT offer readers a chance to adjust their own perspective on suffering through the examples of both authors. Though they have suffered greatly and will never leave this experience behind, they will not allow it to end them either.Further, both authors possess the incredible courage to reach out and share their stories, giving of themselves for the benefit of others. The astounding resiliency shown in that act alone speaks volumes of them as human beings -- and the words they press to paper will ever live on in the hearts of those that read them."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This small, 120-page volume was originally published in 1958, fresh on the heels of the end of WWII. I think this is one of the most important books I have ever read. Having until recently put off reading disturbing accounts of WWII experiences--from all sides--I picked this up when my daughter was assigned to read it for high school. I'm glad I did. This is a historical account, yes, of one young man's experience of the war, but it is also a psychological self-criticism, and expos&eacute; of our universal human frailty and biological wiring for survival at all costs. It is impossible not to feel a strong connection to Wiesel, and to empathize with the choices he must make as he faces death, over and over again. It made me wonder what kind of a person I might become if I had to face the same horrors that Wiesel, and so many others (including some in my own family), had to face. I hope I never have to find out.One of the most poignant and disturbing events in the book occurs in the beginning, when the town \\"oddball\\" miraculously escapes a round-up and massacre, and manages to return to Wiesel's town. Once there, he tries desperately to warn people of the horrors he has witnessed, but no one believes him. Today we have the blessing of hindsight, however, this image haunts me as we face such tumultuous times today and need to sift fact from illusion. Will we be able to know what's a possible occurrence, and what is not? Will we be able to trust ourselves to make the right decisions and keep evil at bay? Again, I hope we never have to find out."},{"Title":"Night","review":"If you haven't read this book then you must read it. I have nothing else to say about it than that. The feelings and emotions this book stirred within me are too great to put into words. At the end of the book there is a speech given by Elie Wiesel and there were two phrases that jumped out at me and that's what I will finish with.Neutrality helps the oppressor, never the victim. Silence encourages the tormentor, never the tormented. Sometimes we must interfere."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I've never read such a short book with such a huge impact. When I read this as part of a college class, we learned that it was originally some 600 pages long. Then the author decided to cut it down to the absolute bare bones - and it worked brilliantly.Too much writing could cushion the devastation - getting bogged down in details could allow a reader to become jaded. However, such stark minimalism forces a reader to think about what is being said. And significantly, Wiesel doesn't describe every horror. He leads us to the brink, and lets the reader imagine the next step. Rather like watching a horror movie and seeing a character walk into the dark without seeing what happens to them. Just as many Jewish families had to do during this time, when loved ones were taken away never to return. The intentionally large gaps between some of the paragraphs faithfully evoke the silence the author needs to convey so a reader must contemplate what has passed.Much like \\"The Color Purple\\" evoked the reality of blacks in that time with the deceptively simple diary of one young black woman, \\"Night\\" reveals the tangible horror the Jews faced around WWII from the eyes of a Jewish boy. I have seen the film version of The Color Purple, and also Schindler's List. Both are strong films, but they lack the power of this simple narrative. The best book I have ever read about the tragedy of the Holocaust."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Heartless, evil, murder. These are the three best words I can use to describe the actions within the pages of this extraordinary novel.\\"Never shall I forget that Night in the camp, that turned my life into one long night seven times sealed.\\"This is the quote that led me to believe the emotional torture a person can be brought through, after going through a concentration camp.Moishi the Beadle tries to tell everyone that infants were getting thrown up in the air and used as target practice! Can this be possible for one human to do this to another, especially so small and helpless?In the book Night, Elie describes his and his fathers time in the Auschwitz concentration camp during WWII. They must battle the cold, God, inhumane conditions and punishments, and look death in the face. The theme of the book is Night, meaning darkness, loneliness, fear, and anticipation.I loved this book and the honest style of Elie Wiesel. In this completely true book, I learned a whole new milestone in history. \\"Never shall I forget.\\"I recommend this book for the young adult and older for mature descriptions and it is a higher reading level."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This book is a must read, especially for young people, as we move further away in time from the Holocaust. It is very well written; you almost feel like you are right there beside the author enduring all the emotional and physical pain that he felt. This book chronicles the author's life from a young child until the day he was released from a concentration camp. He describes his living conditions in the camp, the behavior and attitude of the prison camp guards, and his relationship with other prisoners around him. He also recalls how his father died right before his eyes. This book brought tears to my eyes more than once."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This was about Elie and his family who are rounded up from their home town of Transylvania and shipped off to Aushwitz. Elie gives a detailed account of his experience, from the time they were put in the \\"ghetto\\", to the day of liberation. Everyone in the world should read this book. Hopefully, we can learn from this history and never let it happen again. If any book can reveal the horrors of the holocaust, this one can."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I do not know why it took me so long to read Wiesel's personal account of the Holocaust. Perhaps something in me just did not want to go there, but I am glad I did. This well-written and moving account of human depravity and the ability to survive it (by some) will always cause me to closely scrutinize my motivations, the motivations of others, and, especially, the motivations of governments. It was his account of Juliek, the young violinist, that moved me the most. He played to his death a Beethoven violin concerto. What a haunting image. Don't let the subject matter deter you from reading this magnificent piece of literature."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Night is the terrifying story and reviling truth about what happed to millions of Jewish families while they were in concentration camps viewed by a young Jewish boy's eyes.Night is about a boy named Elie Wiesel and the terrifying account while he was in a Nazi death camp and how he lost his innocence and his religion.The story takes place in sighet a village near the Carpathian Mountains between 10,000 and 20,000 mostly orthodox Jews. When Germans invaded Hungary some believed they were not in danger but Moshe the beadle warned the Jews to try to save them but no one would hear what he as talking saying \\"Jews, listen to me! It's all I ask of you. No money. No pity. Just listen to me!\\"He would also tell them that he was put in cattle trains and was sent northern poland to work as a slave. Every one thought he had gone crazy because he was talking about how jews first had to make a big hole and when done had to present his neck and would get shot, also how little babies would be thrown into the air and how machine gunners would use them as targets.No one would listen to him until the day the germans were slaming on their front door."},{"Title":"Night","review":"The Book Club that I lead opted to read this as soon as we learned of it being chosen by Oprah. The concensus of the group is that we were disappointed. One explanation is that NIGHT is lacking in passion. Admittedly, this was a quick read, and we wonder if the translation is more at fault than the author, who's original transcript exceeded 800 pages. This will probably prove to be an excellent introductory book, and may well find its place on school shelves. Those of us who are more mature, and familiar with books and films describing this horrible period in our civilization, will not find anything new or insightful in this edition of NIGHT."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Although this is a powerful Holocaust story, Elie Wiesel is very bitter and his bitterness goes far deeper than he admits. He blames his bitterness on the Holocaust, and considering what he went through at the hand of the Nazis some of this, of course, would be valid. But I see his deeper bitterness as stemming from an earlier source: his \\"beloved\\" family of childhood.It struck me that the Holocaust gave Wiesel a great excuse to manifest his bitter, angry, resentful childhood feelings (which should have legitimately been directed toward his parents) onto a safe target: the Nazis.After all, who could dare criticize him?A scene from the book which confirmed my perspective: Wiesel is at Buchenwald (on page 101 of the paperback) and brings his feverish father a cup of water (or is it coffee?---it's not clear). His father gulps it down, at which point Elie Wiesel provides the reader with the following commentary: \\"With those few gulps of hot water I probably brought him more satisfaction than I had done during my whole childhood.\\"Although this line is meant to sound like hyperbole, I actually think he's telling the truth."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Elie Wiesel wrote a harrowing novel about the experience of ultimate evil. It is a recommended book because we assume that remembering the evil of the past makes us better human beings. But does it?Wiesel himself is unfortunately the proof that it doesn't. He has turned the memory of the holocaust into kitsch in the service of excusing evil; he has made the Jewish holocaust into a yardstick that denies the seriousness of other sufferings. Wiesel, for example, refused to comment on the massacre of Sabra and Shatila.Adam Schatz commented this month in the LA times on how Wiesel uses his moral authority for the worse:For example, Wiesel does not believe that Gypsies and gays should be remembered alongside Jewish victims of the Holocaust, although hundreds of thousands of them perished. He has frowned upon the use of the term \\"genocide\\" in reference to the Armenian holocaust....he has long maintained that the 1948 Palestinian refugees left voluntarily, \\"incited by their leaders,\\" a claim that Israel's own historians have done much to shatter.In the face of abundant evidence from human rights groups that Israel has committed widespread human rights violations in the occupied territories, Wiesel has either denied such reports or loftily asserted that, as a Jew who does not live in Israel, he has no right to air his criticisms...So go read Wiesel, but don't forget to ask yourself. What is the point of remembrance? When does memory become kitsch? When does sheding tears over some horrors become an exercise in denying other horrors? When does asserting one's pain become a way of forgetting the pain of others?"},{"Title":"Night","review":"I got this for a gift and they enjoyed reading this."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I bought this book thinking I would learn more about the Holocaust,but that was not the case. I rate it fair and somewhat boring."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This book is, of course, a work of perfection. It's a crippling tale about the trials of Wiesel and his family as they persevere in the face of death. It may be the best book ever written on the Holocaust.But really, I needed to write something to say how disgusting I find it that all of you are reading this book simply because Oprah is telling you to. I'm glad that you are reading it, don't get me wrong, and that you are all more literate because of Oprah, but you shouldn't need a talk show host to dictate what you read. It's an awful thing, to be without independent thought, though it seems much of America is heading that way.I'd also like to encourage people to re-think their positions on this whole James Frey business. American Literature is in danger. The fact of the matter is that almost all of the greatest memoirs and autobiographies of our time have been, in part, fabricated. I'm talking about books that have affected thousands of people - \\"On the Road\\", \\"A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius\\", \\"East of Eden\\" and a host of others. The authors embellish so that the work is more interesting and reads easier. Real life is boring. Everyone knows that. Authors have been embellishing their works since the beginning of time. The best-selling book of all time is obviously embellished, at least in some parts. But now Oprah has decided she doesn't like it, so down goes the system. Hundreds of years of literature, studies of style and storyline, works of utter perfection, all down the drain because Oprah feels \\"lied to\\". The implications of this are horrifying. There is a distinct possibility that either fiction or biographies, as genres, will disappear. When writers are limited in their writing, when poetic license is suspended, when the RIGHT TO FREE SPEECH is taken down by Oprah, America is in a state of decline."},{"Title":"Night","review":"it didnt came on time and i got an F on a report i had to do based on the book becuse i didnt have the book!"},{"Title":"Night","review":"(OOOOOOOOPS!!! My review has been posted and to my embarrassment I realize that I have made a MISTAKE. I wanted to give the book five stars instead of one. At this stage of editing I am unable to change the incorrect rating. But since I can add to the main body of the text I wanted to at least set the record straight. Sorry for the mistake.)Elie Wiesel is a genius. He makes you feel the horror of hatred. And yet he doesn't leave you in total despair as the book ends.All of us wonder how a just God can allow unjust things to happen on earth. Wiesel doesn't offer simple \\"bumper sticker\\" answers. But he does get us thnking.Another book I read this year, \\"Christmas Gifts, Christmas Voices\\" by John Allen similarly explores the question of bad things happening to good people.Both books are challenging, and at times so gut-wrenching that they are difficult to read. But they both offer valuable insights."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This is a very powerful book, but seriously, this book is number one on amazon because of Oprah's book club? Did these people who bought this book never go to middle school or high school? Not to take anything away from Elie Wiesel, he is a great author, but what even psuedo-intellectual has not read some of his work before? If the people in Oprah's book club need Oprah to guide them to a great piece of literatrue like this, than I doubt that they have the mental fortitude to fully understand this book."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I was not completely intrigued with the book.

An amazing story."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This book is receiving 3 stars because the length makes it perfect for any high school student to read. The holocaust is something every child should study to prevent it from ever happeing again. But my personal preference in regards to the subject is The Diary of Anne Frank. Anne Frank makes you feel like you are enduring everything happening to her but Night was more like reading a documentary on the subject."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This was another book I had to read for school and when I heard about it, it seemed kind of interesting. I had heard a lot of things about it and many people said it really impacted them. When I finished reading it, though, it was a little hard for me to understand why the book had gotten such rave reviews.This is not a book you can \\"enjoy\\" and I really can't say that I did. The book was filled with emotionless passages describing hangings, beatings, and the general horrors of the Holocaust. I will say that it was interesting in the fact that it was the first book I read about the Holocaust that actually described what went on inside the concentration camps. I think that that is really the one reason that I will give this book three stars, for the simple fact that it is one-of-a-kind. Correct me if I'm wrong but this is the only book I know of that is an actual account of a person living through the concentration camps.The writing style of Elie Wiesel, though, is really unamazing. He writes in short, simple sentences that are supposed to be a kind of \\"style\\" that conveys his emotionlessness in the ordeal. I really think the book could have benefitted from being written in a different way. The way it is written did not move me at all. I had to question myself as to why I would keep reading the book. Also, the narrator is constantly reminding the reader of his lack of will to live. It makes reading the book even more arduous. I cannot speak of what I would have done in his situation, because I was simply not there, but I would like to think I would have had something of a will to survive. I would read the book thinking, \\"Why doesn't he fight for his right to live? Why won't he see beyond the seeming hopelessness of his situation and... just try, just...?\\" I wanted to reach into the pages and just like shake the guy and say, \\"You gotta get a hold of yourself, man. Grin and bear it, or something. You can make it.\\" Again, I can't say how I would of acted in that situation, but I was very frustrated reading it as he simply had no will to surive. Whatsoever. Reading the book was like witnessing a very slow death. It was probably meant to be read that way, but witnessing a slow death does not appeal to me at all.Call me simpleminded, but I like books with satisfying endings, with climaxes, with any kind of action. This book really has none of that. I think this book was a very good historical account but a novel it is not. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone unless they are some kind of historical scholar. Most can imagine what kinds of things went on in the concentration camps, and if you have any kind of imagination whatsoever, you can leave the book closed. It was very gruesome. I am not a very sensitive person but it definitely shook me up a little.I give this book three stars for the fact this book functions as a good historical account of the concentration camps and for the fact that it must have taken the author a lot of blood, sweat, and tears to write the book. I will not say it was enjoyable by any means. Read this book if you really, really want to know what happened in the camps. If you just want a book, a good novel that will leave you with any kind of peace of mind, I would recommend you not to read it."},{"Title":"Night","review":"A good book for my bookclub discussion. Easy and fast reading with alot of topics for discussion."},{"Title":"Night","review":"The book Night by Elie Wiesel was always an interesting and eye catching piece. There was never a boring part of the book. Every part of Night was always grabbing my attention. Even when I only had time to read a few pages, I would end up reading 20-30 pages at a time because it was so great. The book is a true story and it starts off with Elie, his father, mother, and sister at their home. Then they are selected and out of the whole family just Elie and his Dad survive and his mother and sister are executed. While Elie and his father survive the Auschwitz concentration camp, they endure beatings, random executions, and even the crematorium. Towards the end of the book Elie and his father have been at the camp for a couple years and the dad is very weak and has aged a great deal. He is beaten so bad by the Nazis that he dies a slow death. The book Night was an interesting and eye catching book from front to back. When I was finished with the book I was a little angry because I didn't want the book to end! The only negative part about the book was the length of it. Since it was only 100 pages I don't know if Wiesel was able to say everything he wanted to say in a very thin book. I would think that if I had survived a concentration camp and if I was the only living family member alive I would have a little more to say about it than just a short book."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This account of concentration camp life depicts the horror and fear and the depravity of man but fails to address man's response to it. In Viktor Frankl's Man's Search for Meaning, he also gives the reader a sense of the unbelieveable cruel treatment by the Nazis. But he also addresses the choices each person has to respond to such treatment. He applies the situation to man's ability to react to any given circumstance -the freedom to choose one's own way.In A Prisoner and Yet... by Corrie ten Boom faith in God is shown to sustain and raise one's life above the insanity of the imprisonment. Although her sister dies, both trust God for the future on earth and in heaven.Night is worth the read but should not be considered the definitive book on the Holocaust."},{"Title":"Night","review":"It feels weird to review someone's experience because it is there's and there's alone. But, since this book was soooo pumped up and raved over, I ran right out and got it. I heard so many things or saw specials on the holocaust and to get the chance to read someone's actual experience, I was bracing myself for so much more in terms of details of everything I've heard or seen. But the bulk of the book was during the time spent where they ate, slept and worked. And I really wondered why he didn't address more about his mom and sister. Although they were separated, he didn't seem to talk about them anymore, his feelings for them or what did he ever find out about them. I don't know, I don't want to make light of someone else's story, but this book was so raved about and I really braced myself for more. I know he was writing probably exactly what happened to him, but I guess I was so filled with anticipation of reading and learning about it more that it was kind of a let down to read more about eating, sleeping, working and being checked."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Night by Elie Whitney is surely a book that will keep you entertained.

It's amazing that I can sit in my house and eat a bowl of ice cream, and people in this world have gone through hell, and seen the evil perils of man. Wiesels book is a memoir of his boyhood in a concentration camp. His experience is heartbreaking, and amazing. It's mind-blowing what these prisoners went through, all the time keeping faith. Wiesel's journey makes him question his faith, but the will to survive is what amazes me most. That humans can go to the depth's of suffering, and want to continue on ....is just mind boggling.Wiesel's story will touch and move you and make you question life, and ask yourself some serious what ifs. Mostly, I think it's important to read this book because at our core, we're all human, and vulnerable, yet so capable of rising against adversity and struggle. That some would help others, and some would not, that some kept up the fight and some did not will make you realize the meaning of being a human being. For all the cruel things that young Elizer encounters, and sees, you feel his pain and torture that he carries all through his life.You won't regret reading this, and you won't ever forget it. I read it in a few short hours...that I honestly feel have changed me forever."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Although this book is short, it is just as powerful as Anne Frank's diary. Everything that can be said- is said. This book will have a huge impact on all readers.Wiesel is a blessed survivor. His personal accounts of painful and traumatizing events simply define the Holocaust. His experiences in the horrendous Hell will leave you with many hard questions about humanity. It will open your eyes, make you stop, think, and be grateful for what you have. Everyone should read this book because it would enrich our lives and make us better people. Wiesel will make his \\"unforgettable night\\" be ours just as well.------In the words of Wiesel, \\"Whoever listens to a witness, becomes a witness.\\""},{"Title":"Night","review":"Elie Wiesel conveys the real life horrors of life in a Nazi Concentration Camp. As a teenage boy, Elie and his family are taken by force to one of Hitler's numerous death camps scattered throughout Eastern Europe. Soon after entering Auschwitz, Elie and his father are separated from his mother and little sister. He would never again see his mother and sister. Elie shares how he survived the daily struggles of camp life despite the unspeakable and inhumane treatment by his captors. Amazingly, Elie and his Father manage to remain physically close until just a few months before the camps were liberated. No doubt, their mutual support contributed greatly to their individual survival.In this book, Elie depicts in vivid and verbally graphic detail, the essence of what it meant to be a doomed Jew, sentenced to life and ultimately death in a living hell on Earth. From the pungency of the crematoriums to the agonizing screams of human suffering, the reader can vicariously experience this hell, and thus gain a better empathy for victims of the Holocaust. Victims who were robbed of everything including both personal dignity and the God given right to be treated as humans.Elie Wiesel's \\"Night\\" should be read by this generation and generations to come. Elie's story needs to be told and told again. By doing so, hopefully, this ultimate atrocity against humans will not only be remembered, but lessons will be learned from it as well. Lest history be obliged to repeat itself."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This is a book that evokes sorrow, as it should. A unique telling of his Holocaust experiences, Mr. Wiesel moves us to action to guarantee nothing of its kind is allowed to exist again.

It is, however, a story that needs to be read."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This is not the sugar-coated pity-party that some novels about tragedies such as the Holocaust appear to be. This is real. The emotional impact of Elie Wiesel's work is only realized when you think: This actually happened. There's no good way to write about the evils of which humanity has shown itself capable, but Wiesel's way is powerful. The narrative is simple and unadorned - it tells it the way it was - and transports the reader to a world of unimaginable horror. This should a novel that everyone should be required to read - only the truly depraved would be unaffected."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This book is about a young boy, about 15, who is sent to a concentration camp along with the rest of his family. It is an autobiography, so the author is writing about his own experience, his own life. It is powerful, dark, and sad. It moved me and made me truly think about the plight of the Jews in Hitler's time, and it opened my eyes to genocide, and how truly horrible it is. Though it is only 115 pages, it conveys the whole story and you can understand and even feel the situation. This author has written a lot of books, and I consider Night one of the best of his written works. This is a page-turner and I would gladly read it again. Out of all the books I am reading right now, this is the most moving and captivating.This sad tale of a young boy and his fight to survive and keep his family with him will move anyone and keep you captivated throughout the 115 pages of true horror.Warning: not recommended for those under 12.

It's dark and difficult to read at times, but this story will chill you to the bone."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I highly recommend this book to everyone who desires a glimpse into the events of the holocaust. Very well written and difficult to put down. An excellent choice for middle and high school students as well."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Do you know what it's like to be a young Jewish boy in Nazi-controlled Europe? Young Ellie Wiesel had to find out the hard way as his family was abused and treated horribly during World War II. As the story begins we see the Wiesel family as a kind, sweet Jewish family living in Sighet, Transylvania. Then in 1944, German soldiers began arriving in their town. The Jews of the town did not give the soldiers much thought, until the soldiers began separating them into Ghettos. But by the time they were in the Ghettos it was too late for them to do anything about their future.As we continue to read, we find that Ellie and his family continue to be their same kind, sweet selves even with all of the chaos going on around them. Then we see the German soldiers start to take the Jews away from the Ghettos to Concentration Camps. Ellie and his family are able to stay together until they get to the Concentration Camps. Then he and his father had to go to one Concentration Camp, but his mom and sister had to go to a different camp.After Ellie is separated from his sister and mother, we start to see him change to a darker person. He starts to get detached from his father and really from his old personality. He starts to really forsake his God and really get angry at his God because of what he has to go through with all the torture and humiliation that was going on. Although he is losing his faith in his God, he keeps praying that somehow, someway he could be spared and blessed to live another day.This book really makes you think about how fortunate we all are to live in a country where we don't have to worry about people with crazy ideas taking over our entire nation. We don't have to worry about being tortured for our race or our beliefs. This book is a great memoir about the tragic story of Ellie Wiesel and his family. This memoir gives us a very detailed and very emotional look at the monstrous Nazis and their horrible Concentration Camps. It's very tragic that something like this had to happen before we really started to make sure that human rights are preserved. This book could be disturbing for some people, but it is also very impact for the people who read it. It is definitely important that we read more books like this one so that we always remember this tragedy. We need to remember tragedies such as this one so that we never ever let it happen again."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Night is a moving tale of Elie Wiesel's experiences during the holocaust. His one-year experience in the concentration camp resonates with people in all walks of life. It is a tale of hope when such was hard to find. The gripping tale of him being transported from camp to camp and the harsh conditions encountered had me captivated from the beginning. While the book is not extremely detailed it still leaves the reader with a vivid picture of the struggles experienced by those in the holocaust.Wiesel goes through a journey of self-discovery in the novel that makes the reader question his own life. He grows to understand family ties as he experiences the challenges of the concentration camps with his father. He often considers to himself if it would be easier to go on with out his father as he witnesses other young men leaving family behind for survival. These thoughts leave him with a feeling of disgust and shame. This pushes the reader to answer the hard question: would I do the same? He also questions his religion, which leads to an understanding about how he feels about God. At one point in the novel he says, \\"I did not deny God's existence, but I doubted His absolute justice.\\" He learned for himself what he valued and as the reader partakes of this book they question that which they believed to know.I enjoyed this book for the themes portrayed a lessons learned. The theme of family is strong through out the entire book. As I read the book I thought of the relationship I have with my family. The book opened my eyes to ways I can strengthen and enhance what I have with them. Another theme that stood out to me was the dehumanizing that went into the extermination of the Jewish race. While I do not participate in extreme genocides I became more aware of the feeling of those around me. I began to understand that everyone has a story and my story is not more important than his or hers. Everyone deserves to be treated with dignity and respect.This book serves as a warning to all those to come after this horrible tragedy. Wiesel wrote it as a way to educate those who have not and will not experience something of this magnitude. Audiences everywhere should read this book and remember those who took part in this extreme genocide. The reader can experince a horrible tragedy and vow to never repeat it without actually having to spend time in a concentration camp. This is a story everyone needs to hear."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Elie Wiesel was 16 years old when Adolph Hitler's Nazis stole his life, his faith and took God from him.Wiesel's testimony stands against evil everywhere."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Night is a powerful personal account of a holocaust survivor from capture to liberation.

Along the way, his Faith dies in the flames as he watches children tossed into pits of fire. He questions the very existance of God in a world where such attrocities are possible. The \\"Night\\" of the title is not only the darkness of the evil perpetrated by the Nazis, but also the darkness that the experience imparts on Wiesel's own soul.This book is powerful not only because it bears witness to a horror that is almost beyond belief, but because it also gives us a glimpse into how the impact of such evil goes far beyond the physical impact, to scar a person's very soul.

This book brings you through those moments through the frightening eyes of Elie Wiesel in Night.This book tells about the true horrors of the Holocaust.

Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Night","review":"It's been over 60 years since the holocaust, an event in human history so brutal and enormous in it's evil and cold inhumanity that even today it is sometimes hard to fathom that it really happened.As I read Elie Wiesel's book regarding one young boy's brutal nightmare of existence (if you can call it that) in the concentration camps of WWII, I couldn't help seeing some of myself in young Eliezer, concerned with my own life, planning for the future, etc. Perhaps most people see at least a part of themselves in Elie, which makes the tragedy even more horrific.I originally read this book years ago, as a young man, and I somehow thought that as I re-read it, my life experiences would have jaded me somewhat to the horrors that this book describes. Fortunately for me, the book had the opposite effect. As I read the warnings from Moshe the Beadle, I wonder if I would have had the sense to leave before the Germans took me away, or would the enormity of the cruelty and death that awaited me blinded me to the danger, making me into a sheep for the slaughter. This book raises many questions about humanity, and the lack of it in people:1. How does someone retain his/her humanity in the face of such horrible evil?2. What would you do to survive, at least for one more day? What wouldn't you do?3. Even if you survive, what person would you be?I highly recommend this book to everyone, everywhere.

I've seen documentaries about the holocaust, images, and newspaper articles, but I've never read a first-hand account until now. This book completely blew me away. I read it continuously over 2 days and learned about determination, love, loss, cruelty, compassion, and of the lucky few who survived. Like many, I had some idea that the holocaust was about gas chambers and furnaces used to kill and cremate human beings. I had no idea, however, of the many other hardships imposed on the Jews during the Holocaust, both before, leading up to, and - for the lucky few - after the mass killings. I'd recommend this book without reservation to anyone interested in learning about this horrific, brutal period of human history, as told with great honesty by someone who lived through it.

For me there can be no higher praise. Night is a well written (and depressing) pictures of the author's life as a Jew in WWII Germany. The books starts before his internment, ends with his liberation, and paints a vivid and horrifying picture of everything in between. I was so intensely frustrated reading about how the Jews refused to believe bad things were happening through the patches the ghetto's even right up until they were being marched into gas chambers single file.

From Birkenau to Auschwitz to Buna to Gleiwitz to Buchenwald, Wiesel tells us in simple prose the utter evil that arose. It is probably one of the best accounts ever written of the Holocaust. It is short and to the point, only a little more than 100 pages, but it is filled with the little details of the concentration camps that no one can really rationally deny. From the anguish of losing his mother and sister to the doubting of God's existence, Wiesel does an excellent job of allowing us to be witnesses to one of the most depraved chapters of human history. How could it happen and how could a merciful God allow it? The answer seems to be humankind are the masters of their own fate. Although it takes such a short time to read, \\"Night\\" is a memorable account of intolerance, savage hatred, survival, and man's inhumanity to man."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I first read Night by Elie Wiesel in my senior year of high school, which was almost ten years ago. We were covering the Holocaust in English and it was assigned to the class to read. I read the book in about two or three hours; I couldn't put it down. I have read this book about three or four times since then and think that it is one of the most touching true life stories I have ever come across. I almost felt as if I were there with him and could feel his pain. I have recommended this book to several people and recommened that you read it too. You cannot go wrong with purchasing this book, it is a must have as far as I am concerned."},{"Title":"Night","review":"A MUST READ....but not for the faint of heart. Another truth about humanity and the lessons we should learn.Elie Wiesel, a Nobel Prize winner and Holocaust survivor, captures the pure horror of his experiences in the death camps during the Nazi regime. While the book can easily be read in a day the impact will remain for a lifetime. History has taught us to be aware but unemotional about one of man-kind's greatest atrocities but in this little book Wiesel will stir your emotion into action again. With horrible descriptions of babies being tossed into fires and prisoners having to make life and death choices everyday in order to survive it will leave you wondering how we allowed this to happen and re-happen (Rwanda!).Wiesel writes simply but so profoundly that you will physically ache with emotion after reading this book. But the fact that Wiesel's words remain relevant is the true tragedy. As human beings we must stop the act of genocide as it continues to occur around the world today. Let this small beacon of awareness shed some light on the generations that are to come and may we find our way out of the dark before additional memoirs must be written."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This novel changed my life.

It changed my life in many ways, and I am a better person for having read it."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This book embodies Holocaust literature. I've read and re-read Night many times since stumbling upon it when I was a pre-teen. It has become one of my favorite books, and I truly believe it is one of the best pieces of literature ever penned.I am not a huge fan of Oprah. But if this is what it takes to get this country reading Night again, so be it.For the sake of humanity, everyone should read Night."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I completed this story in three evenings. I am not really sure how to rate it. In reading the Preface, we learn from the author that the original book was longer and that the newest translation was preformed by his wife who shortened it considerably, perhaps because of limitations from the publisher? Throughout the book, the authors' descriptions and writing are very short and to the point, so much in fact that what would seem like important events are sometimes limited to one or two sentences and nothing further. No doubt that there were instances within the book which captured the horror and misery of the holocaust, but to me some portions seemed somewhat watered-down. Again, in the preface the author shares with us some of the writing which was left out of this version. I would love to read the original uncut book in its entirety."},{"Title":"Night","review":"A sad, unforgetable, book that opens the understanding of exactly what the holocost was to the reader."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I got the book on time excellent condition as was described by the seller.

I was so moved by this book that I immediately recommended it to friends and family. I even bought copies and passed it around.

But is the one that the new books have."},{"Title":"Night","review":"It's hard to believe such a short book (my copy only had 83 pages but contained pieces of other stories after that also relate to the holocaust) could be so powerful and eye opening. It's difficult to sit and read the details of what these people had to suffer through everyday just to try and stay alive. I completely understand why Wiesel started questioning his God that he was always so loyal to. Who wouldn't in his situation? It's really frightening to know that this actually happened and could happen again someday. I just hope it doesn't."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Elie Wiesel's account of concentration camp life was initially notable for being one of the early first-person narratives detailing the horrors the Hitler's regime. Since it's appearance decades ago, many other survivors have told their stories. Their accounts of the crimes the Nazis perpetrated against the Jews and others no longer surprise us, and yet Professor Wiesel's book not only endures, but is now experiencing something of a renaissance of interest (partly due to Oprah of course). What makes Night unique is the author's ruminations on the meaning of faith and God in the midst of such inexplicable sadness. These are issues that resonate for all human beings who face crises in their lives. Most of us will (hopefully) never have to confront the mortal threats that faced the Nazis' victims, yet many will at some point be tested with a crisis of faith. Elie Wiesel speaks to this universal human experience.Victor Lerch, Author of \\"Four Wheels to Freedom: A Tale of Survival in Nazi Germany\\"Four Wheels to Freedom"},{"Title":"Night","review":"This is a very sad story.

This is the BEST book I have ever read and I will keep it so that my children's children can read it. It's so descriptive you feel like you are actually in the book in your mind.

I love it!"},{"Title":"Night","review":"I read Night in conjunction with Bernard Schlink's The Reader. An extraordinary writing in every way, Night provided an excellent complement to The Reader. It depicted painfully vividly the unmerciful cruelties suffered at the willful hands of the SS. Night is an important and compelling work which, I would argue, should be read by all. One interesting undercurrent throughout both books was the numbness by which people coped with such unspeakable horrors, both contemporaneously and retrospectively. Although the characters may speak of numbness, this reader was anything but numb. I will feel the poignantly powerful imprint of both books, but Night in particular, forever, and rightly so."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Night truely depicts the horrors of the Holocaust. It is a brilliantly written novel that is hard to put down. One can easily imagine the terror that the Jews experienced in the concentration camps. The emotional suspense was never-ending. I whole-heartedly recommend this novel to mature teens and adults. This book easily earns a five star rating. You will not be disappointed after reading it."},{"Title":"Night","review":"It is so hard to find adjectives to describe this autobiographical story of the tremendous sufferings that millions of people had to endure during the nazi regime. The author is a survivor of that death machinery who describes the psychological and physical torture to which he and his family were exposed until he was finally released.It should be compulsory to read this book at schools and universities as a living testimony of the human cruelty in its highest expression. It is very hard to aknowledge how much evil and contempt can reside on someone's mind, disguised as an image of power and bravery. But in reality, this mask is just the cowardice of a society to face their own flaws, blaming others for them."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I've had this one in my collection for over 20 years and enjoyed reading it several times. An inside look at what it meant to be a Jew during WWII."},{"Title":"Night","review":"The most moving part of the whole memoir for me personally was how much the Hungarian Jews - and the world - wanted even until the last minute - when they were stuffed in cattle cars and a woman was screaming about ovens filled with people - when they then landed at Auschwitz and saw with their own eyes the crematorium - when they wanted even until that last minute to be optimistic, and to believe that man was better."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This book brings to life the horrors that this man endured as a youth in the concentration camps - I am starting to read Dawn which is another book in the series.."},{"Title":"Night","review":"My nephew coerced me into reading this book. When he told me it was required reading for his Junior High English class, I thought it would be beneath my reading level or that it would skirt gently around details of the concentration camps in order to cater to adolescents. I was wrong. It was beautifully written, despite the ugly story being told. The new translation in the forward, along with the Nobel Peace Prize acceptance speech just added to the raw emotion of the subject in addition to exploring the author's personal feelings about his survival. I am now looking forward to reading Wiesel's other two books in the \\"trilogy,\\" if you will. I am a Wiesel fan for life!"},{"Title":"Night","review":"This is not a book that a reader can \\"critique\\" or even, for that matter, \\"review\\". To take an experience so personal and traumatic and attempt to filter it through the completely inadequate lens of a reader who has experienced nothing of similar magnitude would be arrogance of the grossest sort.For any of my readers who might not have heard of Elie Wiesel or Night, this book is a memoir of the purest sort. It is a first person account of one traumatic year in Mr. Wiesel's life, the final year of World War II in Europe, the year in which his idyllic life in a small town in Transylvania came to an end and the nightmare that was Auschwitz and Buchenwald began.The words which continually surface in my mind as I have pondered this book are: raw, naked, honest, vivid. As a member of the community of mankind, I like to live under the perhaps naive notion that during the darkest hours in our history human beings have risen to display the best that is in them. When I use the words naked and raw I am not just referring to the sheer emotional drain that is contained within the covers of this book. I am referring to the fact that Elie Wiesel does not try to make humanity look noble. He does not try to make himself look noble. Man's innate selfish quest for personal survival is not shied away from. Indeed, when editors insisted on removing the most raw section with regards to Elie's response to the final hours of his father's life, Elie wrote it into his introduction to the book.As with most books dealing with the Holocaust, the central theme of this one is man's inhumanity to man. The unalloyed emotional candor of this book sets it apart from other Holocaust writings; it carved out a piece of my soul. It saddens me to think that in the aftermath of the war Mr. Wiesel could not find a publisher for his work. But for the tireless work of French Catholic Nobel Laureate writer Franois Mauriac, this powerful work might have been lost to mankind.There are two books which I would recommend as tandem reads for Night, one a work of nonfiction and one a novel. The first is Alex Kershaw's biography of Swedish diplomat Raoul Wallenberg's time in Hungary during the waning years of the war, The Envoy. I also highly recommend Julie Orringer's novel, loosely based upon the experiences of her Hungarian Jewish grandparents, The Invisible Bridge. Orringer's work of historical fiction was my top novel of 2010.The book itself is a scant 120 pages. Even if you read both introductions, by Elie Wiesel and Franois Mauriac, which I strongly recommend, you can finish the 135 pages of the book in under four hours. That four hours will change the way that you view not only the Holocaust, but the way that you view humanity. It is simply a must read."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Night is a true story written from the point of view of Elie as a 15 year old Jewish boy in the holocaust. Elie and his family were taken on a train to Auschwitz. His mother and sister are killed immediately. Elie and his father struggle to survive as they move from camp to camp and go on a death march.Elie's father becomes sick at the end of the death march when they arrive at the last camp. Elie tries to decide whether to help his father or save himself. The whole book is about how Elie's faith is slowly destroyed as he witnesses the cruelty of the holocaust.This book is one of the most graphic books I've ever read. It really shows you the horror of the holocaust and lets you know what it would be like. Elie Wiesel won the Nobel Peace Prize and has written many other holocaust novels.Originally posted on 3 Book Bees Blog"},{"Title":"Night","review":"When I was only twelve years old, I visited Auschwitz, walked among its remains, as if steel and iron bones of a skeleton that still trembles. The stench of death is more of an echo, a meta-feeling. But it is there. Make no mistake. I walked into the old barracks where emaciated Jews were often lifted like pale wafers and tossed into unspeakable piles. I stood in the gas chambers where they gathered to be bathed by death instead of water ...I believe to favorably review such a mammoth literary achievement as, \\"Night,\\" one must inevitably delve into a plaguing question: Why would one celebrate, immortalize, horrific detritus of the most evil mountain of human history? If you do not understand the immediate answer, the only answer, to this question, than you have not read \\"Night.\\"Wiesel's triumphant literary accomplishment here is more than the haunting descriptions, the history-staining and memory-tattooing images, the story of austere survival, of hope as if a tiny diamond entombed by an endless black swamp yet still impossibly catching a ray of the moon; it is the idea, the human song, the greatness of the human spirit ... all reminding us, in one sitting's reading, that the most noble truths of the human family are found in our darkest of hours. \\"Night\\" is really day, whether concentration camp survivors lived to see it with their corporeal eyes, or through the gentle, reverberating eyes of one of our greatest fathers of humanity, Elie Wiesel.... a dog-eared, gaunt paperback, gracing my meager mantel, shall be read long after Wiesel, and you and I, are long gone ... lest we forget what being human is really all about."},{"Title":"Night","review":"For those who aren't familiar with the book or the author, Wiesel was a young teenage boy at the time of World War II. He, and the rest of his family, were moved to the concentration camps and forced to undergo all the horrors of Auschwitz, Buchenwald, and more. When he got out, Wiesel initially imposed a ten-year silence on himself, refusing to write or speak about the experience. This book is his memoir of the experience, ten years later.Wiesel's writing is powerful, largely because he lets the incidents speak for themselves. In a spartan writing style, Wiesel allows the horrors of the concentration camps to do the bulk of the emotional work. In barely 100 pages, Wiesel brought tears to my eyes more than a dozen times.As horrible as the stories are, they all really happened. It is good to be reminded of the atrocities that Hitler and his followers imposed upon the Jews -- so that we may reflect upon that history and refuse to repeat its horrors, but the darkness of the narrative is overwhelming. I frequently closed the book after only a page or two of reading, unable to keep my emotions in check.Wiesel writes -- now more than 40 books -- to ensure that the world never forgets what happened to the Jews. This short book, his first, has the power to do what no textbook or third-person account of World War II can do: it puts the reader inside Auschwitz and makes you feel as if the Germans are putting to death your mother, your sister, and your friend."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I have long been obssessed with WWII and its tragedies - not out of morbid fascination, but out of worried anticipation of history repeating itself. Comments about the holocaust never occuring send chills down my spine. Elie Wiesel's \\"Night\\" is one powerful reminder of the flaws in human nature and character.Wonderfully written, with simple prose and direct explanation, \\"Night\\" is an account of a survivor of Auschwitz, the infamous factory of death. Powerful in every way - in emotions, thoughts, memories - \\"Night\\" takes the reader to the hellish barracks of the once quaint Polish town and its air suffused with the acrid smell of burning bodies.Elie Wiesel, himself a holocaust survivor, speaks so clearly that a reader has no choice but to be transported to that time of humans lacking a conscience, with all its horrors and deficiencies. There aren't many books that can achieve this, but \\"Night\\" delivers its message and warns the reader of the frailty of human life."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Chilling personal account of the Holocaust. Scary....the atrocities are horrific. Very relevant to present day issues, wherever atrocities are committed in the name of race, religion, political beliefs ....in Rwanda, Palestine, Darfur, Myanmar, Iraq etc. Only if we could learn from history, and manage to live in peace...."},{"Title":"Night","review":"\\"Night\\" is a rarity: an example of Holocaust art or literature that doesn't find melodrama or meaning in genocidal suffering.Here's the storyline: Jews are deported to camps, where the weak are murdered and the strong are enslaved. The slaves are quickly dehumanized by fear, hunger and exhaustion. They fight over crumbs of bread; they break faith with one another; they lose faith in God. As Germany collapses, they are marched to new camps in the dead of winter. They freeze to death in the snow; they are shot like dogs. Their torment only ends when the Germans are defeated by the Allies. Along the way, a pious teenage boy sees the truth about the world and becomes an atheist.The writing is spare and economical. The victims come across as victims, not as heroes. They don't emerge from black and white into a world of technocolor. It all happened. \\"Night\\" should be read by every educated person."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This little book is one of the many accounts of life in the concentration camps during WWII, but is considerably different from some other accounts such as \\"The Hiding Place\\". Wiesel uses stark simplicity to tell his story, rather than extensive descriptives. It is, in fact, the very simplicity in which he brings you into the emotion of the story, that makes this such a brilliant book."},{"Title":"Night","review":"\\"Night\\" is a book about a Jewish teenager named Elie Wiesel. He and his family are taken into a concentration camp known as Auschwitz. He and his father are separated from the rest of his family. They do everything they can to survive. They are then moved to another camp known as Buchenwald which is even more cruel than the first. It is here where Elie and his father must try their best to hold on to their lives and pray, pray that it will all end soon.Overall, I really enjoyed this book. It made me feel a lot of different emotions such as anger and sadness. There were even some parts that made me say things like \\"no way\\" because they were sad but were true. Another reason I liked the book was that it had a cliffhanger at the end of every chapter that made you want to keep reading more. Every chapter was also filled with excellent descriptions that kept you hooked to the book. It also reminded me of another great book about the holocaust called \\"Because of Romek.\\"The author, Elie Wiesel, has a very unique style of writing. Whenever he would want to show a passing of time or a new event occurring, he uses breaks between paragraphs. This was very helpful when I was reading because it helped let me know that something new was going on or that it was a different time and location. In order to make help accentuate the main point of a new event, he would capitalize the first few words of a new paragraph after a break. I also found this very helpful because it let me know what he was going to talk about until the next break in paragraphs or the end of a chapter.I recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a good non-fiction about the holocaust. Because they are first hand accounts from the author, it makes it even more captivating. Also, I feel this is a great book for fans of \\"Because of Romek\\" because it is just as unique and emotional."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Audio. I have put both this book and Sophie's Choice off for a long time. The subject matter is just to aborhant to me that I truly had a hardtime trying to stomach it and just couldn't force myself to read them. Having said that, I think I let my imagination run away with itself because I wasn't as drawn in by this book as I thought I would be. Maybe because I wouldn't let myself. Maybe because the writing wasn't as gut wrenching at I assumed it would be. Maybe because man's inhumanity to man isn't so \\"new\\" or \\"surprising\\" anymore."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This book was an excellent book, easy to read and really touches your heart.

It is almost like you are there with him in his life when you are reading it. The only thing I didn't care for is that I had to read it in a class that the book was kind of irrelevent to the class. In other words in this class we should not be studying the holocaust but we are."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Night by Elie Wiesel is not only one of the definitve works on Holocaust literature, it is one of the most definitve works on humanity.This is a factual record of Wiesel's experiences from 1941, when the author was 12 years old, dedicated to learning Talmud and thirsting to learn Kaballah, to his experiences after Jews were forced into ghettoes and then transported to the death camps.Written in Yiddish in 1958 and translated into English in 1960.It is a record of Wiesel's childhood in the death camps of Auschwitz and Birkenau. It is dedicated to the memory of Wiesel's parents and his little sister Tzipora who were cruelly murdered in the Nazi inferno.The book is stark in it's record of everything seen by the author and asks many questions for which answers are difficult to find.It tells of the vow of Wiesel and a friend in the camp to emigrate to the Land of Israel if they survived, a dream shared by millions who died in and lived through the Shoah.Perhaps the most horrifying and moving account in the book is when the author reveals how during the first night in Auschwitz, he and his father wait in line to be thrown into a firepit. He watches a lorry draw up beside the pit and deliver its load of children into the fire. While his father recites the Kaddish, the prayer for the dead.\\" Never shall I forget that night, the first night in camp, which has turned my life into one long night, seven times cursed and seven times sealed. Never shall I forget that smoke. Never shall I forget the little faces of the children, whose bodies I saw turned into wreaths of smoke beneath a silent blue sky.Never shall I forget those flames which consumed my faith forever.Never shall I forget that nocturnal silence which deprived me, for all eternity, of the desire to live. Never shall I forget those moments which murdered my God and my soul and turned my dreams to dust. Never shall I forget these things, even if I am condemned to live as long as God Himself. Never\\".Elie Wiesel has been a voice of conscience in the world ever since this book became known.He has penned various other bestsellers. His Elie Wiesel Foundation For Human Rights has done valuable work in this field for many years.In a plea for the plight of his own people today, especially the youth and children of Israel today targeted by terror and forces of genocide (such as Hamas, Hezbollah and the Ahmadinejad regime- as well as all who are sympathetic to these anti-Jewish elements) he penned an open letter to President Bush stating: \\"Please remember that the maps on Arafat's uniform and in Palestinian children's textbooks show a Palestine encompassing not only all of the West Bank but all of Israel, while Palestinian leaders loudly proclaim that 'Palestine extends from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea, from Rosh Hanikra (in the North) to Rafah (in Gaza). Please remember Danielle Shefi, a little girl in Israel. Danielle was five. When the murderers came, she hid under her bed. Palestinian gunmen found and killed her anyway. Think of all the other victims of terror in the Holy Land. With rare exceptions, the targets were young people, children and families. Please remember that Israel--having lost too many sons and daughters, mothers and fathers--desperately wants peace. It has learned to trust its enemies' threats more than the empty promises of 'neutral' governments\\".Elie Wiesel is atrue voice of truth and conscience."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Amazing and detailed read.

He remembered EVERYTHING! And I mean EVERYTHING!! The way things looked, smelled, felt and seen. It was as if he knew that he would survive this trial of his life to write about it and inspire others to live. So many concentration camp refugees had survivor's remorse for many years after 1945. Between 1945 and today, many museums, monuments and statues have been created in order that we not forget what has happened to 6 million Jewish people and a multitude of mentally stunted, homosexual, ill, or otherwise unwanted disappeared as well. Those who are of that generation, must make sure that those who are younger understand this time in world history, so that it will not be repeated again!This book was a challenge book to help celebrate the 25th Anniversary of the American Holocaust Museum in Washington, DC.

I think it took a lot of courage and heartache to write this book. Excellent read!!!!"},{"Title":"Night","review":"This book could easily be read in a couple of hours, if it were just a book. However, since this volume is the personal account of the Holocaust and is penned by one who has the gift of bringing the reader into his world, this book would be difficult to digest in one reading.After completing this read, this student found it difficult to find ease in his very comfortable bed. This discomfort had little to do with position, temperature, sound or level of darkness. The source of the discomfort is the aching suspicion that the atmosphere that created the possibility of the Holocaust still remains and is alive in these United States. Mr. Wiesel states that indifference to evil is evil. He does not hide his part of this apathy in the face of the \\"Final Solution\\" that Germany was bringing about in Europe. He speaks of denial and rationalization by he, his family and fellow towns people until the gates of Birkenau were closed behind them. To read this memoir is chilling in its clarity, call to compassion and the forthrightness with which the author tells of becoming an orphan, not just parentless.Mr. Wiesel was studying to be a rabbi when he was deported to the concentration camps in the Spring of 1944, in less than a year he was reduced to the barest of definitions of alive. His mother and youngest sister were killed the night they arrived in Birkenau, his father died 28 January 1945 weeks before the liberation of the camp on 11 April 1945 and he quit believing in God somewhere in between. What he saw and experienced would cause anyone to question whether God did exist and, if such was the case, was God still involved in Creation? The author speaks of unimaginable cruelty, inhumanity and loss. The reality that he survived is a testament to his strength of heart, to survive with the ability to write of this experience is a statement of the toughness he possesses.As a therapist, I was struck by the resilience of the human Spirit and the power one has to withstand anything. Repeatedly, Mr. Wiesel speaks of witnessing things that killed his soul, yet he writes of tenderness and joy (anecdotally) he found after these experiences. He was forced to march for days without food, this after being fed only thin soup and a slice of bread, if anything, for the months previous to this march, yet he survived. This reader was left with the impression that those who died (but were not shot or gassed) largely did not survive because they gave up that mysterious thing called \\"Will to Live.\\" I have seen this same determination on numerous occasions in my practice, albeit on a much smaller scale. People who have experienced horrendous events but insist on celebrating life.As a theologian, I was stuck by the real questions raised by the experience of this man. Evil is real, how else can such events like the Holocaust, Apartheid, famine in a world that produces more food with better transportation than anytime in history be explained. The reason such evil exists and grows to such huge proportions is not God, but the choice we humans make: ignoring the good and keeping silent about the evil. This student is party far too often to the closed mouth bunch. It seems better to be included in \\"the Club\\" (whatever club that may be) than speak up and be counted among the oppressed. I hope reading this book has erased any comfort I found in keeping silent about wrong.Never shall I forget that night, the first night in camp, that turned my life into one long night seven time sealed.Never shall I forget that smoke.Never shall I forget the small faces of the children whose bodies I saw transformed into smoke under a silent sky.Never shall I forget those flames that consumed my faith forever.Never shall I forget the nocturnal silence that deprived me for all eternity of the desire to live.Never shall I forget those moments that murdered my God and my soul and turned my dreams into ashes.Never shall I forget those things, even were I condemned to live as long as God Himself.Never.

It's so scorching, so personal, so powerful that my heart shattered for all eternity on every single page. Dr. Wiesel writes with such clarity..I could smell the smoking crematoria, hear the children cry and feel the absolute terror and misery of these over 6 million souls. He asks questions that there are simply no answers to...\\"where was God at Auschwitz?\\", what is the meaning of this, why did he survive? on and on. And I started asking those same questions of myself. how he was able to survive this and not go completely mad or lose his faith forever is beyond me. It is important that we read this..that we bear witness to wahat happened...that we never forget and never repeat. One of the things I really gleaned from this book was how the Nazis had so methodically created industrialised death factories. They produced the most number of deaths with the least ammount of effort...that's what they were in the biz of doing...producing death. Even though I was taught all about the Holocaust in high school...it just never hit me until I read this book. I knew the numbers and the death camps and the pictures and footage...but this book made it personal. a must read for everyone. this is part of our collective history...why did the world turn a blind eye and allow this happen?"},{"Title":"Night","review":"this book was very detailed. it will help more people realize what went on from a survivors point of view. 5 stars from me.i love this book"},{"Title":"Night","review":"This small book shows just what words can do in the hands of a consumate master. Each sentence, each phrase conveys an image, a thought that burns through the pages. Nobel laureate Elie Wiesel has written some forty books of both fiction and non-fiction. Of them he says: 'If in my lifetime I was to write only one book, this would be the one.'In its slightly more than 100 pages it conveys more information, more feelings, more wisdom than books ten times as long. It's story is one of the survival of a child in the German concentration camps.While the book has been available in English for some 45 years, this new translation by Mr. Wiesel's wife is closer in tone and understanding than any previous edition. It cannot be recommended too highly."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I read NIGHT a number of years ago at the suggestion of one of my high school teachers. As a person of faith, she thought I needed to read a book like NIGHT and see if I still believed after reading it. I took her advice, but if I was supposed to stop believing in God because of the content of this book, it didn't happen. Instead something amazing occurred. I began to see that true faith comes not by knowledge and not questioning, but questioning, and perhaps losing faith altogether, and then discovering true belief. Of course I didn't come to this conclusion right away. I head Elie Wiesel speak prior to my reading the book. I discovered his journey to be incredible and his pain taught me that doubt can at times lead to greater faith. When I saw him again on Oprah Winfrey, I decided his book needed another reading and once again, I was moved by the pages.NIGHT is a memoir that tells of the young Eliezer, a dedicated young Jewish boy who dreams of being a great thinker and mystic. He lived in Hungary and like his neighbors, never thought the evil that had spread through Europe under Nazi rule would ever penetrate his beloved homeland. It was only a matter of time, Eliezer and his fellow townspeople believed, before the Red Army would defeat the Germans. They only had to wait. While young Eliezer's prediction was true, the Germans were defeated, it did not happen as soon as the people had hoped, and young Eliezer, along with his family, found themselves in Nazi concentration camps.The majority of the book deals with the inhumanity of the camps and the young man's desire to survive, for his father's sake if not his own. We see everything he knew be destroyed. We read one page after another, wanting to put the book down, but feeling compelled to read further, not out of pleasure as much as out of a duty to honor what these people suffered.Night is a book that stays with the reader, but that's its purpose. Wiesel wrote these words so the world would not forget, and often wrote at moments he wanted to abandon the project. The result is a book that is both powerful and timeless, and may help us to never forget the atrocities that happened in the Nazi concentration camps and could all too quickly happen once again."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Elie Wiesel's book is gripping, powerful, vivid, frightening, and inspiring all at once. I read the book years ago, and it stayed with me. Now that it's back in the public conscience, I read it again and find it just as powerful a tale about the good and evil that reside in the human spirit. I highly recommend the book to anyone."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Over the years, there have been many books about the holocaust. Everyone of them beautiful and touching in their testimony. However, this one--is so much more. Night breaks your heart and strangles your soul. This book does more than tell a story it teaches and warns us about the evil that lurks among us. Hatred is a monster none of us can afford to feed, but there are those who do. Oppression continues to this day. Stories of horror continue to write themselves and most of us, too many of us, do nothing about it. I've learned from this book that silence is a deadly weapon easily weilded and often used. I hope and I think it's the author's hope that we disarm that weapon and speak out. Do something...even if it's recommending this book to a friend as I do to you. Read this book."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Night is a Nobel-Prize-winning memoir of the highest caliber. In this memoir, author Elie Wiesel tells of his experiences in the concentration camps, and how he and his father survived the horrible death-march, even though they were near frozen and starved by the Nazis. This is a work of fine memoir writing and should be read by all so that it never happens again, to anyone."},{"Title":"Night","review":"In the last days of World War Two, a young Jewish boy tries to keep his father alive, but fails. The young Elie Weisel is forced to ask the most searing questions of why, the world stood by and allowed 6 million Jews to be exterminated by Hitler.

The author tells of his horrific experiences in a way that gives me hope that someday all people will be treated with the dignity and respect we all deserve. Everyone should read this book if only to make ourselves aware of the attocities of the world."},{"Title":"Night","review":"It goes without saying that this is a depressing book since it deals with the Holocaust, and it has every right to be. And it's not just depressing in the personal, individual sense, but in the existensial, nihilistic, \\"THERE IS NO GOD\\" sense. Again, if any one of us went through what Weisel did, I can't say we'd draw different conclusions.Weisel writes in this way in order to force humanity to deal with the horror of the Holocaust, and again, I can't fault him for doing this. But while Night deals with the total absence of good in the world, it needed a companion to show the restoration of faith, not just in religion, but also in the human spirit. \\"The Gates of the Forest\\" is that necessary companion.Although \\"Gates of the Forest\\" is fiction, it is a very profound and moving story about the restoration of faith after the Holocaust. I would in no way discourage anyone from reading Night, but I believe the two books should go together to make the components of a single story."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I'd heard the name Elie Wiesel before, but this is the first book I've read by him.

This book as truly addicting and will keep you reading page after page after page. The beginning of the book starts off slow by introducing the characters and what is going on at the time, approximately sixty years ago. Once the introductions are completed, Elie compiles all of the events that happened as he and his family was being transported to a concentration camp. One thing that I truly admire about Mr. Wiesel, is the effort and detail he put into constructing this book. He describes in great detail every scene as if someone else were living it at the same time. The reader can imagine and visualize what Elie was being put through and experiencing. There is no doubt in my mind that you will experience a section of the book where you are captured by the words and can not put the novel down. You may find yourself waking up to see the elegant pages resting on your chest. I recommend this book to anyone seeking a artful piece of literature with a few hours to spare. It really does deserve the prestigious five out of five stars."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I have read holocaust stories before and am familar with the horrors. Where this stood out is the way the story of a son and fathers journey through the camps is told - detail is pared down and yet the images come strongly across. The brutality becomes normality, the prisoners dehumanised, ready to kill for a few crumbs. While the author was only 15 , he is forced to grow up quickly. The images of sons throwing their dead fathers bodies from the train. Son killing father to survive. The prisoners are not venerated as heroes. It is their sheer ordinariness and fraility that make this a powerful story. When you read this it reminds you of how we allow evil to live on. The people of Sighel ignored the warnings and were blind to what was happening. The world still has evil - read this and remember."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This may very well be the best and worst book I have ever read. I say this because it seems sad to call it the best, because of the nature of the book. This book consumed me from the moment I turned the first page. It wasn't my intent, but I ended up reading this book in unison with another holocaust survivor book called \\"Rena's Promise\\". It was like sitting at a table and listening to them both tell their stories. A young man's perspective, and a young woman's.Mr. Wiesel's journey through this nightmare was captivating and stomach churning. How does one hold fast to their faith in God when faced with such a horrible existence? Sometimes they can't.Don't hesitate. Buy this book now! It puts your life in perspective very fast."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Both my daughters were required to read this for high school, a book I had never heard of it myself but when I flipped through the pages and saw the author I knew full well what they were learning about.This first work by Wiesel written from his recollections and what seemed to be more a cathartic expression of what he personally experienced is a powerful treatise on the Nazi goal to humiliate, torture and basically try to kill every Jew they could find.Within its pages lies a story of powerful expression and affect.The loss of family,the fear of the unknown and the crushing anxiety of what was to come slowly grip you as it must have just as slowly, gripped them. The realization and incomprehensible nature of the helpless,insane situation they found themselves in with no one to help them or seemingly care must have shattered even the most hearty minded of these people.Watching from the sidelines, forced to choose to ignore the slow death of their friends and family as the will to survive burned inside the few who did survive as the author did, is a testament to what a human can do if they want to. From home, to ghetto, to train, to camp ,to work ,to misery or death.Cold, poor food,beatings,disease,fatigue and ultimately,a condition akin to the walking dead, zombified,skeletal creatures,mute, dumbfounded,beaten into emotionally vapid shells of their former lives are all discussed with tact and with little detectable anger in its pages one would expect. To me, it seemed that he needed to write this and was still trying to understand just how it happened and why.For those who deny this occurred, well just read this book. If this is not enough for you,there is something wrong. I am not a Jew nor do I condone what the Germans tried to do but this did happen for sure.I do believe in human rights and hope we would never sink to this again.This book,short and to the point, unravels quickly.Before you know it your in the thick of it and I found myself thinking what if that were to happen to me or my family today,what would I do? One can only hope that this scenario will never be repeated again.There are many other directions one could go in to study this chapter in our history but you couldn't ask for a better place to start than this.A well written story by a Nobel prize winner, which after reading will stay with you a while as you ponder the benefit of war or isolating people for genocide which,to some degree continues even today in some parts of the world but on a smaller scale.For those who study or value the benefit of studying history this one is for you.For the Jews it's a testament to what happened, a thumbnail portrait of a bigger event. For others, it's a warning to beware of racist power in the hands of a warped person or group of people infecting their people to follow a grandious program based on personal or religious beliefs which delude others that their way is the only one which is right or that killing those who are different is the only solution."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Elie Wiesel was just a teen when his remote village in Hungary was occupied by the Nazis. With frightening speed, the Jewish population lost their rights and were herded into two ghettos before finally being evacuated. This type of story has been told many times in books and movies; however, \\"Night\\" still stands as a classic. What stunned me is the fearlessness with which Wiesel explores the dark recesses of his psyche. Presenting himself not as a hero, he depicts the base human desire for survival. So many other sources have detailed the horrors of the concentration camps (the selection processes, hunger, death) but few have made it so personal. Despite the brevity of this novel, Wiesel manages to fully convey the day-to-day struggles endured in these camps. I found myself highlighting passage after passage.I'm really pleased that \\"Night\\" is finally available on Kindle. However, there are a few problems, especially with the formatting for the Kindle Fire. One page is completely missing; oddly, the page is viewable when I read it on the Kindle Keyboard. Also on the Kindle, the formatting is completely off for the speech Wiesel delivered when he won the Nobel Prize; the speech is nearly unreadable."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I cannot say that I enjoyed this book. I thought it was very well-written, and the subject matter is doubtlessly a worthy subject. Nevertheless, it is hard to *enjoy* a book about the Holocaust.Weisel writes with a strong voice, and his concise word usage is much appreciated. There are times when I would have liked him to go in to a little bit more detail, however, as to the nature of the type of work he was doing and what the prisoners did exactly when they were not being brutalized. If read as a documentary of the Holocaust, this book lacks the details to stand. If read, however, as an emotional encapsulation of the blurred, nightmarish months of a Holocaust survivor and his father, Night is a great success."},{"Title":"Night","review":"The Holocaust in itself was a tragic and terrible event. This book was difficult to read only because it makes you realize what horrendous things humans are capable of. This book is a heart-wrenching story that is a must read for anyone interested in the Holocaust. \\"Powerful\\" doesn't even begin to cover it."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Elie Wiesel begins this journey prefaced by salient interactions with a foreign Jew named Moishe. Moishe expended his energy in warning townspeople of the horrific fate of other Jews in Hungary at the Hungarian Poland border. His words were semarily dismissed and history took its course. It was 1941. The war was in full force and still no one listened. After all it was the 20th century not the middle ages. A re-enactment of the Black Death revolt is insane...the sky is not falling. The sky fell for Elie and his family in the spring of 1944 when the Germans invaded Budapest. Elie describes the next year of his life in chilling detail from the ghettos to the cattle cars to Auschwitz to Buchenwald to Gleiwitz and back to Buchenwald and solemn liberation. As Elie describes it, when you are near death and starving parades at the sight of American tanks were just not done...they were happy but starving, sick, and exhausted.Elie describes the struggle for survival at the hands of SS men and camp life. He struggled with his father; their relationship is endearing and heartfelt. Elie also struggles with his faith but with more loyalty to it than most. Passover is acknowledged if not celebrated in the camps; albeit, fasting is questioned under the circumstances. Men are reduced to beasts, fighting over every bread crumb, warm clothing, and each other. Night is chosen as the title as there were so many nights where with the rising sun came the unknown, ie.e where were they going, would they be separated, what would they do? This is a book that does not focus on the mechanics of the camp, the administration or the bureaucracy of the SS, this is a story of human survival of a father and son under the brutalities of nature, hunger, selection, and hate. In some venues, the sky is still falling."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Night, by Elie Wiesel, is the story of his experience in the Nazi death camps. Other people have given very thoughtful and thorough reviews here so I will only mention a few of the things that I will carry with me from this book.One of the passages that really struck me was when Eliazar and his father are being transported into the camps and Elie tells his father that he is sure it will be okay, that the Germans are civilized and that in this day and age, the Jews will not be mistreated as they were before. His father responds angrily about the people of \\"this day and age\\" and the terrible things they have already allowed. A short time later Elie and his father march past the graves into which the bodies of small children have been thrown, and Elie slowly comes to the realization that he and his father are stuck in a nightmare from which they will be lucky to survive.Part of the reason this struck me so hard was that the same day I listened to this passage, my husband related to me a phone conversation with his 84-year-old father in which his dad was bemoaning the sad state of the world and the decline of social values that all started when Clark Gable spoke the word \\"damn\\" in \\"Gone with the Wind.\\" According to my father-in-law, that one word started a steady decline which has led to the world today in which movies are laced with profanity, women wear flip flops to work and gay couples are allowed to get married.I contrasted the horror of the spectacle of mass graves which young Elie viewed as he entered the nightmare world of the Nazis with my father-in-law's picture of what he viewed as the decline of society and thought that the world really hasn't changed so much since World War II.We tell ourselves that something like the Holocaust could never happen today, in this day and age, when it is, in fact, happening over and over again in other parts of the world this very moment. We allow ourselves to be horrified by inconsequential issues involving people's private lives, all the while ignoring the very real, public tragedies that are played out every day. And we congratulate ourselves on our open mindedness, ignoring the very real prejudices that lie within our own minds.This is why it is so important that we read books like Night- to help remind us of the horrors of which we are capable. One of the other things that I will carry with me about this book is Wiesel's depiction of what happened to himself-- not physically, but mentally when he was driven to a point where he actually welcomed the death of his father and the lifting of the burden upon himself which his father's life had become. Wiesel describes how the inmates at the Concentration Camps themselves turned on each other as they came to realize that the goal of keeping oneself alive sometimes mean betraying someone else. I have said it before-- one of the most terrible things about war is not that people are killed, but that it turns people into killers. The most tragic thing about the Holocaust is not that so many people lost their lives, but that so many people brutally took part in carrying out the mass murders."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Elie Wiesel's Night is one of the most impacting books I have ever read. When I first read it in 1995, I saw a face of the Holocaust for the first time. I knew the facts of it, but Night helped me to see the human element of it. And, for the first time, I started to think about the idea of how a good God could allow such atrocities and evil. After reading the book in one sitting on the couch on my apartment, I had new categories opened to the world and to my faith.Night chronicles Elie's struggle not against Hitler or Mengele or Himmler, but rather with God Himself. Wiesel's book captures the human questions of theodicy, justifying a good God with evil in the world. It brings up questions that I'm sure I'll think about for the rest of my life.This book also showed me the way to God as well: how can we call Hitler or the extermination camps evil unless there is such a thing as absolute goodness? To condemn the Nazis is to say that there is a principle of goodness that they did not meet. If good and evil are only products of society, why do we consider the Nazi German society evil? Who are we to say that what they did was wrong unless a universe principle was trespassed? If there is a universal good, then there is a universal author if that principle, as well. In this way, the Holocaust points a way to a good God in the universe.After Night, I read many of Wiesel's books. In 1998, I attended Boston University and took a class with Professor Wiesel: The Literature of Albert Camus. That semester was the best educational experiences that I've had. (Ask me about my office meeting with Wiesel when we discussed C. S. Lewis or the failed card trick I attempted to show him in class).I am currently teaching Night in my Honors 10th grade literature class, and students enjoy it. It strikes me as particularly important now as kids are prone to hold the \\"whatever works for you\\" principle of morality. Night shows that morality is not something that society can simply create and the rest of the work should accept blindly. Isn't that how the Holocaust happened?"},{"Title":"Night","review":"As hard as it is to hear about the unthinkable evil that existed during the Holocaust, we must remember that it did, indeed, happen. Elie Wiesel's Night is a brutally honest report of the torture that occurred in the concentration camps, and how it not only destroyed the prisoners physically but emotionally as well. Night reminds us to never forget the evil and the inhuman actions that were taken upon these innocent people-for if we forget, it may happen again. Wiesel writes the novel as an account of his personal experience, but it explains how everyone was treated and how everyone was affected. Wiesel portrays very honestly and very clearly that the Nazis destroyed these people. The Nazis treated their prisoners as animals, and due to this treatment the prisoners lost their faith, their families, and themselves.It is hard to believe that such an incredible portrayal of an evil of this measure could fit into roughly one hundred pages. Wiesel did not go into great detail on his personal emotions and thoughts about everything that was happening. He simply gave a frank explanation of what occurred there. The way he wrote it, however, was more eye-opening than any documentary could be. Night captures the horror, the torture, and the sadness of the Holocaust. It is important to read books like Night so that we may begin to understand what happened, and so that we can do everything in our power to prevent it from happening again. It mustn't have been easy for Wiesel to revisit these events while writing Night, but he wrote it to open our eyes to the evil that must never be repeated."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Being a sixteen year old sophomore in highschool, the Holocaust isn't something I would think about too often. Before sitting down to read Night, I had the understand that it was just going to be another story about the Holocaust. However, I was wrong. I would never think that one persons experience of something could move me as much as Elie Wiesel's words have. Usually I take most things I have for granted, not thinking how much worse some people have it. After reading the excruciating events that Elie Wiesel's was faced with, my views about the Holocaust have completely changed.Though at times the scenes could be gruesome, I couldn't put the book down. When I would get to the end of a chapter, I would have to continue on to the next chapter because I was so interested in what was about to happen to him next. Elie did a tremendous job explaining everything that happened to him though his horrifying journey. As I read, I tried to put myself in the situations he was faced with and I don't think I would have the mental or physical strength to survive the torture he faced. I strongly recommend this book to any and all who are interested in learning about the Holocaust."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I initially approached this book with an attitude of \\"OK, another Holocaust story...\\" But now that I have finished, I cannot hide my shame for having thought I could take this book for granted with a skim-thru read.Night is not just another Holocaust story. It is the ultimate Holocaust story.It is told thru the eyes of a very young man with the detail and touching charm that only the young are able to bring forth. You journey with this fellow as he recounts the turmoil, deprivation, and struggle of being torn from his family home. And then you are right there with him as he and his comrades are subjected to the gruesome conditions of concentration camp life.But rather than just a recounting of one horror after another (and believe me, there is plenty of that), what makes Night so special is the intense mutual love of this young man and his father. The power of their love created strength neither of them knew they had, and created wonder on every page.If you can imagine the most profound love story entwined with a story of sheer horror, this would be Night."},{"Title":"Night","review":"By God, the contents of the book are horrific. Personally, I can't imagine doing such an inhumane thing to human beings. For a summary, you can look at the other reviews, but I just wanted to say that it might change the way you look at things... I've learned to count my blessings."},{"Title":"Night","review":"In this short but poignant and terrifyingly vivid translation of the account of his arrest and incarceration in a Nazi death camp, Elie Wiezel recounts his experience without melodrama or pretentiousness and with sincerity. The narrative is clear and conveys to the reader the psychological and physical trauma that were the results of this nightmare. The book should be read by young and old, and especially by those who have forgotten or doubt the veracity of the holocaust."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I first read \\"Night\\" about 25-30 years ago. This new translation is just as powerful as the original English publication. It's a very small book, but it packs an incredible punch even for a story that's been told many times by others who survived the Nazi death camps. Wiesel doesn't need many words or excruciating details to shock the reader into remembering how unbelievably cruel humans can be toward other humans. If there was ever a case study for showing where prejudice and hate can lead, \\"Night\\" is it.Read it. And someday ask your kids to read it."},{"Title":"Night","review":"The book was more than I had heard it was. I could not put it down, reading into the wee hours of the morning to finish.

History books tell the facts but this book shares the journey with deep feeling and dignity. Thank you, Elie Wiesel."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Elie Wiesel does a wonderful job of describing the horrific events of the Holocaust. He enables the reader to truly experience the fear and terror of the times, while also desribing the striggle to have faith in a higher power that could allow such atrocities. I highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Night","review":"i found myself riveted to this book, it was so hard to put down. my heart broke for elie, being a young boy and having to endure the horrors of the concentration camps, not to mention what happened to his family. I applaud elie for telling this story so that people will know what happened and will never forget. i wish that these atrocities never happened to any of the people that either lived through it, or died because of it. It truly is heart wrenching to know that innocent human beings were treated this way."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I started Night while soaking in the bathtub, and the water turned cold before I could put the book down and stop reading long enough to dry off.Wiesel's straightforward prose painted a picture of the Holocaust clearer than my new 5.0 Megapixel camera.His story begins with the thoughts and events of a happy boyhood existence, and quickly progresses to a monotone cadence matched only by the gravity of his story.My heart twisted over Wiesel's description of his father's death. In the dark, crying out for his son comfort, Wiesel lay motionless, frozen in fear of an impending blow from an SS officer patrolling with a large club.I find myself unable to comprehend the magnitude of suffering and torture at the hands of fellow man. However, Night is an amazing testament to the love between family and the human will to survive.A quick read, Wiesel's story is relevant today. Night has an uncanny resemblance to the religious intolerance that is currently crepting into a world distracted by the latest version of American Idol."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Although this book is small, it really creates a large picture about the holocaust through the eyes a fifteen year old boy.

But, the author states that this \\"concert\\" lives forever in his memory every time he hears the Beethoven violin theme...and it will also \\"live\\" in your memory--- in the mind of the reader of the book every time you think about this book.

With 420+ reviews, I will not make this an overly elaborate review, as the book simply does not require it. Elie Wiesel's story is one of one man's courage, will and fortitude to push on when all around him was lost; friends, family, belongings, even basic human dignity.What struck me more than anything else from his personal story was the retelling of the hanging of the three men (well, two men and one boy) while he was in one of the concentration camps. Millions perished, but the way the boy who suffered during the hanging stayed with me. His story is the story of millions who perished and who never got to tell their tale, and one of the few books I would call a must read.Different instances in the book I am quite sure will strike readers differently. One of the things which struck me and stayed with me was how he kept on looking for God, even amidst the enormity man sometimes will carry out on his fellow man. What also struck me was the woman on the train who was saw the flames at the camps even before they arrived. And the times he scolded and questioned himself and his ethics for even thinking selfish thoughts even though he was dying. I still think would I (could I?) do the same if I was in his terrible position?This book shows the worst of mankind, and sadly this terrible event known as the holocaust is not entirely unique in man's history since the freeing of Elie Wiesel. We have witnessed Rwanda firsthand in the 1990's, and have been told by world authorities that \\"this will never happen again.\\" Yet in modern day Sudan(and North Korea, and Tibet.....), we see much of the same.....the world turning its back on millions of people. There may not be furnaces involved, but the crime of complicity through inaction is little different than a world which allowed human beings to be fed into furnaces. I guess the final question I come away asking from his book is \\"Will mankind ever learn?\\""},{"Title":"Night","review":"An excellent book, vivid imagery, brutal honesty. However I feel that too much was omitted from the earlier versions. Because Night is so beautifully written and the story so compelling, it leaves you wanting more of the experiences."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I first read this in 1988 for a class in high school. \\"Powerful\\" doesn't cover it. This book sucks you in and doesn't let go. Once you start reading it, you won't want to stop until you are finished. Well, let me re-phrase that.... you will be so horrified that you WILL want to stop, but you will keep reading anyway. It's a relatively short book, but you really get a sense of what the author went through. Towards the end, I really wondered what was keeping him alive. I have loaned this book to many people, including those who haven't read a book in years, and every last one of them read the entire book all at once and said it was great. Some of them bought their own copy. It's not uplifting or cheerful; there's not a happy ending wrapped in a colorful little bow. If you want to get a sense of what pure evil is and how far it can go, then this is a book to read. This goes way beyond politics or race; it makes these issues seem minor and petty. The only agenda in this book is exposing evil unleashed.As far as the newer Oprah edition, I don't like it. They re-translated it and to me, I think they dumbed down the language. Part of the appeal of the original translation was that it did sound like a traditional European person talking. It was a welcome change that introduced people to a different way of speaking and using words. In other words, it broadened the reader's horizons a little bit. This new Oprah edition erases that and uses common everyday American-English. All of the old-school European feeling is lost. I would highly recommend the original paperback from the 1980s."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Frightening ! Shocking ! Repulsive Raw Truth !

It is very graphic in a few places that could be traumatic to a child reading this but it is all truth. I have not read all the books of WWII but I have read many. This book tells of the horror of what mankind is capable of? And, I can understand how someone who went through this time could wonder of the existence of God. I have no answer of why He allowed this to happen but I do know there is a God who sent us a Savior in His Son. It was a very interesting and well written book. I recommend it to older teenagers and above because of the graphic word pictures especially of what is done to children. This is a book to remind us that we must not forget what a corrupt and dangerous government can do and we must remember to gaurd our rights provided by the constitution of our great and wonderful United States of America."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Nobel Peace Prize recipient, Elie Wiesel, retells his riveting personal account of the Holocaust in his autobiography, Night. Out of the forty international works of literature entitled to Wiesel, Night became his masterpiece. As the narrator, Wiesel takes his reader through the gruesome process he was forced to endure. Night begins with the backdrop of Wiesel's hometown, but quickly from there moves to a ghetto, then to deportation, on to transportation in a sealed cattle car, to concentration camps, on the dreaded Death March, and eventually to liberation, separation from the physical aspects of the Holocaust, but never the mental or emotional. The struggle for Wiesel to maintain his strong belief in a God who he believed to be altruistic is one of the predominant themes in Night. Wiesel offers a sincere account of the gruesome questions he was forced to ask and the doubt he developed concerning his faith. Despite the fact his views on God were altered, he never denied the existence of a supreme being. Wiesel's wavering faith could no longer sustain him through constant starvation and beatings. Therefore, the need to care for his father did. The two men miraculously were able to remain by one another's side through the majority of their horrendous journey. Overall, Wiesel provides his readers with a clear representation of the hardships the Jews suffered through during the Holocaust. Elie Wiesel's plea was and is not for justice to be brought, violence to be inflicted, no repayment for the lives stolen, but instead he beckons for remembrance; that, in and of itself, is what Elie believes to be his remaining purpose. He motions for people to break the silence, in order to never forget, because if those lives are forgotten or the gruesome years are lost in memory, the modern world has then become an accomplice of the Holocaust. The center of the universe, according to Elie Wiesel, is wherever people are in oppression, and this former victim of oppression demands action!"},{"Title":"Night","review":"Elie Wiesel was a teenager when he and his family were forced to leave their home in 1944 and sent to the Auschwitz and Buchenwald concentration camps. Night is the horrific story of Elie Wiesel's memories of the death of his family, the death of his own innocence, and his despair as a law-abiding Jew confronting the sinful nature of man at its worst. This book by the 1986 Nobel Peace Prize Winner is an extremely sad, but gripping account of what happened in the camps, and an unforgettable message that we must do what we can to stop the forces of evil. If you teach about war, you should definitely read this book. If you don't, you should still read this book."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Night is the story of young Elie Wiesel, the author, and his coming of age in the midst of the Holocaust. Fifteen-year-old Elie is just learning about his Jewish culture when the book begins. His teacher, Moshe the Beadle, is deported but returns in a few months to warn his neighbors about the horrors of the Gestapo, and Hitler. No one believes him and they all think he has simply gone mad. Not long after Moshe's warnings, the Gestapo force Elie and his neighbors into a tiny ghetto. Day by day, the people are packed onto cattle cars and shipped to Birkenau concentration camp. Upon arrival to the camp, Elie and his father are immediately separated from Elie's mother and sisters. This is the last time the two sides of the family will ever see each other. While waiting in line someone tells Elie to say he is 18 while they tell his fifty-year-old father to say he is 40. The two do as they are told and they pass the first \\"selection.\\" The prisoners that will stay in the camp are worked harder than they have ever worked before, running on about a 500-calorie diet at most. Dealing with both mental and physical abuse daily, the ones who survive long enough are then marched to Auschwitz, the main extermination camp.At first, the Jewish slave-laborers look out for each other and help to calm the fears of others. After endless beatings, exhausting labor, giving up gold teeth, and witnessing several hangings of fellow prisoners, however, the men are stripped of their faith and their pride and are only looking out for themselves. Soon, Elie is no longer praying for his survival, but the strength to not abandon his father. It is at this point, when Elie is losing grip with his faith, that the reader forgets that the narrator is just 15 years old. The pain and frustration in the story is that of a mature adult. The Nazis have not only taken his family and his hope, but also his childhood.The Russians are now advancing toward the camp and the prisoners, including Elie with a broken foot, are forced to run a murderous 50 miles to the nearest concentration camp, Gleiwitz. Just a few days after leaving Auschwitz, the Russians liberate the camp. The 100 remaining prisoners in Gleiwitz are then loaded on to a cattle car and head for camp Buchenwald. Due to starvation, exposure, and over-crowding, only 12 survive to the end of the trip. Of the 12 are Elie and his father. Unfortunately, Elie's father dies of dysentery and exhaustion just a few days later. Elie is able to keep himself alive until America liberates Buchenwald.Elie Wiesel deals with his loss of faith during the holocaust, and relives the horrors of the concentration camp. He shows how such a life affected the people in the camps and how it changed many of them into something less than human.Walter S.

The detail this author's descriptions evoke are difficult to experience. It's not a fun read, but a necessary one. Everyone should read it."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This book shook me to the core. In fact, after reading it, my husband and I visited Auschwitz-Birkenau Concentration Camp in Poland and learned so much more than what is in history books.

You will not get this kind of insight from a history book or class. The torture people had to go through was shocking and I have learned a lot through Wiesel's work."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Elie Wiesel has close to, if not one of the most moving stories about a life. His life. In this incredibly moving and powerful recount of his experiences at the Concentration Camps, he fully encompasses all the terrors that these awful camps had to offer. His explanation in full detail almost makes the reader feel like they are there, witnessing these acts. Through the book, I felt absolutely horrified, disturbed, and more often than not, sick to my stomach. But I remembered while I was reading this book that I was not there, and I could not possibly imagine what happened; but the fantastic imagery in this book made me feel like I was.What I think that Elie Wiesel was trying to accomplish by writing this book is not to educate us about the Holocaust, we have history books for that, but to give the reader a pseudo-experience, no matter how haunting, that will stick with the reader. I know it stuck with me. Never before do I think I have read such a moving book, and I can definitely say that nothing I have read has even come close to matching the intensity and depth of this book.What some readers may say about Wiesel's purpose in writing this book is for people to feel sympathy towards him or pity him. Whether Wiesel is pitied or not by the readers of this book is irrelevant to the cause. I personally do not believe that pity was the intention or motivation to write this book. Wiesel believes that you should not stand by and watch something bad happen, you need to tell people about it. He did, and I do not believe he could have done it in a more successful way.Whether the reader took something away from this book or not, Wiesel made one thing absolutely certain: We must not forget. That is the most important thing, and anyone who reads this book and appreciates it like I did will tell you the same thing."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I just returned from a trip to Israel and had a chance to visit the Holocaust Museum. I brought this book along to read after the visit, which I did. The overall information on the Holocaust is not new to me, as I have visited the Holocaust Museum in Washington and have toured Dauchau in Germany. But I had never read this book, and it was a very detailed read after all that I had observed in Israel. Weisel tells his story in a way that makes the museums all make sense. It's a story society should never forget. (I wonder what society will say some day about how we treat abortion, stem cell research--the destruction of embryos--and euthenasia, which is becoming more popular.) Honestly, we need to remember that people matter and that ethics should not be determined based on what society merely thinks is right.

Very emotional book to read on humans at their worst and best."},{"Title":"Night","review":"My grandparents and parents were both part of the Canadian Armed Forces in both the first and second World Wars and, when I became an adult, I remember the stories they passed on to me about what they had seen during those years. \\"Night\\" paints a vivid picture of Hitler's reign of terror and the Halocaust years, an era any remaining survivors would sooner forget than recall.Elie Wiesel brings to life the everyday experiences of a captive of war; the hunger, suffering, pain, cruelty and humiliation experienced in the death camps, such as Auschwitz. Hopefully, none of us will ever know those atrocities other than what we read in a book. However, what Elie brings to us is also the presence of hope, for surely without that, many of the captives of war who did return, would never have survived.Elie's writing style says much about Elie as a person. It has a humble quality blended with strong character. The book is not a lengthy one but speaks volumes. It is important to pass this part of our heritage on to future generations for so many gave their lives that we might live in freedom. All of Elie's writings are literary accomplishments, but this one seems to stand apart from the rest because the author has the knack of bringing the pages of history to life with candor and emotion.

Really, just read it. Get a box of tissues, sit in a comfy chair and cry your way through this horrible account of hate.

Somehow, for reasons no one can tell, he lived. And, then he lived without telling anyone about this experience -- for a period of decades.How he managed to remember in such clarity, no one will truly know. I had one terrible accident only 10 months ago, and I have already had my mind block out portions of it. Much to my chagrin as the memory is not worth reliving. This had to be true for Wiesel. The repressed history's sudden appearance probably was a two-edged sword -- a freeing of the horrid side effects of the repressed feelings accompanied by a reliving of the moments which can only be described as nightmarish.With such books, we hope he and the others silence the immature and revisionist historians who demand that no holocaust existed.With such books, inhabitants of modern free societies can bask with the opportunistic life bequeathed through the misery of others -- including Wiesel.Thank you, Elie Wiesel."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Elie Wiesel's memoir \\" Night\\" is a monumental piece of tremendous poignancy and absolute resonance. His account has altered the consciousness of millions. I was pleased to find that Wiesel's book is easy to read. He doesn't camouflage points with ostentatious language, or sugar coat anything. This book is one that inspires courage through truth. \\" Night\\" is more then a book, it is a life changing experience. You will be horrified, confused, angry, awakened, uplifted, and empowered."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Honestly, Night is one of the most touching books I have ever read. I've always had an interest in learning about the Holocaust and Elie Wiesel had used such powerful emotion while writing it and it is overwhelming to read and listen too. It must have been so hard for Elie to write Night because he went through so much pain and torture to survive and watched his own father die right before his eyes and he had to watch how the German Nazi's dealt with his dead body. I can't even fathom the thought of ever watching my family die, I cry just thinking about it. The fact that the German Nazi's wanted to destroy all of the Jew's, and actually thought they could is an utter disgrace to humanity. The Nazi's out of nowhere came and captured the Jews, they had no chance to even pack or say good-bye or anything. They were just taken away like that. None of us would ever think of something like could happen to us. And the Jews during that time definitely thought the same thing because no one thinks about how one day they are going to be kidnapped and killed by the millions. It's terrible how people could want a heritage and religion of such popularity to be completely taken from the world.Elie Wiesel did an excellent job writing this book because it shows in great detail what he went through and the emotions he felt. I'm sure that some people aren't very happy with how graphic he is sometimes but it actually gave me a better sense of what happened during that time. I don't think that the time frame as to which he wrote the book had an impact because he probably relives the experiences every day. He became ashamed of himself because he had actually wanted his father to die so he could survive. He admitted how he was so brainwashed by the whole experience that nothing will ever be the same to him anymore and he most likely will never take anything for granted anymore. I'm glad Elie Wiesel wrote this book because it gives everyone a very good idea of what everyone felt and went through during this terrible time."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Night is a book which is in every way powerful and perspective changing. It does not dance around the issues or use description to enhance the story. It is straight to the point, almost cut-throat. You are not reading it consciously if you do not feel great remorse and depression as you read of the actions of our ancestors. History and its people looked the other way during the holocaust but Elie Wiesel would not allow this of our future generations. This book is necessary to read just to see a side of human nature that many of us would like to pretend didn't exist, cruelty. This book is not uplifting in anyway, it ends with a boy all alone with a heart that no longer knows how to love, and the shame of knowing he abandoned his father. It also shows us that human character is not always the strongest, but you can always turn something horrible into something of value. Night educates thousands and gives us all an insight to our hearts and relationship to our families.Would I abandon my father? Would I still have faith in God? Would I be able to love again? These questions and many more swirl through our heads as we read of the trials and tests Elie faced at the camp. This book allows us to look into our character and let us wonder: would this break me? This is not a lightweight book despite its size, and is not a book just written to complain about what he went through at the time. There are questions of morals and values that resonate today in all society, and while Wiesel might not be the most poetic of writers, the points are clear."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Personally, reading Night by Elie Wiesel was a big eye-opener. As a fifteen year old who barely ever concerns herself with victims of the terrible event, I can truly say that it is an extraordinary book. There is just something about the blunt and to-the-point nature of Wiesel's writing that captures my attention and helps me understand the Holocaust better. I never thought I would like a book about the Holocaust, but this is really a different kind of book.Although the book is sad and rather scary to someone who's had the comfort of protection most of her life, it shows us the true message that many Holocaust victims probably want us to know. The message of warning us never to do something as stupid and prejudice like that again. Wiesel's approach of truth and directness shows us what really happened leaving out any exaggeration. I think everyone should read this book for an insight into the reality of the sufferings the Jews had to go through. Night is a short, not so sweet, novel that does exactly what I'm sure Wiesel intended it to do; get his message across. He does a very good job of this."},{"Title":"Night","review":"To put it simply the book \\"Night\\" is depressing to read. It is horrific in every sense of the word and having read it three times there is nothing that can ever prepare you to take in what the sentences in the book are saying. After reading just about any line you are in a state of disbelief, even now i still cannot grasp that these events actually happened to someone. It is sometimes painful to continue reading \\"Night\\". It would not matter how poorly the events in the book are described there is nothing that can dull the concussive power a first hand account of being in a concentration camp hits you with. In the last pages of the book when Eliezer is unaffected by the death of his farther, is a prime example of how horrifying this book can be. I cannot imagine that someone can go through so much suffering that the death of their farther leaves them with not even a tear, but it has happened. \\"Night\\" shows you the grim reality of the unimaginable power hatred has.\\"Night\\" is the hardest book to read in my opinion by far, but i still would say everyone should read this. I do not like this book, for it is not possible to enjoy reading it. No recreation can come out of it, but there is so much to learn from it that to not read it is simply crippling yourself, that is not even a slight exaggeration. \\"Night\\" is not only to tell people what happened during the Holocaust but to show the darkest parts of human nature.

Never.\\"I read Night in high school, and always think of it as being a particularly long book, which it is not. Wiesel manages to pack more than I would think possible into a little over a hundred pages, which relates the story of himself and his family during the Holocaust. It is a beautifully written work that relates a terrible story. I found the story of Wiesel's loss of faith and the relationship he had with his father particularly memorable.

It's worth it."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Night, by Elie Wiesel is a non-fiction story that takes tragedy to another level. It really does not seem to be real, but this was apart of World War 2, more specifically, the Holocaust. This tells his story of how he survived and how the rest of his family did not.It starts when he was small, he was living a decent life, his father owned a shop. But when the Germans walked through the streets with guns in their hands, he didn't know what it meant, but his parents were getting worried. Later on, he knew exactly what it meant when the Germans passed by.He waited a long time until he was sent on a train with a very little food or anything for that matter. Not many people survived that ride, they were willing to commit suicide because the couldn't take it anymore. Another reason was because of starvation, or dehydration, most of the people there couldn't live under those conditions.When they arrived, they first separated the men from the women. That meant he had to leave his mother and his 2 sisters. It was only him and his father. It was hard, but he had to get used to it. As time went on, people had to strip themselves and run laps, and get new clothes. Then, they got assigned jobs.As time went on, his father was just getting weaker and weaker as inspections went on. You would see more people on the ground dead.Then, one horrid night, the generals told them to get out of bed in the middle of the night and run many miles in the blizzard to another camp. That night was like no other. He actually saw people die.Nothing is happy about this story. It breaks your heart, especially because it is all true. It is the perfect story to read."},{"Title":"Night","review":"These tragically pitiful words summon the inordinate power of this small book NIGHT by Elie Wiesel. Everyone knows the story of the Nazi concentration camps: No one knows the story of the Nazi concentration camps. Novels, films, photographs, poems, speeches, tours of sites all try to give some idea of the gripping tragedy of the genocide and the deplorable conditions that befell the victims of the camps, but nothing does it as well as this deeply moving account by Wiesel.The reasons are many. Not only does Wiesel tell his story in the simplest of language without cluttering the facts with gory details: the facts themselves are atrocious enough and when told through the words of a 16-year old boy who entered the camps from his life as a spiritually devout Jew in Sighet, Transylvania that gradually metamorphosed into a challenged believer who felt God and mankind had deserted both his ailing father and him, the impact is overwhelming.Wiesel's writing is at once eloquent and harrowing and his descriptions of survival through the camps at Auschwitz, Buna, Birkenau, and Buchenwald searingly become imprinted on our minds. Every reader may think these facts are redundant but they can never be retold often enough. Even as we read this book there are occurrences in various places throughout the globe TODAY that resurrect the atrocities herein described. And in reading the Nobel Peace Prize statement by Elie Wiesel that closes this book we are bound to fight against the hate that allows such exploding carbuncles.This is a book that should be read by everyone, globally. In it lies our only hope that history will not continue repeating itself. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. Grady Harp, July 06"},{"Title":"Night","review":"With an incredibly moving story, winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, Ellie Wiesel, takes his readers to a place no one should ever have to go, a concentration camp. No two stories of the Holocaust experience are the same. The way in which Wiesel tells his is especially moving. For him to not have told it, he said it would be offensive to future generations to deprive them of the knowledge and especially disrespectful to the memory of the dead. Do not let the size of this book fool you. Between the pages of this slender book is an incredibly moving and powerful story.His recount begins with religion, the basis of all things for many people. He follows the instruction of his teacher with the hopes that he would help him \\"enter eternity\\". Moishe the Beadle, his teacher, was suddenly expelled from Sighet, Transylvania he was a foreigner. When Moishe returns, he tells horror stories and suggests people take heed. He tells of prisoners being forced to dig their graves and babies being used as targets for machine guns.Going from the ghettos and eventually to the concentration camps, Wiesel constantly questions God and the world. Why has his God abandoned him when he needs him the most? How can the world still go on when babies are being burned and men and women worked to death? The men find true equality when they are all stripped down naked of their distinguishing clothing. In Auschwitz, men become mere ID numbers. The ideology revolved around fear. Wiesel says, \\"Fear was greater than hunger.\\"His father's only son, he served as his father's only crutch in the concentration camps. When his father becomes fatally ill, it is the advice of the Blockalteste that he watches out for himself, as he can no longer help his father. In the concentration camps, everyone must look out for himself. This is the message sent to Ellie. This encounter fills his head with, what he considers to be ill thoughts. He forever regrets the decision he made regarding his father.Reading this account has broadened my interest in the Holocaust experience and has led me to want to further question basic humanity both philosophically and psychologically. Wiesel brings to light an experience one should never have to live through. Only mere twists of fate can keep one alive during such conditions.At the end his new preface, Wiesel strongly states, \\"The witness has forced himself to testify. For the youth of today, for the children who will be born tomorrow. He does not want his past to become their future.\\""},{"Title":"Night","review":"I'm surprised that this book is only surfacing in Oprah's book club now.It's been around for a long time,and has received acclaim from every corner of the earth.That being said: Buy this book. It will change your opinion of the value of your life. It will stick with you forever.After you've read this,get the other two Wiesel books. Let your children read them,if they are old enough to read. Having re-read it ,I can only say that it continues to both haunt and inspire me.I found out about the Holocaust when I was 10,and from that day on,I have read everything I can get my hands on about not only the victims,but also about the murderous Nazi regime. For another harrowing look at the nazi mentality and its incomprehensible cruelty,read The Painted Bird,by Jerzy Kosinski.Whether it is fact or fiction,it shows in harrowing clarity the beasts that were nazis."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Wiesel's famous book about his horrifying experiences in a concentration camp truly deserves its accolades. Having read this book years ago, I did pick it up again because Oprah had chosen it. But the spare writing and the vivid portrayals were just as moving as I'd remembered. Wiesel does not waste words and he doesn't mince them either; he is frank about his degeneration into a person obsessed with survival and the misery of watching his father's slow death. My heart broke for the loss of innocence that can never be recovered and man's cruelty to man. Wiesel is to be commended for sharing this tale in so honest a manner. Maybe it's some comfort to him to know that others have benefited from it. Highly, highly recommended."},{"Title":"Night","review":"The most remarkable thing about this writer is his capacity to raise such monumental questions about faith and existence in so few pages. His ability to affect so many emotions with so little prose is impressive, to say the least. In addition to Night, some of my favorite works by Elie Wiesel include The Accident, a grim revealing of the Holocaust which fluctuates between the past and present lives of a single protagonist; much like Twilight, another one of my favorites by this author. One could effectively compare any of Wiesel's works as his themes are rather typical and central to his inability to be silenced. He is of his work; therefore, his tenure as an author of the Holocaust will prove to be everlasting."},{"Title":"Night","review":"The Holocaust is the stain that will mark the 20th Century as a time of fear, a time of hatred. This event causes all our accomplishments, victories, and technological advances to seem paltry in comparison. But does anyone remember that time? Do your children even have a brief history of the Holocaust? Of The Rwandan Genocide? Or Perhaps some more current knowledge...-The Crisis in Sudan? Anyone...? No, it is as I imagined. The world is full of people who seek entertainment and personal joy; those that seek knowledge of the past are few, those who seek the truth, fewer.Elie Wiesel desires to spread his story and the story of the Jewish people who perished during their stay in the camps. His story is at times hard to read; at times it is graphic; and at times it will break your heart. Elie won the Nobel Peace Prize which is the top honor that any person can receive. His acceptance speech (for the Nobel Award) was as stunning as it was sobering. He is most deserving of the award.I have many of Oprah's books and I have loved some and was bored with others, but this book shouldn't be purchased just because it has Oprah's endorsment on the cover, no, this book should be purchased by those of you who seek truth over fiction, a Brave story of loss, redemption, and peace is what you will find."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This book is not uplifting, it is not hopeful, it is not triumphant. As you read Elsie's tale of being shipped from one camp to another, starved, beaten, and simply trying to survive you ask yourself- is life even worth it? You sympathize with those who ran into the electric fences to end the torment.... and you realize... this really happened.This is a short book, very precise and to the point, but for me I had to read it in chunks because it was so sad and disturbing. It is so important that books like this are written (and applauded) and that society reads, and re-reads them, so we never forget.If you are looking for a more redeeming look at the holocaust- I recommend Viktor Frankl (MAns search for Meaning) but for me, Night was much more affecting, it chilled me to the bone and hits a hard punch. If you are studying the holocaust, have children interested in it, or just enjoy real life stories that are completely unforgetable- this book belongs in your library!Please pass it on..... so we can all remember."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Powerful, Powerful firsthand account of the Holocaust. Sad, poignant, bitter are words that come to my mind. And yet in reality my feeling after reading this is undefinable. It's incomprehensible that human beings would treat others so inhumanely. This period in our history is deeply troubling but even more heartbreaking (can it be more?) given the personal face of the author. A lot of books are given the title 'must-read'. But every person on the planet must read this book so we do not forget, so we do not think it is over exaggerated, so we do not let history repeat itself. My fear is we will forget and present events show us we are still capble of these unspeakable acts."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I was assigned this book in one of my relgion classes, but due to time restraints we were not required to read it. Just out of the blue, one day, I picked up and started reading it. 2 1/2 hours later I had finished it, I was unable to put it down, even for a minute. For that 2 1/2 hours I was transported to WWII Europe and I was very lucky to get out alive. Elie Wiesel shared a part of his life with me, like I have never before experienced.

Thanks to Oprah Winfrey , who has once again popularized this first person account of the Holocaust, and helped raise the consciousness level of Jews and non Jews alike in today's younger generation.Elie Weisel wrote his first book,his personal account of his experience as a jewish teen in Nazi Germany. Although it is a painful read, it is an era one must never forget.We Jews of the Nazi generation are fast dying out, and must pass this information onward.

He repeatedly uses the symbolism of fire and of nighttime, with excerpts that could move someone to tears. He says that he would never \\"forget that night... which has turned my life into one long night.\\" He would \\"never forget those flames which consumed my faith forever.\\"Most of the book however, simply tells a story. It relates terrors with no particularly pretty words or fancy writing.

There is some mention of what went transpired, but the focus' on the people-in particular a child. If you look at this book in a broader sense, it can be applied to today's problem of drugs and drug addicted babies,when they are admist the drug environment. They too are held in concentration camps- brainwashing and abuse run rampant. They are innocent and left to fight to survive--as the people in this book. This novel clearly shows how hope, strength and a desire for a better future are three things that \\"kidnappers\\" of any realm can't account for. This is a beautiful story of survival--truly many lessons for all ages and generations to come. Lessons of the past, but certainly can be used for the present, to preserve our future."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Very good historical account of the holocaust.

How can a loving and merciful God allow mankind to brutalize itself in such a repulsive and atrocius way as the Nazis did to the Jews during WWII? Except for Pol Pot's massacre of six million Cambodians thirty years ago, nothing in inhuman history dethrones Hitler's Holocaust.Not as atrocious, of course, the Cuban holocaust sends the world the same ominous message: \\"Thou shalt not stand idly by.\\" Only ninety miles away from US shores, this savage tyranny has survived over forty years on account of American ambivalence, and is visited by thousands of US tourists annually (illegally, of course.)

This is not a book for children, nor for the innocent. It is a real-life tragedy.Not a big difference from earlier versions of Night, it is a horrible, real picture of Life as it was, as it still is, and as it will always be. When we ask how can such atrocities happen, we need only look at today's news and read about accidental bombings in Iraq which kill hundreds off innocents. There is no question man learns little from his mistakes. And the similarities between persecution of the Jews, Gypsies, homosexuals during WWII is being repeated daily with the Islamic war against the West. (or is the West's war against Islam?)Night is so real, it is hard to draw the parallel with today. What have we learned from such a scholar as Elie Wiesel?"},{"Title":"Night","review":"I ENJOYED THIS BOOK..IT WAS VERY PROFOUND AND IT REALLY MADEME THINK...I ENJOY ALL TYPES OF MEMOIRS, AND BOOKS BASED ONTRUE STORIES. I FIND MOST MEMOIRS INTERESTING. tHIS ONE WASONE OF THE BEST......"},{"Title":"Night","review":"With a decades-long legacy of being used to torture schoolchildren, Night is indeed a pillar of modern establishment culture. It remains to determine what kind of a pillar it is.The official holocaust story claims that Jews were exterminated in gas chambers, but according to Night the Germans used giant flaming pits to exterminate the Jews, who willingly marched into said pits when the Germans told them to. Wiesel does not mention gas chambers at all. In reality, giant flaming pits wouldn't work as a method of extermination. A fire hot enough to cremate people is much too hot to approach. The Germans would have needed a catapult to throw people onto the fire, which isn't part of Wiesel's story. The coup de grace is the collection of aerial photos of Auschwitz taken by allied planes in 1944. These photos show little or no smoke, and in particular no giant flaming pits for exterminating thousands of people.Wiesel has a history of fabrication. For instance, he famously told a story about reading the Critique of Pure Reason in Yiddish just after being liberated - but the Critique of Pure Reason had not been translated into Yiddish. The only reason Night is famous is that it is presumed to be true, or at least closely based on a true story. In fact, it is only a sea of fabrications. As pure literature it is embarrassingly bad. Avoid."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I'm not sure I enjoyed this book, it was very troubling to read. You hate to think anybody ever had to go through what these people did. But it is important for everyone to know and I recomend this book."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I read this book when it first came out in the 60's and it made big impression on a young high-schooler. When I visited Dachau a few years later after joining the USAF and being stationed in Germany where the hatred of the Jews was still very much in evidence, I remembered the line from this book that was spoken by a dying Jew who was in the hospital with Wiesel at one of the death camps he fought to live in, that \\" I've got more faith in Hitler than anyone else. Hitler is the only one who kept all his promises to the Jews.\\"When i first read this book I was mad at the Nazis for their inhumanity, but after many decades I learned to redirect and balance my anger at those who led themselves like sheep to the slaughter. Wiesel has an interesting chapter at the beginning of this book about Moshe the Beadle, who escaped death at the hands of the Nazis and returned to tell the Jewish community in Hungary about how vulnerable they were. His advice was ignored, and when the Jews were herded up, they went without a fight as they went to the death camps, delusional to the end about the true nature of the threat until the Nazis pulled their heads out of the sand and marched them to the trains.What I did not remember about this book until I read it again this week was that the Jewish prisoners fought and scratched, and even killed their own for a scrap of bread, but did not think that they would best be served to act like humans instead of sheep and fight back as many did in the Warsaw ghetto. I suspect if they had taken out one in ten Nazis who rounded them up, there would have been no gas chambers or ovens since the Nazis would have been depleted to nothing. Wiesel ultimately came to this realization in his later years.Wiesel's descriptions in the book are fundamentally the story of those who would only take bread from the weakest of the flock as they moved from camp to camp, knowing that their ultimate fate was to die at the hands of the Nazis in the ovens. A scrap of bread to live another day was the trade-off for their own claim to humanity. It is essentially a study of a refusal to pay attention to the reality of the threats to the Jews that Hitler and other made, but also a story of human cowardice on a grand scale.I can now understand why this weakness only encouraged the bullies, just as other weak leaders such as the New York Times owners praise the United Nations, which is only united in calling for the end of Israel and the death of the remaining Jews on the planet. But just as millions of Jews got on the trains taking them to their deaths did so without a fight during the Nazi era, millions more are repeating history by ignoring the fact that sheep do not eat wolf stew. It goes the other way round.I gave this book three stars because it is an average. The descriptions of the horrors of what the Nazis did, as well as what the Jewish inmates did to each other to survive deserves five stars, but Wiesel was essentially clueless when he wrote this book over 40 years ago in understanding how his own actions and those of his fellow Jews made them less than human, and thus reinforced the view of many Europeans that they deserved the ovens that they tended as prisoners until they were too weak to load their own parents bodies into the furnaces and added to the flames when they were finally selected for the gas chambers.Nothing has changed, with the leader of Iran calling for the destruction of Israel, and the USA being the lone voice calling out for the UN to condemn anti-Semitism disguised as anti-Zionism. And indeed you have people such as the ambassador from France calling Israel a \\"shi**y little country\\" unworthy of a future, and dozens of American Democrats such as Jimmy Carter's loathsome new book comparing Israel to apartheid South Africa, and other politicians demanding that the US join the \\"international community\\" in condemning Israel for defending itself.Wiesel did what he did to survive, as did millions of other Jews, but their weakness invited the bullies to depravity, just as it does today. I suspect that the chorus will be the same once the Iranian nukes wipe Israel off the face of the Earth. This book is a study in how they will have brought it on themselves by acting like sheep instead of humans. And of course the world will look the other way, just as Clinton did when the Hutus slaughtered nearly a million Tutsi's in a three-month period but chose not to get involved. His approval ratings are off the charts, even though the holocaust in Rwanda was more intense over a few months than Hitler's was against the Jews over a decade.C'est la mort.But I suspect that Carter will continue his attacks on the Jews, and his book will be cited on Al Jezera and other propaganda arms all over the world as justification for supporting jihad, and NY will vote overwhelmingly Democrat in the next election. Talk about not connecting the dots!! Those dots will probably lead to the death of millions in the country you cannot find on a map in the Middle East which happens to be called Israel.Wiesel finally grew and understood that it is human nature to favor the \\"stronger horse\\" and the political parties in Israel are a reflection of the political delusions in play in the major cities with large Jewish populations in the US today. It is unfortunate that the later editions of this book did not include his late awakening of this reality.If you are looking for a book that covers this issue in a far better way than this short review, you might consider Mamet's \\"The Wicked Son\\" written by a Jew who understands what is at stake in today's world. But Wiesel's book is really an embarrassment and a look into how men can become mice, and be treated as such if they do not stand up for themselves.As the saying goes, those who do not learn from history are condemned to repeat it, and Iran is about to perform a nuclear repeat of the 1930's because too many around the world would rather look the other way as the UN Security Council delivers \\"peace in our time\\" once again."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I read it the 11th or 12th grade and all I could think about throughout the whole thing was how badly written it was.
