Lomborg, himself a card-carrying green activist and professor of statistics, set out to disprove a critic of the movement, and discovered to his surprise that much of what we carelessly accept as &quot;fact&quot; is actually based on mistakes, misquotations, and junk science. It turned out that the critic was not only correct, he was actually reporting only the tip of the iceberg.There's good news and bad news here:The good news is that we're making real progress on many fronts, despite the professional doomsayers who depend on a steady supply of enviro-scares for their continued funding.The bad news is that, although plenty remains to be done, if we can't put a stop to those crying, &quot;Wolf!&quot; where none exists, we're going to quickly loose all credibility and exhaust the public's patience and support.Lomborg's book is MUST READING for anyone who claims to have a real concern for the environment. It is going to shake up a lot of people. Watch for two reactions from organizations active in the movement: 1) Some will excoriate it and will stoop to ANY level in an attempt to discredit the book, essentially calling for a green jihad against it, 2) since effectively discrediting it is going to be virtually impossible, a larger number will attempt to ignore it and to force others to do the same.Having exposed themselves by their reactions, the folks who fall into either of these categories may then be dismissed as serious players, as people who are part of the problem rather than part of the solution.REAL environmentalists need this book!"},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"I had to critique a chapter of this book for a class for a module in a postgraduate GeoSciences course at Edinburgh University, Scotland. I chose the chapter on forests. It was not a difficult assignment. It was riddled with inaccuracies, exaggerations, avoidance of key issues, and, I am sad to say, plain lies. Lomborg uses data which is clearly not supposed to be used for the purpose he uses, mis-quotes people, aggregates data sets which aren't meant to go together, all to enable him to present the image he wants to portray. Personally, I can only comment on the chapter on forests, but after talking to my fellow classmates, it is clear he has done the same for the other chapters we were asked to critique. I can only assume he wants create a media frenzy which will push his book sales.Please email me if you want to read my essay critique of the chapter on forests.Thanks,Joseph Gair"},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"Bjorn Lomborg, Associate Professor of Statistics at the University of Aarhus, Denmark, has succeeded with this momumental work in stripping the myths from the environmental debate and presented the facts, in a way that is most enjoyable to read. He has accomplished this by keeping the fascinating narrative to 350 pages with around 150 pages of notes, bibliography and index.The book clearly spells out how these &quot;environmental myths&quot; which Professor Lomborg refers to as &quot;the Litany&quot; were born, evolved and spread by a willing and gullible media and the damage this has sadly created within the political process. The tide is turning however towards a &quot;facts based' environmental debate and this book will be an enormous assistance in speeding this up.It is very pleasing to see that Lomborg has given well deserved recognition to the great economist Julian Simon, who he attempted to refute, but on researching, found he largely agreed with. While Simon had enormous influence within North America, unfortunately he had considerably less elsewhere. &quot;The Skeptical Environmentalist will indeed have a wider reach.This book is a &quot;must read&quot; for everyone. Lets hope it is carefully read by the young in particular, so that they gain a sound perspective of the real issues we need to deal with and most importantly, built from this, a positive and realistic outlook of this wonderful world."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"Bjorn Lomborg does an excellent job in debunking the mass hysteria from the environmental left. Mr. Lomborg has been attacked and pilloried for daring to expose the lies and bogus research by the left.Buy this book if you want to understand what is really happening to the environment and see why most of the environmentalists are lying to you."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"What most critics of this book seem to overlook is that the vast majority of the literature on the environment comes from a certain apocalyptic vein. Even the ex-vice-president's book was so bleak and negative-I'm surprised it didn't come back to haunt him in the campaign (Earth in the Balance-Gore). The truth is the trends are favorable, and almost all the predictions by the fanatics have been proven false, and furthermore, it has been an increase in wealth and affluence that spurs this trend, not a return to cave-dwelling! And if the truth were told, most environmentalist have their own personal fiefdoms they chose to protect, and are not interested in what we may or may not leave to &quot;future generations&quot;! This book will help us get back to a rational evaluation of environmental issues, and away from the religious fervour that groups like Greenpeace display. Read it and give it to a college student!"},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"First the good news:1.The book's stated aims are laudable.2.Many of the points in the book are sound.3.It (usually) uses a better approach than just emotional gut feeling (\\"how arrogant are we to believe...\\")Now the bad news:1.It's a polemic.There's plenty of documentation out there about just how wrong it goes (e.g. the Jan 2002 issue of Scientific American), but I'll add a few thoughts:Lomborg shows no qualms about reversing his position wherever it suits. For example, he argues that acid rain was never a big problem and limiting sulphur dioxide output was a knee-jerk reaction. Then, in discussing air pollution he boasts about how much sulphur dioxide levels have dropped. What is wrong with this picture?Lomborg repeatedly argues that we can't help the environment without giving up schools or hospitals, as if spending less on agricultural subsidies or nuclear arms or even roads isn't an option. He dismisses transferring taxation from wealth creation to pollution for many dubious reasons including \\"limiting the joy of driving\\" -- as if that belonged in a supposedly objective book on the environment. He argues that cars are getting lighter; don't they have SUVs in Denmark?Lomborg also seems to have a skewed view of how much effort has been needed to get this far in cleaning up. In his world, and contrary to counter-examples such as Saudi Arabia, countries get to a certain level of wealth and then just clean up; scientific discoveries, public opinion, the democratic process and legislation don't come into it. The post-hoc fallacy should not be made by a self-proclaimed skeptic.Particularly painful to read is his version of the history of the Montreal Protocol, where every country instantly united in banning CFCs and moved on. What *really* happened was a longer process involving political and industrial interests attempting to discredit the science and the scientists (which still goes on), followed later by attempts to claim that reducing CFCs would be more expensive than living with the consequences of reduced ozone. There's an obvious parallel with what Lomborg argues with carbon dioxide limits: I suspect that had the book been written in the 1980s, he'd have argued against limiting CFCs.The book falls well short of meeting its stated goals. It's progress of a kind when a polemic acknowledges that there is such a thing as global warming or ozone depletion, but it goes on to say that in every field the (non-expert, non-peer-reviewed) author has looked into, the consensus of (peer-reviewed) experts is wrong: don't the book's fans find this in the least bit odd?And on the subject of peer reviewing: Cambridge University Press took the strange step of not getting the book reviewed by natural scientists. This isn't unheard of -- Velikovsky's bizarre \\"Worlds in Collision\\" also escaped scrutiny and became a big money-spinner for its publishing house.As a balanced text, I'd give it 1.5 stars. As a polemic I'd give it 3, but if that's what you're after then try P.J.O'Rourke's \\"All the Trouble in the World\\" -- considerably more upfront and readable."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"UPDATED 6 Oct 09 to upgrade to five stars and add links that comprise an apology of sorts. The more I read the less I know, and the more I appreciate the absolute essentiality of getting all points of view face to face before a citizen's wisdom council. New links that complement this book:The Resilient Earth: Science, Global Warming and the Fate of HumanityActs of God: The Unnatural History of Natural Disaster in AmericaThe Next Catastrophe: Reducing Our Vulnerabilities to Natural, Industrial, and Terrorist DisastersEco-Imperialism: Green Power, Black DeathThe Real Environmental Crisis: Why Poverty, Not Affluence, Is the Environment's Number One EnemyI rate this book a 5 for effort, a 3 for half-truths, and a 4 over-all. I am updating this review to note that my basic points were recently validated when the Danish committee for scientific integrity slammed this book for dishonesty. It is never-the-less a tour de force for Lomborg and his students (the latter appear to have done most of the tedious data gathering and basic analysis)--at its best, it provides a severe spanking for environmentalists who get careless with their data and their assertions. At its worst, it provides a semblance of cover for corporate carpet-baggers intent on liquidating what any child can understand is a closed system with limits.At root, Lomborg is a disciple and blind follower of the paradigm best articulated by Julian Simon, who has himself been discredited here and there by well-educated environmentalists. Lomborg's professionalism and devotion to data are not questioned here--one either shares his paradigm or one does not. It merits comment that there are now several web sites, one of them in Denmark founded by his own colleagues, dedicated to exposing the flawed assumptions and analysis that went into this corporately attractive politically-biased treatise.This is indeed a brilliant and powerful book, just as a nuclear explosion is brilliant and powerful--and very destructive. However well-intentioned--and I do not question, even applaud, the author's intentions, what we have here is a rather scary combination of fragmentary analysis in depth, combined with a strong belief system that accepts as a starting point the concept that the earth is infinitely renewable and no matter what happens, that is a \\"natural\\" turn of events....Just as 9-11 was necessary before a paradigm shift in national security concepts could be achieved (now we know that individuals without weapons can turn our own civilian instruments against us in really damaging ways), I fear that a major environmental--perhaps even a terrorist-environmental event, such as exploding train cars full of chlorine, will be required before citizens as a whole experience the paradigm shift and understand that a) we live in the closed system and b) the burden of proof must be precautionary rather than exploitative.We are soiling our seed corn and the earth it grows in. Lomborg would have us believe that what we grow within such a paradigm is natural and good--no doubt he has an explanation for the dramatic drops in sperm counts around the world, the troubling increases in asthma across Canada and the East Coast and other nations reeling from antiquated coal-fueled power plants (most of them in the mid-West), and other documented demographic costs to uncontrolled liquidation of the earth.I will end with one very significant concession to Lomborg and his adherents: this book, compelling in isolation, makes it clear that nothing less than the full application of the distributed intelligence of the citizenry on a 24/7 basis, will be sufficient to monitor, evaluate, and comprehend the breadth and depth of our attacks on the earth. It is now clear to me that until we have a global web-based community of citizen observers able to enter data at the neighborhood level, using peer-to-peer computing power to analyze distributed data, that the citizens will continue to be at the mercy of corporate computers and political manipulation.I strongly recommend this book, and Czech's book, as companion volumes framing a much higher level of data and debate that is now beginning."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"When picking up this book for the first time, I couldn't help notice the date of its publication: September 10, 2001. Lomborg's book was not only pre-911, but cool before global warming was cool. In the pre-911 world in which this book was written and in which it tried to dominate the climate change debate, The Skeptical Environmentalist serves as a bookend to a debate, which had begun 30 years earlier with Paul Ehrlich's writings. Instead of creating hypothetical scenarios, and then manipulating data to support the hypotheses, Lomborg suggests that he is able to \\"test\\" the viability of these scenarios with \\"statistics.\\"While \\"statistics\\" can be just another rhetorical tool, the sheer mass of data overwhelms any rhetorical maneuvers that the author can possibly employ. The sheer mass of data allows the reader to make up his own mind.While Lomborg's own belief in the reality of global warming can also be questioned, Lomborg at least displays his honesty that we \\"just don't know\\" what the result of an increase in greenhouse gases will cause. Increased CO2 in the atmosphere could just as well cool the earth's surface as warm it up.Finally, Lomborg's attention to topics, such as food scarcity or chemical risks, helps us to understand environment issues beyond just those caused by dangerous greenhouse gases."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"This is a calm, measured appraisal of the 'facts' (as best we know them) regarding a range of environmental topics - poverty, starvation, water supply, pollution, and so on. Using highly reputable sources of data, and with extensive references throughout, Lomborg analyzes the state of play, topic by topic: first, where we are today and how we got here; then projections of likely futures.In most regards, the data supports an optimistic view of the world's state. For example, the evidence presented by Lomborg on starvation reveals a declining percentage of the world's population starving, even a declining absolute number, and an increase in caloric intake per capita. And there is ample reason to expect hunger to decline still further in the future. As with several of the topics, however, progress in this area has not been uniformly distributed across the world, with - again as with other issues - Sub-Saharan Africa failing to benefit from the favorable trends that have been experienced elsewhere, particularly in Asia. Generally speaking, each of these sections leads to a similar conclusion: matters as they stand today are far from perfect, but they are better than they were in the past, and there is every reason to expect them to improve still further in the future.Then we come to global warming. Despite the claims by environmental zealots that global warming is universally acknowledged, and that it is universally recognized as deriving from mankind's production of greenhouse gasses, this of course remains a controversial topic. As elsewhere, Lomborg takes a measured approach, choosing to believe (at least for now) that global warming is at least partially caused by CO2 - while acknowledging the factors suggesting that the effect of this gas on climate might be considerably less than some claim. Lomborg's stance is: 'if it's true, what should we do about it, and when'? His conclusion - we shouldn't do much at all, at least not yet. In particular, we should avoid wasting scarce resources ineffectively, or in ways that will hamper the global economic progress necessary for the developing world to become affluent, healthy and well fed. Expenditures in, for example, the Kyoto approach would yield negligible benefits - at a huge cost. Instead, Lomborg argues, we should invest in whatever defensive measures become necessary, in about 50 years from now.Most books concerning the environment - on both sides of the spectrum - approach the issues with a great deal of rhetoric, accompanied by a small amount of evidence selectively assembled to support an argument. At worst, they are hysterical in tone. Not so this excellent volume, which balances a somewhat academic presentation with a popular narrative style, and offers a great deal of factual evidence for the reader's consideration.No matter what you think you believe about the environment, you owe it to yourself to read this excellent work."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"I was introduced to \\"The Skeptical Environmentalist\\" and Bjorn Lomborg by Scientific American. I am a decade long reader of Scientific American, and I still enjoy reading Scientific American. It took me a few years before I decided to read this book. It is a thick book and I was afraid it would be biased. However, I was positively surprised once I read it. This book is one of the most important and interesting books I have ever read. After reading this book I went back and read the critique of the book in Scientific American. I am sorry to say this but the critique in Scientific American was misleading, off target, strong worded, and ridiculous. The critique had nothing to do with Science; it was just a few offended Professors mouthing off. If you read the book carefully, check some of the facts for your self, and then read the critique in Scientific American Bjorn Lomborg will end up looking like the Galileo of our time, or maybe a Giordano Bruno. Many of the claims you will see in the negative reviews below are simply false and many highly exaggerated. Some negative reviewers, however, admit they did not read the book.Regarding his chapter on Global Warming. Contrary to what some reviewers and critics claim, Bjorn Lomborg does not deny the existence of Global Warming. Neither does he state that it is not partially human induced. However, he puts the effects of Global Warming in perspective and corrects many alarmist myths regarding this subject. He also statistically analyzes the effects of the Kyoto protocol and finds that it is a flawed protocol that does much more harm than good.Why the book is so important is because the public has been made to believe so much outrageous nonsense with regards to the economy, health, resources, environment, and the state of the world. It is primarily the media and environmental activists that are responsible for this misinformation. However, environmental scientists have not been very eager to correct misconceptions that result in more grants for them. This book is a \\"just the facts mam\\" book, and many (I believe the vast majority) of the facts that will surprise you are also agreed on by the very experts that are critical of this book. This is very important to remember. The book contains 173 figures, mostly graphs, nearly 3000 references, and thousands of interesting facts. Some of the claims in the book are under dispute, but for the average reader this is not of great concern. You have been bamboozled and Bjorn Lomborg will set you almost entirely straight.One great service the book does to the average reader is that it makes you aware of how statistics can be used to manipulate you (this was not a surprise to me). For example, a claim that more people are dying of cancer does not mean that there is a cancer epidemic. Cancer is an old age disease, and we are living longer but the overall mortality rate is still 100%(duh), so that a higher percent is dying from cancer is not strange. You have to adjust the cancer rate and mortality rates for age to see if it has become worse (and it hasn't). Watch out for statistics in the media. Lomborgs analysis of GM food scares/hoaxes was exceptionally interesting.And finally, here are a few interesting facts selected by me.>> In 1970 35% of all people in the developing world were starving. In 1996 the figure was 18% and the UN expects that the figure will have fallen to 12% by 2010.>> The life expectancy in the whole world in 1900 was still around 30. In 1998 it was 65 in the developing world.>> Water scarcity is a local and logistic problem, not a global resource problem.>> So2 pollution in London in the mid 1800 was around 40 times higher than it is now. Also economic development leads naturally to less pollution (not the the other way around), except for the very beginning.>> The price of the vast majority of the important minerals and metals keep going down, and the reserves up (we find more, or extract more efficiently).>> The worlds known conventional oil reserves has gone up (not down) because we keep finding more. At the year 2000 it stood at 40 more years of consumption.>> It is estimated that globally there is about 242 times more shale oil than the conventional petroleum resource (we could tap into this when the price goes up more)>> Do you remember the acid rain scare, it was just that. Acid rain only damages trees under very rare conditions."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"Finally, we have a reasoned expression on the critical components of the dangers we face in our environment. Not just a broad series of &quot;the sky is falling&quot;, &quot;death and distruction are upon us&quot; pronouncements from the self serving radical environmental movement, in this book we receive a rational view of what is really wrong with the environment, and a guide to a reasonable allocation of scarce resouces to change the things we can and should. The book further lets us see the methods that have worked in the past and how many aspects of the environment are changing for the better either on their own, or in response to our continuing efforts. It is a tribute to the depth and accuracy of the material provided that the arguments from the &quot;movement&quot; against the book are ad hominem arguments pointed at the person of Mr. Lomborg, not his analysis and conclusions.Thank you Mr. Lomborg."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"Excellent and fascinating expose of how the enviromentalist machine has made a cottage industry of apocalyptic and consistently wrong pronouncements of eco-collapse based on junk science. The current selection on libertarian Andrew Sullivan's book club, Lomborg's book is also the subject of an informed article in Reason magazine which exposes the tepid, hypocritical, and self-serving criticisms leveled at it by the incestuous enviromentalist/anti-industrial complex. A dangerous book indeed, in the best sense of the word."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"I purchased The Skeptical Environmentalist after readingthe free chapter that you can find on the web site of theCambridge University Press.The free chapter gives a very good indication of the contentsof the book. As you'll see in the free chapter he showsthat environmentalists often overstate their case.From his book itself I find that he takes very seriouslythe threat of global warming. His lengthy chapter on this topic isnot so breezy as the other chapters as he digs into a complex area.He takes the threat as real but considers proposedsolutions as too costly. He proposes alternatives."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"This book should be required reading for all earth's inhabitants. Lomborg is still an environmentalist despite what his critics say. He wants us to focus on issues of vital importance such as poverty in Africa, as opposed to questionable behaviors such as glass recycling.I am no fan of giant corporations. The early environmental movement, and a few brave outspoken souls, did much to improve air and water quality and get the alternative energy ball rolling; but many environmentalists have become as deceitful as the big companies they originally began criticizing.The economist Julian Simon was the original inspiration for Lomborg's book, and I highly recommend his \\"Ultimate Resource 2.\\" Simon may have been a conservative economist, but he loved the out-of-doors and like Lomborg, sheds much light, with tremendous amounts of hard data, upon the now-polluted environmentalist litany."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"Outstanding, comprehensive and absolutely necessary to be able to separate goodwill errors and 'green' junk alarms from science and reality. Dr med MG Koch, epidemiologist, physician"},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"In this book Mr. Lomburg proves to have a preoccupation with reality, and that's not a bad thing. It is very refreshing to find someone who can represent environmental science on a factual instead of fictional standing. It has been very frightening to watch the art of soothsaying elevated to the height of an actual science and then this so-called \\"science\\" used to achieve political power. As Stephen Schweider (global \\"cooling\\" scare/scam) has said, \\"Each of us (greens) has to decide the right balance between being effective and being honest\\" which in fact tells us our gullibility is no longer in question.The peer review process so often mentioned is no more than bad science \\"back patting\\". I have read the reviews in the so-called reputable publications and have found very little resembling objective science rebuffs. Instead they have resorted to emotional tantrums and irrational outbursts, which is typical of those not having a leg to stand on. One good thing did come out of reading these reviews though... it provides me with a very good guideline of what publications not to rely on for scientific insight.With this book Mr. Lomburg successfully weakened the cartoon foundation the greens have been building for so long. It is now time for \\"actual\\" scientists to knock it down altogether, re-take the intellectual high ground and prevent science from ever being used as a political weapon again.It's up to \\"us\\" to open our eyes and stop buying the snake oil"},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"I'd like to submit a different sort of review for this book. As a homeschooling parent, I am extremely concerned about making sure that my children have access to the best, most accurate information available. This includes, of course, controversial information. As such, &quot;The Skeptical Environmentalist&quot; should be considered a 'must-have' in the library of every high-school age homeschooling family.The premise set forth by Dr. Lomborg, namely that he read some controversial information and decided to refute that information in a scholarly, academic fashion is precisely the sort of determination and drive for academic honesty which homeschooling parents are trying to instill. In Dr. Lomborg's case, he found that the 'controversial information' was largely (but not completely) accurate. Thus, he was forced to modify his own views -- again, an honest, academic response.The actual subject matter in this book would also be of value to the home classroom. Dr. Lomborg tackles most of the significant environmental problems encountered in the world today, and addresses them in a fashion which is straight-forward. While I do not find myself in complete agreement with Dr. Lomborg, I find that his clarity of thought and presentation, as well as his copious references, an aid to forming intelligent and defensible positions.Finally, the observant homeschooler will note the tenor of the opinions attacking Dr. Lomborg. These attacks tend to be ad hominim in character, politically divisive, and largely devoid of any cogent dissent or scientific merit. I have seen little -- even by scientific journals -- which challenge Dr. Lomborg strictly on the facts and information presented. Unfortunately, such tends to be the response of one who would dare to tread on a sacred cow of political correctness.Overall, I would give this book a 3.5 for content, a 4 for presentation and documentation, and a 5 for its usefulness in a high-school homeschool setting."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"Bjorn Lomborg and his students have done an excellent job of parsing the arguments and data surrounding the range of environmental issues facing today's policymakers. The book is chock-full of verifiable data and carefully reasoned discussions of implications. People may disagree with his conclusions but you can absolutely not question his data. In this age where school kids (like mine) are taught that breathing equals pollution (really!), this plethora of data is absolutely critical. This is a great book to keep to check up on media statements and advocates' PR efforts."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"Confronts current biases of current environmental issues.Seemed logical. Probably most of it is valid.It is amazing how doom and gloom predictions, hyped by the media, and promoted by agenda-oriented environmentalists, gain widespread acceptance by the lay population.I suspect the majority of people who think global warming has been proven to be a threat to civilization could not understand or refuse to accept the scientific concepts presented in his discussion, even as well as the facts are presented.And the average person does not want to accept the fact that some foods we eat contain naturally occurring carcinogens, more potent than Alar."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"Its refreshing to read a book, that doesn't just give you facts but challenges you to go find the data and analyze it yourself. He doesn't disqualify the eviromental concerns, but rather puts them in a reasonalble perspective. The enviroment still needs work, but its darn refreshing to see someone who takes a moderate view. Very informative and well written."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"I bought the book on the strength of a review in The Economist and did not regret my purchase. This is not a scientific treatise, nor does it claim to be such; it is a timely and thoughtful critique of the environmentalist cause. I found it refreshing that for once someone took a closer look at the scientific assumptions, procedures and figures underlying our latest ideological orthodoxy. It only adds to the credibility of the work that the furious responses tend to concentrate on the author (the old ad hominem tactics) rather than on any factual basis -- possibly because Mr Lomborg uses the very same data used by the environmentalists.One may not agree with Lomborg and his views, but if his book makes the reader revisit and check his (received) opinions, then its purpose has already been fulfilled. One important aspect of science is criticism, and on environmentalist issues this has been sadly lacking so far. To quote one of the strident critics of Mr Lomberg:\\"[We] are not just scientists but human beings as well. And like most people we'd like to see the world a better place...To do that we need to get some broad-based support, to capture the public's imagination. That, of course, entails getting loads of media coverage. So we have to offer up scary scenarios, make simplified, dramatic statements, and make little mention of any doubts we might have...Each of us has to decide what the right balance is between being effective and being honest.\\"(interview for &quot;Discover&quot; magazine, Oct 1989)This book counteracts such attitudes, and is all the more important for it."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"This book tries to analyse the available statistics that determine the state of the world. This is done by looking in depth to find some facts that can explain them, so it is not a simple enumeration of raw data. This the author does very well, and the conclusion is clear: things are improving, and can improve faster if we put the resources to the real problems and avoid ghost problems that take nowhere. This is all so credibly explained and so rational that it seems very difficult to rebate. However, if this is so, why don't most scientists support this view? This is perhaps the most astonishing question that one gets in the end. People like me get caught between the opinions of those who say that the world is rapidly deteriorating and those who say that it is improving. Both have arguments. It is so difficult to decide between both, but the book shows many cases where respected scientists have exposed false data to support their view of the problem. This damages their credibility, and may explain the success of the book: we expect more seriousness from science. Sometimes I wonder if a really complex problem like this has so many interpretations that the position taken from most people is closer to religion than science, even scientists themselves."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"Poverty, infectious diseases, hunger and pollution are serious problems for the humanity. The good news is that all these problems are getting smaller and smaller all the time. The problems have become extraordinary smaller during the last century, and are likely to get even smaller during the next one. That is one of Bjorn Lomborg's messages in this highly controversial book. He is attacking a lot of high-flying pessimist like Lester Brown, Al Gore and UN's climate panel (IPCC), and has therefore been portrayed as a liar, amongst them the Danish Committee on Scientific Dishonesty (before the ministry cancelled their verdict). Their official reason is that the book is one-sided and contains some (a lot of) factual mistakes. My oh my. As he writes himself: the intention is to correct the usual picture painted by the environmental movement and the media, and that must necessarily mean a bias. And the book certainly is biased, but the trouble is that Lomborg is biased the political incorrect way. That there are some factual flaws shouldn't surprise anyone, because the book is so full of facts. However, with his 3000 footnotes and 70 pages of references, the facts are very easy to check.I was planning to give this book four stars, but after checking the some of the allegations other reviewers have posted on their sites, I changed my mind. Lomborg is one place attacked for \`deliberately not' having rounded 174,600 into 175,000 hectares, meaning Lomborg have given the number far to much credibility (Lomborg's footnote number 78). At another point, Lomborg is attacking the IPCC for having a hidden agenda. He accuses the panel's 2001 report for being concerned about consumption in general, and comes up with a lot of fantastic quotations, like \\"it's doubtful that this trend (of higher speed in transportation) really enhances the quality of life\\". I couldn't really believe this, but yes, it was true. The IPCC, which I until yesterday believed consisted of natural scientist, has used a lot of their latest report to mourn about how the TV are fooling us to believe that consumption is the road to happiness. The IPCC! The revelation of the UN priorities stunned me a bit really.The book is highly recommended. It's a thorough investigation into the all of humanities greatest concerns, and a highly usable reference. If you doubt any of the claims Lomborg makes you could always check out the primary source."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"Lomborg has written a well researched, carefully documented, readable book that exposes the shoddy research of so many of the establishment enviornmentalists. And they don't like it. Read the book, then read the criticism and his responses on Lomborg's web site and on The Scinentific American's web site (the S.A. wouldn't let Lomborg post their criticism of him on his web site). I found the SCIENTIST'S criticism based mostly on \\"because I say so\\" but make up your own mind.The crux is global warming. Lomborg finds The Kyoto Accord very expensive to impliment. There isn't much argument here. He also finds it almost worthless as a cure for global warming. This is also consistent with what the serious envioronmental data shows, but this isn't what the media is telling us."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"Several reviewers have commented on Bjorn's lack of response to his critics. Apparently, Bjorn wrote a paragraph by paragraph refutation of the 10 pages of space the SA devoted to his critics and posted it on his website. Scientific American sent him an injuction to take down his refutation on the ground that it was \\"violation of copyright\\". You can read his refutation of his critics [at his website].What is most interesting about the 'experts' attacks is that they do not debate him on the merits or the facts - instead they engage in personal attacks and appeals to authority -- he isn't an 'expert' in enviornmental affairs, etc. Funny. I thought science relied on demonstratable facts and methodologies.I suppose there is a lot of grant money at stake here. -- At least that's the only reason I can think of why the SA would be acting like this.

Seriously - Ph.D Political Science, University of Copenhagen, 1994. This book is a fine piece of work for those pro-pollution, foul-our-own-pot parties to point at when they tell voters that global change doesn't really happen and isn't happening. Having read it for a graduate-level global change course, along with several other texts, it was astounding the way Lomborg carefully chose which studies to use as examples and how he twisted the consensus of science by focusing on the margins to fit his agenda. Don't believe me? Ask the numerous international agencies and groups of scientists that have discounted the claims in this book. I also believe he was removed from his job because of the backlash. This book is an example of ecology's version of the anti-evolution campaign. You stand up a few so-called experts (usually people who real, working, publishing scientists have never heard of; often from fields outside the subject), and point out some negative results (which happens in science - its how science works) that fit your desired conclusion and call it a cover-up, an atrocity of science, a failure to humanity that such studies (the 0.001% of the 99.999%) are not considered the consensus. Heck, statistically speaking we should get negative results 5% of the time, simply by chance - even if the results were really positive. Now, if that is something you want to read as the &quot;truth&quot; about the environment, this is a PRIME example and I highly recommend it. It will at least open your eyes to how selective truths can be worse that flat lies. I think I am qualified in my opinion - I have been a professional ecologist for over 10 years.

What this book won't do is help your children sleep better seven generations from now. Money got this book published, not peer review. I'm a biology major and I personally talked with more than one professor about the inaccuracies of this book due to the unreliable, old and unobjectible sources used. Remember, this author is not an authority on science! Just because he uses over 2,000 sources doesn't mean their all true or not outdated. If you could read between the lines, you would see that he had a hidden agenda and used slanted tactics of a statistician to get HIS viewpoint across. So all the fatcats could feel good about themselves and we can keep on polluting OUR home. One day we will realize that we are only polluting ourselves. May the eternal spirit grow within all of us. Mother nature, our fellow man, unity and a bright (clean, healthy) future is what is important. Bjorn could care less that though as he rolls in the piles of cash this book has made him.

Now, a division of the Danish Research Agency has condemned Lomborg for \\"scientific dishonesty,\\" deeming the book \\"clearly contrary to the standards of good scientific practice\\" and systematically one-sided. The Danish Committee on Scientific Dishonesty conducted a six-month review ofthe book after several scientists filed complaints; despite thedamning conclusions it reached, the group stopped short of finding Lomborg guilty of gross negligence or deliberate attempts to mislead readers. Lomborg rejected the committee's findings and said it could get him fired from his new post as director of the Danish Institute for Environmental Assessment, but government officials said his job was not in danger."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"This is a thick book dense with various statistics covering many issues in a contentious way. How can a person decide whether it is worth the effort? Read reviews and you will get conflicting opinions. My method then was to sample the material by opening the book at random and evaluating the quality of what turned up.What I came across was a discussion of the garbage problem. The preoccupation of the author was to prove that we shouldn't worry about garbage, because in fact there is enough physical space on the planet to hold what we produce. He goes through various statistics and simple calculations to arrive at the conclusion that, for example, every US state could solve its garbage problem for the next century at least, by merely putting aside a square landfill site 2.5 miles long on each side, and 100 feet high. Or, the problem could be solved nationally for that time period by making a single landfill 14-18 miles long on each side, and 100 feet high. The conclusion then is, don't worry, for what the author considers to be a very long time to come (i.e., past his own lifetime, and that of his children, if he has any), we will not run out of physical space to put our garbage.Since the title of the book is &quot;The Skeptical Environmentalist&quot;, I presume the author does consider himself an environmentalist after all. Why then does he waste trees and the reader's time on an entirely pointless argument? No need for any calculations, maps, or graphs: we already know we will never run out of physical space to put our garbage, because there already was room for it in the first place, before it became garbage. The process of making garbage is, in terms of physical space, and leaving aside the details, just one of moving stuff from one place to another. As long as we are not importing junk from other planets or other extra-terrestrial sources, everything began here on Earth and will stay here on Earth. What a pseudo-issue!What is not a pseudo-issue, and which the author ignores in this chapter, is what else the garbage process entails: making valuable resources, which were once in an accessible form, much less accessible, or even for all practical purposes inaccessible; and also typically, putting them into an extremely unpleasant and inconvenient form. A new landfill 2.5 miles on each side, 100 feet high, in every state? Is the author out of his mind? Has he actually thought about what this entails? Doubtful, judging from the fact that he has explicitly not thought about what will happen after the ego-centric timeframe that he considers has expired. This is the kind of proposal one expects from someone locked in an ivory tower, far removed from the messy details of real life, or even from common sense. It is one thing to slog through statistics about garbage, but before pontificating about the subject, the author would have done well to have spent a little time trying to slog through the real thing.On this basis I put the book back on the shelf. If you already have bought it and are wondering what to do with it: don't throw it in the garbage- put it into the recycling bin."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"Here is the real Litany that Lomborg endorses, the sacred Litany that most of us in the privileged world live by:1. Humans are the only beings that really matter on this earth.2. Western civilization is the model for the rest of the world; after all, we are the pinnacle of evolution.3. Resources are infinite and economic growth is infinite.4. Technology will save us.Lomborg is blinded by the same cultural ideology that got us in this mess in the first place. The Skeptical Environmentalist is the same old rhetoric (Litany) cloaked in scholarship and statistics. He wants us to believe The System would work just fine if the pesky Chicken Little environmentalists would just stop frightening people with their lies and exaggerations.Don't waste your money unless you want to hear a Litany of cop outs that are made to justify our destructive behavior."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"Potential readers should be aware that, according to a recent New York Times article, the Danish Committees on Scientific Dishonesty issued a report calling Lomborg's book an example of &quot;systematic one-sidedness&quot; and that &quot;the publication of the work under consideration is deemed to fall within the concept of scientific dishonesty,&quot; as defined by Danish rules for scientific integrity.

He was elected to fill that position as the far right prime minister Anders Fogh Andersen was elected. He represents a very conservative philosophy concerning the future of the environment and one should be very cautious when reading that he is representing the environment at all. The book is a classic example of how and why people believe what they read. If it makes people feel better to believe that they can drive as many cars that suit their needs and not concern themselves with the water pollution that kills so many precious lives, then who can argue that.

He lends credibility to many environmental issues by removing the hype and spin and looking at the facts. With over 2000 citations he draws from a wide variety of sources. When the facts dispute the hype he quotes directly from the studies that the hype is based on. The upshot is that there are important issues to confront and there are optimally effective strategies to deal with those threats to our planet.

It is widely applauded in many conservative camps including the editorial page of the Wall Street Journal who are always looking for a leftist enviro-conspiracy, and permission to ignore scientists' warnings on global warming, deforestation, and endangered species to overpopulation. What lomborg proceeds to do is mathematically manipulate the facts to make them all magically disappear. Call David Blaine for this illusion is in his realm, not science.A statistician and a professor of political science Lomborg isn't even qualified to have an educated opinion about the subject matter he tackles. I have had this argument with many of the untrained before. \\"We have more trees today than 100 years ago,\\" is a typical entry of this argument, a classic out of context blanket fact. Maybe we do, somewhere, but in what form? A lot of small tree farm-like sticks that make good kindling and increase forest fire risk. Lack of diverse old growth forests is the problem scientists are concerned with, but Lomborg doesn't even address this. Why? Because he doesn't know enough to. To him and like-kind, a tree is a tree and a farm raised fish is as good as a wild fish. Why bother discussing genetics? Lomborg doesn't. As a scientist I could go on and on, it's not necessary. The worst part is that this book could set us back 100 years because it does what science cannot: fit the facts to the story and tell people what they want to hear."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"This book is nothing new and even Lomborg himself admits that he has no new insight to offer. Why the fuss about the book then? Basically the anti-science coalition found a sexy new way to sell the same misinformation: a former \\"member\\" of Greenpeace examines the issues for himself and concludes that environmentalists exaggerate the \\"true\\" state of the world. It is hard to believe that so many people have fallen for that catch. Lomborg admits that he was never active in the group, and it is more significant to note that Lomborg is in a political science department. Years ago I gave $15 to Greenpeace but that doesn't make me a left-wing environmentalist. I also read the Economist but that doesn't make me a right-wing capitalist. On the other hand, I have a Ph.D. in biology and have been involved in university teaching and research for the past 15 years. I read Lomborg's invited essay in the Economist last fall and felt that his treatment of the issues ranged from misleading to basically wrong. I read the whole book to get a better idea of the basis for his arguments. I am sorry to say that I find the book severely lacking in merit. Here's why:1. False comparisonsThe basic premise of the book, as well as many of the individual chapters, are based on false comparisons. For example, he makes clear in the introduction that humans are his main concern as opposed to the environment or functioning ecosystems in general. For Lomborg the environment serves to provide specific products for humanity, whereas for environmentalists, humans are simultaneously part of and dependent upon the environment. Thus, Lomborg is not asking the same question as environmentalists and therefore is able to dodge many of the tough issues. Another type of false comparison Lomborg frequently uses is pitting the most extreme view against the most optimistic view rather than acknowledge that a range of opinions exists.2. Misuse of statistics and data. In the beginning of the book he makes a generally reasonable explanation of how statistics can be misused. But then he forgets his own lesson and makes some of the same errors.2A.He typically uses global averages to obscure specific local and regional problems; global \\"forest\\" cover, global freshwater supply, global air quality, total marine harvests, etc.2B. He correctly notes the importance of long term trends vs short-term changes but also forgets this lesson when the long-term trends conflict with his view. For example, plotting the known extinctions of species per century since 1600 shows an exponential increase that by his own logic is likely to continue increasing. But Lomborg does not shown a graph of these data because doing so would undermine his argument that extinction rates are no cause for alarm.2C. Lomborg rarely mentions ranges, and never mentions variation, or confidence intervals. He presents many graphs showing trends but does not once mention the statistical significance of those trends or of how much of the \\"noise\\" in the data is explained by the variable of interest as opposed to other factors.3. Poor scholarship. Many other reviewers note the extensive footnotes and references but this is only the appearance of scholarly work. Lomborg frequently cites sources out of context, misunderstands the data he uses, ignores information that contradicts his view, and relies far too heavily on outdated and secondary sources while ignoring most of the current peer-reviewed scientific journals.3A. By relying so heavily on Julian Simon's book (which he purportedly set out to disprove) he walks a fine line between paraphrasing and plagiarism. He lifts entire sections of Simon's book, including quotations and references, without reading the original sources himself.3B. Many of his footnotes do not contain references but contain irrelevant comments (2044), subtle insults (2109), or information that contradicts what he says in the text (2068). In note 1606 he states \\"we must assume that the best recycling ideas have already been exploited and that yields from further recycling will be lower\\" without any supporting data or references and apparently contradicting his frequent claim that human ingenuity will continue to find new solutions to various problems. I am an optimist too, but Lomborg's analysis too often just doesn't hold up under scrutiny - and careful readers are not the intended audience.4. Official data. Lomborg adopts government and international reports at face value. But these \\"official data\\" often rely on the assumption that individual countries report values honestly. Unfortunately, many instances of misreporting are known. This problem affects data on marine harvests, deforestation, and pollution emissions, among others.5. A blind eye toward history. The purpose of calling attention to potential problems is to attempt solutions before conditions worsen. Lomborg focuses on predictions made 20-40 years ago and then compares those with current data as if nothing has happened since then. We have made progress because we focussed attention on potential problems. And progress is not an automatic result of free-markets, but has been and must be guided by policy.6. Funding priorities. Yes, we need to prioritize, but Lomborg makes no convincing case on specifics. Lomborg fails to note that eliminating environmentally harmful subsidies, estimated at $1 trillion annually, would benefit the environment AND the economy directly.7. Alleged personal attacks by Lomborg's critics. Simply not true. This book is a failure as a scientific analysis. The small errors (such as calling worms insects) are telling but inconsequential. The big problem is the pervasive misunderstanding of science, misinterpretation of data, and misuse of statistics. The \\"corrections\\" on his website are little more than typos. In response to the larger and more important issues noted above, Lomborg continues to obfuscate and dodge meaningful debate. For example, when errors with his examples refuting extinction rates were pointed out he responded that the errors were with the sources and therefore not his errors.As evidenced by many reviews here, this book will succeed in misleading people, not in clarifying the issues."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"I was astonished to see the two somewhat hysterical reviews below.

Those familiar with *both* sides of the debate will be familiar with many of the relevant facts. This book is important because it has helped reveal how anti-rational many members of this community are. The Amazon.com reviews themselves exemplify this. Notice the repeated ad hominem fallacies--Lomborg isn't relevantly credentialed; he only wrote it to make money; he has an ideological agenda; he is simply serving corporate interests. Apparently logic isn't highly prized in this community, since none of these points, even if true, has any relevance to the truth of his evidence or the validity of his arguments. Notice the repeated appeal to authority. They declare: \\"Just read the credentialed, world renowned scientists who critique him in the Scientific American and elsewhere.\\" Why, one wonders, does no one bother to summarize those \\"devastating\\" arguments from Scientific American? Perhaps it is because anyone who reads them will recognize them as, for the most part, ad hominem rants. So please, dear enquirer, read Lomborg's book for yourself, and by all means, read all those \\"devastating\\" reviews in Scientific American, Nature, Science, etc. Compare the quality of argumentation and evidence for yourself. And then ask: Why do I trust these people who claim to speak for science?

One may debate Lomborg, but he's not deserving of the shrill, dogmatic and malign attacks by the one-star crowd, who by lowering the average score seek to sabotage book sales and thus suppress the thesis. As a charming one-star reviewer says, \\"The only possible use for this book today would be for kindling campfires.\\" Hitler couldn't have put it better.Of course, if suppression of book sales is indeed the one-stars' intent, then they have failed.

Despite all the criticism that's come out about it very little criticism has been written that is of this type.I'd love for the critics of the book to explain to us in factual terms why what Lomborg says is so wrong, because none of the critics have done this that I know of, and I thought that's the way science is supposed to work.I went through the book and did a brief listing of the fact topics and conclusions made in each chapter, then went back and marked through those items of fact that had been contested by some critic. That done, I found that 97% of what Lomborg wrote was never touched by the critics. Most of the book and its major conclusions are untouched.The book is deadly dry, and it takes a lot of determination go go through it in this way. But I invite anyone who is seriously concerned about these issues to do so. Because you are not going to get the truth by relying on the environmentalist experts.

So threatened were the professional environmental pessimists in academia, NGOs and think tanks by Lomborg's arguments and ideas, they lashed out and viciously attacked him, seeking to destroy his credibility. The attack included a one-sided smear in the pages of Scientific American, protesters throwing pies at him at speaking engagements, and a website ... devoted to discrediting him.The smear has now reached a new low, with the Danish Committees on Scientific Dishonesty (DCSD) playing the 17th Century Catholic Church to Lomborg's heretical Galileo. The DCSD has written a 16-page book report denouncing the Dane for publishing a book that they say falls \\"within the concept of scientific dishonesty.\\"But the Committees' report is nothing more than a rehashing of the complaints already lodged against Lomborg, complaints that are largely without merit or that he has refuted.For example, the Committees rely heavily on Stephen Schneider's complaint about Lomborg's treatment of climate science in The Skeptical Environmentalist. The Committees describe Schneider as \\"a particularly respected researcher who has been discussing these problems for 30 years.\\"But Schneider is hardly always a paragon of scientific integrity. In a now famous interview with Discover magazine, Schneider showed his true colors:\\"On the one hand, as scientists we are ethically bound to the scientific method, in effect promising to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but - which means that we must include all the doubts, the caveats, the ifs, ands and buts. On the other hand, we are not just scientists but human beings as well. And like most people, we'd like to see the world a better place, which in this context translates into our working to reduce the risk of potentially disastrous climate change. To do that, we need to get some broad-based support, to capture the public's imagination. That, of course, entails getting loads of media coverage. So we have to offer up scary scenarios, make simplified, dramatic statements, and make little mention of any doubts we might have. ... Each of us has to decide what the right balance is between being effective and being honest.\\"Would the Committees deem that admission within \\"the standards of good scientific practice\\"? It is those \\"scary scenarios ... simplified, dramatic statements\\" that Lomborg sought to address in his book.But what the Committees and others who perpetuate the smear against Lomborg don't realize just yet is they have a bigger problem on their hands. The extreme pessimism of the environmental movement doesn't stand up to scrutiny, and more and more scientists who refuse to be cowed by academic bullies and their lapdogs in the press are speaking out.This April, Jack Hollander, the distinguished emeritus professor at Berkeley, is publishing a new book \\"The Real Environmental Crisis: How Poverty, Not Affluence, Is the Environment's Number One Enemy.\\" An early draft of the book shows it deepens our understanding of many of the same themes Lomborg discussed in The Skeptical Environmentalist and denounces in convincing fashion the extreme pessimism of the environmental movement typified by Schneider and others who have attacked Lomborg.In the meantime, in the effort \\"to capture the public's imagination,\\" as Schneider so honestly put it, the smears against Lomborg and others will no doubt continue."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"I have always considered myself to be an environmentalist since I was a child and my parents taught me not to litter or be wasteful, to be kind to animals, and to respect and appreciate nature. These are values I've maintained and am trying to pass on to my children. So, like many others, I have become increasingly worried about the condition of our planet with the constant bombardment of sound-bites bearing line after line of ever more distressing news almost on a daily basis.But after reading through Mr. Lomborg's incredibly detailed book I find myself more worried than before, and not because we're *not doing* enough but because we're often not doing the *right* things. Mr. Lomborg, a former Green Peace activist, analyzes the data and statistics on many of the current environmental issues, such as soil erosion, landfill capacity, amount of forest cover, ozone levels, global warming, etc. He examines the data on glaciers that are melting and those that are growing. He looks into the data behind the claims of impending catastrophe, such as the famous \\"hockey stick\\" graph, and traces it back to the sources. His conclusions are often very surprising and highlight the need to NOT base public policy on shrill and panic-inducing headlines but on rational and coherent science. For example, through detailed analysis he concludes that even if all nations agreed to abide by the Kyoto Treaty it still wouldn't make a significant impact in global warming.But just because Al Gore is afraid to talk with him, don't assume Lomborg is dismissive of the warnings about climate change. He concludes that the earth is in fact getting warmer and that mankind's activities are most likely the primary reason. But he doesn't claim, as some do, that all results will be beneficial and therefore needn't worry us. Instead, he actually analyzes the various claims of both disaster and benefit, and concludes that the results (as near as can be determined based on currently available information) will be a mixed bag. Overall he advocates for more reasoned policies of action based on sound science rather than on simple knee-jerk reaction.This is an exhaustively researched and detailed book that covers many environmental topics and is not limited to global warming. But it is an approach that I appreciate, not merely calling for action, but calling for action in the most beneficial ways. Most may not want to attempt reading it front to back as I tried, but it is an excellent resource and is laid out in a manner that allows easy access to selective topics for lots of helpful information. An excellent voice of reason in a very emotional and important debate."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"This is the kind of book about which everyone is guaranteed to have a strong opinion.By \\"everyone\\" I also mean to include those who have not ever read it. There will be those, hostile to the environmentalist movement, who will take the book's very existence as proof that there's no cause for any alarm (and maybe that there is no such thing as Global Warming). There will also be those, sympathetic to the environmentalist movement, who will not trouble themselves to read Lomborg's material, but will instead scour the web to find and then recite \\"refutations\\" of Lomborg's claims. To that person, it will count as a complete \\"refutation\\" if a climatologist somewhere (who may or may not have read the book himself) says that the book has made an error in one of its hundreds of references.Actual readers of the book, who will undoubtedly feel strongly about it too (one way or the other), will at least know that Lomborg treats the matters of discussion fairly, and with integrity. I am sure that there are parts in which he errs -- I think Lomborg would easily agree to that, too -- but it is clear from both his tone and also the exhaustive and impressive depth of his research and presentation that his errors are honestly made.Libertarians looking to adopt the work ought to know that Lomborg does not say that there is no Global Warming. Rather, he concedes that point, and points out that there are often negative consequences to problems in our environment, including Global Warming. Instead, Lomborg intends to measure the scope of these problems via scientific data, and compare their projected costs against the costs of taking other measures to combat them. He also makes the claim that, in general, things are actually getting better in the world, not worse. He does so step by step, issue by issue, datum by datum. We might be uncomfortable with such a conclusion, for whatever reason, but Lomborg's argument is substantial.Whether Lomborg is ultimately right about every statistic he cites, and every conclusion he reaches, (and it would be remarkable if he were), this book is a thorough discussion of relevant information about a host of topics related to environmentalism. Lomborg speaks with an honest voice, and this book ought to be read by all those with a true interest in environmental policy, and a belief that true understanding means understanding all sides of a given story.Four stars, instead of five, for being a bit too repetitious and dry at times. Still -- very readable, given that statistical analysis can be fairly dull."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"Mr. Lomborg has produced what is probably the most detailed and even-handedstudy on the environment. In a nutshell; he states that there is more that we can do, but pokes holes in the arguments of the doomsayers. A word to the wise. This is no light read. The book is filled with facts and figures that are illustrated with graphs on almost every page. Think of it as a textbook. If you are serious about wanting to learn about the problems of the earth and the challanges they present, without the hyperbole, this is the one book you should read."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"A remarkable achievement. The depth of learning and research displayed in this book is extremely impressive. I read this book with a very skeptical eye, looking for ideological biases. There were NONE. This is a straigforward, honest, in-depth description of the actual state of the world today. I cannot recommend this book too highly. The book is immensely cheering, a testament to the human spirit. And, if his policy recommendations are carried out, the world will be a much better place in the future. Perhaps even more important is his exposing the intellectual dishonesty (ie, their complete willingness to lie in pursuit of their own private agenda) of the professional doom-prophets/&quot;environmentalists&quot;. This is the best thing that could have happened to the environmental movement, at least for those of us who really do care about the environment. Bravo, Mr Lomborg!"},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"The book does an excellent job of introducing the reader to each of the various areas of discussion which is quite broad. While one book could never exhaust the material in question, Lomborg does an incredible job of providing an insight into the vital statistics. All this while remaining very readable.Most critics object to Lomborg on one of two grounds. One is that he is not qualified. This is nonsence as the book is a review of statistical data and as such it is right up his alley. Two is that he makes the wrong conclusions. This is a somewhat subjective matter, however the book is certainly consitent and conclusions are rationalised and fully explained. If you don't like his conclusions you will at least understand them.If you think the environment debate is all hot air then you will be disappointed because Lomborg explains in much detail the environmental problems we face as a society. As Lomborg says a species extinction rate 1500 times the natural rate is nothing to be pleased about.If you can't understand a chart that uses a log scale on the vertical axis then don't buy this book. If you can then you will have no problem understanding the data.If you want to understand why some people believe the world does not need major institutional reform in order to tackle environment issues then this book has all the best arguments.All up I thought it was a great book. Well worth the time and money."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"Well researched, well documented, and thoughtful. People who believe there are many environmental problems should look at the history of bad environmental predictions, notably in the 1970's the impending Ice Age and 1980's the horrible problems of Acid Rain. Acid Rain has proven harmless and now environmentalists predict Global Warming not an Ice Age. In another 20 years extreme environmentalists will be back to calling for an Ice Age after Global Warming fails them. Also, there is good reason for scientists to make extreme predictions ... $$$$. If everything is okay with the environment nobody will fund studies of the environment. The squeaky wheel gets greased and always will in the case of funding extreme ideas."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"After reading this book and Julian Simon's &quot;The Ultimate Resource II,&quot; I am not sure why so much attention has been heaped on Lomborg's book. The approach is the same. The message is the same. Simon's book is somewhat more comprehensive in its coverage. Lomborg's is a fairly well organized book that provides trend data on many important issues. Most of the trends indicate that, over a period of decades and averaged over the entire world, things are improving. Whether the trends are a result of vocal environmental groups influencing public policy, or a natural result of market forces and improvements in technology, will remain an ongoing debate. I suspect it is probably both.An important message delivered by the book is not new, but is often forgotten- caring for the environment requires money. Deciding &quot;how clean, how pure, how restored to pristine condition&quot; is good enough for society as a whole, requires public debate that includes (as polarizing an effect as it has) books such as this one. Lomborg's book does not provide the literary experience of Edward O. Wilson's &quot;The Future of Life&quot;, but both books provide useful viewpoints for every member of society whose tax dollars are used to pay for the protection of the environment."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"In a nutshell, I found this book to be eminently readable (if a bit repetitive on occasion), with a refreshingly straightforward examination of facts and rhetoric surrounding much of the environmental debate. Lomborg states his case well and systematically demolishes most of the more outlandish (but oft repeated) myths about the environment and the state of the world in general. The book is well documented, containing 153 pages of notes and bibliographical information that allows the reader to look deeper into the issues he examines (conceding that many will not undertake the additional effort).That said, no review of this book would be complete without commenting on some of the vicious attacks on it in Science, Nature and Scientific American. A look at the responses to the book says more about it (and the agendas of the critics) than the attacks themselves.The chief critics of Lomborg's work are:Stephen Schneider, an \\"environmental scientist\\" described by the Dartmouth Review as \\"arguably the father of the climate change scare (and once a scaremonger for global cooling)\\" who once said, \\"To capture the public imagination, we have to offer up some scary scenarios, make simplified dramatic statements and little mention of any doubts one might have. Each of us has to decide the right balance between being effective, and being honest.\\"John Bongaarts of the Population Council (!) who has argued that \\"[t]he historically unprecedented population expansion in the poorest parts of the world continues largely unabated\\" when - as Lomborg points out - the birth rate per woman has dropped from 6.2 to 2.8 over the last 50 years.John Holdren, a defense expert (!) from Harvard who once advocated \\"a condition in which no nation 's military forces were strong enough to threaten the existence of other states\\" as if such a move could be contemplated unilaterally.Tom Lovejoy, former director of the World Wildlife Fund, possibly the largest environmental lobbying organization on the planet.These are NOT objective scientists, but those whose ox Lomborg has gored.The one valid point that the critics have raised is that Lomborg's work is not exhaustive. There are environmental issues that are not addressed (such as the degradation of coral reefs) and information is available beyond that provided by Lomborg on the subjects he does address. But then, what did they expect?The text of The Skeptical Environmentalist spans 352 pages and covers population concerns, air and water pollution, food and hunger, resource availability, pesticides, biodiversity and global warming. An exhaustive analysis of these topics could easily fill a thousand such volumes, but he touches on all the points of significance succinctly and accurately.This is not an anti-environmental polemic. Lomborg NEVER argues that environmental protection is unnecessary or that all (or nearly all) of the problems have been solved. He even accepts that global warming is a fact (it is, in fact, a viable theory despite some contradictory evidence).Your expectations of this book will determine how much you get from it. If you expect to be enlightened, you will be, and if you expect to be angered ... read something else."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"Lomborg has come under ideological attack because he commits heresy against the &quot;religion&quot; of environmentalism. But he's got the facts on his side.Just one example of what I learned from this book: remember the horrified commentary about the ozone hole over the South Pole? Remember all the rhetoric about how sheep were going to go blind because of the increased ultraviolet radiation? Turns out that the ozone hole did cause an increase in UV radiation over areas near the south pole. But the increased level was exactly the same as what you would experience at a latitude partway towards the equator.Are sheep going blind at latitude 45? I DON'T THINK SO. Are they, for that matter going blind at the equator (where the UV intensity is at its highest)? Again, I DON'T THINK SO.So if you'd rather have facts and science than environmental dogma, I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"The Skeptical Environmentalist is an important book. The author writes in what I have to call the \\"un-masking\\" tradition, in which a writer examines an almost universally accepted world view and reveals it to be false. Unlike most writers in this tradition, who tear down false paradigms but leave little of value in their place, Lomborg has a charitable and humanitarian message.Lomborg examines a wide range of phenomena - food and hunger, deforestation, air pollution, and water pollution, for example - and usually finds that our current policies are working. They may not be working as fast as we would like, and it would be inappropriate to feel complacent, but, contrary to what we are told by the media and some environmental groups, we have identified approaches to environmental problems that are successful and are working. The author is careful not to overstate his case, and there are many exceptions to the highly simplified conclusion that I've described above. One major exception is that, while the developed countries can afford to address their environmental problems and are doing so, the developing countries face the more pressing problem of crushing poverty.In Lomborg's view, this problem - poverty in the developing countries - is the principal problem facing the world. Accordingly, our principal objective must be to create wealth in these countries. Creating wealth in the developing countries will help their people live longer, healthier, more fulfilling lives. And, once these basic needs are met, the developing countries will turn their attention and resources to environmental issues as the developed countries did in the last quarter of the 20th century.There is much more than this to Lomborg's finely detailed examination of the true state of the world. His book, while polemical, is carefully researched and argued. Lomborg's presentation is engaging and the book is visually attractive. This is probably the most rigorous book I have ever read by a political scientist and it enhanced my appreciation for what Lomborg's profession can offer us."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"Reading this book is like watching a LONG running playin football. The receiver catches the kickoff at his ownone yard line. He skips aside to avoid the first rusherfrom the other team. He avoids the four men on his own forty.Then rushes past the big guy on the fifty. The carrier takesa hit at the other thirty, but keeps going. Then he tripson his own feet on the one and falls in for the touchdown.Score! Six points! He made a set of small mistakes at theend, but still did what he was supposed to do.Most of the so called literature from environmentalists arehyperventalating doom sayers. Lomborg goes through each mythand debunks it based on the solidest evidence he has. The lifeexpectancy for humans worldwide is now 67. Air polution isway down. The rivers have never been cleaner. The numberof people dying of malnutrition per 100000 is way down, butnot zero. The people who ARE dying of starvation are dyingbecause of poor government, not because they cannot get food.Most people in developed countries die of bad habits and poordiet, but they die MUCH older than before.Lomborg also makes the point that the Litany that mostevironmentalists live by is full of nihilism and defeatism.They feel guilty about being so well off to such an extentthat they have convinced themselves that they are livingon borrowed time and the enviroment will collapse real soonnow.The bottom line is that the author is pushing the point thatwe need to be deploying our resources to defeat REAL problems,not ones that we scare ourselves with. The only way to dothat is to work from real science instead of media drivenjunk science that scares and entertains, but does not allowfor a solution that will stick.The only quibbles I have with the book is that Lomborg stillembraces the global warming myth as fact. He acknowledgesthat the theory is WAY flawed but still will not go that extrastep to debunk it. There is also his endorsement of secondhand smoke as a health hazard and small particles in the airas hazards.At the end though Lomborg makes the correct call. Thedeveloping world can become a better place by open markets,growth in GDP, and better education. The money spent onthe environmental causes is not getting the bang per buckthat improvements in these areas would give. In the devolopedworld we have to get control of our bad habits to live longer."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"Most leading scientists in the fields analyzed by Lomborg think this book is seriously flawed. Libertarians and other anti-environmentalists love it. Lomborg's goal of \\"a neutral, impartial assessment of the facts\\" is impossible at the outset because he has thrown his lot in with Julian Simon and others who see no environmental problems, only Blue Skies for Unlimited Growth and Profits.I sought out the book as soon as it was published, because the premise is a good one. I have read Lomborg, I have read the scathing critiques in Scientific American and on the World Wildlife Fund website, and I have read Lomborg's response to his critics on his own website. I give Lomborg credit for being tenacious and narrowly logical -- one star. He scores points in the \\"debate\\" on some particulars, and he is not cowed by the claims to authority of leading scientists in many fields -- another star. Check the book out of the library and read it yourself, alongside other sources of information -- it's a good exercise in critical thinking.In the end, though, I am convinced that Lomborg is missing the forest for the trees. He has provided ammunition to those who think the environmental movement is some sort of conspiracy against Mom, Apple Pie, and the Free Market. (I've never seen a logical explanation proposed for why anyone would want to be a \\"doomsayer\\" if they didn't believe the warnings were true...) The reason the environment has been cleaned up to the extent it has over the past 30 years or so is because of the environmental movement and the environmental regulations the movement has fought for, not because of benevolent corporations. Lomborg's one-sided \\"expose\\" can have only one consequence -- to aid and abet those who want to roll back our successful environmental efforts, unleash unlimited greed, and the environment be damned.If Lomborg is really neutral and impartial, then he has already started on his next massive book, THE SKEPTICAL ECONOMIST, which will debunk the fallacious use of supply and demand curves to explain everything of value in the world. If Lomborg isn't going to write it, then someone else should."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"How should an open-minded person with a strong interest in determining the truth and with no political axe to grind treat this book? In my view, it is a good starting point, but ONLY that, for exploring many important issues regarding the environment. Check out the sources, the claims and counterclaims. Keep in mind that the 'truth' in this vastly complex subject area can rarely, if ever, be completely determined and no 'side' has a monopoly on it. SKEPTICISM indeed should be the rule, both for the claims made in the book and for claims made by the book's opponents...What really matters is not whether the 'doomsayers' of thirty years ago were right or not (How many predictions of ANY kind made thirty years ago turned out to be right?), but what will conditions on our planet be like for our descendants and how cautious should we be right now to increase the odds that those conditions will be good.In the end, as a result of reading this book or reading about this book, you will probably use it simply to confirm your pre-existing opinions. Too bad."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"Given the polarizing impact of this book, I was expecting a lot of strident rhetoric and distorted analysis. Instead, I was pleasantly surprised to find a balanced, careful analysis.Lomborg makes a very complete survey of all of the potential environmental problems associated with population growth and economic development. He then evaluates statistical indicators of the magnitude and direction of the problems. What he finds tends to be comforting.In some cases, indicators actually are improving. Food production is improving, and starvation is declining (albeit slowly, because of political problems). I was surprised to read that the supply of fish actually is increasing, once fish farming is included.Another environmental issue is water. Here, Lomborg shows that the rate of replenishment is adequate. The challenge is to improve access of the world's poor to potable water.I wish that more young people and policmakers would read this book. It makes an excellent textbook. It provides a useful starting point for thinking about environmental and economic policy going forward. Everyone who cares about the environment and the welfare of the world's people should read it."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"This excellent book illustrates that the world isn't on the verge of some &quot;Day After Tommorrow&quot; Apocalypse. If you need this proven to you, if you're skeptical of the skeptics, you should read this book w/ an open mind. Many environmentalists are sincere--however, many are members of a &quot;secular&quot; cult, reverse-evangelicals, who have a God (Mother Nature), a Devil (Man), prophets (Ehrlich, Nader), demons (Capitalists), a way of salvation (Green Socialism), and a nightmare Armageddon (when Nature takes her vengeance on man's greed). The former, the reasonable people should read this book, because they can be persuaded by Lomborg's most important thesis: that the solution to whatever environmental problems we face, will come from economic growth, not anti-industrialism, anti-globalization.The Kyoto Treaty is not the solution, but would actually exacerbate the problem of Global Warming by restraining technological development and human employment. You want a worldwide Great Depression, put the Kyoto Treaty in practice, and then see if mankind has the collective resources to find alternative sources of fuel or, heck, build new air conditioners. Lomborg shows that as the economy grows, so does environmental problems like pollution reduce.He also shows that the warming and cooling of the Earth is cyclical, possibly (or probably) tied to Sunspots. At the end of the Medieval Period, the earth was as warm as it is now (possibly warmer), and 1400-1900 the Earth was in a mini-Ice Age. London had worse pollution in 1700 than today. I guess you could say that the internal combustion engine is so metaphysically evil, so powerful, that it's vile emissions travelled back in time to warm the earth around 1300 and to pollute London in 1700. But more likely, the .6% increase in worldwide temperature since 1900 is the result of the workings of the solar system and not evil, vile technology."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"Bjorn Lomborg uses UN and government data to show that predictions of starvation, deforestation, global warming, cancer caused by \\"chemicals,\\" and other envirnomentalist laments are simply not based on any verifiable facts. Well researched, well written, and compelling."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"I focused on the section on Global Warming. Lomberg agrees that the Earth is warming (politicians, please take note). There are many graphs and notes to back up a thoughtful discussion of the costs of global warming and the costs of preventing it. This type of analysis is indeed the foundation for determining what to do. Lomberg concludes we are better off letting the Earth warm but admits a lot of Bangladeshis will die in severe weather. And Danes may get a bit more tan.The level of detail is dazzling but the book does not attempt to address what the actual costs are for prevention. It therefore did not convince me it's impossible for the developed world to change its behaviors without damaging the economic future.To my way of business thinking, spending less on fossil fuel per GDP dollar and inventing devices to allow others to do the same is going to be a economic benefit, not a cost. Having been asked by President Bush to take it on faith that adopting the Kyoto Protocol would harm our economy, I had hoped to find some proof in this book. I did not, but would still recommend it for its richness in data. And be sure to note what kind of science Mr. Lomborg teaches."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"Bjorn Lomborg presents a challenge to environmentalist groups everywhere who exaggerate the problems the world is facing today. He considers each of their propositions and attempts to put their claims in context with the overall progress of the world. His findings indicate that despite popular belief and the claims of environmentalists, the world today is better off than before.For his pains, the author has been lambasted by left wing groups as being a stooge of capitalists. Yet, his book is well documented, with 3000 notes supporting the many claims that he makes. Perhaps he is expecting this strong reaction, and if so, I commend his courage to take such a strong stand and to raise environmental issues to the front, to be prioritised and evaluated along with other pressing problems that face our societies today.His basic premise is that we need to take an objective evaluation of many of the environmental problems that are thrust into our attention by the media and other groups. The understanding of the Real State of the world will allow us to prioritise our attention most effectively, instead of having the public agenda hijacked by interest groups who proclaim selected statistics in order to further their cause.Recommended reading for anyone concerned about the environment today."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"By now this book is a classic. I consider it one of the most important books on the environment. Lomborg is an environmentalist who wants to do the maximum amount of good for the world. The \\"skeptical\\" part is really nothing more than the simple common sense notion that given the many potential different ways to do good, that we should look to get the most bang for the buck on our investment. That requires thoughtful analysis leading to a prioritization of effort. As it becomes increasingly more clear with scandals like Climategate that much of the science establishment has been politicized to serve an agenda, it is important that we come back to this \\"bang for the buck\\" principle with rigorous intellectual honesty. Bravo for being way ahead on this Mr. Lomborg.It is a separate matter to talk about the proper role of government in doing good, the role of corporations and the role of individual charitable efforts. Lomborg doesn't really address that. I think it is wise to focus as he has on prioritization first. As any good engineer knows it is much harder to properly characterize the problem than to come up with a solution. If we could just focus first on solving real problems cost effectively the discussion of who pays for what would be much less emotionally charged.The science community needs to lead here or it is at severe risk of losing the public trust. It does not appear that this message has been internalized. It would be a tragic loss for human progress if science fails us."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"Finally, a book that puts perspective and context to the environmental movement.

Wilson of Harvard, said in a letter to the publisher in July that &quot;we rarely see this type of careless and manipulative scholarship in the undergraduates we teach.&quot;&quot;The book earns one star from me because the ink didn't rub off on my fingers and the pages didn't fall out."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"Although the idea of skepticism is a good one, and needed in any highly politicized area. Lomborg does skepticism a disservice by having so little regard for solid research, for recent research, and for accuracy.For an excellent point by point review of just how Lomborg oversimplifies to the point of inaccuracy, take a look at the review on the Scientific American website: www.sciam.comWhile it's wrong to exaggerate the problems that we face or to simply frighten the public without giving good information and solid alternatives, Lomborg seems to go in the opposite direction by painting an unrealisticly cheery picture in the name of &quot;skepticism.&quot;It's sad, really because the average citizen needs real facts, in a language that she, or he, can understand."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"Earlier this year, Lomborg was discredited by his academic peers for his selective and incomplete science.

It does not question the fundamental behind climate change. Interestingly tho, it advocates that we leave climate change alone given the huge cost of solving the problem. Bjorn recommends that efforts are instead focused on aid to places like Africa. He rightly claims that these issues can be dealt with less money. This does however ignore the fact that climate change will damage Africa by providing it with additional drought, heat and extreme weather conditions. A recent UK commons select committee report for example(HM Government, 2005) www.parliament.uk/parliamentary_committees/environmental_audit_committee.cfm.suggests that our Africa efforts will be made obsolete by the effects of climate change. Bjion points out that Kyoto does not do enough to avoid climate change. I agree with this finding but believe that the recommendation should be to take a tougher line.

I just finished reading this ridiculously fallacious work and then the particulary satisfying Scientific American response to it (in which the world's top experts rip Lomborg to shreds).It's both depressing and amusing to read how the some of the reviewers here are clicking their heals in delight at the deception as if they now have the absolution they've prayed for in order to keep on popping out 6 kids, tossing their mountains of waste into rivers and landfills, stuffing their faces with Big Macs, speeding along in their Ford Expeditions in order to get back to their housing developments in time to catch 'Paradise Hotel' on Fox.I'd love to take some of these moronic Amazon reviewers on a little trip away from their gluttonous lives in the American suburbs and visit some of the dead and dying places I have visited (Haiti, the Phillipines, the reefs of the Florida keys, the North Atlantic fisheries) - where people and ecosystems suffer more in a day than these idiots have or will in their entire lives. I would love to show them first hand how bad things really are (and I assure you, they're getting worse).The world we live in has become tragically impoverished - mainly due to our own avarice... if you don't recognize that, you're a simpleton. If you read Lomborg's horror of a book and ignore the experts who have emasculated him; if you live your life in a wasteful manner, without comprehension of how it affects other lands or future generations; if you refuse to change your lifestyle in order to save the living creatures with which we share this planet and ON WHOM we depend for survival; then you join the ranks of the author himself - a disgrace to humanity and a huge waste of time."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"All I can say is: Beware of spin!

The mentality of the people who do not like this book is that all animals must be saved, we cannot tolerate any deaths due to pesticides, we must vastly reduce carbon dioxide emissions, etc.The primary point of the book is that we do not have infinite wealth, so we need to prioritize our spending so it has the greatest positive impact for the planet and human population. The only way to do this is to have a clear understanding of which problems are most important, so we can prioritize our spending on those issues.To those who say that every environmental problem is important, I doubt that you would put your money (unbearably higher taxes and higher prices for everything else you enjoy) where your mouth is."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"Andre Lang, when asked to review the work of one of his rivals, once observed, \\"He uses statistics as a drunken man uses lampposts--for support rather than for illumination.\\"This observation sums up in a nutshell one of the major premises of Bjorn Lomborg's The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World, wherein Mr. Lomborg analyzes-and in large part rejects-much of the statistical analysis used to \\"prove\\" the validity of many of the assumptions that support current \\"mainstream\\" environmental \\"science\\".Thirty years ago, many smart people believed that, by now, the population explosion would have knocked the world into a catastrophic famine, killing hundreds of millions of people. Ecologist Paul Ehrlich, author of The Population Bomb, predicted back then that by the year 2000 Japan would run out of food and an armada of famished Chinese would invade Russia. Needless to say, these predictions, like virtually all others made in that book, were wrong: although the number of humans on Earth has almost doubled since 1960, there are fewer hungry people now than there were four decades ago. Just eight percent of humankind now lives in nations with insufficient average calorie intakes; according to the U.N. Food and Agricultural Organization, that represents the lowest such percentage in human history. Moreover, recent U. N. reports suggest hallowed assumptions about the rates of world population growth appear to be highly questionable at the least.Has Mr. Ehrlich's credibility and stature been adversely affected by the fact that developments have utterly failed to support his theories and projections? Not in the slightest! He's still considered an \\"expert\\" in this area by many!That is why this is book is so important.Using a rigidly objective statistical approach Mr. Lomborg examines the factual basis for a number of popularly accepted \\"Environmental Truths\\" and reaches, in some but not all cases, very different conclusions about the validity of many of the assumptions accepted as gospel within the environmental community. Mr. Lomborgs aim, as the subtitle to the book suggests, is not simply to disprove and bludgeon the environmental community. It is, rather, to provide some objective analysis with the goal of fostering an environment wherein actual debate over reality based facts can occur that could lead to actual development of measures that could provide meaningful, cost effective solutions to real, as opposed to assumed, problems.In a world where the Paul Ehrlich's-and they are legion within the environmental community-can be so wrong, so often, for so long, the development of a skeptical view of the assumptions underlying much of what constitutes \\"environmental science\\" can only be a good thing. With The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World, Mr. Lomborg has skillfully used logic and reason to jumpstart that process.Whether you agree or disagree with Mr. Lomborg, this is a book anyone who is concerned with public environmental policy formation needs to read."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"This is the best of several rebuttals to the prophets of doom and predictions of environmental collapse. Bjorn Lomborg carefully demonstrates the widespread misinterpretations of environmental data and science by some environmentalists and by many politicians. 0ne by one, he addresses the various elements of what he calls \\"the Litany,\\" and shows them to be gross exaggerations, misinterpretations of data, or outright misrepresentations.The author's overall purpose is to get the environmental issues in proper perspective, so that legitimate discussions can occur and valid decisions made regarding policy and priorities. As one approach he uses a cost-based analysis to demonstrate that the cost of remedying environmental damage is frequently greater than the cost of the damage itself.A basic point is that, contrary to the Litany, virtually all aspects of life by any objective measure are better now than they ever have been, and getting better, not worse. That is not to say that life is perfect, or as good as it could and should be. He provides his explanation of why we continually hear so much bad news, when things have never been better! The data, properly interpreted, supports the following statements (emphasis added):\\"We will NOT lose our forests; we will NOT run out of energy, raw materials or water. We have reduced atmospheric pollution in the cities of the developed world, and have good reasons to believe that this will also be achieved in the developing world. Our oceans have NOT been defiled. Our rivers have become cleaner and support more life-\\"\\"Acid rain did NOT kill off our forests, our species are NOT dying out as many have claimed, with half of them disappearing over the next 50 years-the figure is likely to be about 0.7 percent. The problem of the ozone layer has been solved. The outlook on global warming does NOT indicate a catastrophe-rather there is good reason to believe that our energy consumption will change toward renewable sources way before the end of the century.----And, our chemical worries and fear of pesticides are misplaced and counterproductive.\\"\\"The Litany is based on myths, although propagated by well-meaning, compassionate people\\"--- perhaps based on a \\"---Calvinistic sense of guilt. We have done so well that some feel rather ashamed.\\"Here is the most important book about the environment of several I've read. Highly recommend it to anyone interested in FACTS about the REAL state of the world!!"},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"The Skeptical Enviromentalist is a superb book on statistics and geography that pole-vaults over politics, history and economic analysis and somehow lands on some very dodgy public policy. Although our sensitive Norweigen has impeccable green credentials, he ends up sounding suspiciously like a neo-liberal apologist towards at the end of the book. This is due to a sleight-of-hand trick at the heart of this book and it is all the more seductive given some of the excellent analyses that can be found in the book.For a vast range of statistics, this book is one of the most informed book that I have ever read : a flabbergasting range of figures is covered from measurements of natural resources, indices of health, birth rates, deforestation, chemical toxicity. Using easy-to-follow prose and backed by a veritable mountain of statisitcs, the book carefully and patiently explains how many of these statistics are obtained. The explanations in many cases are some of the best I have seen.I leave it to experts to quibble with the technical errors that any book of this size surely contains. As for attacks on this book being biased - well of course, every book that is written on such large topics will be biased. The important questions are what are the biases, and how well they are hidden.Although well-heeled to the intrincacies of statistics, Lomberg is completely at sea about politcs, history and economics. In short, Lomberg actually believes that the world market is one big happy efficient free market, hidden hand and all. This would not be such a grave problem if Lomberg didn't paper over the cracks in his analysis.For instance, at the start of crucial section on energy, Lomberg says that the price oil has continually dropped. Lomberg implicitly assumes that the free market drove down the price of oil and extrapolates that through the rest of the chapter into our heavenly free market future. Left out is the political-economic question of the relationship between abundance, extraction costs, national governments and their influence on the price (try Adam Smith's majesterial Wealth of Nations for a good discussion).However, if you're even remotely interested in international politics, you will know that the control of oil has been one of the mainstays of US national policy for the last 50 years. The whole analysis of oil prices is missing the most important element of all - the United States Armed Forces. American air-bases in places from Saudi Arabia through to the Gulf of Mexico (and what about that little international war we had in the 90's) affect oil prices. Shell Nigeria's execution of Ogoni activists protesting against the devastation due to the oil operations is, in Lomberg's analysis, an example of the ways that free enterprise can extract oil more cheaply.In the discussion of lifespans, there is a rather curious omission: statistics from warfare. It seems interesting that one of the most bloodiest centuries recorded fails to register a passing mention in the section on various ways to die. Concentrating on average lifespans and birthrates is only half the story. For instance, in England during the WWII, lifespan increased because war-time nationalisation improved living standards for the poor whilst at the same time, the male population was being decimated (see Amartya Sen's Development as Freedom).Lomberg seems hardly aware that the 1950-1970 is generally considered the most prosperous economic age in the last 200 years and that statistics that starting from the 1970 will miss the calamities of the Great Depression, and all Depressions before that. Following the World Bank's lead (who serve financial interests above all), almost all discussion on prosperity is based on the Gross National Product. Lomberg's analysis on prosperity will never see depressions because it misses out one half of any financial equation. While I have no problem with macro indices like the GNP, Lomberg conveniently evades all discussion of debt. As anyone in business can tell you that earnings look good when costs aren't counted (just ask Kenneth Lay) and GNP looks damn good when there is no debt - private, public and national. Furthermore, GNP includes money made from speculation, which is not productive capital at all.As for the analysis of hunger and food, Lomberg isn't aware that hunger and starvation isn't actually caused by lack of food. Amartya Sen, who has studied this problem intensively, shows that it's the inability to pay for food that causes hunger and starvation. Consequently, Lomberg misses the whole thrust of the hunger problem - first world agricultural subsidies, trade tariffs and agricultural monopolies. We already have enough food to feed everybody, just that most of it is given to cows. So the whole argument about increased food production is a non sequiteur.Actually, I find that 3/4 of this book is well-argued and convincing. Lomberg does an effective hatchet job on the, really, quite hapless Lester Brown. However, I find that everything Lomberg says that involves a price tag, rather suspect. The picture he paints is geographically and demographically convincing, but economically, Lomberg's picture is way rosier than other theorists would paint. As such, you don't get to see the economic malaise in world trade and you won't get an idea of the kind of shock treatment that is needed to achieve Utopia.Finally, we can see how far Lomberg has sold his soul to free-market ideologues by turning to the section on Global Warming. It is almost excruciating to read his (perhaps overly) detailed dissection of climate models, where, often in the very same sentence, he blithely accepts every projection of free-market economic models. Whilst it is true that climate modelling is one of the bug-bears of the physical sciences, economic modelling is the bug-bear of the social sciences, if not the biggest bug-bear of them all. It would have helped if Lomberg questioned even one of the assumptions in free market models. The fact that he doesn't should tell you something, skeptic or not."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"This is an interesting book. Written by a scholar previously working with an environmental agency, based on a broad spectrum of material(including a lot of data generated by environmental agencies) it makes compelling reading as it states the case for a revision of the apocalyptical view of some orthodox prophets, about the current state of global environment.In order to aquire a more balanced view of the diverse problems that affect our environment, and a more realistic approach to the policies that really need to be enacted, a balance has to be made.

The areas covered in this book are important to everyone who is dependent upon the Earth's natural resources. In the end, I was only able to give it four stars, because it tended to bog this reader down in parts with details of how conclusions are reached, and its treatment of the biodiversity vs. genetically engineered foods issues touched on only a few key points while overlooking othersHowever (despite these flaws), I found Mr. Lomborg's book to be highly informative, and it has whet my appetite for further reading on environmental issues.

It is a refreshing challenge to the-sky-is-falling attitudes of radical environmentalists. This book is not an easy read, but Lomborg does an admirable job of turning hard facts into a readable and interesting book. His research is extensive and persuasive. As a natural skeptic and a graduate engineer, I appreciated his calm, reasoned approach to debunking many of the hysterical claims made by less scientific spokesmen for the radical environmentalists. For example, he shows how one author used a one-year rise in tuberculosis rates to put forth the argument that the disease is increasing in the world. Lomborg shows the entire 55-year graph which trended downward for the other 54 years. Only when you see the entire graph does it become evident that the projection is skewed.His book is full of statistical analysis that shows how the chicken-little crowd selectively picks or excludes evidence to make their case. This is not science, but they don't care. This excellent book should be required reading in every statistics class, and a good reference book for the biological sciences.."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"It is apparent that many of these reviews are closed-minded and over-emotional. This book is clearly not 5 stars because:1. It is clear from the very beginning of the book that Bjorn had an agenda to conclude that the environment is getting better. Agenda leads to bias, which leads to cherry-picking statistics, which leads to skewed conclusions. Even bad results were framed as good. Pollution and deforestation in developing countries ok because developed countries did that 50 years ago? The decimation of fish stocks is ok because they only supply 1% of calorie needs? Falling water tables and water shortages are ok because people could just buy their food somewhere else? (since crops are the primary source of water consumption)2. He claims that we have an essentially infinite supply of resources which can support an infinite human population, simply because production of key minerals and energy has continued to increase. Have you ever heard the phrase \\"past performance is no guarantee of future performance?\\" That's exactly what has happened here. His predictions of reduced food, copper, gold, oil, coal etc prices have all turned out to be dramatically incorrect. Most noteworthy is his prediction that oil prices of $27/barrel in 1999 were artificially high and $20/barrel is more reasonable. $150/barrel in 2008 anyone??3. His conclusion that water shortages can be resolved through economic means is an oversimplification and misses the point. The point is, from a resource drawdown perspective, water supply will be a HUGE issue this century.4. This book is supposed to be about the environment, yet in every case, he \\"measures\\" the environment in human terms. Biodiversity loss is ok because it allows human economies to grow? Marine ecosystem collapse is ok because they only supply 1% of calorie needs?On the other hand, this book is clearly not 1 star because:1. He backs up many of his conclusions with loads and loads of good data. This is rare when it comes to opinions of the environment which tend to be gut reactions not based on the facts - on both sides.2. He targets some key aspects of the \\"litany\\" which have turned out to be exaggerations, and very specifically and assertively proves them false. A few examples are a)global deforestation has leveled off, not increased, b)pollution in developed countries has decreased, not increased c)biodiversity loss is only 0.7% over the next 50 years, not 15%, c)waste and landfills are not a concern as the entire world's waste over the next 100 years could be stored in an area smaller than one county in Oklahoma.In summary, this is a decent book which more accurately quantifies the state of the environment than most people understand. As an environmentally conscious person, this book has really helped me realize the exaggerations of many of the environmental organizations. Although, ironically, the environmental organizations have played a big part in improving the state of the environment over the past 100 years, and of course Bjorn does not credit them. Bjorn's overall conclusion that \\"things are getting better\\" should be read as \\"things have been getting better for humans, while the environment is getting worse, albeit more slowly than many of the environmental organizations lead us to believe.\\""},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"Don't get into another conversation about the environment until you read this book! Lomborg explains it all! He uses easy-to-understand graphs and long time periods to show environmental change. We have all heard the big numbers-1,000 species extinct every year, seas will be dead in 10 years, rain forest gone in 20. This book, which should be in every home worldwide, shows how to evaluate the information overload. Whom should you send your charity to in order to best improve the environment? Lomborg will show you how to judge. Which environmental measures save the most lives for the least money? Lomborg assembles the data.As a former CPA, I became disillusioned when I realized non-profit environmental organizations were just as selfish as any other business. When human self-interest is at stake, objectivity goes out the window. So this book was the answer to a prayer for me. A way to measure where we are on air, water, extinctions, population, disease and global warming. Where will you get the most bang for your buck and volunteer hours? First you have to know how bad things are and what the remedies might be.Make no mistake, this is not easy reading; it is, however, essential reading for every voter and activist on the planet.READ THIS BOOK!!!!"},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"Though I have long been involved in the environmental movement, I never totally bought into the position that \\"everything is going to hell\\" in the environment and it is all Man's fault.Indeed, in my particular area of emphasis (forestry), I know of and have reseached a lot of examples to the contrary of this now knee-jerk position. Recognizing successes in environmental protection need not be off limits, fearing that to do so one would cause fewer people to have concerns about the environment. What does hurt and diminish concern for the environment is the mindless assertion that \\"everything is going to hell.\\"At the extreme, it is this postion and not Lomborg's that threatens to undo the environmental movement. If everything is lost, why do anything? Lomborg's book is clear eyed view at what is actually happening in the world. He is not a pollyanna or an apologist for anyone, although environmental extremists have subjected him to ad hominem attacks, thereby increasing his prestige in the eyes of many. This book ought to be required for any one claiming to be an environmental activist."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"Worthy causes, whether religious, political or moral tend to see themselves as above the duty to provide evidence to substantiate both their claims about reality and the suitability of their proposed measures to improve said reality. To their believers, the state of the world is obvious (usually bad), and they are genuinely astonished to find that most people are unconcerned about the grave issues that drive them. Their natural reaction is to become even more feverish about their respective causes and to step up efforts to proselytise and convert the benighted masses.Bjorn Lomborg started working on the issues that would eventually make up the content of his book by leading some of his statistics students into debunking some claims made by University of Maryland's professor Julian Simon. Julian Simon had claimed that things were actually getting better rather than worse, and that most negative environmental indicators were connected to poverty, violence and bad government rather than consumption or wealth. To their surprise (for he initially took Simon's claims as evidence of typical American arrogance), Lomborg and his students found that Simon was roughly right. It was true that things were getting better, and that many of the claims coming from environmental advocates were contradictory (for example they both dreaded global cooling in the 1970s and global warming in the 1990s as absolutely negative, although clearly both have benefits compared to each other, and neither is all bad), or tendentious (for example, advocates for particular causes often choose particular extreme years to show a negative tendency in a variable, while ignoring the long term trend), or simply shoddy (such as using a report on a tiny plot of slanting land in Belgium to extrapolate the global impact of erosion on land fertility). Lomborg published some articles discussing his findings on a left-leaning newspaper in Denmark, that greenest of countries, and was astonished at the public reaction. He decided to take upon himself a Gargantuan project, one that (I think) he couldn't possibly have thought through before embarking on it, or I predict he wouldn't have done it. He decided to review the state of the world from many, many angles, including humanity, all types of resources, animals and plants, as well as their interactions. The amount of work required to cover all these subjects, and to come up with data to back up his conclusions, must have been staggering. I have sometimes done this type of work, and I am in awe at Lomborg's achievement. It is truly a tour de force.While I don't claim that everything Lomborg says makes perfect sense, or that all his data are correct (surely he won't deny his readers the right to apply skepticism to his own claims as well, and it is quite easy to use the WWW to check out his opponents' arguments), this is a rare book that attempts seriously to consider all facts from a variety of angles, which tries to answer objections or qualifications from opponents, and which carefully connects all the variables into a global picture, incorporating the temporal dimension both past and future. Lomborg is truly skeptical, in the sense of taking nothing for granted and approaching all the issues dispassionately. These are, as Descartes told us in his Discourse on the Method, some of the conditions for true knowledge. Reading Lomborg one sometimes feels like the light has been turned on or the mists have cleared on many topics. One is surprised to find many catastrophe-peddlers (such as Stanford's Dr. Erlich, who is unrepentant of the obvious failure of his predictions for the 1980s of widespread famine and scarce resources due to population growth) are still around and doing fairly well. At least Lomborg takes them to task, and finds them wanting in logic and veracity.I predict (and it doesn't take Nostradamus to figure this out) that this book will be purchased by many people who normally wouldn't think of reading even a newspaper article on environmental concerns. Many of these probably won't make it through the entire book. In spite of Lomborg's great asides about his debates with WorldWatch and with Danish government ministers and his glee in demolishing yet another sophism, he is sometimes prolix, and there is a point were yet another chart showing that some metal's price has not gone up but down in the past hundred years is one too many. But let's not forget his calling (he is a statistician, although an unusually lively one), and let's not ask him from more than what he offers (which is a rational, dispassionate look at the environmentalist discourse). His chapter on global warming is both exhaustive and exhausting. I predict also that Mr. Lomborg will become a darling of the libertarian think tanks in the US and elsewhere, and a villain in the eyes of environmental organizations and their supporters. Both attitudes are mistaken. The only way to dismiss Mr. Lomborg is by showing that his data or his inferences from them are wrong. And, although roughly aligned with them on most issues, Mr. Lomborg is probably not of the libertarians' perspective (they should be scared if Mr. Lomborg decides to write a book testing many of the libertarian's claims, such as the trickle-down theory of economic development). Everything else is just taking things on faith, something Mr. Lomborg hasn't done. He is entitled to the same treatment."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"Lomborg has read through an impressive amount of scientific research and attempted to reach general conclusions about the state of the environment. Most of what he says in the book is true, but keep in mind that he has an agenda. He is trying to convince us not to worry so much about the environment. Whenever possible, he prefers to put a positive spin on the numbers.Skip this book, and go straight to the online debates that followed. Specifically, what you want to read is Scientific American's angry 11 page reply to this book. Then read Lomborg's equally angry reply to Scientific American. You can find both of these on Google. Lomborg no longer posts Scientific American's original reply, but a group called Greenspirit has it up.After you've done that, go to the Scientific American website and search for their follow up replies, which are in response to Lomborg's response to them.If you read all of these, you'll have a pretty good idea of what the environmentalists and the anti-environmentalists agree on, and what they disagree on.A lot of the debate boils down to &quot;Is the glass half full, or half empty?&quot; In his book, Lomborg essentially said at one point, &quot;The environmentalists lied about endangered species! Only 0.7% of species are expected to go extinct over the next 50 years.&quot; Then Scientific American said, &quot;Lomborg is trying to trick you! Thousands of species will go extinct over the next 50 years!&quot; But, if you kept reading the debates, eventually you learned that , since there are millions of species, the numbers Lomborg was using meant the same thing as Scientific American's numbers. The only difference was, Lomborg represented the numbers in a way designed to make them seem good, but Scientific American prefered to write them in the way that made them seem bad."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"Whatever your views about the state of the Earth are, they are bound to be shaken by \\"The Skeptical Environmentalist\\".This book will challenge you to think that the world is not getting more and more polluted but, rather, the opposite, that world population is not growing out of control, that we are getting healthier and richer, that fewer people die of starvation every year, that deforestation is not happening on an alarming scale and that the extent of global warming may have been grossly overestimated.Surely these statements will raise quite a few eyebrows among most of us since we are regularly told by the environmental organisations that our modern lifestyle is endangering the life of the planet.The irony of this book is that Lomborg originally started his investigation with the aim of challenging the views of Julian Simon, an economist critic of the green movement. Lomborg, a former Greenpeace activist, set off to prove him wrong using the sources commonly quoted by environmental activists. Much to his surprise he came to the conclusion that Simon was right on most issues. Lomborg thus turned himself into a \\"skeptical environmentalist\\".While some scientists have praised Lomborg's effort to put environmental issues through a tough scrutiny, many more have accused him of distorting the truth and misleading the public.Most of these accusations are unfair. Lomborg may be wrong on some issues. He may also forget that if the world is not in such a bad state, it is also thanks to the efforts of the environmental organisations which warned of the dangers a few decades ago. \\"The Skeptical Environmentalist\\", however, deserves attention since it is well documented and Lomborg's writing does not lack clarity and enthusiasm.Furthermore, the progress of science cannot avoid the confrontation of ideas, particularly when these are highly controversial and provocative."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"It is true that Lomborg's book does contain some errors. And that is why I am giving it only 4 Stars. But Lomborg has freely admitted them; More importantly, however, these minor mistakes do not undermine his main conclusion that the Earth's Environment is improving, rather than declining. We have had predictions of mass famine in the 1960's too due to the growing world population but the subsequent Green Revolution boosted crop production and supported the increased population. My point here is that Scientists and Prognosticators cannot predict the future. Personally, I do think that we should do more to curb Global Greenhouse Gas Emissions and increase Fuel Economy Standards in both Canada and the US. Having a higher gas or electric bill tends to focus one's mind on buying energy saving devices, light bulbs, etc. Having said that, we should equally NOT Demonise individuals such as Bjorn Lomborg who argue that the Earth's Environment is gradually improving rather than going to hell in a hand basket. Rather we should rationally examine the scientific facts first and then form a conclusion as Lomborg attempts to do in his book.Some critics of Dr. Lomborg have referred to the January 2003 report by the Danish Commitee on Scientific Dishonesty(DCSD) as essentially discrediting the entire basis of The Skeptical Environmentalist. But, in fact, many lay people have pointed out serious flaws in the Methadology of DCSD's conclusions and on its refusal to give Lomborg prior to the release of their critical report. The Danish Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation has now(December 2003) intervened to harshly criticised the DCSD's methadology and to repudiated their findings on Lomborg's book. Among the points cited is that firstly, the DCSD failed to substantiate its case against Lomborg's book and did not state where exactly Lomborg committed his alleged mistakes. In such a situation, Lomborg could not be expected to respond to the DCSD's critiques--which some have said merely copy Scientific American's previous criticisms of Lomborg's work.Secondly, while DCSD emphasised that all scientific work should go through a peer review, they omitted to examine whether such a procedure had been done in Lomborg's case. In fact, Lomborg's book had, in fact, been reviewed by 4 recognised scientists prior to its publication by the Cambridge University Press. Thirdly, the Danish Ministry of Scienace, Technology and Innovation criticised the language and tone of DCSD's report as being highly emotional and error prone--in other words, somewhat unprofessional for a scholarly Committee.Fourthly, DCSD's procedure of presenting Lomborg's case before 3 separate scientific Committees instead of the usual one was quite irregular and procedurally incorrect. Moreover with this new situation, a ruling which was issued by the Individual Committee within whose area of study Lomborg worked could be overturned by the 2 other Commitees. Fifthly, it was \\"clearly wrong\\" to deny Dr. Lomborg an opportunity to first defend his book before the Danish Commitee of Scientific Dishonesty prior to the Committee's release of its judgement. Finally, the Chairman of the Sub-committee in the Lomborg case came from the Health Sciences, rather than from the Social Sciences Department, which is Dr. Lomborg's field. I thought it was quite funny that this was the case--it wld be like asking a Biologist to study the work of Chemist and makes no sense at all!In summary, the Janury 2003 DCSD ruling seems to have been intended as a hatchet job on Lomborg's work. Perhaps it was an attempt to discredit the views of those who don't subscribe to the Environmentalist viewpoint. But fortunately, there is some justice to this world and the DCSD report has now been publicly repudiated by the DCSD's own superiors. As Lomborg states after the release of the Danish Ministry of Science, Technology & Innovation's report: \\"It has been hard, but I am happy that we now have confirmation that freedom of speech extends to Environmental debate. Now that this distraction is behind us, we can concentrate our efforts on matters of importance--namely how to prioritize our effort for the earth.\\" I think he couldn't have said it better. One should let the scientific facts on the ground--rather than the angry rhetoric and threats emanating from Environmental groups and their supporters against both Lomborg or his publisher, Cambridge University Press--to control the debate over how to preserve the Earth's Environment for the benefit of our future generations. These actions strike me as an attempt to suppress dissent on such an important topic.Thank You."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"Well, unlike my esteemed reviewer below, I *haven't* read the correspondence between Lomborg and Scientific American, so instead of commenting on that, what I will comment on here is the *book* at the top of this page, to wit THE SKEPTICAL ENVIRONMENTALIST.The environment is one of those areas like religion where it has become practically impossible to have a rational, reasonable debate or even a conversation, because there's so much rancor on both sides. (People commenting on the book without bothering to read it demonstrate the point: this subject is *so* emotional that there's an unwillingness to give an honest, open-minded look at the arguments being presented--on either side.) However, in this contentious area, Lomborg does two things that immediately got my attention: a.) he cites the hell out of his book (71 pages of sources) and b.) he hammers home the point that EVERYTHING IS A TRADE-OFF. *Nothing is for free.* Increased spending on the environment must come at the expense of other areas, including areas such as anti-poverty spending that most people--including environmentalists--would consider to be worthy goals. And given that we don't have unlimited resources, it is best to focus our resources where they will do the most good. (2000+ sources don't make for an unbiased book? I'd be curious to know, then, what exactly does...particularly as Lomborg pulled many of his figures and statistics from UN sources. And as for this book allegedly not having gone through peer review, I'd be interested to know whether prominent environmental tomes like EARTH IN THE BALANCE have gone through peer review.)Lomborg also leans on the point that long-term forecasting is an incredibly tricky business (which it is--chaos theory, anyone?) and comments that today's computer models are not complex enough to carry this out accurately, which I find thoroughly plausible (in fact I would find it unrealistic to argue otherwise! the idea that we understand everything about the environment--or indeed, *any* subject under the sun--smacks of hubris to me.) He asserts that natural climate change probably plays a large part in global warming while not denying that humans are having an effect and that restriction of greenhouse gases is an important part of the strategy to deal with it (in fact, his position is that current efforts, including the Kyoto treaty, are too lax to have much effect), but also states that serious efforts must include imposing more penalties on the developing world and our resources might be better spent attempting to assist them. In fact, the second point he hammers home throughout his work--that it would probably be best from a cost-benefit analysis for us to spend our resources alleviating poverty, in particular Third-World poverty--hardly enshrines him in the first rank of Evil Capitalists.Are there problems with this book? Sure. Lomborg's assertions that we will continue to find new deposits of natural resources in the future seem just a tad too blithe to me, for one (although he is right in pointing out that we can probably find new and more efficient ways to extract resources from less-desirable sources, should we have to) and he doesn't address that there might be other considerations as to whether we use the ones we have. For example, I'm originally from Michigan. The Great Lakes represent a rich and varied ecosystem, as well as a tremendous tourist resource and state symbol, and I think I speak for most Michiganders when I say that I would not like to see the Great Lakes drained to provide drinking and irrigation water. Not that Lomborg suggests this, understand, but this is an example of one of the problems with access to this type of resource that he doesn't really discuss. I would also like to have seen more of an examination of the ways in which various types of environmental effects might \\"stack\\" with each other--for example (not increased population, since the \\"population bomb\\" has apparently fizzled--another example of the difficulties of long-term forecasting) but water usage with land usage, for instance. From a literary/historical standpoint, I think he could have tied the popularity of the \\"Litany\\" and \\"sky-is-falling\\" scenarios into a long tradition in Western thought of viewing the world as in a state of decline and degeneration (for example the ancient Greeks with their ideals of the Golden Age down through to the Iron Age, and medieval Christianity viewing the world as having degenerated from the days of Adam and Eve and the Garden of Eden--primarily as a punishment for human sinfulness. Hmmm. But that's more of a literary criticism.) His deconstruction of the tone of press releases and of some of the motives behind environmental claims was interesting and on-target, and I would have liked to see more. And I certainly intend to do some snooping through the sources he provides, primarily to check for context, especially of some of the quotes he pulls out. But the fact that he provides these sources at all is a huge mark in his favor, as is his cool-eyed appraisal of a very heated subject."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"Contrary to what the critics are claiming, this book does not tell us \\"everything is alright\\". Basically what the book does is place al problems in context and then it tries to compare them so we can judge where our money makes the biggest difference.But some people apparently don't like the resulting priorities like \\"we could give all people in the world food and clean water forever for less than the yearly costs of Kyoto\\". Notice that the writers sympathy is with the sick and starving, not with the wealthy.What is so good about the book that the writer uses the most acclaimed sources in each field, so people that don't like the resulting priorities find themselves fighting their own conclusions.As you've guessed from the title I've carefully read the 11 page Scientific American article, Lomboks even larger rebuttal, Scientific Americans reaction to that and finally the ruling of the DCSD (the Danish group of scientists that ruled him biased).This Scientific American article uses a very heavyhanded and even rhetoric approach to stress that the critics are scientific heavyweights in their field, not te be disputed.But after the dust clears only two factual errors (that are never relevant to the main theme) remain: (1) the tekst contains the term catalyse where it should have been electrolyze (translation error according to Lombok) and (2) a \\"20% dependence\\" on nuclear energy in nations having nuclear power should have been a \\"20% dependence for electric use\\".So here's a book picked to pieces by heavywheights and these are the only factual mistakes they can find!In his rebuttal (DO read it: I'cant put in web adresses here but you'll find it in no time) Lombok comes up with a long list of errors on the part of his critics. The obviously misleading quotings where the most annoying. Often his critics point a finger at Lombok for giving one view but not the other when Lombok gives exactly the same view not one paragraph later, really! Don't take my word for it but read the text.I'm a long fan of Scientific American but Lombok is not nobody so I wanted to investigate. Since all the data was readily available I could do just that. It disturbs me to find that this journal so eagerly cooperated in what turns out to be a scientific witch hunt.I've spent some time in academic circles and have many friends there. My estimate is that Lomboks \\"crime\\" is not that he has gotten his facts wrong but that he is a threat to the scientific powers that be. Their reputation and careers are on issues like global warming, energy depletion and population growth and they are viciously defending their turf. However, the political agenda surrounding these problems is too important for that attitude to be acceptable.This book is an excellent overview of what it says it is. If you want to make you political decisions better informed and your outlook less pessimistic then this book is perfect for you."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"I especially recommend this book to liberals like myself. Lomborg, predictably, is under attack from the left, and his defenders tend to be people who enjoy reading Ann Coulter. This is grossly unfortunate because Lomborg is not a conservative, and his book is not a right-wing political screed but a measured, balanced, thoughtful appraisal of data that's available to anyone. To me, it appears that the attacks on Lomborg are because, after examining the evidence, he failed to come to the politically correct conclusion. It makes me look upon my liberal brothers and sisters in a colder light, and that makes me sad.No one should want to be a knee-jerk anything. Dare to be wrong! Examine the evidence! Listen to opposing points of view before drawing conclusions!That's the end of _my_ screed."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"We like trees and other good environmental features.

This book is (correctly) complicated and difficult to summarize well, but it has the sort of analysis and backup we need.People use &quot;Pareto analysis&quot; to measure the problems carefully, then focus their efforts on the more important problems first. It is simply impossible to do that very well without careful, realistic data. Of course, real data is often confusing, and a good feature of the book is its inclusion of caveats, contradictions, and more footnotes than I've seen before in one book.This book has a bimodal distribution of opinions: people love it or despise it. As I value skepticism, I checked out some of the negative reviews, chased URLs, reread the book ... and thought there were more errors in the reviews, and few pointers. I'd love to see more negative reviews if they only followed Lomborg in backing up comments with checkable references.To summarize this *review*, it is very difficult to summarize the *book*, as it it tries so hard to avoid over-simplification. As always in real science, there is noise in the data, incomplete data, differences in data measurements, etc. Still if you care about environmental quality, and care that your money is spent where it actually does the most good, you need the best numbers you can get. It is easy to have good goals, like &quot;good environment and quality of life&quot;, but the real issue is balancing priorities dynamically as the real world requires.

That's fine. Healthy debate and disagreement over important issues is essential to the preservation of a free, open, democratic society.Some of Lomborg's critics have politely raised legitimate disagreements about some of Lomborg's statements, such as on global warming, the amount of public land that's covered in forest, and the size of wild fish populations. However, even these polite and civil critics have ignored the vast majority of Lomborg's book.Many of Lomborg's other critics have resorted to waging personal attacks on Lomborg, calling him a \\"liar\\" and a \\"fraud\\" and a \\"charlatan,\\" and saying that he has \\"no credentials.\\" These personal attacks against Lomborg suggest that Lomborg must have struck a nerve somewhere.I suppose that anyone who dares to give statistics and facts to disprove the doomsayer predictions that were made by Paul Ehrlich, Lester Brown, the Club of Rome, Greenpeace, the Sierra Club, and others in 1960s and 1970s, is bound to strike a nerve somewhere.The doomsayers who predicted a worsening of third world famine as the world's population doubled from 3 billion to 6 billion were wrong. Despite what Paul Ehrlich and other doomsayers predicted in the 1960s and 1970s, the truth is that over the past few decades, per capita food production has increased in China, India, Latin America, the developing world in general, and the world as a whole.The doomsayers were wrong in their claim that the Chinese famines of the 1960s were caused by \\"overpopulation.\\" And the doomsayers were wrong in their prediction that as China's population got bigger, its problem of famine would get worse. In reality, China's famines of the 1960s were caused by bad economic policies, not by \\"overpopulation.\\" China's switch from collective farming to private farming in the late 1970s caused a tremendous increase in per capita food production. Today, China's population is much bigger than it was in the 1960s. And today, the people of China are much better fed than they were in the 1960s.Despite what Paul Ehrlich and other doomsayers want us to believe, Africa actually has a low population density, and is very rich in many valuable natural resources, and has many large tracts of fertile land that are sitting idle, unplanted, with no crops being grown. The real cause of African famine is bad economic policies, not \\"overpopulation.\\" Collective ownership of farmland discourages farmers from planting crops, because the person who plants the crop is not necessarily the person who gets to harvest it. Government price caps on food discourage farmers from growing food.Poor countries remain poor because of corrupt government, bad economic policies, and a lack of strong protections of private property rights. Whenever a poor country adopts strong protections of private property rights, free market pricing, and free trade, combined with a strong rule of law, and enforcement of contracts, and holds on to these policies, the country experiences tremendous increases in its standard of living. Recent examples of poor countries transforming themselves into rich countries include Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan, and South Korea, and all of this happened while these countries experienced substantial increases in their populations. Paul Ehrlich said this was impossible, but real world experience proves that Ehrlich was wrong.In the rich capitalist countries with a first world standard of living, the air and water have been getting cleaner. Once per capita GNP in a country reaches about $4,000, people can start to afford worrying about protecting the environment. And the richer the country gets, the better off its environment becomes.On privately owned timberland, the greedy landowner is concerned about the future resale value of his land, so he usually plants more trees than he cuts down.On private fish farms, fish populations keep getting bigger and bigger.Government price caps on the price of water keep the price artificially low. This artificially low price encourages people to waste water. Also, this artificially low price prevents many water suppliers from being able to afford desalination plants. 70% of the world's surface is covered in water, to an average depth of 2 miles. Water \\"shortages\\" are caused by bad economic policies, not by an actual lack of water.The doomsayers who predicted that before the year 2000, the world would run out of oil, copper, gold, iron, tin, and aluminum, were wrong. In a free market, with private ownership of resources, and free market pricing, it's impossible to run out of a resource. Scarcity of a resource leads to higher prices. Higher prices encourage users to conserve. Higher prices encourage suppliers to look for more of the resource, and/or to find a cheaper substitute. The doomsayers don't understand the function of prices in a free market economy, and that's why their predictions of \\"running out\\" of resources have been consistently wrong.The doomsayers of the 18th century who worried about running out of candle wax and whale oil never realized that things like petroleum and electricity and light bulbs would come along. The stone age didn't end because we ran out of stones, and the petroleum age won't end because we run out of petroleum.The doomsayers who predicted global cooling and an ice age by the year 2000 were wrong.The doomsayers who predicted the extinction of one million species by the year 2000 were wrong.The doomsayers who predicted the total disappearance of the amazon rain forest by the year 2000 were wrong.I recommend that you read Lomborg's book. I also recommend that you read Lomborg's critics. Then you can make up your own mind about who is right."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"Those of us who care about the environment are thankful for Lomborg's book. It is a Herculean effort to compile and analyze this immense amount of data on so many fields to give us a rather dispassionate, but certainly much-closer-to-the-truth view on many environmental issues.In the beginning of the book, Lomborg skillfully explained why most people believe that the environment is in bad shape by pointing out some interesting statistics: most people believe that their own immediate sphere, a town or village, is in better shape environmentally than his country, and that his country is in better shape environmentally than the world at large. (And similarly over 70% of drivers rate themselves as above-average drivers!) So, the \\"environment is in bad shape\\" is not a personal experience, but has been communicated to them. Lomborg than correctly pointed out that incentive structure for the career environmental scientist/activist tilt them to communicate bad, or even alarmist, scenarios. Basically, it is money (donations and government grants) and livelihood (career and fame.) Similarly, the media is incented to communicate \\"news\\" that attracts a large viewership - the only real news is bad news. .Lomborg's method is quite straightforward: present a \\"received wisdom\\" of some claim of crisis, provide some explanatory material and put the issue in context, then expose the claim as either having no data or evidence to back it up, or is soundly contradicted by subsequent, more authoritative data, or its prediction wildly off the mark.This book documents how the \\"Silent Spring\\" never came to pass, \\"Our Stolen Future\\" is actually quite secure, the \\"40,000 species loss per year\\" is utter fantasy, the \\"50% drop of the human sperm count\\" is not to diminish our manhood. And there are many more...I do not come away thinking that everything is rosy - it is not the message of this book. Even though Lomborg does not have any startling new discovery to share, I certainly feel that his work is most valuable, and he is much more objective and credible than Paul Ehrlich, Lester Brown and other luminaries who have made a career of making outrageous (and wrong) predictions of environmental disasters year after year.Lomborg's point is not that there are no environmental issues, or that none of the environmental regulations has done any good. He merely points out that if we use scientific methods (rather than faith) and make claims responsibly (rather than based on self-interest), the populace will have a better understanding of the true state of the environment, and resources can be directed to the areas that are truly a source of concern. But of course that might well mean that less governmental money, and less environmental research jobs. Lomborg did not make many friends of the environmental stripe by publishing this book...."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"We can argue endlessly about this or that statistic, and clearly, sometimes Lomborg and other critics of environmentalists are sometimes right. The world is not deteriorating by ALL measures, and maybe not even by most. Global human life expectancy, currently at 67 (!), continues to increase, with no sign of slowing down. A smaller percentage of the world's population is actually starving than before. AND we continue to drive species to extinction, draw down water tables, and warm the atmosphere. It's a mixed bag. People in the broad, reasonable middle of the opinion spectrum have to agree on certain things.But I find the overall direction of Lomborg's claim highly suspect. Obviously, I cannot know what goes on in his mind to lead him to the conclusions he puts forth, but they seem intended to give support to the anti-environmentalist backlash. They set a new high-water mark for sophistication, and for that reason, may be more dangerous than those of his mentors (such as Julian Simon).Just consider a couple of big-picture things:(1) Can anyone show me just ONE reputable, peer-reviewed scientific journal, without an obvious axe to grind, that supports Lomborg's claims?(2) Lomborg says &quot;We invariably choose to prioritize using our limited resources.&quot; He also says that &quot;We have grown to believe that we are faced with an inescapable choice between higher economic welfare and a greener environment--only when we get sufficiently rich can we afford the luxury of caring about the environment.&quot; So--we can have improving living conditions for the human race, and a better environment, although we may not be able to insist on perfection in either area. Isn't that pretty much what most people in the environmental movement would agree about?Is Lomborg going through all these statistics just to refute a few romanticist extremists who want to return us to prehistoric conditions? I don't think so.If Lomborg is really as green as he claims, where is the support for people like Amory Lovins, who is promoting new technologies that support a win-win paradigm? Instead, Lomborg disparages such efforts. He says of wind power, &quot;Even in the unlikely event that the rapid wind power growth rate could continue, it would take 46 consecutive years of 22% growth for wind to overtake oil.&quot; Well, wind power has been continuing that growth rate for at least a couple of decades, and there is no sign of it slowing down. On the contrary, there is a report in the May Scientific American (or maybe it was Technology Review about the same time, but I think it was SA), where there have been some real breakthroughs in large-scale wind power very recently. And that's just ONE of the major renewable technologies. And that doesn't even mention conservation technologies, where the real action currently is.I think 46 more years is somewhat pessimistic, from the trends I've seen. Thirty to forty years, and the fossil fuel era will be coming to an end, if present trends hold.

Since this book is frequently cited by climate change deniers and skeptics, I felt that it was important for people to see a review written by people who actually work in the field of climate science and who had the time to analyze the book.UCS Examines 'The Skeptical Environmentalist'BackgroundA book by Bjrn Lomborg, a political scientist and professor of statistics at the University of Aarhus in Denmark, has created quite a stir since its 2001 release. Lomborg accuses scientists and environmental organizations of making false and exaggerated claims about the world's environmental problems. He concludes that population growth is not a problem, that there is plenty of freshwater around, that deforestation rates and species extinctions are grossly exaggerated, that the pollution battle has been won, and that global warming is too expensive to fix. A self-proclaimed environmentalist and skeptic, he claims that his reanalysis of environmental data measures \\"the real state of the world.\\"The heavily promoted book, published by Cambridge University Press, has received significant attention from the media and praise from commentators writing in The Economist, The New York Times, and Washington Post. For example, the Post's reviewer (a philosophy professor from New Zealand) concluded that it was \\"a magnificent achievement,\\" and \\"the most significant work on the environment since the appearance of its polar opposite, Rachel Carson's Silent Spring, in 1962.\\" Meanwhile, groups with a vested interest in maintaining the status quo are using the book to promote their \\"no need to take action to address global environmental problems\\" agenda. For example, the \\"Cooler Heads Coalition\\" -- formed by the Competitive Enterprise Institute and others to \\"dispel the myths of global warming\\" -- featured Lomborg in a Capitol Hill briefing on global warming.Does this book merit such positive attention? Does Lomborg provide new insights? Are his claims supported by the data? A healthy skepticism towards the claims of others is, after all, one of the hallmarks of good science. And, at first glance, Lomborg's book appears to be an objective and rigorous scientific analysis. It is published by a leading academic press, and contains an extensive bibliography and nearly 3,000 footnotes.To answer these questions, UCS invited several of the world's leading experts on water resources, biodiversity, and climate change to carefully review the sections in Lomborg's book that address their areas of expertise. We asked them to evaluate whether Lomborg's skepticism is coupled with the other hallmarks of good science - namely, objectivity, understanding of the underlying concepts, appropriate statistical methods and careful peer review. Reviewing Lomborg's claims are Dr. Peter Gleick, an internationally recognized expert on the state of freshwater resources; Dr. Jerry Mahlman, one of the most highly regarded atmospheric scientists and climate modelers; and top biologists and biodiversity experts Dr.'s Edward O. Wilson, Thomas Lovejoy, Norman Myers, Jeffrey Harvey and Stuart Pimm.These separately written expert reviews unequivocally demonstrate that on closer inspection, Lomborg's book is seriously flawed and fails to meet basic standards of credible scientific analysis. The authors note how Lomborg consistently misuses, misrepresents or misinterprets data to greatly underestimate rates of species extinction, ignore evidence that billions of people lack access to clean water and sanitation, and minimize the extent and impacts of global warming due to the burning of fossil fuels and other human-caused emissions of heat-trapping gases. Time and again, these experts find that Lomborg's assertions and analyses are marred by flawed logic, inappropriate use of statistics and hidden value judgments. He uncritically and selectively cites literature -- often not peer-reviewed -- that supports his assertions, while ignoring or misinterpreting scientific evidence that does not. His consistently flawed use of scientific data is, in Peter Gleick's words \\"unexpected and disturbing in a statistician\\".These reviews show that The Skeptical Environmentalist fits squarely in a tradition of contrarian works on the environment that may gain temporary prominence but ultimately fail to stand up to scientific scrutiny. Others, such as Julian Simon and Gregg Easterbrook, have come before him, and others no doubt will follow. Correcting the misperceptions these works foster is an essential task, for, as noted above, groups with anti-environmental agendas use these works to promote their objectives. It is also an unfortunate, time-consuming distraction, for it pulls talented scientists away from the pressing research needed to help us understand the environmental challenges we face and their prospective solutions.Winston Churchill once said, \\"A lie gets halfway around the world before the truth has a chance to get its pants on\\", reminding usof the parable of the Tortoise and the Hare. Like the Hare, Lomborg's lie has raced out in front of the truth. With the help of these careful scientific peer reviews, UCS hopes that the truth, like the Tortoise, will catch up and emerge the ultimate victor.Editor's note: In addition to these UCS-solicited reviews, critiques of Lomborg's book have also been published in Scientific American, Nature, Science, and other scientific journals, as well as on several web sites (see Related Links)."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"After reading this book, It has more or less proven beyond a shadow of a doubt what I ... had thought for a long time.

The easiest way to convince a person of an untruth is to make the lie one they already want to believe is true. Throw in the conspiracy theory that scientists, politicians, and environmental organizations have something to gain by scaring the public and you've got a bestseller!The scientific basis of this book is pure rubbish and scientists on both sides of the Atlantic have already trashed Lomborg's book. Among the most informative are a collection of reviews in Scientific American (January 2002). I will not waste my time reiterating what others have already done so well.However, I will point out that Lomborg's methods are those of a polemic rather than of someone that is honestly interested in \\"Measuring the Real State of the World.\\" The book fails to cite the reams of relevant literature that would paint a picture not in the spirit of his deceit, is full of misleading quotes taken out of context, and outright misrepresentation of fact. It brings to mind the tactics of the creationists. Therefore, you have to ask yourself who actually has more to gain by the environmental 'controversy'?On one hand you have thousands of environmental and biological scientists that on average spent six grueling years after their undergraduate education working like a slave for virtually no money, in order to obtain a Ph.D. and very specialized knowledge. After taking a series of temporary postdoc positions for low pay, if they are bright and highly motivated, they will land a job at a university. They generally sacrifice the greater monetary gains of other fields (like medicine) because they are fascinated by how our Planet, and the living things on it, work. Funding is extremely limited in this field of research and the money that the government and NGOs provide are for research purposes, not private use. In other words they receive no personal gain, they all wish the news was better, and they hate having to take time off from their research to deal with Bozos like Lomborg. Do you actually believe that if their were no environmental problems that there would be nothing to keep scientists occupied?On the other hand we have a statistician, with no expertise on environmental issues and only one (not very prestigious) publication in statistics. He is a junior faculty member not highly regarded by his peers. He writes a book for the lay person, that is basically just an expanded and updated version of similiar books written in the recent past. If that book takes a popular but controversial stand, it might sell millions. The author would be rich and famous. Such an author might have already been considered a failure by academics and therefore would have nothing to lose by writing a book with no intellectual merit. Such a book would also have the advantage of not having to go though that pesky peer-review process that may have kept some of his other biased and unsubstantiated ideas from seeing the light of day.Think about it."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"Just recently, the Danish Research Agency's committee reviewed this book and concluded that the author was systematically dishonest, misstating facts and presenting half-truths.

Is it true, as Lomborg claims, for instance, that (to take just a few): 1) the world overpopulation &quot;problem,&quot; if it ever WAS a problem, is basically solved at this point; 2) that income inequality is lessening and human welfare is improving basically everywhere and in every way (although, Lomborg admits, not as fast as he would like); 3) that global warming is not much of a problem, and certainly not one worth wrecking our economy over; 4) that the rainforest is not being destroyed (well, at least not rapidly); 5) that species are not going extinct at a rate even close to what environmentalists claim; 6) that we're not \\"running out of energy\\" (or other resources); and 7) that the only reason people are so \\"scared\\" about these so-called \\"problems\\" is that environmental groups constantly (and cynically) pound away with their exaggerated \\"Litany\\" of doom, which the media loves to pass along as its \\"horror story of the week\\") because this type of news apparently attracts readers/viewers?My take on &quot;The Skeptical Environmentalist?&quot; Interestingly, for the first few chapters, I found the book to be refreshing, honest, and &quot;skeptical,&quot; if not especially profound or original. But as chapter after chapter went by, and I realized that the author was just making the SAME EXACT ARGUMENT (\\"don't worry, things are basically not so bad and they're getting better fast!\\") over and over again in the SAME EXACT WAY (go through the \\"Litany\\" point by point and argue the exact opposite), I started to get increasingly suspicious -- not to mention increasingly bored! Especially since each chapter tackles a highly complex topic (i.e., petroleum geology, demography, global climate modeling, forestry, hydrology, chemistry, agriculture, developmental economics), each one of which would seem to require a lifetime of study to master.Here's an example. On the issue of biodiversity, an extremely complex subject, &quot;The Skeptical Environmentalist&quot; argues that the rate of species extinction has been wildly exaggerated. Now, this certainly MAY (in theory) be the case, but how can Professor Lomborg KNOW this with such certainty? I mean, scientists who specialize in this subject don't even have a clue how MANY species there are, let alone how many have disappeared and are currently endangered. And by the way, if there are 20 members of a species left in zoos, and perhaps a few more in the wild, does that mean that they're still not \\"extinct,\\" and is that supposed to be a good thing?!?. Having personally visited rainforests in places like Costa Rica, Guatemala, and Peru, all I can say is that I saw with my own eyes how much pressure (from logging, mineral exploitation, agriculture, pollution, and population pressures) is being exerted on these amazing places (and their inhabitants). Are these places really threatened? Do we want to protect these places for future generations or not? Do they have intrinsic, not just economic, value? &quot;The Skeptical Environmentalist&quot; would seem to imply that the answer is &quot;no&quot; to each of these questions.In sum, I believe that &quot;The Skeptical Environmentalist&quot; is neither truly &quot;skeptical&quot; nor &quot;environmentalist.&quot; And despite the thousands of footnotes and convoluted statistics, this book does NOT do what it claims to do, namely present the &quot;real state of the world,&quot; just the &quot;state of the world according to Professor Bjorn Lomborg.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"Come on people. This Scientific Dishonesty Committee action is part of an ideologically motivated witch hunt against someone who refuses to parrot the extremist environmentalist line.Lomborg has responded to his critics and refuted them line-by-line, but the Danish Inquisition didn't take his responses into consideration. Scientific American allowed him 1 page in print to respond to 11 pages of attacks.The Danish Committee failed to cite a single specific example to support their claim of bias. Apparently one of the criticisms is that he was too diligent in citing his sources.As a scientist myself, it is frightening to see this attempt to silence someone who challenges a popular myth. The Church (and his fellow scientists) did the same to Galileo in the 17th century.When the Danish Committee also scrutinizes Al Gore's ridiculous Earth in the Balance book for scientific dishonesty, then I'll believe they have some objectivity in the matter."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"For all the reviewers who only rely on Scientific American's negative 'review' for your negative perceptions of this book, you must know that SA refused to allow Lomborg a full rebuttal either in the magazine or on his own website.

Most of us aren't so dumb..."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"I wanted to start this book review with - what else? - some statistics. As I write this review the book has received 208 other customer reviews and the average customer review rate is about 3.5 stars. Does that mean that most reviewers consider this book to be slightly above ordinary? No. The 3.5 stars average doesn't say anything about how the individual rates are distributed. It would be good if Amazon would disclose also the standard deviation of the ratings or, in other words, how far from the average are the individual star ratings. Without going into calculations I can assert that the standard deviation for the star ratings given to the book is huge. People love it or hate it. There are very few reviews with 2, 3 or 4 stars; the vast majority is either 1 star (the minimum) or 5 stars (the maximum). The controversy represented by such high standard deviation by itself is enough reason to read the book. If a book can instigate such impassioned response it's got to be worth checking out.The book brings new elements into the environmental discussion and that's what all the fuss is about. One of the key elements is of course accountability. The author double-checked the sources cited in many doomsday predictions, mostly from Lester Brown from the Worldwatch Institute. It becomes apparent from reading the book that Mr. Brown is keen on data massaging. Mr. Brown, according to the book, would select, from a historic data set, points that deviate from the line that best fits the data and, based on those particular points, assume a considerably different trend. According to Lomborg the Worldwatch Institute predictions need to be taken with a grain of salt.Another element brought by the book is falsifiability. Nobody can be criticized at hindsight from making a wrong prediction based on a poor model. But once this happens the model has to be reevaluated. This is what the scientific method is all about; it's called falsifiability. A model or hypothesis should be testable against experimental data and if it fails to predict the outcome of the experiment the model or hypothesis should be reconsidered. What the doomsday theorists such as the Worldwatch Institute do, according to the book, is to recycle failed hypothesis such as \\"humanity is running out of food\\"; \\"most animal species will go extinct within the next few years\\"; \\"water-wars will crop up everywhere\\". Such predictions have being made, again and again, for decades now and as we find ourselves still having readily available food, water, oil, lush biodiversity, those theories should be reevaluated. Instead the doomsday theorists keep using the same predictions saying, \\"now it is the turning point\\", and this turning point keeps being pushed to the future but never challenged.Another element mostly absent from the environmental discussion is economics. Preservationist efforts need to be economically sound. If to save an acre of forests someone needs to set in motion a chain reaction that will damage several acres elsewhere then it's not worth doing it. One of my favorite examples of this approach on the book is the unfortunate Exxon-Valdez oil spill in Alaska, 1989. That was certainly a tragic incident that should be avoided but the reaction to the spill was far from optimal. Scientists knew at that point that the oil would naturally degrade or evaporate and the best course of action was to leave things as they were. Instead More than 2.1 billion dollars were spent on cleanup efforts using pressurized hot water and other techniques. However, some portions of the beaches were left aside without undergoing the cleanup efforts so that compare the two strategies could be compared. The places where the hot steam was used were pretty much sterile for about four years while at the beaches left with the spill remains life was thriving only 8 months after the spill. Most of the oil on those beaches naturally degraded, evaporated or formed harmless tar nodules. Knowledge is power but not even the scientific knowledge could save those 2.1 billion dollars from being wasted in harmful cleanup efforts. Something more powerful than knowledge prevailed: public opinion. The public just wanted to see some action being taken. The Skeptical Environmentalist has the potential to help changing that public opinion. Think about what could those 2.1 billion dollars have done to improve the environment if used elsewhere.The book has its flaws. The author himself has a few corrections posted in his personal website. But it is still a momentous effort to challenge environmentalists' claims that went unchecked for so many years. The book is not a final answer but is a much-needed reality check.Leonardo Alves - Houghton, Michigan - January 2003"},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"Lomborg compellingly debunks many myths about the state of the environment. I am an environmentalist who helped start the first Earth Day in 1970 at age 10, but I read and checked the original data sources he cites and they are very accurate. His conclusions about the improvements in the human condition are impossible to ignore - we are better off than at any time in our history - verifiably. At the same time, the dire situation for the natural world is also clear - and worthy of major action.Three cheers for Lomborg's courage to challenge the basis for doomsayer preaching about apocalypse."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"Must read for both those who have disregarded the environmental movement, and those who have embraced it. So many have gotten mixed-up in this battle that maybe it's time to take a step back. Make sure to read both the critique of this book, which does sound rather shill, and Lomborg's measured response."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"This is a fascinating book if you read it with an objective mind. Lomborg presents a new perspective about inaccuracies that have enabled some environmentalists and activists to present an excessively bleak picture of the effects of pollution, overpopulation, global warming, food shortages, reduction of biodiversity, etc. One has to bear in mind that the author started his research when he was an environmentalist at Greenpeace.He utilizes statistical and economic models to present us another view about these subjects and the real dangers we have to confront in the world, using mostly official figures of the U.N., World Bank and environmentalist organizations. According to the author, there are problems that we must approach in a scientific manner, but we might have never been better off compared with other periods of humanity.Life expectation has doubled in developed countries in just a century (increasing 50% in less developed ones). Never so much food has been produced and population growth is slower relatively, than the reduction of cereal production. According to FAO figures the rainforests are not in the brink of extinction. On the contrary, since WWII, forests have actually grown by 0.85 %. Lomborg also analyzes in depth figures related with the water problem and pollution. Global warming effect gets a fairer treatment.The Kyoto protocol could only provide a very marginal difference in temperature rise.If you want to balance the inflammatory literature we are getting used to read, with another perspective, I would recommend this book. But of course, politicians, regional interests, and fanatics are contaminating constantly what should be a real and transparent debate, from the scientific standpoint, to insure a better future and the right policies for a healthier world.........."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"When I read this book, I was amazed. Based on what I had heard I had thoroughly convinced myself that our environment is getting worse and worse. And then there is this Danish associate professor Bjorn Lomborg, who writes a book describing, among other things, how:1. The world population is not growing at a record rate; the growth rate has been steadily declining since 1964. The world's population is expected to stabilize just short of 11 billion.2. There is more and more food per head of the world's population. This is largely caused by the success of the so-called 'Green Revolution' (high-yield crops, irrigation and controlled water supply, fertilisers and pesticides, and farmers' management skills). The number of people starving is decreasing (although the numbers are still frighteningly high!)3. Our lives and health have improved dramatically over the past couple of hundred years due to better standards of living, better hygiene and water supplies and better medical therapy. And over the past 50 years poverty has fallen more than in the previous 500. Also in the developing world a fantastic progress has been made (although there is still a long way to go!). Furthermore, over the past three decades, inequality between countries has not been increasing but decreasing. This trend is expected to continue throughout much of the century.4. We are not headed for a major energy crisis, nor are we likely to experience any significant scarcity of raw materials. The earth is not running out of energy or natural recourses.5. We need to manage and price water more carefully but we are not facing insurmountable water shortages.6. Overall, the pollution burden has diminished dramatically in the developed world. Air pollution has dramatically decreased over the past decades in the Western world while at the same time there has been a dramatic economic growth. It would be a mistake to believe that economic growth is in the process of destroying the earth. Economy and ecology complement each other.7. Global warming is almost certainly taking place, but 1) probably less devastating than often claimed, 2) radical fuel cutbacks are worse than the original affliction8. Biodiversity-reduction and deforestation do exist but to a much lesser extent than often thought and claimed.Lomborg describes all of this very transparantly, uses clear statistics, uses excellent references and argues very logically, intelligently and subtly. He constantly keeps on explaining and reminding throughout the book that the fact that things are getting better does not mean everything is OK. He clearly points at the necessity to keep on focusing on solving all of the real problems we still face. Also he acknowledges that the fact that things are getting better overall does not mean that there are no places or times were things get worse. The author says for instance: \\"A lot still needs to be done to improve conditions in Africa, not only in the context of AIDS prevention but also for food availability and economic production.I think this is a brave and terrific book. I was surprised by how ferociously it was attached by some authoritative scientists, for instance in Scientific American. These scientists treat the book literally as if it were an attack on science. I read many of the criticisms and Lomborg's response to them. And according to me, Lomborg wins by knock out. The criticisms are full of irrelevant personal attacks, misquotations and unsubstantiated attacks. Lomborg's replies are factual and to the point. I am not an expert at all in this field and I can't know how right Lomborg is. But if he's right, it wouldn't be the first time that established scientists deny a truthful new message and try to isolate the messenger."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"There are many reasons why this book is a needed voice in the marketplace of ideas. Environmental policies, while so needed, have become reactionary instead of strategic. How we use our resources will have a far-reaching impact on future generations and the preservation of our planet's integrity is essential. As a result, clear-thinking in this area is desperately needed and Lomberg does the job well. Here are the reasons I like this book...--First of all I would like to say how well documented this book is. I wish more writers followed this example. The variety of sources is truly impressive.--Lomborg is clearly not \\"anti-science\\", but rather he is anti bad science. This distinction is essential. Policy makers need to keep in mind the fact that not all science is good science. The results from studies must therefore be tested and critiqued just like everything else that's man-made.--This book points out that there are those who place the environment ahead of humanity and those who place human interests as integrated with the environment. Studies, which come from each, are sometimes biased towards their ideology.--Lomborg has a firm understanding of the importance of truth. No matter how noble the cause and how justified the end or goal of that cause, the means which is used to attain that end must be just as noble and just as right. Twisting data, misrepresenting environmental impact, and deceiving the public cannot be done - even in the name of good. The consequences are far too great.--This book makes it clear that if we are to rightly know priorities for what should be protected, cleaned, and guarded, then truth must not be abandoned. Only when the highest priorities are truly known can resources be rightly directed toward those issues.--The unfortunate results of focusing on non-existent problems is that the real problems get ignored. Additionally, poverty stricken nations have precious few resources and it is necessary to focus those resources towards the right issues.--The use of worldwide figures to account for both positive and negative trends for any given issue is a must if we are to truly think and act globally.--In short there can be no valid reasons for producing poor or inflated studies. Instead, this tactic should be called for what it is - deceit. If it's not that then it's at least inexcusable sloppiness."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"Environmentalists are rather like Jehovah's Witnesses, both groups keep insisting that we are all doomed, and that the world is heading for disaster, but somehow the world is still there and they keep having to alter their pronouncements to account for the awkward fact that we have not all perished yet. Bjorn Lomborg's brilliant book shows that the dramatic pronouncements made by the envrionmental movement are nonsense, we are not running out of water or oil or anything else, proportionally fewer people are starving, things are getting better, not worse. Some of the information in this book was already familiar to me from reading P.J. O'Rourke's wonderful book 'All the Trouble in the World' . I was pleased to meet again from O'Rourke's book our old friend Paul Ehrlich, the environmentalist who is always making dramatic pronounciations that turn out to be 100% wrong, yet people still listen to him. Why? Lomborg isn't as funny as O'Rourke, but then he isn't trying to be, his book is utterly fascinating anyway. If you have ever been scared by the dire prophecies of an environmentalist, read this book and arm yourself with courage."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"Lomborg set out to prove that the environment was getting worse, as all the environmentalists say it is, and found that maybe it wasn't. This book presents the part of the story that environmentalists don't talk about. Read it to get a reality check, noting that Lomborg does not present the whole story either. The truth in cases like this is usually somewhere in the middle, so google up lots of reviews of it and make your own decision. Better, pick a couple of sample cases in the book and investigate the scientific literature on them.My take on this issue is that there are scientists crying &quot;Wolf!&quot;, some of whom are correct and others who are not. It is unfortunate that the latter exist, but that does not mean the former don't. So much depends, for example, on what environment model and simulation parameters you use, and testing them empirically isn't always immediately possible.Individual cases are just going to have to be treated as such, but it is difficult to do so when Environmentalism becomes just as much a religion as Anti-Environmentalism or Capitalism.

Modern environmentalists are only the most recent expression of recycled romanticism.

After years of careful research with his statistics students, he exposed the Litany of Lies propounded by radical, romantic environmentalists.

Reading this book, it became obvious to me that environmentalists for the most part, are *not* interested in the environment and in the health of the people on it (if they were, they would at least get their facts straight, and stop the constant barrage of misinformation that they constantly throw at us). They are indeed, more interested in their political agenda, a combination of fascism and socialism, because of course, &quot;they know best&quot;.Use this book as a fact finder.

The story of a bold loner who dares to defy the establishment makes for really great press.Unfortunately, Bjorn Lomborg's &quot;The Skeptical Environmentalist&quot; also makes for really poor science.Thus while Lomborg has mostly gotten rave reviews from newspapers and political commentary journals, the scientific community has exhaustively exposed his fallacies, omissions, misunderstandings, and misrepresentations. You can read scholarly refutations of Lomborg's book in &quot;Science,&quot; &quot;Nature,&quot; and &quot;Scientific American,&quot; among others.I dare not try to cram a summary of all of Lomborg's errors into 1,000 words. One random example: Lomborg claims that ocean productivity has doubled since the 1970s, and thus fears about rampant overfishing are exaggerated. Unfortunately--and inexcusably--he's confused production with consumption. The volume of fish caught has indeed doubled since the 1970s, but this is a far cry from showing that the oceans are actually producing more. Try uprooting a few blades of grass from your lawn with just your bare hands. Then go back over that same patch with a lawnmower. You'll have cut much more grass the second time, and not because your lawn started growing more.If you see the environment as a scientific matter, &quot;The Skeptical Environmentalist&quot; will probably be of little value to you.If you see the environment as a political argument to be won or lost, then you might find it more useful: it sounds convincing and it makes environmentalists look really bad.

This movement makes false and dishonest statements, ignores contradictory evidence and is deliberately alarmist.

I was somewhat skeptical of his thesis, and it seemed duplicative of the work of Julian Simon, the first maverick to note the systematic exaggeration in the environmental sciences, until I observed the extraordinary attempt by the earth science community to silence this young voice. The first shot was the Environmental Caliphate review in Scientific American which, breaking with tradition, refused to give Bjorn Lomborg any space in which to respond, not in that issue nor in subsequent issues, even though they reviewed him on four occasions. His work had already been published in the Italian language version of SA, Le Scienze, a peer reviewed publication, so he was likely to respond as the scholar that he is. However when he responded on HIS OWN WEBSITE to Scientific American they went to court to enjoin him from doing so! Fortunately they were not successful, however using the courts to interfere with a scientific debate had not been seen since the Scopes trials, a malicious prosecution staged to prevent John Scopes from teaching evolution in the public schools. Now in the latest bizarre installment of this saga, an academic group in Denmark--where Bjorn Lomborg is head of their Environmental Review Agency--delightfully named \\"Committees on Scientific Dishonesty\\" has belched their decree: \\"Objectively speaking, the publication of the work under consideration is deemed to fall within the concept of scientific dishonesty.\\" (Please tell me that this is a bad English translation of Danish and that no one \\"deemed to fall into a concept\\") They have since admitted that their haughty conclusion was based on the aforementioned SA articles, further they had not reviewed his response, and their report cannot, and does not, cite a single instance of a fallacy or distortion in Lomborg's book, not one! Americans love a good scrap and rarely agree on much other than everyone gets to speak, and we can spot those that would quash free speech a mile coming.

I have spent my adult lifetime --- say, the past 30 years or so--- seeing one doomsday prediction after another proved wrongheaded, exaggerated, or false. In Lomborg's well-written, meticulously researched and documented book, we finally have just what was needed: a compendium of correction.I'm glad this was written by a evenhanded and even rather polite person--- one who is still committed to protecting the environment--- rather than by some strident Rush Limbaugh type. Lomborg's calm reasonableness makes it possible to actually discuss important global issues without a snarling partisan tone. Although some of his critics evidently need lessons in this sort of dialogue.This would be a rgeat gift to your bright college freshman just beginning to be exposed to the popular apocalyptic environmentalism.

Why not research the points Lomborg makes with the worlds' top scientific journals, before being so quick to jump on his bandwagon. If Lomborg wrote that smoking does not cause cancer, would you believe him? Yet to the majority of the scientific community, Lomborg's assertions are just as ignorant.

The very things he critizes environmentalists about, such as sloppy source work and using skewed numbers, are what he seems most guilty of. I could complain about this book for a very long time: I will not. If you are environmentalist do not read this book: it will only make you mad.

This book reminds me of the efforts of creationists trying to refute evolution against all odds, this is the last ditch effort of the conservative right to try and defend there environmental policies using bad science and sometimes outright lies. As a student of carnivore ecology i find this books attitude towards biodiversity very distrubing, turning your back to the world and telling yourself that everything is all right wont help anybody.

This book is worse than worthless."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"While I am all for a careful review of the science that is behind our environmental policies and standards, readers of Lomborg's &quot;The Skeptical Environmentalist&quot; should be aware that the Danish Committees on Scientific Dishonesty (DCSD) reviewed this book because of its dubious claim to scientific standards. Their discussions centered mainly on whether or not the book &quot;The Skeptical Environmentalist&quot; could even be classified as science. A number of DCSD members stated that the book fails to meet even the most rudimentary requirements of basic scientific inquiry and that DCSD should not even handle the case. Other members thought that the term &quot;bad science&quot; should not be an obstacle to evaluating the complaint.In their assessment DCSD refereed to a Scientific American forum from the Jan 2002 issue which asked four leading experts to assess Lomborg's treatment of global warming, energy, population and biodiversity. Lomborg was repeatedly cited for distorting statistics, misrepresentation, vagueness, illusory precision, and \\"persistent conceptual confusions.\\"In their final ruling DCSD concluded that \\"On the basis of the material adduced by the complainants, DCSD deems it to have been adequately substantiated that the defendant, who has himself insisted on presenting his publication in scientific form... based on customary scientific standards and in light of his systematic one-sidedness in the choice of data and line of argument, has clearly acted at variance with good scientific practice...Objectively speaking, the publication of the work under consideration is deemed to fall within the concept of scientific dishonesty... the publication is deemed clearly contrary to the standards of good scientific practice.\\"In response to the DCSD ruling members of the Danish government have called for him to step down as Director of the Environmental Assessment Institute.Jeff Harvey, former editor of the scientific journal Nature commented on the ruling in an Associated Press interview that &quot;It is unfortunate that I and many others felt it necessary to take Lomborg and his book to task for the veritable deluge of inaccuracies it contains, but Lomborg has veered well across the line that divides controversial, if not competent, science from unrepentant incompetence... Scientists must be held accountable for serious transgressions that are committed without responsibility, and this judgment goes at least some way to underlining Lomborg's dishonesty.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"The Danish Committees on Scientific Dishonesty issued a decision that declared Lomborg's research \\"to fall within the concept of scientific dishonesty,\\" and to be \\"clearly contrary to the standards of good scientific practice.The man is statictian with an adgenda- to say that the enviroment is actually not as bad off as it is.

It will serve as an example of the many problems of this book. In his work Lomberg claims that habitat loss has had no effect on birds, that is it has not caused extinctions. This is utterly irresponsible. Clearly, habitat loss lead to the loss of no less than four species of birds in North America alone. They are, the Carolina Parakeet, Passenger Pigeon, Ivory-billed Woodpecker and Dusky Seaside Sparrow. These extinctions offer a cautionary tale to those who would haphazardly slash and burn rain forests or even northern temperate forests. The important point made by our North American extinctions is that evolutionary specialization can mean disaster when the local environment is decimated. The kind of specialization exhibited by the species mentioned above is uncommon in temperate regions, however endemism and ecological specialization is extraordinarily high in the tropics. So thoughtless clearing of the kind engaged in here in North America would spell absolute disaster in the tropics. I am not saying that development and the conservation of biodiversity are incompatible, I hamppen to think they are. But the picture that Lomberg presents is not an honest one. Not in the slightest. There is geniune truth in the 'litany'. I think it is clear that pollution, bioaccumlation, ozone depletion (not so much a problem now as decisive action has been taken), acid rain are all serious problems that affect the quality of all life. Lomberg likes to gloss over this fact, or say that it is not really a problem, or that is not as serious a problem as the environmentalists think it is. This is a horribly irresponsible book."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"If I could give this less than one star, I would do it.

I have read the correspondence between him and Scientific American.Naturally, each two-sided argument has two bodies of thought. The question as to whether the earth is at the brink of some sort of collapse, environmentally and economically, (those terms have the same meaning here, will also have two bodies of separate thought. Where, oh where, can we find somebody to disprove the overwhelming body of scientific, naturalistic, and innate understanding that we are treating the natural systems, our own physical bodies included, like our dumping grounds.Well, we've found a guy. He doesn't have much understanding of the environment, nor does he have an understanding of ecological systems, nor does he have an holistic understanding of how our human bodies and the environment are one in the same, nor does he understand that his graphs are meaningless and simply wrong. However, he does know statistics and formualas. Whether they work or not in reality it doesnt matter. Lomborg is sitting at his computer telling us that outside everything is well. If somebody tells you the woods are not on fire but they aren't looking towards the woods, do you believe them? IF they say statisically that it looks like the woods are not on fire, do you believe them? You feel the heat, you see the flames, does it mean that 10 years ago there was no fire, so there shouldn't be one now? of course not.Lomborg is a theoretician, and only that. His theories don't hold up when tested. What can you say? I guess somebody has to take the other side in this issue, not surprisingly, it's incredibly weak and it's by sombody outside of the field.So sad that this book is so heavily read.

You could see pollution everywhere. Lakes were oily. The air smelled like coal. Over the next forty years, things got a lot better. I saw an even more dramatic change when I lived in Eastern Europe after the fall of Communism. With a free market and economic progess came much a cleaner environment. In North American and Europe (the places I lived) my observations told me that the environment had improved yet I kept on reading about things only getting worse. This book confirms with statistical evidence what I and many other people have observed during our lives. I know environmental problems remain, but pessimism won't help us solve them. A book like this courageously challenges the doomsday establishment and will help clean the environment, since the only way forward is through better use of technology, not returning to an earlier age. Most primitive technologies were environmentally friendly only because they supported such small populations. With the populations already on the earth, we can't go back. If the current American population tried to live like hunter gatherers of the past, we would destroy the environment within days."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":". . .do protest too much!!Dr. Bjorn Lomborg, a professor of Statistics, admitted member of the Left, and former member of Greenpeace, has done the unthinkable. He has presumed to tread on the sacred cows of the environmentalist movement by demonstrating, with hard-core numbers, that the world is not in quite the bad shape it is claimed to be. Kudos to Dr. Lomborg for having the courage and character to present an honest analysis behind a generation of faulty (albeit politically correct) thinking and reasoning.The response to Dr. Lomborg's book has been quite interesting. He has been attacked by many popular scientific journals and noted scientists -- but only very rarely ON HIS ACTUAL WORK! Rather, the attacks have been ad hominim in nature (and in one case, a cream pie in the face!) This tends to make me extremely suspicious of the motives of his critics.No student of the sciences or the humanities, regardless of discipline, can afford to ignore a seminal work like this one.Recommended."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"Full disclosure -- I consider myself to be an environmentalist, but before that I'd like to think that the truth is my main priority. The Earth and it's ecosystems are incredibly complex, and I do feel that a lot of what contributes to our views on the state of the environment don't come from direct experience, but from what information we choose to expose ourselves to. I looked forward to reading this book if only to get what had been trumpeted as a coherent, alternative view to my own. This did turn out to be a complete waste of my time. The shortcomings of this book have been eloquently documented elsewhere, so I'll just summarize briefly:The \\"things are getting better\\" angle: Lomborg devotes a lot of time to the theme that the environment is in better shape than it used to be. In the cases he cherry-picks to support this view, it has. We no longer deal with the soot-choked skies of early industrial cities. Air pollution from autos in the major cities of the U.S. is down considerably from what it was in the 1970s. The irony here is the obvious correlation to these improvements are pieces of legislation that are an anathema to the self-same people who praise this book the loudest -- to these free-market wonks, the clean water act and the clean air act are nothing short of draconian and socialist. And then there is the very obvious leaving out of any statistics (or, in fact, common sense) that would point to the somewhat inescapable conclusion that with 6 billion people, many of whom leave larger ecological footprints than ever seen in history, the environment most likely is in a world of hurt.Fun with words: Lomborg consciously manipulates the meanings of words to suit his ends. For example, \\"forest\\", in biological terms, would refer to a complex, multi-faceted ecosystem that grows and evolves through stages and disturbances over a long period of time before it reaches a status that could be considered old growth. Lomborg instead refers to a \\"forest\\" as pretty much any vegetation that covers the ground, which therefore makes him able to claim that \\"forests\\" are actually increasing on the planet. In another case, Lomborg claims that marine \\"productivity\\" is increasing, since we are pulling twice as many fish out of the water. The biological definition of \\"productivity\\" refers to the rate at which organic (living) matter is produced. This type of \\"productivity\\" obviously doesn't increase when you consume twice as much of it. I don't think Lomborg is stupid -- I think this is willful manipulation, and it is all over this book.The Earth is just a resource base: I realize that not everyone shares the view that the planet is a spiritual resource, but I also know that a lot of people, including those who have read this book, do. Don't expect to see this angle covered. The consequences of global warming are detailed strictly in terms of loss and changes in the resource base. The environment as a place where humans can go to calm down and heal themselves is evidently not considered to be important enough to include in the \\"greatest environmental treatise since 'Silent Spring'\\". The fact that our best scientific evidence shows us to be in the midst of a major extinction pulse previously reserved for asteroid strikes doesn't figure in here. Polar bears might have been discussed if one could turn them into gasoline or housing.I'd hoped for something smart here, something to chew on. Not so much."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"Whether you agree with Lomborg's analysis or not, this bookhas opened up the debate about what is wrong (and right) aboutpublic policies concerning the environment.No longer will the mandarins be able to sit back in their ivory towers and tell the rest of us what we ought to do without providing detailed analysis and policy arguments. On the other side of thing, no longer will people like me be able to pretend that (some) changes are not needed.Lomborg has provided us with a ractual framework upon to base the public debate. No matter that he may be wrong on various factual points: his opponents will have to make their countercases on Lomborg's framework."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"A must read for every person still interested in rational and critical thinking.Based on official statistics by the United Nations and government agencies, the author presents a holistic view of the state of the world. Whilst he does not neglect to highlight where the is still room for improvement, he makes it clear that we are living in a world as good as it ever existed.Lomborg, statistician by training started of as a convinced Greenpeace member who wanted to rebut the claims of a \\"conservative\\" economist claiming that environmental associations try to paint too bleak a picture of our present life. In the process of his investigations, Lomborg transformed into one of the most well-known political scientists who persistently argues to adopt a more balanced view of the main problems faced by our society."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"It is interesting to see all the usual suspects attacking Bjorn Lomborg now that a Committee in Denmark has attacked his book. If these zealous envirnmentalists would take time to read the UK Daily Telegraph, The Economist and several other publications that can be found by a simple search on the web, they would find that the so-called findings of this committee are completely laughable. Mr Lomborg's arguments were ignored, the main witness has gone down on the record as suggesting in public that environmentalists should lie for their cause, and the Committee could only find, oxmoronically, that Mr Lomborg was \\"unintentionally dishonest\\".Mr Lomborg's real crime was to prick the pretensions of those who see their way to power and wealth from riding on the environmental bandwagon. If the world isn't such a parlous state as these people say, then their grants might start drying up, the press wouldn't talk to them any more and they might have to go and do some real work."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"The book tries to present a side not often heard in this debate. One should read it to judge for themselves. This issue is so close to some, all you see here are either 5 star reviews or 1 star reviews. As some here wish to cite the NY Times and this Danish agency's rebuking of the author. Remember, majority scientific consensus does not always equate into truth. At one point in history, the majority of scientists felt they had undeniable proof the world was flat and the Earth was it's center, and those that opposed this view were not treated very well to say the least! Let's not walk the same road again of idea stifling, no matter how ridiculous you believe another's ideas are."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"As a expose on the luddite fund-raiser that is TV-environmentalism this in-depth statistical page turner has very few peers.I have to admit that as a classically-trained, professional economist I am biased. Man's achievements in terms of wealth creation, poverty reduction and life expectancy over the last hundred years or so leave me utterly awestruck. I have no truck whatsoever with people who claim to have the third world at heart, but whose self-promoting policies would clearly consign Africa and the even less well off to perpetual poverty, endless epidemics and non-genetic crop failure and starvation.Nevertheless, I try to listen to all the views and Lomborg appears to have done much the same. What made TSE stand out for me was the way the author treats everyone with sympathy & patience - even mindless buffoons who think that food production depends on land mass or that a high oil price spells doom for the world economy.And in contrast to what Lomborg's many detracters would like you to believe, it appears to me that he has a reasonably good grasp of the issues involved. Reasonably. This is probably what lies behind the many distastefully rabid denouncements by his former friends. Had TSE been written by policy wonks at the Cato Institute, it would hardly have been mentioned in popular circles. But Lomborg is a former card-carrying environmentalist who had the courage to risk reputation and career by announcing, 'I was wrong. We really are in great shape.'It wasn't until he actually looked at all the numbers that he realised things aren't getting worse .... but only if you do your numbers properly and put realistic timeframes on your projections. TSE is worth reading just to see why - although it's worth noting that Lomborg is no raging libertarian. He's a European social-democrat who believes in public/private co-operation and long-term policy plans.Criticially, BL focuses in on the main obstacles to bettering mankind's lot and what can best be achieved by using cost-benefit analysis and long-term data trends - rather than starting with a thesis and choosing 'friendly' data points. The end result is a very readable - if occasionally dry - trot through our world and its state of being.So if you are open-minded, in search of ideas and believe in our ability to invent and adapt through market-based choices, then you'll probably like this book. Alternatively, if your world is full of storm clouds, a paranoid fear of debate and a love of authoritarian bureaucracy, then keep your money. You'll hate its breezy open-minded outlook on life.Lastly, to our environmentalist brethren, please, please, please stop telling us all to wake up. Thirty years ago you shouted about the coming ice age. Now it's global warming/dimming. Virtually all government interference results in 'solutions' that create problems far worse than the original. And in our world, where climate/living conditions are changing, but in ways that are not properly understood, the thought of mixing scientific uncertainty with bureaucratic bunglng is frightening to say the least. For this reason there is nothing more healthy than informed, open-minded debate where all the facts are laid bare. That way everyone can make choices and changes can come about naturally.Five stars to Mr Lomborg for helping us all to do just that."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"There is sanity in the environmental movement!Lomborg is a true environmentalist whose message is that many things are getting better but that there is still room for a lot of well thought out improvement.He has a real problem with activists who grossly overstate their data (or who have no data and overstate anyway) in order to panic the public into action. He does a wonderful job of digging out the solid data and putting the data and consequences in perspective. He is ruthless with sloppy science!He is especially good at balancing the costs and benefits of corrective actions. For example the trade off of large reductions in pesticide use versus the effects on costs of vegetables and fruits and the adverse consequences of these costs on diet and cancer incidence.The only downside is that my wife is tired of me talking about what I've read. Although, I've noticed she is using Lomborg's analysis in her own conversations.It is a thick, comprehensive book with a lot of graphs and numbers. Despite this, it is an easy read with a very logical breakdown of chapters and a summary of key points at the end of each chapter. Skipping around the book is easy. I hope this book can make it into some college classrooms. I would consider it appropriate for any environmentally interested teenager or adult."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"First off, let me state that it is very sad that many people do not understand Global Warming well other than what they see and hear through popular media. It is even concerning that the IPCC's publications are free for the reading but they aren't celebrated, popular literature. Just like a gun in the hand of a mentally deranged individual can spell nothing but danger, it is highly dangerous to allow policy makers and public officials to propose laws based on interpreted and misinterpreted global gloom and doom predictions that in most cases always lean towards conservative estimates.Hence, someone has to intervene, say \\"look, hold on a minute\\" and take this whole mess apart! Lomborg was the man. Who wants to blame him? Any respectable citizen today, either in the developed world, or the developing world has to pick up a copy of this book and give it a serious read.The Skeptical Environmentalist deserves 4 stars simply for the breadth of research Mr. Lomborg has done and citations he has provided in the book for the same. While it is a widely controversial work, many of Lomborg's perspectives on key environmental issues such as air & water pollution, global warming, population growth, destruction of forests and more provide a much required balance to the litany of one sided arguments on these topics which eventually lead to very poor public policies that are not fair or thought out from a systems perspective. I'm also pleased that I was educated on the complexities of climate modeling and the vast temperature rise variations depending on what \\"model\\" or \\"scenario\\" you choose to stick with. For instance, I did not know climate modeling was so parameterized yet model resolutions on a global scale do not study the effects of such fine factors as the effect of aerosols, cloud cover or water vapor feedback.I do hope that another edition of the book would be released that would provide a touch of clarity and compactness to the 'Skeptic' arguments, perhaps something like a reader's guide to the book that could serve as an introduction. As it stands now, it isn't an easy read for the uninitiated, with myriad facts and numbers to crunch in your head and a library full of graphical plots. However, that's what it takes to understand these sort of complex issues. The real question is : are our politicians reading?Despite controversy, the polarizing book will bring much needed awareness and discussions to the hot topics of tomorrow. Any policy maker dreaming to slow down a projected gloom and doom world ought to seriously consider cost and benefit issues from a cradle to grave approach. There is no excuse to an alternative approach, not in a world with limited resources."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"With all of the hyped discussion about the global environment, everyone needs to become better informed concerning the truths and deceptions of this emotional issue.Mr. Lomborg is liberal and a member of Greenpeace, but more importantly he is a statistician and totally dedicated to the truth and the proper use of statistics in finding it. The book is not written as a boring statistical proof of his conclusions. He does illustrate his conclusions with numerous graphs and charts which you can study or ignore and he documents his facts with an almost unbelievable number of reference notes.It is a prodigious accomplishment by someone searching for and discovering the truth. The book is brilliant and powerful. If you only read one more nonfiction book in your lifetime, let it be this one. This is quite possibly the best book of the new millennium for people in the general public.Unfortunately this book vividly illustrates once more why you cannot trust the mainstream media for a fair and balanced treatment of any volatile societal issue. Mr. Lomborg's critics have already launched into their ad hominem attack mode because his rational conclusions do not agree with their left-wing extremist hysteria.Help decrease the ignorance and demagoguery about this very important subject. I cannot recommend this book too highly. Almost everyone who reads this book will be very glad he did and most will recommend it to a friend."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"The subtitle is &quot;Measuring the Real State of the World&quot; and this is what this statistician/author did. The author states that there are only a few sources accepted for worldwide statistics, mainly UN, USGS or Nasa studies. Using these studies the author shows how some studies are misused, and misquoted to portend impending environmental doom.I read this book because as one who lived through the sixties, I have not seen the environmental disasters that were predicted, come true. The world population did not outrun the food supply of the green revolution by the mid- seventies; basic foodstuffs are not even on a rising price trend. I have not seen it with our basic metals or oil for that matter. The costs of these have not kept pace with inflation. The author attempts to show where the error lies in these environmental dire predictions. One is inclined to believe this book, the original source is cited, numerous graphs are used and the historical results seem to jive with reality. Many of the past-predicted environmental scares did not pan out.One example would be the scarcity of oil in the seventies and the beginning of a continuous oil scarcity. In reality, oil prices have not kept pace with inflation.One main point of the book is that as a country becomes richer it puts less pressure on the environment and its population levels off. The author puts much faith in this because statistics show that the percentage of the world's population considered poor is steadily diminishing. The author's research seems to be immense, and his reasoning very well thought out. He leads you through the main points of environmental crisis's, scarcity of resources, energy, food, the rainforest, global warming, etc. This book puts many things in perspective. One wants to believe this book, because it offers a future that is not going to be one of stark choices, but reasonable choices and trade-offs. The conclusions are based on the data given and seem very logical. I recommend this book as an eye-opener. The author's explanation of what is happening environmentally, certainly bears more resemblance to reality than can be shown throughout the history of the environmentalist scares of the recent past. One can only hope the future is also as consistent."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"An excellent survey of environmentalist literature. Ever since Malthus, there has been scaremongering about overpopulation, dwindling resources, etc. but fears have always been proven vain.

The attacks on Mr. Lomborg are political rather than reasonable.The 1-star reviewers should be ashamed of themselves for sinking to this level.

He is a dedicated green himself, but wrote the book because of his perception that much of the claims as to environmental problems involved data which seemed to be suspect or wrong. Lomborg's approach was simply to look at the data cited as to major environmental issues and to examine such data to determine whether it in fact supports the claims made on its behalf.As Lomborg sifts through the data, patiently and objectively, his message is at once upbeat, because we have made great strides over the past three decades as he documents, and cautionary, because, as he shows, there is still much to be done.Lomborg has done us all a great service in winnowing the immense amount of data on environmental issues and in evaluating the claims made in the environmental dialogue, much of which unfortunately has been more in the nature of mere propaganda. The book is very readable, and gives the person looking for an objective view of our environmental problems and challenges an important piece of bedrock upon which to stand and evaluate the public policy debate."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"According to Lomborg, &quot;statistics offers us a way to see the world more clearly. Indeed, statistics is in many areas the only way we can make a scientifically sound description of the world.\\" Moreover, in this book he suggests, \\"My aim has been to give a description of the approaches to [environmental] problems, as the experts themselves have presented them in relevant books and journals, and to examine the different subject-areas from a perspective as allows us to evaluate their importance in the overall social prioritization.\\" Finally, Lomborg suggests, \\"The key idea is that we ought not to let the environmental organizations, business lobbyists or the media be alone in presenting truths and priorities. Rather, we should strive for a careful democratic check on the environmental debate, by knowing the real state of the world -- having knowledge of the most important facts and connections in the essential areas of the world. It is my hope that this book will contribute to such an understanding.\\"Lomborg organizes his material as follows. Part I: The Litany (as indicated in the Oxford University Press's Young Oxford Books: \\"The balance of nature is essential for life. Humans have upset that balance, stripping the land of its green cover, choking the air, and poisoning the seas.\\"); Part II: Human welfare (Lomborg concludes that, despite various serious problems, \\"unprecedented human prosperity\\" calls The Litany into question.); Part III: Can prosperity continue? (Lomborg asserts that \\"our society certainly seems to be sustainable\\" and thereby, again questions The Litany.); Part IV: Pollution: does it undercut prosperity? (According to Lomborg, \\"As far as the vast majority of significant areas are concerned, we have reduced pollution and increased environmental quality.\\"); Part V: Tomorrow's problems (Given the facts rather than subjective assumptions, Lomborg asserts, \\"if we want to leave a planet with the most possibilities for our descendants, in both the developing and developed world, it is imperative that we focus primarily on the economy and solving our problems in a global context rather than focusing -- in the IPCC [Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change] lingo -- on the environment in a regionalized context.\\"); and Part VI: The Real State of the World (\\"Thus, this is the very message of the book: children born today -- in both in the industrialized world and developing countries -- will live longer and be healthier, they will get more food, a better education, a higher standard of living, more leisure time and far more possibilities -- without the physical world being destroyed. And that is a beautiful world.\\") Lomborg also includes 173 \\"Figures\\" to support his conclusion (just quoted) concerning \\"the real state of the world.\\" The reader is also provided with 81 pages of Notes and a 70-page Bibliography.My hope is that this book will help to generate an extensive and rigorous debate of his essential assertion that \\"the state of the world\\" is not rapidly deteriorating nor has already deteriorated to a degree that seriously threatens the continuation of human life. Lomborg would be among the first to admit that there are serious environmental problems which must be solved or at least alleviated, and, that efforts to date have proven much less effective than others may insist. Those who oppose his position, and no doubt there are many who do, are challenged to provide sufficient evidence in support of \\"The Litany.\\""},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"I first became aware of tse late in 2001 and have read many parts of it. However, this will not be my review of this book, but rather will focus on a rather important and unique commentary that may not have been covered here. This 2002 commentary, entitled \`Gore Wars', is by Judge Alex Kozinski. Judge Kozinski sits on the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. This 27 page essay can be found by a Google search: \\"Alex Kozinski\\" \\"Gore Wars\\". In his introduction one learns that the \`Gore Wars' is in reality, a review of tse. I don't know if Kozinski chose to couch his essay in the spirit of Star Wars because so many of the claims and predictions of the environmental crowd come across as science fiction, but it is possible. Kozinski bemoans the long chronology of doomsday edicts that started with The Limits to Growth in the early \`70s. He calls this tome \\"a bunch of hooey.\\" He notes the most recent addition to this alarmist chronology is on global warming. At the end of his introduction Kozinski wondered whether anyone would ever write a book thoroughly analyzing the huge number of environmental scares and explaining how much was legitimate and how much was hype. That book is now here, namely tse by Bjrn Lomborg (BL), a Danish, environmental statistician.The first section in this commentary is entitled: I. The Phantom Menace. He notes that BL challenges \\"The Litany\\" -- namely the \\"list of hazards that environmental groups present as plaguing mankind.\\" After much analysis BL reaches \\"different conclusions from the environmentalists about the kind, degree, pace and method of change that we should pursue.\\" Kozinski continues \\"we should not be smugly satisfied with the current state of the world. \\"It suggests, rather, that we must be very careful about the type of changes we bring about, lest we undermine the very values that we seek to promote.\\" Global warming is surely the number one area that we need to be very careful on what we do.The second section in this commentary is entitled: II. The Attack of the Clones. Kozinski notes this part of tse is where BL examines the state of the world in those many areas that have been the subject of alarmist predictions by the Clones. Kozinski notes that BL \\"paints a picture of a world where human welfare is dramatically improving in just about every way one might measure it.\\" Yes, there are many ways things can be improved, but \\"all measurable trends point in a positive direction.\\"The third section in this commentary is entitled III. The Empire Strikes Back. It should surprise no one that the Clones despise tse and BL and have launched a furious, almost desperate, counter attack. Hundreds, possibly even into the thousands of Clones have challenged BL. Two examples of critiques are by E. O. Wilson and John Holden, but BL defended his work against these inputs. The volume of attacks, however, has been so large that some have compared this to the Gallileo inquisition.The fourth section in this commentary is entitled IV. Return of the Luddi. Kozinski noted that as \\"poverty recedes - - and it surely has over the course of human history, despite increases in population - - the problems we fear have tended to be ameliorated or disappear, not get worse.\\" He asks why \\"then do we hear so much bad news about the environment?\\" The answer to this question \\"is because environmental activists often lie, in big ways and small, in order to create the false impression that we are going from one environmental crisis to another.\\" And Lomborg brilliantly \\"demonstrates the ways in which professional environmentalists play fast and loose with the truth.\\" In short \\"Environmentalists manipulate data, so as to create a false picture about the state of the world.This is a very short summary of his review of tse. Go to Google and look up this essay."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"An excellent book. Not only is there a large amout of information in there, but it is well laid out for easy access.

Naturally, I have been looking forward to being cleared of the charges of scientific dishonesty. Therefore I have submitted my comments on many of the accusations to DCSD.Unfortunately the DCSD has made their decision without taking a position to the content of the complaints. The DCSD has ruled that \`it is not DCSD's remit to decide who is right in a contentious professional issue'. I find this ruling inexplicable and it means that there is still no ruling about the numerous complaints put forth in public. So I maintain that the complaints of the plaintiffs are unfounded.The main conclusion by DCSD finds that my book is \`clearly contrary to the standards of good scientific practice' because of systematically biased selection of data and arguments. But since the DCSD has neglected to take their position on the technical scientific disputes their conclusions are completely unfounded. The DCSD does not give a single example to demonstrate their claim of a biased choice of data and arguments. Consequently, I don't understand this ruling. It equals an accusation without defining the crime.The DCSD, however, refers to the criticism of my book put forth by 4 scientists in Scientific American. This is a one-year-old discussion, which I participated in at that time, e.g. by writing a 34-page response ([website]). But in spite of the fact that the DCSD received a copy of my response, they refer to none of my arguments. In fact the only thing that the DCSD does is to repeat the Scientific American arguments over 6 pages, while only allowing my arguments 1 line. This seems to reflect an extremely biased procedure. On top of that the DCSD has failed to evaluate the scientific points in dispute outlined in Scientific American article.My initial response when I read the conclusion of the DCSD was one of surprise and discomfort. But when reading through the complete ruling I found it to be:Inexplicable in its negligence to take a position on the complaints of the plaintiffsUndocumented by ruling the book to be systematically biased without documenting this with a single exampleBiased by its reference to only one side of the comprehensive discussion concerning my book (the plaintiffs side)"},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"I was quite surprised, initially, at the very strong negative responses by a number of early reviewers. It reminds me of my long years in Audubon and the Sierra Club - if you don't toe the party line and support their grab for more power(power = land), then you don't belong, and I left.This book is one of the few excellent examples of taking difficult to understand (as fed to us by the media) information and making it understandable to anyone at all with a modicum of intelligence. The points are well presented, the conclusions are fairly easy to draw..Still, look for underlying agendas, in even the seemingly most obvious books. He has one, but it's quite benign.In a nutshell, any book must be worth reading if it engenders the kind of mouth-foaming, hysterical reactions it has generated, even with this highly intelligent subset of readers.Well worth the cost."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"&quot;The Skeptical Environmentalist&quot; presents a plethora of arguments (nearly 3,000 footnotes and a 70 page bibliography) to confirm what saner environmentalists have always suspected: the environment and life on earth are improving! Bjorn Lomborg's critics would do well to begin reading his book. His critics sadly will look to his title and simply assume that because he is a professor of *statistics* that he could never make an intelligent argument on the environment. Yet, Lomborg's analysis is based on statistical evidence taken around from the world and hundreds of different sources. One suspects that even if Lomborg was the most honored environmental scientist on earth, his critics would still disparage him for no other reason than his conclusions are actually positive and not comprised of Doomsday scenarios.Even if we were to assume that Lomborg's optimism is nave, that some of his conclusions are incorrect, or his interpretation of statistics proves wrong, his often repeated point is the same: the environment certainly needs to be cared for, and we still have much work to do, but nonetheless the state of our air, water, food production, life expectancy, income, etc. have given us some reason to be proud. Surely this should be cause for SOME celebration! Lomborg should be praised and admired at minimum for not running with the herd and instead looking at facts and reality to come to his conclusions. In this way, &quot;The Skeptical Environmentalist&quot; is an excellent book, and definitely worth a read (or two). If environmentalists would only take his lead and present the status of the environment fully and completely, they would gain much more credibility.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"This is an extremely critical book on a range of environmental topics. The approach is to examine the statistical basis of many assertions and observations regarding environmental issues, and focuses on long-term trends. The outcome of this analysis is that indeed environmental problems and concerns have been remediated, and the future looks very good.The book's findings challenges the prevailing paradigms of European bureacrats and American environmentalists and shows that the sky isn't falling, nor is it necessary to panic from short term observations. The key lesson is to verify before asserting and hyping a problem, to look at long-term trends and to use rigorous and quantitative methods to evaluate the results.That doesn't mean there aren't problems, but the good news is they can be addressed and solved, and most have been solved.I had to downgrade the rating because of the awkward writing style of the author. Frankly speaking, I fault the editors at Cambridge Univesity Press for (1) failing to properly edit the wordy text and rambling writing style, and (2)failing to make many of the diagrams self-contained. At one time, I taught for nearly 24 years at the University of Illinois @ Urbana-Champaign, and if Lomborg's mansucript was turned in to me for a PhD (or Master's) dissertation, I would have required a massive rewrite before recommending acceptance and awarding the degree."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"Bjorn Lomborg makes some very good points about energy sources. His use of statistics is impressive, but in taking a big-picture viewpoint, he misses some critical details. One would believe, for example, that oil shale could be a saviour if conventional oil were to increase in price, whereas, most experts predict that oil shale is likely to be no more than a niche supply, at best. His discussion on oil is misleading, and he neglects to include important statistics on discoveries and exploration. There are complex debates about a wide range of issues in energy generation, and these are simply not mentioned. His conclusion that \\"energy is not running out\\" tends to skew the valuable information he provides. While he complains of \\"the litany\\", he could also be guilty of being too optimistic. In summary, a worthwhile read, but by no means the final word."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"....that Scientific American and The Star Chamber (Danish Committees on Scientific Dishonesty) piled on Lomborg with polemic statements and petty arguments against The Skeptical Environmentalist. I have a physics degree and currently study politics with a stastistical approach, and I appreciate the effort Lomborg put into his comprehensive survey so that we now have a dispassionate reference of the state of the environment.Read Lomborg's careful rebuttle to Scientific American on the web, and watch him debate a Berkeley professor of Ecological Studies on PBS's Uncommon Knowledge (where you can view 25 minutes on several topics -- just enter Lomborg's name in the web site serach engine). Lomborg doesn't simply win the debate but utterly smashes these scientists' feeble arguments, all while gracefully taking their cheap shots. To some extent the lopsidedness is funny, but deeper down it is disturbing. I still have respesct for science in general although worry when many prominent scientists have inexcusable lapses in reasoning. But then again, Lomborg has one clear advantage over many scientists he debates: He understands basic economics and benefit/cost analysis while too many bright scientists obviously do not.Long live science, but live longer the intelligent skeptics."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"The facts are laid out by the author in superb and conversational style are impressive and well researched. More frighting is the reviews that just \\"happen\\" to have appeared since Jan 7th. This Author is being attacked by people with the lowest of brows. The book itself abounds with fascinating material on almost every page. For instance, how wonderful were primitive societies, extolled by environmentalists who constantly carp about industrialism? About half the children died before age 5. Stone Age skeletons from Africa suggest that life expectancy was about 21 years. Politically-correct types have long viewed India as morally superior to the West, yet in India, as recently as 1906, life expectancy was just 25 years! Even later, in 1930, life expectancy in China was only 24. Communism was a catastrophe in which more than 30 million starved to death, but since economic liberalization, Chinese food production soared, and as Lomborg notes, about half has come from comparatively small private plots.These facts, along with cleaner water, less diseases, greater medicine, better understanding of the universe, greater comfort, and fuller lives which a modern industrial provides for man. Life is better, not worse, in every measureable catagory. The Chicken Littles can't STAND it!"},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"Just to take one issue out of many -- lets talk about forests. Part of the environmentalist &quot;litany&quot; that has led to so much deserved skepticism is that there is a devastating deforestation of the planet underway, with further obviously bad consequences for biodiversity.Yet Lomberg observes that the UN climate panel, a standard source for the relevant statistics, relied upon often by his critics in their own writings, indicates that there is no net deforestation, and that in all likelihood the Earth will have more forests in 2100 than it had in 1950.To this his critics often reply (as Lovejoy did, in the SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN panel, or lynch mob) that Lomberg is confusing &quot;tree plantations&quot; with real forests. We are deforesting because we are substituting phoney forests for the real thing.So they say. But that revised version of the litany doesn't work either. Lomberg antitipated it. In this book he writes, &quot;But for one thing it is not obvious that plantations reduce overall biodiversity. Certainly, they do have fewer species locally, but...they reduce the economic pressure on the natural forests. As a result, these forests are better shielded, and support higher biodiversity,&quot; etc. Unsurprisingly, he provides specific facts to back that up, too.In all, this feels to me like real science, whereas the critics, who often claim that they have the &quot;defend science&quot; from such outsiders as this, sound like dogmaticizing Popes."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"Our resources are running out. The population is ever growing, leaving less and less to eat. The air and the water are becoming ever more polluted. The planet's species are becoming extinct in vast numbers. The forests are disappearing. Fish stocks are collapsing and the coral reefs are dying. Fertile topsoil is disappearing. We are decimating the biosphere and will kill ourselves in the process.This is what Lomborg calls the Litany. The media has repeated the Litany so many times that we accept it as fact. The purpose of the Skeptical Environmentalist is to determine whether the Litany's predictions of environmental cataclysm are supported by the best available scientific data. Lomborg's conclusion is that the Litany is wrong, the environment is improving rather than declining.Lomborg's data comes from various governmental and inter-governmental agencies: The Environmental Protection Agency, The US Department of Agriculture, The Food and Drug Administration, The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, The Food and Agriculture Organization, The World Bank, The World Trade Organization, The International Monetary Fund, The Fish and Wildlife Service, The National Park Service, The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, The World Health Organization. The reports and figures produced by these agencies are the most comprehensive and authoritative available and it is to these sources that Lomborg turns to learn the \\"real state of the world.\\"This is not light reading. There are 173 figures, almost 3000 notes and hundreds of references. Turn to any random page in the Skeptical Environmentalist and you'll be confronted with a figure and half a dozen citations and references. For readers willing to make the effort this is a very rewarding book.Lomborg livens up the text with pithy quotes. On population, Lomborg cites a UN consultant: \\"It's not that people suddenly started breeding like rabbits; it's just that they stopped dying like flies.\\" On pollution, Lomborg cites economist Julian Simon that the purpose of washing dishes is not to make them clean but to reduce the dirt to an acceptable level. Regarding London's air pollution, Lomborg cites Percy Bysshe Shelley opinion that \\"Hell must be much like London.\\" I imagine that Shelley would be pleasantly surprised if he saw London today.For those of us in the Western World, the wonderful improvements in pollution, health, food production, energy efficiency, and environmental stewardship come as no surprise. Afterall, we're personally acquainted with the West's phenomenal prosperity. But what of the developing world? I found that Lomborg's book really shines by filling in the gaps in my own knowledge as to the \\"real state of the world\\" in developing and third-world nations. According to Lomborg, the developing world is following along the same path to prosperity that the West followed. The developing world is making the same gains in agricultural efficiency, food production, pollution reduction, educational and health improvements, and general widespread wealth. Not only are they making the same improvements, but they're making those improvements even faster than the West did since they have the West's technology and experience to draw from. The trends that Lomborg presents point to a future of ever increasing prosperity and health for humans and the environment alike. The Skeptical Environmentalist can truly make an optimist of any open-minded person.I was partially attracted to reading the Skeptical Environmentalist by the controversy surrounding it. The Skeptical Environmentalist has received grief from critics in the pages of Nature, Science and Scientific American. The charges against Lomborg were rather vitriolic. Scientific American ran eight pages of criticism, declined to allow Lomborg space for a full rebuttal, and threatened Lomborg with legal action when he posted Scientific American's criticism along with a rebuttal on his personal website. The Skeptical Environmentalist is replete with figures, references and citations. Can you guess how many figures, references and citations were provided by the Nature, Science, and Scientific American critics? In addition to being totally unsupported by references and facts, I found that the critics were also shrill and emotionally invested. If you're a fan of these magazines, as I am (usually), then you'll appreciate the opportunity that the Skeptical Environmentalist affords to judge just how even-handed and dispassionately rational such magazines really are."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"When Lomborg researched the material in Julian Simon's book on &quot;the State of Humanity&quot; he found that Simon was correct. To his immense credit, Lomborg suffered this shock of recognition with the grace of a statistician who had not invested his ego with the plausible uncertainties of the factually flexible environmental myths of the day, and with that emotional check in place he proceeded to write this book.The book contains over 2900 source references and a large bibliography. Lomborg methodically goes through each issue with a thoroughness one is unaccustomed to in today's world of hysterical word by word acceptance of any statement made by the various environmental groups, all of whom seem to have a Left leaning agenda. He believes in statistical checks of scientific pronouncements, but he has found to his chagrin that this does not play well with the socialistically inclined who masquerade their political beliefs behind a thin veil of environmental concern.He felt his findings would contribute to the debate, but instead found that the gut reaction of many environmental groups was one of complete denial. He thought that their initial refusal would give way to reflection based upon the massive amounts of supportive data he had assembled. He felt we could engage in a genuine reevaluation in our approach to the environment. Surprisingly, he found that many, even among his closest friends, had read only the critical commentaries on his work and had drawn the simple conclusion that he was wrong. They continued to believe that we should all go on comfortably believing in the various impending doomsday scenario's that are the popular fare. This suggested to Lomborg that doomsday-visions are very thoroughly anchored in our thinking. And, that is the message one ultimately has to take from this superb effort to set the environmental record straight.In that Lomborg is a politically Left, former member of Greenpeace he has the moral authority that Julian Simon has not been graced with. Perhaps this book will begin to instill a measure of sanity in the more rational among us. Perhaps even the media will be forced to acknowledge the error of their ways. What do you think?"},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"This book is well written, scientifically and statistically pretty sound (I've a PhD in engineering, and apply the models, statistics, and arguments Lomborg uses here on a daily basis), and is for a book with a lot of facts and nearly 2000 citations rhetorically witty, and very enjoyable to read. The negative reviews wouldn't be so strident if this book was not effective and interesting!. If you are an environmentalist, read this book to help you figure out the things that you (and I) should work on to actually improve the environment rather than wasting our time and resources on efforts that may have only marginal (or negative!) effects on things that aren't even problems!No book of this size, with this much information, could every be 100% correct but this type of even-handed, open-minded analysis and clearly laid out discussion (from a Liberal-left Scandanavian university professor, no less!) has been what's missing from the rather totalitarian environmental movement (think my statement is too strong? Read the book yourself, then check out some of the reviews here!).This book is not a slam-dunk refutation of all of us with an environmental sensitivity. It is certainly not scientifically, statistically, or rhetorically deficient. It IS an effective antidote to the extremely unscientific fear-mongering and outright lies made by some scientists and pseudo-authorities to effect popular activism and strict regulation that they favor. It does call into focus the &quot;Quo Vadis?&quot; of how some people and environmental groups increase their contributions and power base by inflaming fears (often wtih incorrect or stilted &quot;facts&quot;). It does bring up the correct point that, given that we are skeptical when business advocacy groups say &quot;everything is peachy&quot;, shouldn't we try to not accept so gullibly negative pronouncements by groups or experts whose revenue stream is enhanced by making folks believe that the world is going to hell? Paul Ehrlich, for example, earns fees by writing books predicting starvation, disaster, and environmental despoilation within five years. Seems to write a new one every five years!As a technically trained person who enjoys the outdoors and loves and wants to protect the environment, I am often frustrated by ignorance in popular media (and indeed, even in some science-trained friends). One can read, almost daily, some incorrect or impossible claim about the environment. This ignorance is illustrated by the story of a city council member who, upon hearing testimony that indicated that reduced emissions had lowered a stream's acidity from pH 9 to 8, insisted that &quot;we won't be satisfied until that pH is zero!&quot;*.The anecdote illustrates another of Professor Lomborg's points, which I think is this: if you don't accurately know the real problems, chances are that any actions you take to fix things may not have beneficial effects, and you will have wasted resources.I suggest that you read the book. If you disagree with points Lomborg makes, research these issues as thoroughly as he has and work as hard to understand and explain the proper point of view and conclusions from the facts and explicitly stated assumptions. If you do this, I believe that Lomborg will have succeeded in his overall goal: to insist on a science based, rational, and rigorously reasoned environmental viewpoint.Enjoy!*pH is a measure of acidity. pH 7 is neutral (your tears and saliva are both near 7). Higher numbers are alkaline, lower numbers are acidic. A solution of pH zero would be about as strong an acid as there is. Not good for fishies!"},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"After reading some of the savage, irrational reviews of this book, I felt like I had to respond. I am an environmentalist and have been active in the field academically since the 1980s. The longer I studied the situation, the more dismayed I became about the claims from the radical environmentalists. It seemed that science was being hijacked for political purposes.This book is a welcomed antidote. Lomborg uses the exact same data and statistics that are used by the Ehrlichs of the world to forecast continual doom and gloom. He shows how they, not him, as some of the reviewers claim, distort and manipulate the data. He presents all of the data and lets you make up your mind. My conclusion, one that I actually came to many years ago, was that the radical environmentalists lie. Ehrlich continually uses two years data out of many to distort and make his point. Lomborg presents it all.I agree with the reviewer from Franklin, TN, below. Radical environmentalism has become a religion, but it is one based on a lack of ethics. It is one in which the ends justify the means and any amount of lying is justified. Lomborg is questioning the basis of this religion and the hate and venom virtually explode from the negative reviews. The so-called peer reviews in Science were by the high priests of this religion. You expect balance?I have not addressed the reliability of the data Lomborg uses because it stands on its own. It is the same data used by the UN, EPA, and other organizations. It amuses me that the negative reviewers accuse him of distortion when he uses the same data their organizations use.I salute Lomborg for writing this book and exposing the distortions and lies of the radical environmentalists. It is about time someone did it. Maybe some of them will think for a change."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"This book is a sorry excuse for science or criticism based on science. While being skeptical about environmental issues is probably a good idea, this is not the book where you will find reasonable arguments on both sides. Lomborg picks his data to support predetermined conclusions, not the other way around. He often chooses to cite studies or reports that are over 30 years old while ignoring or downplaying more current information. The data he presents are often superficial and misleading. He makes no attempt to help the reader see the data in context - yet that is what rational skepticism is all about. In each chapter he concludes by saying nothing serious is really wrong. So if you want a book that says, &quot;Don't worry - be happy,&quot; lull yourself to sleep with this one. But if you want to take a look at why you might be skeptical about the claims of some environmentalists, then find a book by someone who can differentiate between being critical and being Pollyanna."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"I wanted to like this book. I really did. It sounded so good! What could be better than a clear-headed, non-ideological look at such a controversial set of issues?Unfortunately, that's not this book. I read it as a rather more easily swayed 17- or 18-year-old, and even then I knew it was seriously off. Now that I've had more experience with scientific research, it's even worse.There are already a number of reviews pointing out the book's problems, so I'll just add one more. His argument for doing nothing about global warming rests entirely on the postulate that it will have negative effects, but it'll be ok, because we'll all be richer!Yes, really. He thinks that everyone will be richer in the future. Um...no. This can't be true. THIS CANNOT BE TRUE. Even if everyone made a higher dollar(/other currency) amount of income, this wouldn't make everyone richer. If everyone's incomes increased proportionately, everyone would still have the same sized slice of the metaphorical pie, and wouldn't actually be able to buy more.This is basic common sense! Inflation can't make everyone richer! It can make some people comparatively better off, but only at the expense of others.That was where the book broke for me. Or maybe where my brain finally broke trying to make sense of it, I'm not sure."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"When I read this book, I considered its results deeply suspect, largely because of my own work in the quantitative analysis of environmental contaminants. Lomborg's ideological bias was obvious, and his pronouncements rang hollow. Save for those who reflexively view one form of extremism as a corrective to another--rather than as yet another form of error--Lomberg's arguments were very much less than compelling.And now, in January of 2003, a committee of Danish scientists has ruled that \\"The Skeptical Environmentalist\\" is \\"scientifically dishonest.\\"This decision was released after a six-month investigation of the book and its data by a committee working under the aegis of the Danish Research Agency. Their full decision reads:\\"Objectively speaking, the publication of the work under consideration is deemed to fall within the concept of scientific dishonesty. In view of the subjective requirements made in terms of intent or gross negligence, however, Bjorn Lomborg's publication cannot fall within the bounds of this characterization. Conversely, the publication is deemed clearly contrary to the standards of good scientific practice.\\"These scientists accuse Lomborg \\"of fabricating data, selectively and surreptitious discarding unwanted results, of the deliberately misleading use of statistical methods, consciously distorted interpretation of the conclusions, plagiarization of others' results or publication, and the deliberate misrepresentation of others' results.\\"I believe that this finding, though perhaps not the last word on the subject, casts the author and his book in a very poor light indeed. Fair-minded readers will certainly want to investigate these charges thoroughly before judging the book."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"Ordinarily I wouldn't bother to write a review of a self-evidently useful book, but the latest developments begin to surpass the Salem witch trials in interest. The very people criticized in Lomborg's book are engaged in a mass lynching of him for simply speaking the truth.Let's start at the beginning. This is by far the most useful reference on environmental issues and facts ever published. Lomborg has undertaken the Herculean task of locating, interpreting, and presenting the collective knowledge of the world on environmental issues. As a compendium of knowledge, The Skeptical Environmentalist is awesome and unequaled. To be sure, it is not uniformly excellent. For example, he devotes only a handful of pages to nuclear energy, incorrectly dismisses nuclear as unreasonably expensive and dangerous (relying on weak, tertiary sources), and unduly credits wind, solar, and other unconventional sources as likely to solve future energy problems. In fact, modern nuclear plant designs are immune from meltdown, cannot produce weapons-grade material, and are economical to build and operate. Anyone worried about global warming should be leading the fight to replace coal and oil-fired electrical power with nuclear power. Lomborg could also use some editing by a serious craftsman of the English language. But no book is perfect, and this one is hugely impressive.Lomborg also aims at exposing what he calls the \\"Litany\\" of environmentally and politically correct extremists who dominate most popular, mass media organs. He accomplishes this effectively, though that is no great achievement, since environmental hype is so widespread and patently erroneous. Anyone with the slightest acquaintance with environmental data knows that things are improving rapidly on almost all fronts, and have been improving for decades, in most of the world. Julian Symons (The Ultimate Resource) long ago discredited the Malthusians. The Limits to Growth was exposed as a nonsensical sham thirty years ago. Yet, the Malthusians persist. Donella Meadows, one of the authors of Limits, won a so-called Genius award from the MacArthur Foundation for her misuse of modeling and demonstrably false predictions. The predictions of Paul Ehrlich, and of Lester Brown of the Worldwatch Institute, have been proven equally idiotic. When I first read Lomborg, I found his exposure of the \\"Litany\\" almost boring--sort of like hunting fish in a barrel.But the \\"Litany\\" has struck back. A committee of Danish witch hunters, apparently Malthusians to the core, has taken charge of a Danish bureaucracy called \\"The Danish Committees on Scientific Dishonesty\\". Using Kangaroo Court techniques, they have found Lomborg guilty of scientific dishonesty because the environmental establishment disagrees with his views. Despite their inability to document a single important error of fact or inference in his massive work , they have condemned him as dishonest, based on the disagreement of the very people he criticizes and whom he demonstrates to hysterically misrepresent the scientific data. Their report, linked from his web site, condemns him for having criticized many environmental activists \\"of having misunderstood the basic concepts, of misrepresenting relevant facts, of understating uncertainties, of cherry-picking data, ... in a nutshell, at members of the research community being guilty of large-scale infractions of the researchers' code of conduct.\\" Well, yes. That is exactly what Lomborg criticizes them for, quite thoroughly and quite effectively. And that, if you read the witch hunter report cover to cover, is apparently enough to convict him of a science (sic) crime. In a particularly Orwellian twist, he is condemned because he himself is a scientist, not a mere journalist, and is hence not allowed to \\"a provocative debate-generating publication\\" (never mind that his critics engage in the very behavior for which he is condemned). Precious. I can hardly wait for the next edition of his book. Bjorn, be sure to reserve some special praise for the mentally challenged chairman of the witch hunter committee, one Hans Henrik Brykensholt, as you tote up your increased royalties.

Mankind's lot has actually improved in terms of practically every measurable indicator.\\"Members of the Danish Research Agency -- Denmark's equivalent of the National Academy of Sciences -- said Lomborg had \\"clearly acted at variance with good scientific practice\\" in light of his \\"one-sidedness in the choice of data and line of argument.\\" The panel, responsible for investigating allegations of scientific dishonesty, said Lomborg lacked \\"any special scientific expertise\\" in dealing with \\"the extraordinarily wide-ranging scientific topics\\" in his book.Lomborg's British publisher, Cambridge University Press, said it would not comment on the panel's finding. Sloane Federer, the publisher's New York marketing director, said in an interview that \\"we went through all the usual processes [of reviewing the material] in order for it to be printed.\\" He added, \\"We have no reason to doubt the process.\\"Publication of the English-language version of Lomborg's book in September 2001 was greeted with glowing media attention. The New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, the Economist and other publications praised the Danish professor, who dismissed many environmental concerns as \\"phantom problems created and perpetuated by a self-serving environmental movement.\\" A Washington Post book reviewer concluded that the book was \\"a magnificent achievement.\\"Corporate-sponsored groups and libertarian Washington think tanks praised and promoted the book during Lomborg's visit to the United States. But the book touched off a wave of criticism from environmental groups and academics. They said Lomborg had been highly selective in his use of research data and secondary source material to attack the work of dozens of respected and prize-winning scientists and broad-based, peer-reviewed scientific panels.Eleven distinguished scientists, including Thomas Eisner of Cornell University and Edward O. Wilson of Harvard, said in a letter to the publisher in July that \\"we rarely see this type of careless and manipulative scholarship in the undergraduates we teach.\\""},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"I am a full time college student. In one of my courses the class was told to pick a section in this book with the purpose of finding Lomborg's sources and stating if his sources agree with what he has stated or if Lomborg was miss quoting or taking information out of context. Through hours and hours of research I have found that Lomberg will site three or more sources for one statement and then only one may be obtainable or relivant to what he is refering to. For example, when discussing the life expectancy in sub-sahara Africa due to the AIDS epidemic he gave one valid source, two sources that could not be found, and one source that was a page from a report by the U.S. Census Bureau from 1999 about &quot;Family and NonFamily Households, by Race, Hispanic Origin, and type: 1980 to 1998&quot;. This is only one of many examples of errors and miss citations that my peers and I have found in his book. In a span of two pages and more than 18 citations I was only able to find 4 citations that were validated by the souces that he stated. Although I believe that there are many interesting points made by Lomborg I do not put much faith in his &quot;facts&quot; because you can not find many of his references. To that all I have to say is what is he trying to hide? If you are going to make statements about anything be able to back up those statements. If you are going to buy a book about the environment and the state of the world may I suggest Julian Simon's The State of Humanity. This book was very informative and all of the citations that I have checked make sense.

Ecologist Paul Ehrlich, author of The Population Bomb, predicted back then that by the year 2000 Japan would run out of food and an armada of famished Chinese would invade Russia. Needless to say, these predictions, like virtually all others made in that book, were wrong: although the number of humans on Earth has almost doubled since 1960, there are fewer hungry people now than there were four decades ago. Just eight percent of humankind now lives in nations with insufficient average calorie intakes; according to the U.N. Food and Agricultural Organization, that represents the lowest such percentage in human history. Moreover, recent U. N. reports suggest hallowed assumptions about the rates of world population growth appear to be highly questionable at the least.Has Mr. Ehrlich's credibility and stature been adversely affected by the fact that developments have utterly failed to support his theories and projections? Not in the slightest! He's still considered an \\"expert\\" in this area by many!That is why this is book is so important.Using a rigidly objective statistical approach Mr. Lomborg examines the factual basis for a number of popularly accepted \\"Environmental Truths\\" and reaches, in some but not all cases, very different conclusions about the validity of many of the assumptions accepted as gospel within the environmental community. Mr. Lomborgs aim, as the subtitle to the book suggests, is not simply to disprove and bludgeon the environmental community. It is, rather, to provide some objective analysis with the goal of fostering an environment wherein actual debate over reality based facts can occur that could lead to actual development of measures that could provide meaningful, cost effective solutions to real, as opposed to assumed, problems.In a world where the Paul Ehrlich's-and they are legion within the environmental community-can be so wrong, so often, for so long, the development of a skeptical view of the assumptions underlying much of what constitutes \\"environmental science\\" can only be a good thing. With The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World, Mr. Lomborg has skillfully used logic and reason to jumpstart that process.Whether you agree or disagree with Mr. Lomborg, this is a book anyone who is concerned with public environmental policy formation needs to read."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"In high school I sometimes said that I was against the environment. It was too easy to be for the environment, I reasoned. Who was going to keep these people honest?Enter Bjorn Lomborg and his 2001 book, the Skeptical Environmentalist. Lomborg argues that the world is not going down the tubes, but that instead things are getting better. He begins with a description of what he calls the Litany: a seemingly endless list of environmental concerns portrayed in the media and elsewhere, ranging from toxic pesticides to a Malthusian concern that we will eventually run out of food to feed an ever increasing population. He says that environmental organizations, researchers, and the media all have a vested interest in scaring the general public and making it disproportionately concerned about the state of the environment. He then moves on to what he considers the best method to measure the true state of the world: human welfare. According to Lomborg, not only are we in a state of unprecedented prosperity, but this prosperity will continue for as far out as our models project.One by one, Lomborg dismisses the most basic of environmental concerns. Remember those population projections that showed an exponential increase in the world's population beginning in the 20th century? Lomborg takes the UN's most recent projections and shows that the population will start to level out by about 2050. In fact, he states that the exponential increase is not due to sky-high fertility rates in developing countries, but rather to a dramatic increase in the life span of the average person in the developed world. Food shortages? Fear not, the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization predicts more food for more people for the foreseeable future. Energy? We will continue to refine our technology so that we do not run out of fossil fuels. Besides, solar power will be competitive by mid-century. Surely water must be a problem? Nope, the world has enough water for everyone. The problem is access to water, and Lomborg argues that we need to manage our water better to allow more equal distribution.Lomborg dedicates six chapters to pollution issues. Air pollution is diminishing, he shows. London, for example, has the cleanest air it has seen since monitoring began in the mid-16th century. The Exxon Valdez crash of 1989 was \\"a very unfortunate accident\\" that despoiled the coastline and killed a large number of animals in their natural habitat. Or did it? It killed 250,000 birds - precisely the same number that die every day in the U.S. by colliding with plate glass. According to Lomborg, \\"the [Prince William] sound has almost fully recovered or will do so within decades.\\" Phew.Discussing \\"tomorrow's problems\\", Lomborg maintains that the cancer risk of pesticides is blown out of proportion, that many fewer species are becoming extinct than most people think (between 4 and 100 species become extinct each year, he says, not the popular notion of 40,000 species per year), and that global warming is only partially caused by greenhouse gasses and in any case the models used to predict the extent of global warming aren't very good.The Skeptical Environmentalist does not argue that everything is for the best in this best of all possible worlds. In fact, Lomborg's main point is that we live in a world of limited resources and we should accurately inform ourselves in order best to allocate these resources. For example, if pesticides cause 20 cancer deaths per year in the U.S., should we thus ban pesticides? By doing so agriculture will be less productive, we will need to convert more land to farmland (leading to deforestation), and the price of fruits and vegetables will rise. A price rise will encourage consumers to eat less cancer-fighting fruits and vegetables. The result: an estimated 26,000 more people will die of cancer. Oh, and it will cost society $20 billion to boot. How about the Kyoto Protocol's proposal to cap greenhouse gasses? Not only will Kyoto have a minor effect on climate change (which isn't as big a deal as people make it out to be anyway, says Lomborg), it will cost society somewhere between $75-345 billion, money that could otherwise be spent on HIV screening, feeding the hungry, or reducing poverty in the developing world.It is in making such comparisons that Lomborg is at his best. Yes, there are legitimate environmental concerns, he agrees. But we need accurate information so that we can understand the consequences of any action we take, prioritize among environmental concerns, and make proper trade-offs between investing in the environment and, say, health care. On top of that, a richer society will have more money to spend on non-environmental and environmental concerns, so decreasing poverty and promoting growth in the third world should be our priorities.Though Lomborg makes an effort to distinguish between the progress of the developed and developing worlds, he tends to look at aggregate figures that ignore real local or individual concerns. Plus, just because we can save billions of dollars by not implementing a specific environmental program does not mean that the money will indeed be used for such a noble cause as to feed the hungry. Indeed, Lomborg himself points out that it would be inefficient to institute an environmental tax that would be earmarked for a specific purpose. His argument that the money can better be used elsewhere is therefore more theoretical than real.Lomborg seems to confuse causality at times. Many of the data sets he uses to measure environmental improvement only go back to the 1970's. Why? Because this is when environmental issues became a general concern for the U.S. and the Western world. This is when the media and environmental groups started using their \\"the sky is falling\\" approach to educate the public about the environment - and it worked. The EPA was established in 1970. The UN Environment Programme was established in 1972. These organizations were created, in part, in response to the public's concern for the environment. Lomborg dismisses this very notion on the second-to-last page of his book: \\"No, things have gone so well because we have worked hard to improve our situation.\\"Is Lomborg right in the end? I have no idea. But the Skeptical Environmentalist will help readers look at news stories about an environmental doomsday in a new light. And it will certainly give me plenty of ammunition for my next high school reunion."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"I urge those interested in this text to read not only the book, but also the published criticisms. Many of the leading scholarly criticisms (e.g., Nature, Science and SA), resulting letters to the editor, and Lomborg's responses, can be found on Lomborg.com and anti-lomborg.com. After reading the book, published reviews, letters and his responses, it became clear to me that Lomborg's text is so strong that the critics are left with no choice but to attack him personally and highlight small errors (which Lomborg admits and corrects on his site) which make no difference to his overall thesis. The scientific experts are panicked b/c Lomborg has shown them for what they are--just another group of special interest lobbyists constantly screaming &quot;disaster is near&quot; in an effort to get funding. In the old days these seemingly strong but in reality marginal criticisms would have gone unanswered, or taken years of publications to &quot;resolve.&quot; With the web, Lomborg can instantly describe the almost trivial nature of many such complaints. Simply an amazing book."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"I have been a professional environmental consultant for nearly 25 years and served many US agencies and private concerns. Its about time we question many of the myths about environmentalism and contradictions of environmentalists (though I believe the overall need for protection is there). However, I do not necessarily think Mr. Lomborg's The Skeptical Environmentalist always does this judicially.Contrary to other reviews you read here, this is not about left and right. (The more one makes this a polarizing political discussion, the more it will never be a honest examination.) It is about slugging it through detailed analyses of facts and near-facts. It is about arriving at the truth, as much as can be done. Here is where Lomborg goes halfway. In some circumstances, he has selectively analyzed topics to arrive at a conclusion that convieniently provides a more consistent overarching summary for his book - that things are A-OK. Specifically, he does this on the topics of population, energy, habitat depletion, species elimination, and global warming. These are a few too many mishandled topics to give him high marks for his efforts. I think Lomborg commits the same crime he accuses others of; that is of jumping to conclusions, not seeing the complete picture and wanting to package a conclusion that is nearly impossible to neatly package.Mr. Lomborg does bravely raise some very important issues and ideas. For this I applaud him and for this reason I recommend this book. There is a great need to be honest about ourselves in environmental policy. For too long, policy has been driven by the perception of doing good, excessive chemophobia, and too much of &quot;its someone else's responsibility&quot; (never the individual citizen and their lifestyle but more likely that of industry). The resultant policy is also often cumbersome and micro-managed approach that is implemented long after a sensible, sometimes more creative approach should have been initiated. I hope that this book encourages an honest self-examination by its readers."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"I figured this worthy of mention here since the DCSC's smear campaign against Lomborg is oft cited in the preceeding negative reviews of this book.From a press release today (12/17/03):&quot;The Danish Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation has today repudiated findings by the Danish Committees on Scientific Dishonesty (DSCD) that Bjrn Lomborg's book 'The Skeptical Environmentalist' was 'objectively dishonest' or 'clearly contrary to the standards of good scientific practice'.&quot;The Ministry, which is responsible for the DSCD, has today released a critical assessment of the Committee's January 6 ruling.

There has been so much progress than the Environmental Community has promoted doom and gloom to get attention for their causes.Obviously no one book has the answers for the magnitude of an issue as complex as the environment, but it is refreshing to get an alternate perspective. In some ways Lomborg's book is a self-fulfilling prophecy. By writing this book Lomborg had to know there was going to be an absolute backlash against it and that is precisely his point. Both sides discount any reasonable objective perspective about the environment; one side for painting too rosy of a picture and the other side for stating there is a problem at all.This is a great book to read if you love economics. There are tons of figures and graphs and extrapolations based on data.

For this, he has been condemned in the scientific press and accused of everything from ignorance to being a tool of the corporations- everything short of being an agent of the devil himself. Even New Scientist magazine, in comdemning his treatment, found it necessary to repeatedly characterize him as being &quot;out of his depth&quot;, and his ideas as &quot;illogical&quot; and &quot;by no means a towering intellect&quot;.All of which, I think, goes a long way in supporting the notion that far too much environmental policy is more about politics than science. Looking closely at data and trying to replicate findings- something that I was taught is at the heart of scientific inquiry- is not allowed.Now I think of myself as an environmentalist. I drive a tiny 4-cylinder car, I don't run two-stroke motors, I don't dump solvents into the drain, I compoost my lawn, I use organic methiods on my lawn and garden, I superinsulated my house and I try to use manual power wherever possible. I'm excited about the coming of hybrid vehicles in the mass market.But like Lomborg, I am skeptical of much of the data and theory being presented in support of policy. I know, for example, that a good part of global temperature fluctuation- though I would not claim all of it- it due to long-period, well documented, solar oscillations. And while research on the correlation has been published in Sweden, you won't find any scientist publishing that data in this country. It's just too risky to a career to go up against the politically popular models.Some of Lomborg's statements that have upset his opponants the most have been those that point out what should be obvious truths- like the fact that while pesticides may have toxic effects, they can also save lives by providing cheaper food.Remember the Alar flap? It wasn't that long ago that Hollywood mustered dozens of stars to protest against a relatively harmless antifungal agent called Alar. You may also remember those touching ads with Meryl Streep talking about this terrible poison.Well, Alar was only found to be carcinogenic when administered in a dose large enough to kill 90% of those receiving it- the equivalent of eating pounds of it, when only a few milligrams or micrograms were applied to apples. So now, Alar is banned, and instead we have apples with fungi producing aflatoxins- some of the most potent carcinogens known. All thanks to some concerned and grossly ignorant Hollywood stars repeating the facts they were told.If you're a comitted environmetalist- and you think you have all the facts- you owe it to yourself to read this book."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"I discovered this book accidentally and it's probably the best I've seen in years. It puts all environmental doomsday predictions under the microscope of statistics and reason. You either love it or hate it. But reading most of the reviews, people largely missed the entire point of the book.The book is not a right-wing, pro-capitalist conspiracy intended make the West feel less guilty. It does not trivialize environmental issues. It deals with the issues head-on, in an EVEN HANDED manner. It tries to locate the sources of the problems so we can better understand and deal with them. Doomsday predictions do more to hurt us than to help us because they lack focus.It suffers from its encyclopedic size. The monumental research effort is admirable, but the short chapters don't give each issue the required depth. My favorite example is the graph of population growth which plateaus at a comfy 12 billion people by 2200. He cites the graph with ease, \\"As we see from Figure 11 . . . .\\" Huh? Says who? By which method/model?OK, so this book starts the conversation but does not necessarily end it. However, DO buy it to gain new ways of thinking about heretofore unexamined \\"facts\\" published in the media. DO buy it to gain a toolset for reading the news more critically."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"This book was put in the map by the raving review \\"The Economist\\" wrote on this book in September 2001 and by a series of other reviews which appeared in leading media. I remember reading a favorable review in a British newspaper in early February 2002, which \\"tricked\\" me into buying it. On the other hand, I'm glad I've bought this book before reading the 32 pages which appeared in Scientific American in January 2002, which does all but destroy the conclusions Lomborg makes throughout his book. Now that I have it, I think both sides have a point.Bjorn Lomborg has every right to be skeptical about the work done by environmentalists. He is probably right that they cannot prove many of the claims they make in absolute terms. So far, that is healthy skepticism. However Lomborg does more than that: he violates that basic rules of skepticism as you find them written down in \\"Fads and fallacies in the name of science\\", the skeptic bible Martin Gardner wrote in 1952 and repeated since on many other skeptic books such as \\"How we know what isn't so\\" by Thomas Gilovich (1991). My biggest regret is that Lomborg draws his own conclusions about many subdomains of environmentalism without having any authority in that field. In doing that (already lacking scientific credibility), regrettably, he makes many of the mistakes he accuses other scientists of.As an unfortunate result, environmentalists can easily refute the entire book, by pointing at the many mistakes he makes and in his reply to Scientific American in the April 2002 he fails to give a decent reply to the criticism. As a result, this book will only help to polarize the \\"believers\\" and \\"non-believers\\". Those that claim that the disaster is near are fighting those that there is no problem. Of course, the reality is more \\"balanced\\". In their attacks or praise for the book, to some extent both parties are generalizing and distorting sections of the text. But that is something that Lomborg has helped to create. Critics will say that his main aim was to create controversy, because this results in more copies sold, a claim that is supported by the sales figures of this book.If you read the last chapter of the book, you'll note that Lomborg concludes that \\"in many areas and over time it will make good sense to invest even more in sound environmental management\\", but he adds: \\"we should prioritize\\". In the rest of this last chapter he shows his bias: he is a clear proponent of \\"progress\\" and dismisses the environmental fears as \\"pessimism\\". Because of this bias, he moves from showing that \\"research is incomplete or inconclusive\\" to calling it \\"wrong\\" or \\"litany\\". An example: he shows (correctly) that the claims that the earths reserves are disappearing fast are overstated, but, it's not because the claim is overstated, that the claim is wrong. The truth is that oil reserves are limited, only in reality we found that we can keep postponing to take this problem serious, because oil reserves will probably last for our lifetime. However, Lomborg says in his conclusion: \\"we will not run out of energy\\". That's not a \\"balanced view\\" anymore: that sentence, taken separately, fails to acknowledge the reality is that one day the earth will run out of oil, and in stead of wanting to mine the oil fields under Alaska, we'd better look for alternatives today (even if Lomborg acknowledges that we should increase non-fossil fuel research). Moreover contrary to what Lomborg claims, spending more on \\"alternative energy\\" in developed countries will create progress, new learning, new research and will reduce our dependence of oil, which is a misused weapon by the oil countries in the middle-east since the 1970s. Also, it's nave to think that if these developed countries would spend less on the environment that their savings would flow to more money for the developing world.This book would have been better served with a more balanced, and neutral conclusion, in which some of the sentences would have been written in a more \\"probabilistic\\" style, indicating \\"we cannot know for sure\\". As I've shown in my own book, and as many authors did, in case of conflict, this is the wrong approach when a conflict looms. Thus, for me Lomborg doesn't get my sympathy when he writes his own litany about being misunderstood in his reply to scientific Amaerican in April 2002. By not doing that carefully enough, Lomborg has given a powerful weapon to anti-environmentalists, even if he claims not be one of them. Moreover, as other review indicate, this ending chapter results in a completely dismissal of his book by environmentalists. Instead of bridging the gap between \\"progress\\" and \\"care for the environment\\", Lomborg only contributes in widening it."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"Firstly, I want to say that Bjorn Lomborg has been very unfairly vilified by mainstream scientists - from the shameful issue of Scientific American (\\"Science defends itself against The Skeptical Environmentalist\\" - as if science needed defending), to the attack against him by Nature and Science to his denouncement by the Danish Research Agency. Whatever one may think about the argument, one should not attack the person saying it (argumentum ad hominem). The attacks, chillingly, bring to mind the Inquisition and the thought police. Mainstream science has discredited itself in my eyes.Lomborg was courting controversy when he wrote this book and it is intended as a popular science book rather than a purely scholarly book. Having said that, there are some intriguing ideas, a few bad or incorrect arguments (which one would expect given the range and scope of what is discussed), and quite a few salient points regarding the case for environmentalism. The premise of the book is that fundamentally, we are healthier, our children are healthier, our environment cleaner than it ever has been and Lomborg is quite convincing.His arguments are a healthy antidote to environmental doomsayers and, although I profess no greater understanding of geophysics or biology beyond that of a well-informed layman, I do know something about statistics and about risk. This is where Lomborg is strongest and his observations most relevant. Sometimes (rarely) he is as guilty of misrepresentation as the people he attacks but then these lapses are overshadowed by the majority of the book that is accurate, well researched, and well within the realm of science. Readers should always be critical of what they read and the so one should be critical of this book but even with the hat of a skeptic, \\"The Skeptical Environmentalist\\" does make the grade.One should remember that many pro-environmentalist books in the past were guilty of far more misrepresentations and inaccuracies and contained predictions that in retrospect are more comical than anything else. Sadly, the scientific establishment has never questioned books that stick to the environmentalist orthodoxy, which makes attacks against \\"The Skeptical Environmentalist\\" all the more hypocritical.While not the nail in the coffin of environmentalism that the right would like, it does produce enough convincing material to at least question what is being said in the media, the mainstream and by environmental propagandists. Maybe our world is not in such bad shape, maybe we are not going down the road to extinction.Sadly, many miss the point of the book and focus on attaking the occasional lapses (which are truly few in number). Scientists must be skeptics and must always question orthodoxy. This is the point of the book and this is why one should read it."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"The Birkenstock wearing crowd should get nervous. It's time to buy some nice shoes and forego the toe cheese exhibition.Finally a book - and one written by an environmentalist - that expose the hype that sorrounds important environmenatl problems and exposes those environmentalists who dedicate themselves to generating panic and concealing the truth. It seems the only opinion people are allowed to entertain about the world is that the world is on a fast road to disaster. This gloomy prediction is sheepishly pronounced all over the planet in all media. Voices of sanity are silenced. The author is (or was) a card carrying member of Geenpeace - is generally a 'leftist'- and he sets out to evaluate the world's leading environmental pressure groups and the evidence they provide. In the process he finds that the evidence is falsified and skewed to support the gloomy view and that scientific evidence, in fact, suggests that on all or most indicators the world has improved in the last decades. The evidence is well examined and documented. he finds fault with the Kyoto agreement and entertains serious doubts about global warming and de-forestation statistics (Lomborg should know as a professor of statistics)."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"This book is a an excellent testament to the adage &quot;a little knowledge can be dangerous&quot;. Yes, it's true that some evironmental and social activists have made some bold claims that turn out to be unsupported by data. Lomborg does a fine job of showing us how baseless some of the more outlandish of these claims are (e.g. we are headed for a world food shortage - not true). However, the book's weakness is that Lomborg himself ends up drawing equally erroneous conclusions to prove HIS point.The book is loaded with data, much of it very interesting and supportive of the author's point of view. However, it is also full of straw man arguments and other errors of logic too numerous to list (I'll try to list a few).For example, Lomborg's analysis of income disparity is analogous to the fallacy that you can't drown in a stream averaging 3 feet deep. By comparing the average wealth of whole countries and stating that differences are not severe, he misses the point that the wealth distribution within countries is often hugely unbalanced, and getting worse.Lomborg shows us data on DDT, among other pollutants, and points out, correctly, that the contamination levels have been dropping. Should we be surprised by this? DDT has been banned for years. Of course DDT levels should be dropping. I'm more curious about the stuff we are STILL dumping into our rivers. I'm also curious about the rising levels of bacteria in surface water, which Lomborg brushes off saying &quot;we could solve that if we wanted to&quot;.In his discussion on deforestation, Lomborg makes no reference to declining old growth or wilderness areas. At least in the USA, these are huge issues, perhaps even the biggest issues of all (as regards deforestation). Roadless wilderness and old growth giants are two examples of priceless treasures that are quickly disappearing, but nowhere in the book are these issues discussed. Yet Lomborg's overall conclusion is that there is no problem at all with deforestation.I could go on and on. The discussion of cancer risks is grossly oversimplified (and in my opinion misleading), as is the analysis of species extinction. His discussion of energy and future fuel sources does not jive with other works I have read on the subject. Etc. Etc.Having read some other reviews, I see that some folks have taken issue with Lomborg's data being inaccurate. As a layman I can't comment on that. However, in my opinion this book goes a little too far in trying to paint a rosy picture of the world. Ironically, Lomborg has fallen into the same trap as the environmentalist extremists he was seeking to discredit - selectively presenting data to further your own point of view.In conclusion, I will make a two-sided recommendation. If you really believe the claims that the Worldwatch Institute makes when it says we are headed for widespread famine, blackouts, and flooding (due to global warming), you had better read this book! These things are just not true. However, if you're reasonably savvy about the world and just want an opinion on mainstream environmental stewardship, I think this book will disappoint you."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"Sure, it is not totally free from error (as with all texts on this subject matter), but it does make an effort to present the other side of a commonly one-sided equation."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"Yes, I have read the entire book. It's about time someone has emerged to tell the tree huggers to be more thorough in their work. What is already bad science is abused further by pontificators who will say virtually anything to exite the media."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"Every now and then a treatise comes along that so egregiously distorts the science it is trying to present and analyze and misuses statistics in the guise of a careful analysis that it ends up simply being an embarassment to itself and its publisher. Such is the case with Lomborg's book. With its 515 pages and nearly 3,000 endnotes, it would appear to be an example of careful scholarship. Unfortunately, the book is full of analytical errors, misstatements and distorted quotations. An example of this can be found in his chapter on biodiversity, in which Lomborg attempts to argue that it is impossible to establish extinction rates by \`\`quoting'' a Scientific American article by P. A. Colinvaux. Lomborg writes, \`\`Colinvaux admits in Scientific American that the rate is 'incalculable'. What Colinvaux actually wrote is, \`\`As human beings lay waste to massive tracts of vegetation, an incalculable and unprecendented number of species are rapidly becoming extinct.'' This kind of irresponsible, out-of-context quotation could have been avoided had the book been properly peer-reviewed. However, like much of the literature cited by Lomborg, the book apparently was not peer-reviewed and, therefore, stands as an example of how uninformed writing can be disguised as a scholarly work. Lomborg's arguments about the state of the environment could potentially lead to dangerous complacency that may have severe repercussions in the years to come. As a mathematician and scientist interested in environmental issues, I rely heavily on the peer reviewed literature as a source of information and strongly encourage prospective readers of this book to do the same. I would also encourage them to read the reviews of Lomborg's book recently published in the January, 2002 issue of Scientific American."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"I've been methodically checking Lomborg's sources. So far I've spent around 30 hours doing this, checking over 200 that looked suspicious to me (my results are summarized here: http://www.geocities.com/jefferson108/blomborg ). (In case you're wondering why I'm motivated to do this investigation: I'm writing a book about the problem of lies in print and I've decided to devote a whole chapter to this author.)PLEASE note: I'm very careful when making accusations. I fully realize people can write false things unintentionally. I've given Lomborg as much benefit of the doubt as I can muster. However, the pattern that has emerged is very damning. I've so far found around 50 mismatches between his cited source and what he says about the source, and 42 distinctly favor the conclusion Lomborg wants readers to accept, and none disfavor him. Therefore (as a statistical claim using a binomial distribution) at least 80% are surely intentional.I want evidence when I hear accusations of lying, and I assume all readers of this review want that too, so I'll devote the remainder of this review to listing examples:--on pages 22-23 Lomborg complains about the higher estimates for TB deaths of Cornell researcher David Pimentel's (2.5, 3.0, and 3.5 million, for, respectively 1990,1995, and 2000), citing his own much lower number (1.699 million) from a 2000 WHO World Health Report (downloadable from www.who.int ). Lomborg here has hid Pimentel's source: WHO -- their 1996 World Health Report! Notice his wording, which explicitly and falsely claims that the first two numbers are Pimentel's. The two author's numbers don't conflict even the tiniest bit! Lomborg avoids telling readers that WHO generates two different, perfectly consistent TB estimates: CONFIRMED TB deaths and TOTAL TB deaths, which explains both why Pimentel's is much higher (it afflicts the worlds poorest, who often die without being seen by an MD) and has only 2 digits of precision, whereas Lomborg's has 4.--page 13. Lomborg says: \\"Reference is made...\\", telling readers that WI (Worldwatch Institute) misquoted a FAO book. It's totally false. WI didn't cite any source for the number (intended to imply, I'm sure: \\"It's our own estimate\\"). Check his source for yourself please if you doubt this (or anything else I've said). The source (WI's 1998 State of the World) can be found in university libraries, or downloaded from the www.worldwatch.org site.--on page 25 Lomborg puts a crazy remark supposedly about tobacco smoke into David Pimentel's mouth. But the actual words preceding the words Lomborg has quoted don't say anything about tobacco: \\"Environmental diseases are attributed especially to organic and chemical pollutants, including...\\" See the word \\"tobacco\\" anywhere here? Check the web page he cites and see for yourself if you doubt this. Other sites have duplicated the same page, so the discrepancy isn't because Cornell has updated the page.--note 248 (page 359) misquotes Al Gore severely. Look at the source page and you will see that Gore compared persons who don't recognize the dangers of the environmental problems he describes not to Nazism, but to OPPONENTS of Nazism: one's who, unlike Churchill, failed to recognize the seriousness of the threat posed by the Nazis.--note 446. The page of the WI 1997 State of the World that Lomborg cites says NOTHING faintly resembling what he says is there.--figure 3: the WI source he cites (a book) has NO DATA in it at all about fertilizer use. The text associated with this figure says Brown has failed to describe the difference between nations (developing vs wealthier) in their trends of fertilizer use, in a way that \\"fails to consider what's important\\" and also deceives Brown's readers. But Brown HAS, on page 16 of the WI 1998 State of the World.I could go on and on listing out the examples I've found.Lastly, I want to mention that I like MANY things about this book. As a source of \\"nuggets\\" of many interesting and useful bits of knowledge it surpasses almost any other book I'm familar with, and I believe that many of his complaints about environmentalists and their organizations are sound. I like the book for these reasons. However, I estimate that there are at least 100 significant, intentional, defamatory (most are about persons/organizations) false claims in this book. Be VERY careful what you decide to trust in it without checking."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"Bjorn Lomborg, a mild-mannered professor of statistics at the University of Aarhus in Denmark, has got the green lobby running scared. Since the Danish version of \\"The Skeptical Environmentalist\\" was published in 1998, an international smear campaign has been mounted against him.All he said was that most of the \\"Litany\\" fails to withstand scrutiny under statistical analysis. The Litany is the green creed that the world is going to hell in a handbasket, that soon we will not have enough food or fuel or space, that we are busy killing off most of the other animals and plants, that we are sickening ourselves with pesticides and pollution, and that, to top it all off, we are cooking the planet.Problems face us, Lomborg admits, but the answer is not to abandon wealth but to make the developing world -- where most of these problems are most acute -- as rich as the developed world.Others, like Peter Huber in 'Hard Green.' have said the same, but they were not rewarded with an intercontinental counterattack.The reason, presumably, is that Lomborg and his 10 students have backed up their version of the past and vision of the future much more capably than previous critics of greenness.There can be no question that Lomborg is right about the past. His hundreds of graphs -- all based on the common fund of data from the United Nations and similar open sources -- prove that, for example, the number of poor people in the world with access to safe drinking water has grown from 30 percent to 80 percent since 1970. \\"Not good enough,\\" Lomborg says, but clearly whatever we have been doing was on the right track.\\"Poverty and not the environment is the primary limitation for solutions to our problems,\\" he writes, which is no different from Huber's remark that a starving peasant hunched over a dung fire is not green, just poor. Who could argue with that?Lots of people. The counterattack has taken a weird form. First, the critics say Lomborg is lambasting the environmental cassandras of 30 years ago, but that those statements no longer represent green thinking. The critics seem not to understand that this complaint concedes that we shouldn't have been listening to the Chicken Littles of a generation ago.Be that as it may, the complaint is false. As Lomborg says, thanks to the Internet he was able to update his book with statements published as recently as a few months before the 2001 publication date of the English edition.And his text proves it. It turns out, in fact, that the preposterous statements made by the likes of Paul Ehrlich and Lester Brown in 1970 -- predictions that, for example, the population of the United States would have been reduced by famine to 22.5 million by now --are still being made by new Chicken Littles. (The old ones haven't shut up, either.)Pick just about anything you have been told to worry about in the last decade, and you will find the situation graphed in \\"The Skeptical Environmentalist.\\"Epidemic of breast cancer? Adjusted for age, down 18 percent. Mass extinctions, running at 40,000 species per year? Actual rate unknown but at least a thousand times slower. Destruction of the rainforest? The biggest one, in Brazil, is still 86 percent intact.However, numbers don't tell the whole story. At current rates of reduction, the Brazilian forest will be much smaller within a generation or two. And, unlike temperate forests, which in North America have been cut down in some places three times and today fool people into thinking they are primeval, rain forests, once destroyed, tend to lose their soils and not to come back -- or not come back the way they were. (I live in a rain forest; this is happening in my backyard.)On the other hand, Lomborg's finding that there is plenty of iron ore left (contra the Litany) is actually too pessimistic. The United States made 100 million tons of steel a year for 100 years -- 10 billion tons. Some is tied up in the Brooklyn Bridge, but there is plenty to recycle. The need for mining more ore is very small, and Lomborg's estimates of how many years' supply remain are too small by a huge factor.Lomborg says if you don't understand what the problems are, you won't know how to deploy scarce resources to fix them. In particular, the precautionary principle, which says that if you are not absolutely certain you will not cause harm, you must do nothing, will prevent human progress.Lomborg's assault against the precautionary principle is subtle, but he is not shy about the conclusion: \\"A lack of prioritization, backed by however many good intentions, can in the final analysis result in the statistical murder of thousands of people.\\"Most of the book is easier to follow than the argument against the precautionary principle. \\"Many of our deeply engrained beliefs from the Litany are not supported by the facts,\\" writes Lomborg, and the numbers back him up.This will not come as news to those who have read such analyses as Aaron Wildavsky's \\"But Is It True?\\" That was the first substantial critique for non-scientists of green doomsaying. Lomborg raises the critique to new levels, and the screams of his targets show that his arrows are hitting them where they live."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"I enjoyed this, however the basic premise of this book is in serious error. The real state of the world is far from being openly known, even in countries such as Mexico there are extremely well hidden sites and actions of destruction and pollution, that goes for a large part of the world. I am a traveler, I see the inside as I live in places for at least a year at a time. In my research, not one of these sites has ever been reported, I know uncounted permanantly polluted sites exist that do have world effect. This and other occurances of destruction are in fact in overwhelming numbers that would shock every American. I will give two examples, in a country that has excess reserves of gasoline, cannot sell it by accounting deadline dates, trucks the fuel by tanker to desert sites and dumps millions of gallons monthly. Another country, Mexico has a similar problem, in 1992 the top authorities of Guadalajara had excess gasoline showing as sold. The government auditors informed them they were to be audited in one week. They took every tanker they had and filled them will gas and dumped the millions of gallons in the cities storm drains, the gas ignited the next day blowing the streets out and killed thousands. It was covered up and whitewashed that this had been going on for more than forty years. So much more takes place worldwide on much grander scales. This is the grand error, we do not get information of what really takes place outside the USA. This book bases it's research on governmental statistics, that is something none of us can rely on as so much is whitewashed.This is definitely a good book outside of it's misnomer of factual stats. It covers a great deal more than pollution. Our technology, quality of living, education, and desire for a direction of survival. I do recommend buying it as it is a serious effort in the right direction of what we all fundamentally need to understand.I recommend a book which offers solutions that is similar in its effort, takes a broad approach in a realistic account, covers the acts of terrorism, its general worldwide effects and change, cultural difference showing deaf ears, pollution, economic policies, war, calculates a threshold, or a point of no return, SB 1 or God By Karl Mark Maddox, very good."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"There are a great number of apparently deliberate (i.e., when pointed out to him, he made no effort to correct them) mistakes in Lomborg's books and the film \\"documentary\\" about him called \\"Cool It.\\" The subject of this film is Bjrn Lomborg, yet he controlled the final cut of this film.

I think it is hard for people in the business itself (scientists, paid leaders of anti-property-rights groups, reporters, etc) to keep an open mind when their career path is on the line. Scientists are supposed to be unbiased in observation and experimentation, but that doesn't always happen. Examples: Recent Lynx-hair hoax in WA state, \\"cooling in Antartica happening despite global warming\\" (I quote straight from the news!), actual habitat of the NW spotted owl.Mr. Lomborg's book is very readable, and interesting enough to where I read it over a two-day weekend. It may be a subject for a different book, but I think the author should have spent more time on the motives of the folks who perpetuate myths and/or complete lies in order to a) have fun worrying people who don't have the time or brain-power to get into the details and b) keep the career very lucrative.However, he lays the facts out fairly cleary, and it would take many books to fully explain the science and politics behind the many different facets of environmental preservation."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"Lomborg has done us all an enormous service by providing perspective on the real state of the environment.

Many researchers, who are constantly seeking more funding, slant their \\"scentific\\" findings to hype the need for more studies.It is therefore refreshing to find out from Lomborg that our world is actually in better shape than it was 200 years ago!

Despite what you might think based on a vindictive and amateurish slam by the clearly biased and not particularly scientific Danish Committees on Scientific Dishonesty (the DCSD which looks more than anything like George Orwell's &quot;Ministry of Truth&quot;), Lomborg makes his argument from the facts provided by his detractors.The DCSD built most of its case on a special section in the January 2002 'Scientific American' titled, &quot;Science Defends Itself Against 'The Sketpical Environmentalist.'&quot; This section was an embarrassment to the scientific community in general and to 'Scientific American' specifically.Quoting from a review of the book and DCSD's position in TechCentralStation, &quot;He (Lombard) had set out to prove that the rosy scenarios promoted by the late University of Maryland scholar Julian Simon were wrong. But he found they were right, and actually changed his mind.&quot;And, Lomborg &quot;is modest, reasonable and cheerful. He is just a statistician, after all. He claims to be nothing more. All he wants is fairness. To have a civil debate over his ideas, his facts, his point of view. But the other side, with an intellectual brutality and singlemindedness that recalls Leninism, can't stand such an approach. Free speech is what the Ministry of Truth hates.&quot;It isn't a riveting book. But the war being waged against it alone makes it worth looking into.

Is overpopulation endangering the world's economies? Are we losing forests and fish? Are we all in danger from acid rain, water pollution, chemicals, global warming, air pollution?That is part of 'the Litany,' fears that Bjorn Lomborg, author of The Skeptical Environmentalist, says are based on faulty information. The heavily-documented, best-selling book challenges the basic assumptions, methods and mathmatical models which underlie much of the gloom and doom we read today.He thoroughly punctures most environmentalist groups' major theories, which they often present as facts, or future horrifying scenarios. A statistics professor at the University of Aarhus in Denmark, he didn't believe the optimism of the late economist Julian Simon who analyzed environmental trends.Lomborg, a self-described \\"old left-wing Greenpeace member\\" and concerned environmentalist, set out to challenge Simon's view of the future. But, he found out Simon was right.With the scorn and anger of one betrayed, Lomborg criticizes some famous environmental spokesmen, whom he believes misuse data to deceive the public into supporting their causes. And he shows news stories taking the worst of the predictions and expanding on them. He accepts that man-made global warming is real, but shows that forecasts of drastic climate change \\"are not plausible.\\"\\"Well, what's so wrong with that?\\" some might say. \\"We have to get people's attention. If it saves one fish, it's worth it.\\"Lomborg disagrees and has a compelling argument about what is wrong with that attitude.\\"The constant repetition of the Litany and the often heard environmental exaggerations [have] serious consequences,\\" he writes. \\"It makes us scared and it makes us more likely to spend our resources and attention solving phantom problems while ignoring real and pressing (possibly non-environmental) issues.\\"We have an example of that from Oregon, in this year of grief and bankruptcy which followed the government's decision to shut off irrigation water in the Klamath Basin. Turns out the shutoff was unnecessary.In a just-released report, a National Academy of Sciences review committee concluded, \\"there is presently no sound scientific basis for\\" cutting off the water. The committee found the government's underlying scientific assumptions and methodology lacking.No one in Klamath Falls was surprised, just as they weren't surprised when they heard charges that government workers faked lynx presence in Washington forests.Lomborg wouldn't have been surprised either. A problem he notes among those pushing the Litany is that they pick and choose figures they want to use, selecting for example, the two or three downward trending years in a decades long upward trend. Examples are world grain yields and world exports of goods.The 'crises' that have enriched so many scientists and researchers living on government and foundation grants disappear under his analysis. He suggests that the only reasonable way to create accurate public perceptions is to use worldwide figures to account for both positive and negative trends for any given issue.\\"Whether we are talking about food, raw materials or energy, no shortages of resources seem to be forthcoming, no serious problems for the continued growth of production and welfare are in the offing,\\" Lomborg writes.Now, don't you feel better?"},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"Probably the most important book ever to be written on the environment, this is a tour de force, a brilliant work, and a masterpiece of careful analysis.

Much to his surprise, and somewhat reluctantly at first, he discovered just the opposite. Lomborg exposes and criticizes the ways in which many environmental organizations make biased and misleading use of the scientific evidence to suit their own political agendas. He sets the record straight by tracking down and exposing the fabricated claims made by often quoted environmental groups. He also backs his own conclusions with solid scientific evidence, including extensive references."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"In this book Mr. Lomburg proves to have a preoccupation with reality, and that's not a bad thing. It is very refreshing to find someone who can represent environmental science on a factual instead of fictional standing. It has been frightening to watch the art of soothsaying elevated to the height of an actual science and then this so-called \\"science\\" used as a means to achieve political power. As Stephen Schweider (global \\"cooling\\" scare/scam) has said, \\"Each of us (greens) has to decide the right balance between being effective and being honest\\". This statement alone shows how the general public's gullibility is no longer in question.The peer review process so often mentioned is no more than bad science \\"back patting\\". I have read the reviews in the so-called reputable publications and have found very little resembling objective science rebuffs. Instead they have resorted to emotional tantrums and irrational outbursts, which is typical of those not having a leg to stand on. One good thing did come out of reading these reviews though... it provides me with a very good guideline of what publications not to rely on for scientific insight.With this book Mr. Lomburg successfully weakened the cartoon, fear mongering, foundation the greens have been building for so long.

You have already figured out that the environmental lobby is a very poor source of information about the true state of the earth. You already know that the scientists quoted by the press gomers are motivated by a desire for more research funds, rather than a desire to spread the truth, and that those who disagree with them remain silent for fear of vilification and ostracization by those of their peers who fear the loss of those funds. Unlike the Green Party pinheads, you already know that all actions have consequences, and that the only intelligent way of deciding on a course of action is to weigh the advantages and disadvantages of any interventions. So what can you learn from this book? The answer is plenty. First, there is a danger of dismissing all warnings about a subject after being exposed to a succession of false warnings by the usual sources of these warnings. Second, the state of the world is a very important subject, despite the fact that there are so many charlatans peddling their snake oil in the area. This book helps you to pull the signal out of all the noise. Third, it returns some much-needed rationality to the debate about the environment. Finally, it puts the human desires regarding the environment in the context of all other human desires, and acknowledges that not all human desires can be fulfilled.Those gullible people who need to believe every report that the sky is falling will not like this book, however, nor will those who are in the business of scaremongering.

Given the space limitation, I can only highlight the more appalling errors in the polemic; the book is literally full of straw men, egregious errors in interpretation, and a selective inclusion and understanding of the empirical data.What undermines TSE is the fact that provides the reader with only half of a very complex story; we are informed that people are living longer, that food production per capita is still increasing, that the Asian tiger economies are catching up with the developed nations, and that many (though not all) forms of pollution are in decline. In perspective, this is good news, but what is missing from Lomborg's opus is the second, and perhaps more important part of the story.TSE completely disregards the link between environmental indicators and human welfare indices and the underlying condition of ecological systems; these systems represent the infrastructure which makes consumption possible and upon which the prosperity of all nation states depends. In TSE, there is nothing on wetland loss and eutrophication, fraying food webs, the loss of coral reefs and a general transformation of marine ecosystems worldwide, the effects of invasive species on communities and ecosystem functioning etc. In evaluating the condition of the biosphere, scientists have known for some time that indices of human welfare must be weighed against the underlying conditon of our ecological life support systems. Yet, in TSE, Lomborg dismisses these systems entirely, and claims to write \\"from a human perspective\\", as if our fate is somehow independent from the health of the biosphere. Such a fatal omission allows him to dispense with thousands of peer-reviewed studies published in the past 10 years which examine in detail such ongoing processes as climate change, habitat fragmentation, the disruption of biogeochemical and hydrological cycles, and extinction as they affect the structure, function and ultimately health of communties and ecosystems.Furthermore, if Lomborg is the \\"hard-headed skeptic\\" he claims to be, he would have dedicated as much of his book debunking the veritable tsunami of anti-environmental distortions as he does countering distortions from environmentalists and environmental organizations. In his chapter on biodiversity, for example, which he admittedly bases on a chapter in a book by Julian Simon, Lomborg selectively omits a wealth of studies by scientists like Brooks, Balmford, Pimm, Olsen, Woodruff and others which are more recent than the sources he uses but provide a different perspective. Why would an allegedly \\"objective\\" writer omit such research from his thesis? By intentionally avoiding these important studies, it seems obvious that Lomborg is not seeking the \\"truth\\" (an elusive concept in science anyway, but one he harps on about throughout the book) but instead these omissions reflect Lomborg's own agenda.I also found it rather amusing that a statistician can state that \\"hidden value judgments should not cloud our understanding of environmental problems\\", a correct statement and one I agree with, and then go on to fill the pages of TSE with one hidden value judgment after another. \\"The per capita amount of garbage produced has ONLY increased 45% since 1966\\". \\"We have ONLY lost 30% of the world's forests\\". \\"ONLY 14% of Amazon forests have been lost\\". Similarly, on water resources, hidden value judgments crop up over and over again. It is as if these percentages do not constitute a problem, which one cannot correctly estimate on the basis of a simple overview. Furthermore, Lomborg is long on quantitative data but short on the equally important area of qualitative evaluation. Which forests are being lost? What kind of biomes do they constitute? Where are they located? What kind of forest is replacing them, and so on and so forth.For my part, and in spite of the time expended, it is imperative that scientists continue to counter the nonsense contained in books like TSE which attempt to explain away complex problems. I fear that, so long as powerful conservative forces wish to disseminate a \\"business-as-usual\\" message, that there will be \\"new Lomborg's\\" emerging from the background long after TSE has been consigned to the scrap heap, but at least this episode has evoked a strong scientific response, and is making us better prepared."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"A must-read for those interested in environmental issues. And for parents who generally have the &quot;Earth Day&quot; nonsense fed to them by well-meaning teachers eager to teach &quot;compassion for the earth.&quot; The conclusion builds as you read, and you realize you already KNEW this. Of course! Human's are using science to understand more, do more with less, and handle waste more effectively. The &quot;environmental&quot; argument of resource-depletion and &quot;man's dirty footprint on the earth&quot; is an uneducated and reactionary one. It is wrong-headed, and the evidence is all about us.Follow some of the sources, read some of the citations and we learn that there are more forests now than when the Indians were here. There are healthier rivers and lakes (pine trees are acidifying) as we planted more hardwoods. There is no danger of running out of landfill.One becomes excited to learn that, as you knew in your heart, that the silly movie stars and vapid &quot;anchor-people&quot; are misinformed and spouting nonsense to get you to keep watching and adoring them. Not to be mindful, intelligent free men and women.The truth is like that."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"It is always interesting when personal politics becomes the primary motivation for writing an article or a book. And to anyone who is reasonably well read in environmental affairs, it is obvious that the author is so burdened. So too are some of the reviewers, such as the fellow who so over-simplifies and reduces his arc of thought as to actually believe that free market interests and personal property rights somehow automatically trump wider environmental concerns. I hope the gentleman in question will remember that if and when he has no potable water to drink because the local industries have contaminated the local reservoir, or when there is no electricity to power his comfortable lifestyle because the corporations providing power are more interested in profits than public service, or when his stock portfolio goes into the dumpster because the minions of free-wheeling capitalists, unchecked by any meaningful governmental regulations, choose to exercise their personal prerogatives by putting their own financial interests before those of the other stockholders. Can we all spell Depression? Or is that simply a \\"Bush\\"-league shot in the dark?More seriously, the problem with what the author has to say is not that some of what he may have to say has some truth in it, but rather that he has a hidden agenda in concocting this threadbare argument regarding the environment. He is a third-rate scholar who doesn't specialize in the specific subject area he has written the treatise on, and much of what he contends simply does not square with what is scientifically established and proven through much more rigorous studies. Other reviewers argue on his behalf based on the fact that Lomborg can quote statistics to bolster his claims. Yet anyone familiar with statistical analyses will tell you that numbers can be manipulated or pencil-whipped in almost any direction. Figures don't lie, the old adage goes, but liars often figure.Secondly, Lomborg seems to have some problem with following an argument to a logical conclusion. Thus he seems to arrive at conclusions that do not necessarily follow from the data he uses to substantiate his case. As another reviewer comments, to equate a temperate forest with a boreal forest is not only bad science involving poor understanding of the data, it is also recklessly ignorant. As this same reviewer also points out, Lomborg is very selective in his choice of data to use to substantiate his argument. This is usually indicative of someone who is much more interested in forwarding a particular political point of view than with someone honestly trying to reveal the truth.All this said, I did find the book fascinating, and I would be the first to admit that some of the environmental groups have been less than honest and forthright in their presentation of environmental data. Yet the information flowing from the various centers of scientific study all seem to agree, to use just one example of one problem that Lomborg laughingly dismisses as being overblown as a crisis, that global warming is in fact occurring, that it appears to be both more rapid and more serious a phenomenon than was previously believed, and that its political, social, and economic consequences will be far-reaching indeed.Moreover, while I understand that personal experience is not always a reliable guide for making judgments regarding the world around us, most of us can certainly testify that something systematic seems to be happening with the weather. And speaking of the weather, I want to conclude by agreeing that this book has created a firestorm of controversy, and I am sure you will find it as thought-provoking and challenging as I did. So while I do not necessarily agree with all of his conclusions, or even with some of his scientific approaches and methodologies, I do agree with what some of the other reviewers said regarding admiring the singularity of purpose and personal courage he seems to have exhibited both in publishing this work and in facing the controversy since. Poor scientists aren't necessarily bad people, rather just people who may be tragically misinformed.

Well there is only one answer. To make up your own mind.The controversy surrounding this particular author is not my concern. I am sure that he can fight his own battles.My concern is that if I want to know about what is happening to the environment I want to be able to get the facts from somewhere. I do not trust government statistics, nor do I neccessarily trust the information I get from any sort of organisation that has an axe to grind for one side of the other.To the extent one can trust the scientific community, which is not value free, one should be able to go to published sources and find the information that one seeks. If we do not have the required level of technical expertise we are forced to rely on others to translate accurately the science into English.This book performs an important function for us, as non-scientific members of our community. We owe it to ourselves to read this book and make up our own minds about the information which is made available to us.I am sure that the vast majority of us are concerned about the environment whatever our personal beliefs. We need to make informed decsions based on the best information possible and in my view that means that we should ALL be skeptical.As Bob Dylan so eloquently put it:Don't follow leaders follow parking meters!"},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"No one book is going to be the last word on the environment and this one requires a considerable background in the science and politics of the environment in order to be remotely useful. As someone who has been active in the environmental arena for many years, I have often been embarrassed at my own side and appalled at the other.Too often emotion has driven out fact and reason, with ideological cant substituting for a well thought out conservation ethic. This book, with its apparently objective use of atatistics would seem to shed some useful light on the debate. Alas, it is not so.1. The problem with the use of statistics is with the primary selection process. Flawed primary data, even if properly manipulated, will still result in a flawed final product. This problem runs throughout the book.A good example of this is his section on forests. If one checks both the text and the footnotes one discovers that Lomborg uses the UN's FAO data on &quot;forests and woodlands&quot; His selection of this category as a measure of forest gain or loss is, in the end, arbitrary and one he doesn't even attempt to justify.The definition for this category is politically not scientifically determined. It allows for 20% canopy coverage in developed countries but only 10% coverage in lesser developed countries. Since forests (both tropical and temperate) are often a sea of green (80 - 100% canopy coverage) the potential for understating forest loss is obvious.The loss of every acre of old growth forest could be offset by the planting of pulp and Christmas tree farms. The FAO number is biased against native forests from the start and allows the transition from forest to savanna to go unobserved.Timber as a commody may be fungible however forests from a conservation standpoint need to be considered by type. Again, the loss of old growth conifers in the Pacific Nortwest isn't offset by plantation pines in Georgia. One would never learn this by reading this book.Similar problems are evident in the sections on energy and extinction. His reference to the most extreme application of the Wildlands Project (forceably shifting the U.S. population to produce large uninhabited areas, closed to humans) makes one wonder how deep his research was. No mainstream environmental group advocates this - it's a real fringe position and the context in which he mentions it creates a deceptive impression and constitutes a real rookie error.2. As a general rule I'm wary of books or articles that start out with some version of &quot;I once believed this but now I know better&quot; not because one shouldn't be open to changing ones mind but because both sides in a debate usually commit the same types of errors and the &quot;zeal of the new convert&quot; syndrome that usually comes with the above statement often results in the exchange of one set of errors for another.Contrasting Paul Ehrlich with Julian Simon is an example of this. Mr. Lomborg fails to consider another (and to me, better) possibility: That both hold/held flawed positions; Ehrlich's projections on population were irresponsible and reflected a lack of understanding of economics. Simon didn't understand ecology and was indifferent to the effects of population growth on the natural world.Another possible problem is overstatement. Much has been made of the author as a member of Greenpeace and a leftist. However, was Lomborg on the high seas, riding the Zodiacs as a member of Greenpeace, or was his &quot;membership&quot; confined to a mere monitary contribution with a vague sense of environmental commitment? We aren't told.Likewise a close reading of the book makes it hard to believe that he is a confirmed &quot;man of the left&quot; even though the promos constantly refer to him as such - there is just too much blind reliance on markets as a solution to energy issues.While Lomborg is correct in calling attention to the many problems some environmentalists have created by exageration and imprecision, his methodology merely creates a new set of the same problems."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"A very thorough job of laying out facts - the book is layed out like a textbook, though it is more readable than your average textbook.The negative hype and slant of stories about the environment in the media is pretty obvious to me. However, it's nice to see someone get the story out to others.The chapter on global warming has much to be desired. I don't thing Mr. Lomborg or any scientist, for that matter has enough information to make a computer model that can accurately simulate the complex behavior of the atmosphere and oceans. The only way to know whether we even have enough information to predict anything of this complexity is to talk to a mechanical engineer (no, a &quot;computer engineer&quot; is not a real engineer and will not do). He could at least have the knowledge of which details of a computer model are known well enough and how much uncertainty exists in the final output of such a model. So, don't believe what's written in Scientific American, as many of the science writers have an agendas. Engineers cannot afford to have an agenda, as their results get immediate use - they must be correct, not just politically correct.OK, the &quot;D&quot; is for all the inherent socialism in Mr. Lomborg's worldview. Everything he talks about is in terms of &quot;we should do this&quot;, &quot;we should do that&quot;. I understand he comes from Denmark. This is America and the free market should rule. Many environmental problems become non-problems with the understanding of property rights. People take care of their own stuff much better then &quot;the commons&quot;. I think that the author's socialistic viewpoint may irk some readers, such as myself.Oh, and he likes to be politically correct and put in BCE instead of BC, something instead of AD, etc. That's easily taken care of with an inkpen, but still annoying.This book is worth buying, anyway."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"For those of you who don't read \\"Newsweek,\\" a recent article discussed the work of critic Howard Friel in tracking down all of Lomborg's numerous references... only to find that they did not say what Lomborg claimed they did.

Press's \\"The Lomborg Deception\\" coming out in March 2010.For those looking for an intelligent and HONEST anlysis of environmental issues... look elsewhere."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"Bjorn Lomborg has written a book to try to calm the worry of the masses. In so doing, he has given all of us something to truly worry about: the possibility that many will believe what he has said. The principal thesis of The Skeptical Environmentalist is that there is no environmental crisis, and that money can be better spent combatting poverty, hunger, and other social ills. It would be wonderful were he telling the truth, and it is tragic that he is not. As a biologist, I have never seen a more dangerous piece of scientific journalism- if I may so distinguish it. For Lomborg is not merely misguided, he is deliberately and knowingly misguiding others. In all the religions that I have ever studied, this is a sin.Lomborg's book is presented as a scholarly treatise, replete with references and citations. Lomborg depicts himself as one who was once sympathetic to the notion that the earth is in trouble due to human shortsightedness, but now has seen the light. Yet in every single area where I, as a reader, have expertise, Lomborg is pitifully wrong. Lomborg says that the problem of species exinction has been greatly over-rated and that scientists have no real idea how fast species are going extinct. This is actually a lie. The truth is that an accurate estimate for rates of extinction over the world as a whole are difficult to verify. In any one place, however, it is easy to see what is happening, and there are reams of data to indicate that we ought be acting to reverse the loss of species, mostly out of our own immediate self interest. I work in East Africa, where hundreds of fish species, including several important food fishes, have come perilously close to extinction, and about half of them have not been seen at all for many years. In my study area on Stellwagen Bank off Cape Cod Bay, the fishery is hurting badly, and the world's most endangered large whale, the Atlantic right whale, gets closer to extinction every day. There are so many other examples- things I have seen with my own eyes, and helped with to collect the basic data that Lomborg so eloquently and humorously misquotes. What Lomborg is saying about biodiversity loss simply does not wash with reality.Then there is global warming, which Lomborg seems to feel is a relatively minor change, and a good one for northern folks like him who have trouble enough with cold winters. Let us see what Lomborg would have to say if we forced him to live on the edge of the Sahara Desert, or in Bangladesh, or to become a farmer in the heart of drought-stricken regions of the US, Africa, or Australia.Remember that the International Panel on Climate Change, a well-balanced group of scientists from all over the world, have warned all nations that the problem is real. President Bush didn't like that answer, so he called for a second review of the problem, his own, and the answer came back even more strongly that the US had better do something about global warming or risk serious consequences! Tropical reef corals all around the world's warm seas have been dying in droves due to lethally high sea surface temperatures- or is this also a figment of our fertile imaginations?Air and water pollution are exagerated problems, too, in Lomborg's book. Try telling that to the relatives of folks who choke to death on putrid air or die from cholera and arsenic-tinged water every day.The truth of the matter is that while Lomborg grows fat on customers to his complacency, the rest of the world's people know damn well what's going on, and are working their butts off to fix it. THAT is the reason why air quality has improved in the past few decades in many of our big cities. THAT is the reason why famous rivers like the Thames and the Hudson have moved from open sewers back toward something tolerable and liveable. THAT is what will save the starving, sickly masses in the developing world. The Skeptical Environmentalist is a balm for do-nothings and ostriches with their heads in the sand (something that real ostriches are not foolish enough to do). The rest of us who love life and share hope and a can-do attitude are better off using Lomborg's book as a doorstop.Bjorn Lomborg is a young man with a long life ahead of him. See how quickly he changes his tune when his followers discover his nakedness. Pity him, but for heaven's sake, don't support him by purchasing this book. I and so many others have already made the mistake of buying it, so if you want to read it there are already plenty of copies around to borrow. When you are done, and the wiser for it, resist the temptation to burn it and instead pass it on to your worst enemies. Meanwhile, I can have only pity for my Danish colleagues who must now deal with Lomborg as head of a national institute for the environment. We live in such a strange, strange world."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"Here in the customer review community you are unlikely to find more articulate and well-written reviews than those for this book. These are often lengthy and passionate, from all sides of the political spectrum. With that in mind, one-star and five-star reviews may be from extreme thinkers. Two, three, and four-star reviews are likely to be from more moderate and analytical thinkers. I am concerned about the environment, though I lean toward the pragmatic and rational thinking of Sierra Club, rather than the self-righteous theatrics and polemics of Greenpeace. But I also know that environmental groups can exaggerate, usually because of the need for funding. I won't give this book one star because Lomborg has performed a valuable service in bringing the exaggeration of environmental doomsday theories to light. However, that's the only good thing about this book. Main points:1) You can see plenty of other reviews for an expose of Lomborg's faulty statistical methods, and especially *Scientific American* magazine. But even this misses the forest for the trees. You don't need precise statistics to know that there is environmental damage taking place at an alarming rate. You can see it all around you with your own eyes. Whether air pollution is 2.3 or 1.7 parts per million, the problem is still there.2) Lomborg states repeatedly that he has environmental concerns, and that there are still serious problems, but things are actually getting better (at least statistically). There is merit to this position. However, things are getting slightly better because of the environmental awareness among the general population of recent decades - awareness caused by the very methods Lomborg criticizes throughout this book.3) The fact that anti-environmentalists are likely to praise this book as \\"real science\\" in the face of thousands and thousands of other pieces of evidence that state the contrary is revealing. One single book that refutes the claims of thousands, and then is praised by certain groups as truthful and realistic, is unlikely to be impartial.4) Despite Lomborg's repetitive claims to the contrary, he is not a skeptic. He's a reactionary. A skeptic refuses to believe something at face value and demands to see evidence, but then is willing to believe a position if the evidence is strong and foolproof. On the contrary, Lomborg has decided that he already disagrees with a position, extreme environmentalism, and proceeds to compile \\"evidence\\" that supports his viewpoint. This is reactionary politics, not a skeptical inquiry.This book suffers from a fundamental flaw, which is present at the beginning and prevents it from ever achieving the degree of believability that is Lomborg's goal. At the core, Lomborg is guilty of the exact same exaggeration and polemics that he's criticizing."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"Thoroughly researched and extremely well documented, this is the book that will refocus the entire environmental debate.

He does a good job of exposing more easily debunked myths such the one that 40,000 species go extinct every year. He falls short however when addressing more complex issues. His major shortcoming in this regard is that he is a statistician, not a scientist with the expertise to explore extremely complex scientific issues that too often seem paradoxical to all but the specialists who spend years studying them. In his chapter on global warming, Lomborg details his argument that the phenomenon is real, but hardly the threat that most climatologists claim it is. This is a little like a dentist explaining that a rare new type of cancer is not as bad as oncologists say it is.Although, as a professor of statistics, Lomborg does a commendable job of documenting his figures, the figures don't always tell the whole story. One of the more glaring examples is his argument that the world has plenty of water. In his chapter on water, Lomborg goes to great lengths to show that there is enough surface water to support human life on earth, but only superficially delves into the subject of ground water, and barely mentions the fact that aquifers are sinking all over the world from overpumping. He completely ignores the subject of how much water is required tosupport freshwater aquatic life (fish, etc.) or any of the natural systems that depend on fresh water to exist. He seems to be unaware of \\"subsidence\\"- a phenomenon that results from too much extraction of groundwater. Subsidence is causing a number of areas of the world to sink and the substrata to harden so that it cannot reabsorb as much water. Lomborg seems equally oblivious of salinization of coastal river deltas when their flow levels decrease, or of any other water problem not directly demonstrable by numbers to affect humans.A major weakness of this book is that statistics can't support every argument. More abstract, but vital, aspects of the state of the world, such as beauty, justice, the human spirit and the value of animals are conveniently sidestepped. Lomborg often uses one criterion-- the length of human lives / how many deaths result from x, y or z--as the paramount measurement of our success or failure.A magician tricks our senses by his skill at hiding vital parts of unfolding events. Similarly, when Lomborg fails to reveal vital parts of environmental issues, he presents a deceptively convincing case to the uninformed. Because it contains so much information and is so thoroughly referenced, \\"The Skeptical Environmentalist\\" should be read by anyone seeking the truth about environmental issues, but it should be balanced by such books as Paul and Anne Ehrlich's \\"Betrayal of Science and Reason.\\"The central point of Lomborg's book is very valid-that we need to make rationally prioritize our problems based upon facts instead of upon myths.

Amongst other things, he shows that global warming is not necessarily man's fault, and sometimes it is better for the environment to bury waste rather than recycle!Of course, it won't make any difference.

And I strongly feel this is a very good point in buying and reading The Skeptical Environmentalist with the highest attention. There must be a reason if so many authors, and so many organizations, have been compelled to stigmatize Lomborg's ideas. Isn't it because they just felt someone had stripped them off and left them exposed in all their lies?Reading this book sure makes you wondering about all you know about environment and ecology: maybe Lomborg is wrong, maybe his thesis are unscientifical, but he surely has many a strong point to support them.Anyway, I can't see no reason why we can proceed on rewriting the world's more recent history (from WWII on) but we cannot revisit environmental theories: neither WWF nor WI nor any other known environmentalist organization can claim to be depository of the truth.

There is a wealth of detail with hundreds of compelling charts and diagrams. Withall one need never have taken a statistics course, or even understand what statistics is, to read the book with great interest and ease. For all its academic underpinnings the style is friendly, open, and most importantly apolitical. You can astound your friends with what you will learn. There is, for example 242 TIMES as much oil in oil shale (most of it in the US and Canada) as in all conventional resources combined (oil, gas, coal). So anyone who says we are going to run out of petrochemicals in the next thousand years is blowing smoke. Lomborg's analysis in other areas is equally revealing. The conclusion is inescapable.

The book has gotten me to do additional reading in the field, and that's high praise for any book."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"I haven't seen this much dust kicked up since Thomas Wolfe published his art world broadside \\"The Painted Word\\" in 1975. That text ridiculed the incestuous idiocies of the art historian/art theorist, and the response that spewed forth from those he targeted was identical to those now appearing in opposition of Lomborg: \\"our trade journals don't agree,\\" \\"he's not properly educated,\\" etc. You get the idea: those who we control aren't agreeing, and those who do agree couldn't find their rump with both hands. Especially they are incensed that an outsider put a pencil to their Luddite fantasies and poor research. Fortunately this scientific study came from Denmark and their academia and not a shareholder at Enron as his detractors would have you believe. Note: the English language version of Scientific American published an Environmental Caliphate review of his book but declined to offer Lomborg space in which to respond; neither then nor in a subsequent issue! Lomberg then published his response on his own web site. SA then tried to enjoin him with a court order preventing him from doing so. THAT is the real state of the world, at least the environmental world."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"More than anything else, Lomborg displays a respect for honest method and spends a great deal of time describing the margin of error involved in all the information he sifts through.This work is thorough, and anyone who takes this subject seriously ought to take the time to read it."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"Whether you agree with the author or not this is an interesting book that forces you to think rather than follow the most current dogma. Most people criticizing this book have missed that completely. Do I agree with Lomborg on every point? Absolutely not. But in my judgement if a book forces you to think it is even more important then if the author himself is right or wrong. I am tired of reading manifestos where there is no place for an alternative point of view only propaganda. Lomborg presents evidence to support his thesis. He might be too optimistic at times but in general I tend to agree with him that sky is not falling. He does not deny the existence of environmental problems but he thinks they are manageable. That is hard to swallow to his detractors. This book has stirred quite a discussion and that is important."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"right in the face of environmentalist hysteria. The author, who makes no bones about NOT being an environmental scientist, presents an analysis of environmental trends using the science he knows- statistics. He argues that many of the statistical trends he reveals stand in direct opposition to the common wisdom that the earth is in peril.He raises questions, a lot of them, about the real state of the environment. He defends his view that the earth is in better shape than what others say it is and pokes holes in the histrionic assertions of the environmental movement that all is woe. He questions the motivations of such pronouncements of doom and gloom and wonders aloud if they can be believed.The environmentalists are, of course, livid over this challenge to their litany and have descended in force to criticize and critique the work as being scientifically dishonest. Their charges are based on the fact that the book does not adhere to the standards of publication of a peer reviewed scientific journal. But the critics miss the mark - the book is not a scientific paper (just as most pronouncements from the enviromentalist movement are not), and does not attempt to hold itself out as authoritative on any of the subjects it discusses. It only expresses the opinions of the author, who is advocating his view in the debate over the true state of the planet.Whether or not you agree or disagree with the author's viewpoint, the book is topical, thought provoking and well-substantiated.

Readers will recall that Mr Lomborg, a statistician and director of Denmark's Environmental Assessment Institute, is the author of \\"The Skeptical Environmentalist\\", which attacks the environmental lobby for systematically exaggerated pessimism. Environmentalists have risen as one in furious condemnation of Mr Lomborg's presumption in challenging their claims, partly no doubt because he did it so tellingly. This week, to the delight of greens everywhere, Denmark's Committees on Scientific Dishonesty ruled on the book as follows: \\"Objectively speaking, the publication of the work under consideration is deemed to fall within the concept of scientific dishonesty.\\"How odd. Why, in the first place, is a panel with a name such as this investigating complaints against a book which makes no claim to be a scientific treatise? \\"The Skeptical Environmentalist\\" is explicitly not concerned with conducting scientific research. Rather, it measures the \\"litany\\" of environmental alarm that is constantly fed to the public against a range of largely uncontested data about the state of the planet. The litany comes off very badly from the comparison. The environmental movement was right to find the book a severe embarrassment. But since the book was not conducting scientific research, what business is it of a panel concerned with scientific dishonesty?One might expect to find the answer to this question in the arguments and data supporting the ruling-but there aren't any. The material assembled by the panel consists almost entirely of a synopsis of four articles published by Scientific American last year. (We criticised those articles and the editorial that ran with them in our issue of February 2nd 2002.) The panel seems to regard these pieces as disinterested science, rather than counter-advocacy from committed environmentalists. Incredibly, the complaints of these self-interested parties are blandly accepted at face value. Mr Lomborg's line-by-line replies to the criticisms (see www.lomborg.com) are not reported. On its own behalf, the panel offers not one instance of inaccuracy or distortion in Mr Lomborg's book: not its job, it says. On this basis it finds Mr Lomborg guilty of dishonesty.The panel's ruling-objectively speaking-is incompetent and shameful.>>"},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"I would just like to clarify S. Allison's August 10, 2004 review stating that \\"The Danish Committees on Scientific Dishonesty issued a decision that declared Lomborg's research 'to fall within the concept of scientific dishonesty,' and to be 'clearly contrary to the standards of good scientific practice'\\" A minute's research would have revealed that this complaint was withdrawn on March 12, 2004, after being roundly rejected by their parent organization, the Danish Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation, as a biased, emotional, baseless attack without any scientific merit.It begs the question: who really has a hidden agenda, a former Greenpeace member who attempts to dig through myth and dogma in order to present scientific truths, allowing for fair and accurate scientific debate about how best to protect the environment? Or organizations like the DCSD and reviewers like Allison who will do anything to discredit Lomborg in order to retain their simplistic view of the world and ensure radical environmental groups are able to gain power by spreading irrational fears?I believe this book does a great job of giving an accurate picture of our environment. It shows that we have not solved all of our problems, not by a longshot, and still have much more to do, but we are making progress. Books such as this help to concentrate our efforts on actual problems, not myths, and ensure that our resources aren't wasted and that we do not make problems even worse by misunderstanding them. Perhaps a ten minute break from the drum circle to actually study objective scientific research would help radicals be of some benefit rather than an annoyance, but I'm not going to count on that happening. The cult-like mentality of most of these people proves that they aren't interested in reason, which explains the backlash against this book."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"\\"The Skeptical Environmentalist\\" is a great book, carefully written, well-researched, logical, fair, well-documented, and even-handed. The book resonated with me immediately upon reading a few paragraphs, and I had to own it. I have found it hard to put down. It is a tonic to media hype and distortion, ego-driven arguments, and knee-jerk thinking. After reading about half the book, I came across new pronouncements about the environment, and read them much more skeptically, and was able to see much of the slant and spin put on them. You will be surprised to learn how much of what you know about the environment is the product of artfully crafted sentences that shade the truth, don't tell the full story, or hype and amplify single data points that wouldn't stand scrutiny if sourced and understood. Fascinating to think about how much of what we \\"know\\" is manufactured to support an industry that is no less self-interested than the ones it purports to assail."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"I can personally vouch for many of the claims which Lomborg makes in this paradigm-shattering book. In the first Earth Day in 1970, while in high school, I was taught, among other things, that, within 10 years or so, the human race would be dying off en masse from overpopulation, depletion of resources, and the polluted environment. Here it is 2002 and none of these predictions have come true--not even close. Instead of a population bomb (Ehrlich), we have stabilization of world population. Instead of the rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer, Lomborg points out that such things as food supply and basic sanitation are enjoyed by a larger and larger fraction of the world's population. Thirty years of oil only means that we have found reserves for the next thirty years. It does NOT mean that we will be out of oil thirty years from now! And, far from being some puppet of corporations, Lomborg remains left-of-center politically. A great book!"},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"It is one thing to challenge orthodoxy; doing so is an often brave and heroic endeavour. This book, however, is intellectual dishonest and scientifically sloppy. Too bad, a book which truly challenged some of the claims of environmentalists with serious science could be very useful and could help foster constructive debate. This book does none of that. It is so obviously based on imprecise arguments and distorted 'facts' that no serious debate could possibly ensue, except perhaps how it got published."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"Lomborg's book could serve has a source of examples for an older book called: 'How to Lie with Statistics.'There are several errors in the chapter about forests. For example:The author assumes all forests are the same (except plantations). Temperate forest is temperate forest, tropical forest is tropical forest, and boreal forest is boreal forest. The assumption is not valid. The current structure and dynamics of, say Brown CountyState Forest, are dramatically different then they were 200 years ago. It's still forestland, but it's very different. About 2% of forests account for about 20% of the bird population.Lomborg is very selective in his source of data. In some cases he ignores the last twenty years of research to choose a data source that supports his assertions. In other cases he filters the data eliminating data that would not support his case.His book is an unfortunate publication.

At the moment he is director for an independent institute for environmental evaluation newly created by the Danish government. This position was 'tailored' for Mr. Lomborg, but the problem is that the institute is supposed to do scientific research, and the researchers are employed through an evaluation of their former scientific research! This clearly brings Mr. Lomborg's employment as director in miscredit since the evaluation of him and his scientific work is primary based on 'The Sceptical Environmentalist' - which has now been labeled as a debate book and certainly not a scientic piece of work!P.S. the rating for the book is if it is supposed to be a scientic work - as a debate book it clearly works pretty well!"},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"The Skeptical Environmentalist is not based on science, is not peer-reviewed (i.e. was written in a vacuum and ignores the vast majority of science), and is just plain wrong on many levels. 2000 plus BIASED footnotes does not equal an accurate set of data on which to extrapolate the short- and long-term effect of man on the environment.Research this book a little further: read reviews by Scientific American and other peer-reviewed journals for a detailed analysis of how the book is not balanced or accurate, how the footnotes are biased, and how the author gets basic arguments and theories wrong. These journals also point out the many valuable elements of the book.If the Skeptical Environmentalist is correct, then the work of thousands and thousands of scientists in numerous disciplines the world over is wrong.

What it is is a series of brief vignettes on a multitude of environmental issues, with the apparent conclusion that past efforts at environmental action were good and wholesome, and were rightfully undertaken, and that we are now in an ideal world and should make no further attempt to change it. Future environmental efforts are expensive, evil, and should be rejected, even if the issues are real (for example, he doesn't claim global warming isn't happening, or that humans aren't causing it, just that we shouldn't do anything about it).One should question how one person could have the necessary knowledge to make the claims Lomborg makes on so many different issues. If anyone does, Lomborg is surely not one of them. His natural science background appears minimal. This would be fine if he were only compiling and reporting the work of other, qualified, individuals. But he is attempting his own \\"research\\" in areas where he has no qualifications. His only \\"scientific\\" ability seems to be the use of a computer graphing program. He will graph production of some commodity, and if the graph slopes upward, seems to imply that this is evidence that reserves of that substance are going to last forever. I guess he's expecting a biblical loaves and fishes trick.Bjorn Lomborg may well be good at political science, but that is not what this book is about.

READ WITH SKEPTICISM!!"},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"An important key to understanding this book: Lomborg's best reviews come from the most conservative, business-oriented sources. A very few of the ecologically improving trends that he notes *may* be occurring, but three of the most important measures of planetary health--total biodiversity, terrestrial wildlife habitat and oceanic wildlife habitat--are on steepening downward trends. The book has been widely panned and gets two stars here only for its value in helping understand and debunk inaccurate statistics and perspectives that might be used by those who argue for status quo development policies. For a very well-reasoned and well-written response to Lomborg, go to http://www.ecocouncil.dk/english/ and click on the link for the book: \\"Sceptical Questions and Sustainable Answers,\\" published, and provided without cost, by The Danish Ecological Council, an organization of academics dealing with environmental policy on a scientific basis. What comes through in reading the book is that Lomborg selectively chose the most alarmist environmental prognoses, recast them as mainstream perspectives, and called them The Litany, as though they were something that one constantly hears. At the same time, Lomborg selectively chose and twisted the data that support his extreme minority view of environmental conditions. In short, Lomborg appears to be a self-promoting ideologue who is doing everything possible to stretch his 15 minutes of fame."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"Lomborg's book is a noble attempt to assess the state of the world through the use of long term indicators of factors that affect human welfare and the quality of the environment, such as food production, disease incidence, life expectancy, forest loss, access to clean drinking water, infant mortality, air quality, cancer incidence, water quality, and hundreds of other measures. For its success in this area alone, it deserves a five star rating, as it succeeds in dispelling many myths, places environmental risks in context, and makes a strong case for the need to prioritize environmental policy.But where Lomborg goes astray is in the few chapters where he deviates from concentrating on outcome data, and tries to assess the extremely complex underlying science behind projected trends in biodiversity and global warming. In this, he is out of his league, and many of his conclusions have been attacked by scientific experts in these fields. He is also showing a degree of selectivity in his skepticism here, as he tends to accept, with little skepticism, official estimates on environmental issues where the trends are positive, but starts looking for holes when official estimates show negative trends. As an example, the IPCC estimates on temperature change are put through the wringer over dozens of pages, but economic estimates on the costs and benefits of global warming abatement are taken almost without question, when these estimates are *at least* as fuzzy as anything coming out of the IPCC as they require projecting the costs of technologies that don't exist yet. This sort of selectivity damages Lomborg's credibility and leaves him vulnerable to legitimate attacks from environmental scientists.Unfortunately, outside of Lomborg's comments on global warming and biodiversity, which include hundreds of pages on population growth, food production, deforestation, human welfare, pollution, chemical fears, and the like, few of those attacks have been legitimate.My recommendation: read the book, but with the skepticism that Lomborg recommends. The world is better off than you probably think, but not necessarily as well as off as Lomborg seems to think (although it should be noted that despite the claims of his critics, Lomborg is no Pollyanna, and recognizes many serious environmental problems in the book)."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"XXXXXThis book (first published in Danish in 1998 then English in 2001) by Bjorn Lomborg has ignited a storm of controversy. (In fact, his official internet site has received more than 150,000 hits since it began in mid-December 2001.)Opponents say that this book is inaccurate. They say that his conclusion with respect to environmental concerns that \\"things are better--but not necessarily good\\" as compared to the past and that the environment will improve even more in the future is not accurate.As far as Lomborg himself, he is Associate Professor of Statistics in the Department of Political Science at Denmark's University of Aarhus (and a former Greenpeace member). (Note that Lomborg has a Ph. D. in political \\"science.\\") He admits that \\"I am not myself an expert as regards [to] environmental problems\\" but he had \\"experts\\" review the chapters of his book. When I referred to this book's acknowledgements section, I counted about twenty names of people who might be called an expert. For a book that discusses the large topic of the environment, I thought this number to be quite slim.Lomborg also admits that \\"it's...true that statistics can be used to manipulate the truth. But used judiciously, statistics is the best source of information about our world...[and] the only way [in many areas] we can make a scientifically sound description of the world.\\"This book has a main narrative of about 350 double-columned pages. There are over 2500 endnotes, over 1000 references, almost 175 figures (mainly line graphs and histograms), and almost ten tables. This book is divided into six parts and each part is divided into sections. (There are a total of 25 sections.) On the environmental side, these sections cover traditional problems like food, energy, water, and pollution but also future problems like biodiversity and global warming. Part one is a general outline of the entire book. Part two to five present graphs of data with Lomborg analyzing and interpreting the graphs. Part six is a summary and details the author's views and conclusions.Thus, when Lomborg says, \\"This book presents a lot of data,\\" he's not kidding! Also, I should warn you that if you're not used to it, reading all this graphical data and Lomborg's explanations can be quite tedious and even boring. Thus, I recommend reading this book at a slow pace.As you can imagine, a book like this draws much criticism and most of this criticism I've read has to do with the accuracy and amount of the book's content. According to Lomborg's website, some scientific publications (with their associated experts, scientists, and university professors) that have given negative critiques of his book are as follows: Nature, Science, Scientific American, World Wide Fund for Nature, and the Danish Ecological Council. Even the Danish Committee on Scientific Dishonesty gave this book a \\"highly critical assessment\\" but this has been recently retracted.I recommend reading through this mass of criticism to understand what the controversey is all about and perhaps balancing what Lomborg has to say in his book with what others in their areas of environmental expertise have to say about his claims.Why is all this criticism coming from the scientific community? Is Lomborg right and the scientific community wrong? The answer to these questions is found in this book! On the first page of part one, section one, the fourth paragraph states the following:\\"This book attempts to measure the real state of the world [with respect to environmental concerns]. Of course, it is not possible to write a [single] book...which measures the ENTIRE state of the world...I wish to gauge [WHAT I CONSIDER are] the most important characteristics [or indicators] of the world.\\" (My upper-case emphasis added.)This is the answer to the two questions above. Lomborg is NOT measuring the ENTIRE state of the world but is only measuring the state of the world based on a relatively FEW indicators WHICH HE CONSIDERS MORE IMPORTANT than other indicators. The environmental science community has data on the entire state of the world. This is why when you read their criticisms of this book they say his data is not completely accurate SINCE DATA THEY CONSIDER AS IMPORTANT INDICATORS IS MISSING. (For specific indicators, read the scientific community's criticisms in the sources indicated above.) Therefore, in their view, this book is not really \\"Measuring the Real State of the World\\" (which is the book's subtitle).Thus, Lomborg seems to be right (that is, the environment is better) when he bases his analysis on a few indicators. But when you base the analysis on all possible indicators, the scientific community is right (that is, the environment is not better).In Lomborg's analysis, he does, however raise many important ideas. Here are three of my favorites:(1) \\"Prioritization [of worthy causes] is absolutely essential if we are to achieve the best possible [or most efficient] distribution of resources in society.\\"(2) \\"We ought not to let [radical] organizations, business lobbyists, or the media be alone in presenting truths and priorities.\\"(3) There should be more emphasis on the positive things that have been accomplished rather than dwelling only on the negative.In conclusion, this is a controversial book that bases its conclusions with respect to environmental concerns on the analysis of a limited number of indicators. Thus, caution must be used when applying these conclusions to the environmental state of the entire world.** 1/2XXXXX"},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"As an Associate Professor of Statistics Lomborg could have fallen prey to the demonizing pseudoenvironmentalists or pandered to unregulated capitalism, but avoided both extremes. In my opinion he has done an astounding job of comprehending the broadest possible range of environmental concerns. The many reviews already posted on [Amazon] show an almost complete polarization between the environmentally brainwashed and the hardheaded skeptics. Many of the reviews indicate that this massive book was read only in part by many; I assure you I read it all, and that it took months.Lomborg set out his philosophy clearly: Most of us desire to increase the quality of life for the greatest number of people. We do not advocate eugenics. We accept that there will never be enough money to do everything that governments might like or be asked to do. Priorities should be set to maximize the benefits of the decisions that are made. As well or badly as we have done, we could easily do better. Much of \\"The Litany\\" on present and predicted disaster is not based on facts, and is done to attract funds to the agency or organization or author of environmental alarms.The disparity in results of expenditure to gain lifespan are staggering: from &lt;$30/life-year saved from requiring smoke detectors in homes to $20 billion for further tightening benzene emission at rubber tire plants (Table 9, p340).Lomborg uses many sources, including peer-reviewed, to conclude that human caused global warming will be much less than the most dire predictions, and that it may cost less to deal with it than to attempt, perhaps in vain, to prevent it. He acknowledges that the warming we have had in the last 100 years is for warmer nights in arctic regions, which are very welcome to the local residents.The failed predictions and/or false premises of Rachel Carson, Lester Brown, Claude Martin, David Pimentel, Paul Ehrlich, Al Gore and others are neatly punctured.That said, there are a few important errors which could be corrected in future editions. The common chrysotile asbestos is not toxic in other than massive amounts to non-smokers (pp184,229,335); only the other forms not commonly used in the US are toxic. (See Dixy Lee Ray, Trashing the Planet, Washington, DC: Regnery Gateway,1990.)Low-dose radiation from Xrays, gamma rays and radon is actually beneficial, and does not follow the \\"linear-no-threshold\\" relationship (pp183,231,247,337,340) . (See Dixy Lee Ray, Trashing the Planet, Washington, DC: Regnery Gateway,1990; Mortazavi, SMJ, &lt;www.anglefire.com/mo/radioadaptive/inthorn/html>, 31 Aug 02.)Contrary to p321, cold fusion has been replicated in at least 6 laboratories (See Charles G. Beaudette, Excess Heat: Why Cold Fusion Research Prevailed, South Bristol, ME: Oak Grove Press, 2000.)The role of water vapor as a greenhouse gas is underplayed (pp258-324). (See Lomborg's ref. to Lindzen, 2001 &lt;http://ams.allenpress.com> and S. Fred Singer, Hot Talk, Cold Science: Global Warmings Unfinshed Debate, Oakland, CA: The Independent Institute, 1999.)Despite these few errors, and provided that the references above are available to compensate for them, I cannot recommend this book more highly, whether for general edification or as a text for college courses in economics, environmental science, political science and toxicology. The wonderful rationality of Lomborg's outlook, especially including consideration of the costs of doing anything or nothing, direct and indirect (see Henry Hazlitt, Economics in One Lesson, New York, NY: Arlington House, 1979); and his courageous debunking of alarmist nonsense, naming the names, should earn him well-deserved fame and fortune."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"This book is a stockpile of funny and interesting facts.

Or that for some reason, men with the highest sperm quality live in Finland and in New York? I didn't, at least not until I read this book.Lomborg has his highs and lows. His discussion of many environmental problems is singularly centred on Europe and especially the US. Large problems get a very short \`discussion' (waste, biodiversity, water pollution, acidification), while excellent chapters treat the earth's food production, energy & resources, air pollution and chemical fears. The biggest chapter by far, on global warming, was the only one I didn't finish because of the depth of the technical discussion.Although most graphs are interesting and to the point, Lomborg definitely moulds his graphs to illustrate his arguments best. Data are plotted in multiple lines with different scales on 3 axes, which makes for pretty complex reading. Also, without warning, data on income are are plotted on a logarithmic scale which seriously distorts a clear picture.All in all, despite its many flaws and weaknesses, this is a must-read.

Many of the extant reviews exist to further the agendae of the reviewers, rather than cast an unbiased (however jaded) eye over this book.The main reason for my surmising that most of them haven't read it is because they make pointed, often gleeful, attacks on things that Lomborg specifically addresses in the book. The treehuggers have a penchant for saying the message of The Skeptical Environmentalist is \\"nothing's wrong,\\" a point which Lomborg specifically addresses many times, far more than he should have to, in this book. (Note to others writing controversial books: it doesn't matter how often and how plainly you state something, the deluded will see the opposite. Not your fault.) Instead, Lomborg's driving purpose in this book is to examine the environmental concerns on which the global economy currently spends many billions of dollars per year to see if there are ways we could better spend that money.That he comes up with a resounding \\"yes\\" is not surprising. That his advice has not only not been listened to, but attacked from all sides, is equally unsurprising. Why? Because we have heard the myths Lomborg attempts to put to rest so many times that we take them as truths. What Lomborg calls The Litany has been inculcated into us as surely as has the idea held by some that man has never gone to the moon, or that the Earth is flat. Just because you hear something a million times, and just because you surround yourself with people who also believe it, that doesn't mean it's true.One assumes Lomborg set himself up for the ridicule he has received; you don't tackle topics such as deforestation, global warming, Rachel Carson and the legacy of drooling idiots she has left in her wake, and other such imbecilities without the imbeciles who foster the myths wanting to castrate you. But someone had to do it. Whetehr it would have met with less skepticism coming form Jan Harold Brunvand is anyone's guess. But it came from Lomborg's, and thus, we must look at what we've got.There is no denying that what is here is valuable information. Even if there is a glimmer of truth in the massive Scientific American criticism (to which Lomborg has already responded, so I will save my words), if the many environmental movements whose horse manure we're subjected to daily use massive amounts of hyperbole to try and get their points across, why shouldn't the other side use a little now and again? (Not that I believe this is in any way the case.) Those who don't believe there's been hyperbole on the part of the environmental movement seem to have very short memories, another point Lomborg brings up in almost every chapter. The doomsayers have held a monopoly on our ears for too long; it's about time someone tried to set us straight.And thus we come to the problem with the book itself. It's what my college literary criticism professor would have called a \\"typically German\\" work of criticism; well over twenty-five hundred endnotes are packed into the three hundred fifty pages here (and a small mini-rant, if I may; the increasing use of endnotes rather than footnotes is highly annoying. Please cease and desist immediately, and put the notes back where they belong, on the pages where the references are found). One cannot argue that Lomborg hasn't done his homework, though many have. There are huge blocks of text that are nothing more than facts, figures, and interpretation. Which, as you may surmise, makes for a book that is at time more boring than it is controversial. Readability here may not be at a minimum; you'll get more pleasure out of this than you will trying to choke down the dreck that, say, Tom Clancy or Danielle Steel releases on a regular basis. But not much. It suffers from the general malady of the belief that what is important must be dry as dust.There are also a number of questions Lomborg left unanswered, many assumptions he took at face value; did he do so because getting too far into them would have resulted in the book being endless, or because there are certain parts of the litany he believes? It's certainly okay to not question some things, but the professional skeptic will tell you why. Such things do leave questions in the mind of the reader, chinks in the armor that such a controversial book cannot afford.I cannot recommend it highly enough as a way to balance out the loads of excrement we get fed on a daily basis by people who should know better. But I can't recommend it as an unputdownable bestseller. It's hard work, getting through this thing. But it's worth it. ***"},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"THE BOOKBjorn Lomborg conducted an extensive literature review using the most commonly referenced studies of the major environmental issues currently under debate (human welfare, natural resources, pollution, global warming). Seeking an objective assessment, he discusses: inconsistencies between sets of data, different ways to evaluate and interpret research findings, how pasts forecasts have been wrong, the limitations of current knowledge, and cost/benefit analysis of risks and available options. His overall analysis is in stark contrast to what he calls the \\"litany\\" (what everyone \\"knows\\", what the media reports). The book's strength is that it is meticulously referenced (over 2,900 references!) and is written clearly, concisely, and in a well-organized manner.THE CONTROVERSEYSome cry out that this is a biased, misleading, unscientific account of the environmental issues, while others cheer the voice of reason and objectivity they always knew was out there but never reported in the media. While the disagreement includes factual disputes, the heart of the conflict centers around philosophical questions concerning ways to interpret research findings and about deciding what actions should be taken. You would think that a critical response to this book is a best-seller waiting to happen, but so far only vague denouncements rather than specific examples of substantial errors in the argument or the offering a counter interpretation.WHY YOU SHOULD READ THIS BOOKThe enormous public and private debate this book has stirred up is reason enough to put this on your must-read list (aren't you curious what everyone is so fired-up about?). Being an easy-read and a broad-based review of current environmental topics, it serves very well as an introductory text to those who are unfamiliar with the issues. Even if you end up not in agreement with the data and arguments presented in this book, you will be in a better position to understand the reasoning and more effectively communicate with those who agree with this book's position."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"What do you get when an admitted environmentalist, political liberal, and expert in statistics decides to examine the science behind many of the mantras in the environmental movement? Very provocative reading, as Lomborg has been the subject of much rebuttal in magazines such as \\"Science.\\" A quasi scientific organization in Denmark even attempted the equivalent of \\"disbarring\\" him - which should lead one to believe that he's perhaps touched a raw nerve that was in dire need of scrutiny instead of just swallowing everything we're told about how precarious the state of the earth is at present.I got this book precisely because I wanted to get a view from someone who would normally be biased towards a sympathetic interpretation of the data supporting numerous environmental causes. I figured that if HE found the data less than compelling in many cases, that I would be wise to pay attention. After all, he can't be dismissed with haughty sniffs of, \\"Big Oil\\" \\"Right Wing Hack\\" \\"Profit Over Planet\\" and the usual parade of other predictable snubbs.I have sometimes seen Lomborg dismissed as someone who analyzes gambling because he has expertise in \\"Game Theory\\" but those who make such assertions do not have the slightest notion of what Game Theory is all about. For convenience, here's the short definition courtesy of wikipedia:\\"Game theory is often described as a branch of applied mathematics and economics that studies situations where players choose different actions in an attempt to maximize their returns. The essential feature, however, is that it provides a formal modelling approach to social situations in which decision makers interact with other minds. Game theory extends the simpler optimization approach developed in neoclassical economics.\\"In other words, Lomborg's expertise is in evaluating not only statistics, but the economic consequences of various choices related to social policy. This is particularly important for environmental issues because for things like global warming, potentially trillions of dollars can be spent on actions that might make people \\"feel\\" they are doing something positive, but which has very limited benefit. Kind of like LBJ's war on poverty - trillions spent and things are actually worse today, not better. Let's not make the same mistakes with the environment.Consequently, I think it is inappropriate to dismiss Lomborg as not having the appropriate \\"specialization\\" to embark upon a book of this nature. He took the available data from published reports (such as the IPCC's reports on Global Warming), analyzed it, and presented sound conclusions about whether the earth is really \\"on the brink\\" as many would have us believe or if the world is actually a vastly better planet than it was even 150 years ago.I enjoyed the book and encourage you to read it. You may not agree with every conclusion, but it is an alternative and - I think - rational viewpoint that is becoming increasingly harder to find in today's climate of highly politicized science.The book is an ambitious undertaking with over 2000 citations in the bibliogrophy, hundreds of diagrams, and a scholarly approach throughout.Mr. Lomborg is to be commended for an outstanding book that injects reality into the situation and let's us know that perhaps things are not so bad as Al Gore and his fellow alarmists would lead us to believe."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"It is very interesting to read the many reviews of Bjorn Lomborg's book. The remarkable thing is how polarised the reviews are. There are many 5 star reviews, and just as many 1 star reviews, with only a few giving a score in between. Most of the 5 star reviews compliment Bjorn Lomborg for his intelligent discussion of the issues, and for his integrity and honesty in his presentation.The 1 star reviews on the other hand are clearly the work of people who don't want to accept Lomborg's positions. However, the Lomborg opponents don't seem to be able to come up with specific examples where Lomborg is wrong. Instead they resort to emotional language, and say things like \\"there are simply too many errors and distortions to list them all.\\" Excuse me? It would indeed be very helpful if those who take such a position would provide clear, objective, unemotional instances of where Lomborg is wrong, with page number references, contradicting data etc. As a review of his reply to the Scientific American articles attacking him will show, Lomborg has been able, in nearly every case, to effectively argue for his conclusion over the viewpoint of his opponent.For the rest of us, the obligation is, as it always must be if we are to avoid being conned by propaganda from either side, to find out for ourselves. For example, an area where Lomborg may not have it right is his acceptance of the IPCC Summary Report position that there is evidence for global warming, and that that warming is caused by anthropogenic activities. Examination of the DATA itself, especially that collated from rural stations or the satellite record, shows that there is very little, if any, evidence for secular global warming at all. And even if one accepts the flawed record that includes stations subject to urban heat island effect, the record shows that it is only average night time temperatures that are increasing, not the average daytime temperature which just goes to show the merit of the urban heat island argument! The best that can be said about global warming is that there may be a cyclical fluctuation in the climate that appears to correlate with cycles of solar activity. But it behooves all of us to find out for OURSELVES.The conservation movement has made a major contribution to the quality of life on the planet over the past 30 years. As a result of their efforts we all enjoy cleaner harbours and beaches, streets free of litter (at least in Australia), and much improved air quality. There is much to be done yet, but there really has been a major change in the awareness and concern of the general population regarding conservation issues.Bjorn Lomborg's work has been effective in stimulating discussion, and challenged interested parties to develop a better understanding of the issues. That has to be a good thing."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"Lomborg educates the reader about using statistics to arrive at conclusions in a political environment. His book operates at the levels of statistical methodology and analysis. Method requires using the best available data, including both the data points that support and detract from the thesis, and plotting the data in every way that makes sense.His premise is that most of the statistical analyses put forth by environmentalists support an activist agenda. Support the Kyoto Protocol to stop global warming. Eliminate pesticides. No frankenfoods. Swap your SUV for a bicycle. Don&#65533;t eat meat. Put a high tax on gasoline because we are running out of oil. His observation is that advocates often tend to use sloppy statistics to support radical positions. They incite fear that things are getting worse, whereas by almost any statistical measure life on earth is getting better in almost every way.After presenting his methodology, Lomborg looks into the trends for world hunger, illness and mortality, pollution, depletion of natural resources and energy sources and global warming. Statistics in large measure disprove a number trends that we have been lead to fear: the increase in the incidence of cancer and infectious diseases, air and water pollution and the health risks associated with pesticides. Though statistics support other trends such as the hole in the ozone layer, extinctions, fossil fuel depletion and global warming, Lomborg finds that the extent of the problem, the projected direction and scale, and the threats are often terribly overblown.Lomborg observes that statistics about the environment are inevitably politicized because they feed a political process. What problems need to be addressed, how do we address them, and how much and whose money do we use to do it? Above than that there is a question of whose values will be imposed on the society. Will we outlaw frivolous consumption just because it wastes our resources?A key conclusion, certainly not original with Lomborg, is the need to impose a calculus on the value of human life. Because legislators act out of fear rather than fact, some environmental regulations cost $20 billion per life saved while others cost virtually nothing. While savings lives is certainly good, the obvious conclusion is that far more lives would be bettered by choosing the cheaper options, and in fact more good might result from spending a sum like $20 billion on education rather than the environment. Educated people live longer.Lomborg would purport that his own agenda is to advance the understanding and use of scientific method. His statistics demonstrate he is not in the pay of the tobacco or oil companies. I think he&#65533;s right, and would ask that a skeptical reader question the motivation of his detractors."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"I have thought for some time that the Environmental Movement has become a religious one. They have developed a creed and a theology baed on opinions set in stone. &quot;Leaders&quot; make dire prophecies and refuse to look at opposing facts. Despite the numerous predictions - famine by 21st century, 50% of all species extinct, cancer rates skyrocketing, mass starvation in most of the word, deformities will mushroom due to chemicals, etc. - not a one has even came close to occurring, they continue undisturbed in their faith.The author's biggest problem is not going to be solved by a book - even one as good as this one. He is attemmpting to fight a battle using scientific data, facts and teaching, whereas the opponents use emotion, wild claims, false science and ideology. Facts that do not agree with a stated opinion are ignored or ridiculed.This book, appearing at this juncture in the environmental fight, provides an amazing array of charts, facts and sources. The comparisons with the claims of the zealots are remarkable. Especially telling were the many measurements of progress in almost every area of human activity - from life expectancy, to food to clean water. This is in direct conflict with the doom and gloom we hear on a regular basis. The return to a pastoral setting, which many of the &quot;theologians&quot; evoke displays an incredible lack of knowledge about pre-industrial conditions. Wisely, the author does not pretend that &quot;all is well&quot; but does try to restore a little balance to the argument over humankind's role on Earth.The power of this book is evident by the over-reaction from the &quot;mainstream&quot; media. I have heard it disparaged on NBC, CBS, MSNBC, NPR and read &quot;reviews&quot; in many publications (NY TImes, Washington Post, Scientific American) All these blasts have one thing in common. Very little attention is paid to the facts and the the main argument seems to be that he had the temerity to challenge the world view promulgated by the preachers.

I am convinced Bjorn Lomborg and Rush Limbaugh Must have gone to the same school of scientific obfuscation and unctuous disinformation. A middle school debate class could take this book apart with little effort. It proves a good case study for how to make a million pandering to eager (desperate) skeptics but for real &quot;facts&quot; look elsewhere. Even if you are skeptical of environmental science you can do a WHOLE lot better than this book.Now if you want a book that REALLY throws some light on the environmental debate over history look to &quot;Ruin and Recovery&quot; by Dave Dempsey. What I found so remarkable about his book was how anti conservationists and anti environmentalists have been making the same arguments for 200 years and how THEIR predictions not only prove untrue but often completely contrary."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"This book is based on a tenditious and self-serving interpretation of the existing data. Worst yet, the author provides a scientific smokescreen for those economic and political interests which are blocking any effective effort to address the single greatest threat to humanity and this planet, climate change. For an accurate understanding of the political and economic forces arrayed against appropriate environmental policies I recommend Matthew Cahn's _Environmental Deceptions_ and George Gonzalez's _Corporate Power and the Environment_."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"Lomborg selects his statistics very carefully. For example, he reports that the WWF figure for land burned in wildfires in Indonesia was significantly higher than the Indonesian government's estimate. He doesn't say that Indonesia's government was reporting only on forested land burned, nor that a later study showed that actually more than double the WWF's estimate had been burned (Indonesia's estimate was based on reports from farmers and ranchers, who probably started the fires themselves). On the issue of global climate change...are you going to believe his interpretation of the statistics or the World Meteorological Organization's (which says that not only will global warming happen, but that it is happening already). Likewise, he reports that the extinction rates are exponentially lower than those claimed by the environmental movement. In fact, he uses the rates of species being classified as extinct. In order for this to happen, there needs to be either an extensive survey of the species' entire known range (which almost never happens) or the species needs to go for a 50 year period without being recorded (which takes 50 years) Furthermore, the species needs to first be described to science, and the vast majority of species are not. As he talks about oil, he twists the arguement around, from \\"oil is being consumed too quickly; it fuels wars and emits nitrous oxides and carbon dioxide\\" to \\"we are about to run out of oil.\\" He essentially states that forests are not significantly threatened. This is based on several flaws. For example, one of his footnotes references a figure stating that 7.5 million square kilometers (which was apparently misread as a percentage). He then confuses net forest loss with original forest loss, although second growth forests are much poorer biologically than virgin ones. He also expresses forest loss as a fraction of total land mass on earth, rather than forest cover, a misleadingly small statistic. The whole book is intresting, but not in any way grounded in fact. ...."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"A sufficient comment about this book would be the fact that recently the Danish Science Council (Lomborg hails from Denmark) proclaimed this book to not be a scientific publication. So what is it? Lomborg himself admitted that he is not an environmental expert. Perhaps we should then pay attention to people who are! The Union of Concerned Scientists in Washingtons solicited reviews of this book from a number of respected top scientists. To quote a little from the UCS Website:\\"Reviewing Lomborg&#65533;s claims are Dr. Peter Gleick, an internationally recognized expert on the state of freshwater resources; Dr. Jerry Mahlman, one of the most highly regarded atmospheric scientists and climate modelers; and top biologists and biodiversity experts Dr.&#65533;s Edward O. Wilson, Thomas Lovejoy, Norman Myers, Jeffrey Harvey and Stuart Pimm.These separately written expert reviews unequivocally demonstrate that on closer inspection, Lomborg&#65533;s book is seriously flawed and fails to meet basic standards of credible scientific analysis. The authors note how Lomborg consistently misuses, misrepresents or misinterprets data to greatly underestimate rates of species extinction, ignore evidence that billions of people lack access to clean water and sanitation, and minimize the extent and impacts of global warming due to the burning of fossil fuels and other human-caused emissions of heat-trapping gases. Time and again, these experts find that Lomborg&#65533;s assertions and analyses are marred by flawed logic, inappropriate use of statistics and hidden value judgments. He uncritically and selectively cites literature -- often not peer-reviewed -- that supports his assertions, while ignoring or misinterpreting scientific evidence that does not. His consistently flawed use of scientific data is, in Peter Gleick&#65533;s words \\"unexpected and disturbing in a statistician\\".\\"I find it disturbing that such a flawed book gets so much attention - even though it did not fool any real expert for a second.The full reviews as well as further links and comments are available at the link below.

More recently, I heard him on a community radio station (KGNU) debating the author ofBoiling Point: How Politicians, Big Oil and Coal, Journalists and Activists Are Fueling the Climate Crisis--And What We Can Do to Avert Disaster. Lomberg doesn't sound as authoritative when he is challenged by a skeptic of the global warming skeptics. Nevertheless, I'll give Lomborg an additional star beyond the lowest ranking for debating the issue, and for recognizing that climate change is a serious issue. At this point, even the Department of Defense is issueing reports on global warming and its ramifications. Andrew Marshall, a leading Pentagon strategist, and others have urged that the U.S. be part of a global transformation away from fossil fuels and toward renewables and conservationNatural Capitalism: Creating the Next Industrial Revolution.If not for the improvements we've already made in efficiency, many of Erlich's predictions would've come to pass. Moreover, many people feel there has been a population bomb and that it is creating unsustainable stresses on natural resourcesMaybe One: A Case for Smaller Families.There are many weaknesses with Lomborg's positions.

Fortunately, our options aren't either/or proposals. We can reduce malaria by investing in bed-nets, and reintroducing predators of mosquitos (like amphibians, bats and birds that were wiped out by DDT.

In order to interpret the statistics that Lomborg has assembled, one would need thorough scientific training in a number of different disciplines. The people who actually HAVE such training (research scientists in those fields) have thoroughly refuted Lomborg's findings in reputable publications such as NATURE.The state of the environment is a very emotional issue, however, and a lot is at stake. In order to take the steps necessary to counter the havoc being wrought on the ecosystem, governments, corporations, and individuals will have to take drastic measures, measures they may find inconvenient and economically harmful (at least, in the short term). In order not to have to face the unpleasant reality, many people unwittingly fall into a well-documented psychological trap called \\"denial.\\" We see it all the time: \\"no, my son's not homosexual,\\" \\"no, I'm not going to get laid off next year,\\" \\"no, I don't have a drinking problem.\\" It doesn't matter that the majority of scientists competent to decide these matters disagrees with you: as long as you find somebody to wave numbers around and manufacture bogus \\"proof\\", you can maintain your delusion indefinitely. Well, not indefinitely of course, only until reality slaps you on the face and perhaps takes your life in the bargain. Lomborg is just giving such people fuel for their fires, and being handsomely rewarded for it. What his readers have to ask themselves, however, is the following: is it better to err on the side of caution and take steps to counter potentially catastrophic disruptions in the ecosystem, or better to err on the side of making all decisions on the basis of short-term convenience and profit? How much is there to lose in each case if you make the wrong choice?

The answer is NONE but hey, don't listen to the experts with no vested interests, listen to this guy spew more garbage out so you can all feel better about how you're not really being wasteful and we're not really ruining the planet.

As he says himself, without the scare tactics of parties like greenpeace, the world would be in much worse condition than it is. I think that, as a book for the general public, it could cause an alarming rise in apathy.

As a mechanical engineer I have simply never been convinced by the constant stream of so called \\"science\\" used as propaganda nor have I ever thought that the total contribution of mankind to global warming more than 20%. The rest seems to me to probably be natural variation in earths atmosphere. I first heard about this book reading Michael Crichtons \\"State Of Fear\\", which is a must read for anyone interested in this book.What is admirable about this book is the author is using the same widely used statistics that the propagandists use such as the IPCC, UN and others. He clearly and concisely illustrates how even supposed top \\"scientists\\" pervert the data to their own ends or are simply idiots. Further he uses the information in an intelligent way such as the estimated profits and losses using World Bank and other non special interest group data. We need to do things more intelligently not on a bigger and bigger scale(shotgun style) and we need to realize that we ultimately have only hints of the far future so moderation is the best policy.Another is that the author does not have a huge agenda to push unlike organizations like Greenpeace, World Watch, the Sierra Club, Concerned Scientists and others. Nor is he a politician. There are no CEOs and others to pay, no political offices to win and no cronies to pay off. People like Al Gore are simply opportunistic gold diggers who manipulate the weak minded such as celebrities, etc. for their own ends with this issue. The academics are simply a tribe who are indoctrinated and also in some cases deliberately misleading us. There are never any innovative solutions offered by those people only applications for ever more grants and media attention.It's actually quite shocking to read how misleading and incompetent the press is. It's sadly a simple truth that sex and violence sells, not well thought out and considered research. It's also sad how negative people are, at least the ones selling things. Most people I know accept that the earth is warming but the precise reasons are unknown. Global warming could be a net benefit to earth as a whole.We forget how much we've done over the last 500 years, when we put our mind to it we can solve most problems, look at AIDs it's no longer a death sentence and that's over only 30 years! To be sure there are many problems but it does no good to use hyperbole and threats to get progress.Oil and most other resources won't run out before we move on to other sources of energy as is stated in the book. Solar, wind and nuclear are the best alternatives we have now but there will be others in the future for sure. Efficiency and technology upgrades will be more than enough for the foreseeable future. The earth was able to support huge populations of large lizzards for hundreds of millions of years, I think it can support us for a long time as well. Can you imagine the amount of greenhouse gases emitted by the dinosaurs?A highway is just as natural as a river, humans are not parasites on earth. At the heart of these propagandists is a deep collective self hatred for mankind. A need to punish all of us for their pathology."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"We need this type of clarity when discussing environmental issues. Bjorn Lomborg may not tell you what you want to hear about the environment but thats the point. He explains why we should be optimistic and perhaps evaluation our priorities. Read the book, its wonderful."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"This book is refreshing reading. To start, the title: skepticism is de rigueur in trying to understand scientific problems. Any scientific problem. Most self proclaimed environmentalists, however, are not skeptical enough. They always assume that the worst possible scenario is the most likely. They always make an environmental problem, any problem, to appear the most pressing of all. They, in other words, recite the \\"Litany\\" to which Lomborg refers. As a result, resources are not optimally allocated to address the real environmental problems, choices are not made in a rational way, and time, money and lives are lost.Lomborg does NOT argue there is no environmental problem. He says there is. What he does convincingly argue is that, overall, humanity is going in the right direction in addressing them. Maybe not in an ideal way, surely mistakes have been made, but things are, all in all, better today thany they have ever been, and they are improving. Whether it's nutrition, medicine, the quality of the air we breath and the water we drink, housing, schooling, etc. we wre going to leave to our children a better world than the one we inherited from our fathers.I am not arguing (I could not, possibly) that Lomborg is always right in his many arguments. Surely his statistics can be, and have been, questioned. However he proves that the Litany we have become accustomed to hear is both wrong and counterproductive in addressing the real problems of our environment."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"A valuable and necessary reasoned document for those who care to inform themselves and not simply be bullied a media who dont present any factual information to discuss.All the facts may not be 100% correct, but thats the point - the data is conclusive, and it's too early to jump to conclusions. The impact of carbon in the air may be great or it may be small (no one's certain) but there certainly are may other factors (sunspots, natural iceage cycles), so many in fact it is nigh impossible to be certain of what is happening.The climate is changing - it does that naturally. Focusing on carbon is in danger of over simplifying the problem. It is lulling people into a false sense of security (ie. so long as we tax carbon, everything will be fixed - it won't). Instead, mankind should be looking holistically, and directing our efforts into adapting to climate change (as nature has always done), whether you believe its manmade or not."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"Love this book.

Of course since it reflects my empirical world view quite closely (my husband asked if I had written it), I enjoyed it all the more.

With that said, &quot;The Skeptical Environmentalist&quot; presents a plethora of arguments (nearly 3,000 footnotes and a 70 page bibliography) to confirm what saner environmentalists have always suspected: the environment and life on earth is improving! Lomborg's critics will look to his title and simply assume that because he is a professor of *statistics* that he could never make an intelligent argument on the environment. Yet, Lomborg's analysis is based on statistical evidence taken around from the world and hundreds of different sources. One suspects that even if Lomborg was the most honored environmental scientist on earth, his critics would still disparage him for no other reason than his conclusions are actually positive and not comprised of Doomsday scenarios.Let us assume for a moment that Lomborg's optimism is naive. Even if some of Lomborg's conclusions are incorrect, or his interpretation of statistics proves wrong, his often repeated point is the same: the environment needs to be cared for and we have much work to still do, but in various aspects, the air, water, food production, life expectancy, etc. have improved! Surely this be cause for SOME celebration! Lomborg should be praised and admired at minimum for not running with the herd and instead looking at facts and reality to come to his conclusions. In this way, &quot;The Skeptical Environmentalist&quot; is an excellent book, well researched, and even if Lomborg is incorrect in some of his conclusions, he book is definitely worth a read (or two). If environmentalists would only take his lead and present the status of the environment fully and completely, they would gain much credibility.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"Interesting to read that Danish Committees on Scientific Dishonesty (DCSD) was unable (and unwilling,) to find any fault whatsoever on the basis of reason or (gasp), as their name might suggest, &quot;science&quot;.Many have dismissed this work as illogical, yet none can contest the merits of its arguments and its sources. It has not been effectively debunked, save for shallow, ad hominem attacks against Lomborg himself.Does this book claim that those proffessing upon the perils of the ecology are entirely without base? Of course not, but it does make coherent arguments against shameful and exaggerative scare tactics.How strange that so many who deem themselves &quot;scientists&quot; would not welcome such an articulate voice in what is doubtless to become an important debate as we enter the next century."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"Given the controversy generated by this book, it is hard to assess the book without referencing the criticisms piled on it.Many reviewers alluded to the fact that many critical and repudiating reviews of the book were from scientific journals. This on the surface commands credence. However, taking a deeper look into this matter reveals something quite different.The science of the environmental studies, mostly conducted in college campuses and in concert with scientific publications, was virtually taken over by the advocate scientists, whereas the old fashion fact-finding scientists have all been silenced. Lomborg's book is an expos&eacute; on the political agenda of the advocate scientists, their shoddy work and outrageous claims. It is small wonder that loud squeals are heard from the \\"scientific\\" community. Their integrity, their competency, and their raison d'tre, no less, are being openly questioned!Reading into some of the refutations (I read a fair number them all, including the ones from Scientific American), one would find a profusion of rhetoric, patronizing and denunciations, but very few actual errors they could cite in Lomborg's book. These criticisms are generally along the lines that Lomborg was a statistician and not a natural scientist, that the issue is \\"more complicated\\", or that Lomborg drew conclusions without looking what was happening in the \\"developing\\" nations, or that Lomborg selected data to support his claims. (Of course, Lomborg, like anyone else, selects data. But he gave source of the data and also compared data from different sources and explained why a set of data is more credible and/or more consistent with observed facts.)Even the condescending criticism of Lomborg confusing production with consumption about the ocean was not right. It is customary to refer to the rate of yield from a land or an ocean, or a worker or a machine for that matter, as its productivity. The ocean is not a consumer; human beings are. Human beings could not have harvested and consumed the fish if the oceans have not produced them. The question is whether that productivity can be sustained. If this productivity had been on an upward trend for thirty years, and is now double what it was in 1970, Lomborg was quite correct in making that claim. I would not argue that there has not been over-harvesting or depletion over the years. When they happen, feedback mechanisms, natural, economic and legal, will kick in to stop or correct them.Having read both sides, it is clear to me which side is more objective and credible. ..."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"It takes a certain disposition of mind to derive value from this book. You will know immediately upon reading the introductory chapter whether you are of this ilk. If you find yourself feeling enraged, exonerated, or bored, you should probably immediately return the book to the shelf, as it will likely cause you more harm than good. If you find yourself feeling curious, skeptical, and deliberate, this book will likely not only expand your horizons but afford a satisfying (and all-too-rare) exercise to your analytical mind.I say these things not to disparage anyone, but merely to make a point--the value of this book is only available to a careful, dispassionate reader. That reader will not care whether Lomborg is (morally) \\"right\\" or \\"wrong\\" but merely whether he has presented a carefully reasoned argument, the bounds of which are clearly qualified. After reading the book, as well as most of the published criticisms (and, quite importantly, Lomborg's responses to those criticisms), I have come to the conclusion that he has accomplished his stated purpose in good faith (as limited as this purpose is, by the author's own unequivocal admission).The limits to research and available data may prove him incorrect in his conclusions, the (likely unintended) influence of, and simplifications regarding, his book may even have (eventual) negative effects on policy decisions. Who knows? But to judge him on these grounds is foolish and misdirected because he acknowledges the limits of his endeavor and the methods he uses, in plain sight to the reader, with all due diligence. It is tempting to be bowled over by the breadth of data and seemingly shocking \\"revelations\\" here, but Lomborg takes a careful, surgical approach, trusting his reader not to skim, generalize, or amplify his statements, which is from where the lion's share of the criticisms leveled against him seem to arise. This subtle difference is what distinguishes a passionate argument from a senseless pontification.This does not mean that I espouse some ideological camp, and anyone who feels uncomfortable without attaching such a label to themselves likely will not get much value (or pleasure) from the book.Many of the other reviewers have exhaustively enumerated their objections to and/or defenses of this book, but if you are meant to read this book none of them can dissuade or encourage you. You must simply read it and decide for yourself. That is the spirit of empirical science. It will improve your wits and your dignity as a reasonable, self-determining being.In short, I recommend it."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"This is a comprehensive and technically precise investigation into many claims of human impact on the environment. The author heavily documents his sources, which allows them to be conveniently cross-referenced for more academically-minded readers. The massive number of citations also suggests how deeply researched this book really is!In terms of readability, this book is very accessible for those with a basic familiarity with data analysis; probably nothing more than an introductory statistics course for humanities students. This is largely required to appreciate the more precise statements in the books and the extensive number of supplementary charts and graphs.This book thoroughly investigates trends of life expectancy, food availability, energy availability, global warming, depletion of forests, depletion of natural water and the like. The general consensus is that although there is usually some truth to many of the more alarming claims out there, any Malthusian prediction of destruction is generally exaggerated. Moreover, the author refutes many commonly exaggerated perceptions about the dangers of nuclear power, DDT and alar.The global warming chapter is a little outdated, largely because the theory that global temperature is largely driven by solar activity was not popularized around the time of this writing. For more information on this particular topic, I recommend either Bjorn Lomborg's book Cool It, Climate Confusion by Roy Spencer or Unstoppable Global Warming: Every 1,500 Years by Fred Singer and Dennis Avery. The latter two books however, have much more of a derisive tone than Bjorn Lomborg's book does.

The most informative debate is Lomborg's point-by-point rebuttal of criticism which appeared in Scientific American. (You can find all of this on the web.) In a nutshell, the scientists do not sound very scientific.I think there is a reason for the disgust of many scientists. Lomborg attacks the evidence of several kinds of environmental catastrophe. The scientists, on the other hand, begin from a conservative point of view in their concern for the mere possibility of irreparable damage to the earth. They are obviously correct to realize that we cannot afford to lose the earth, and we should therefore be wary of any significant perturbation made by mankind.I believe that the scientists get angry because Lomborg refutes their favorite arguments in favor of strict environmental policies, those which purport that a catastrophe has already begun. Lomborg, on the other hand, does not understand that the strongest argument is that we can always be wrong.We cannot afford a mistake which destroys our only viable planet, which is why we must limit the global impact of our activities. But this is not the point addresed by either Lomborg or his critics.Lomborg has done a significant service in pointing out some flaws and biases in scientific research, but you would learn more by following the debates than by reading this large, tendentious book."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"This meticulously researched book refutes the innumerable jeremiads of the eco-hustlers, while honoring the values and goals of those who wish a liveable environment for the forseeable future.

His mathematical background shows at every step in the book. First of all, he is highly organized. There is never a doubt of where he is at or where the author is going with his thoughts. Nothing is confusing here. Next, the author is thorough in his research and his presentation. He considers every nuisance of the problem and approaches the matter with exactness.This is a true man of science trying to show the reader how science, true science, approaches problems and works out solutions. Even if one isn't interested in the environment, if there is an interest in science, this book will show how science must work, and how it must NOT work, if there is to be thoughtful progress in the world through science.If you are wondering what the environmental debate should sound like you must read this book.

Perhaps more correctly it could be titled Changing Children's Intelligence, which is specified in the rest of the title. But Intelligence has been largely viewed as relatively a fixed quantity. Perhaps not by all individuals, or all professionals, but institutionally, kids get classified as Slow, Retarded, Normal, Gifted,etc., and these labels condition teachers and become a self fulfilling prophecy. Feuerstein was an Israeli, working in Israel in the early 1950s, when Israel was taking Jewish children from many lands including lands where modern urban culture was totally unknown. Conventional testing indicated that these children were &quot;unteachable&quot;. Feuerstein devised a new testing protocol. First, he used a conventional test in a very restricted area. Second, he provided brief but intensive instruction in a specific activity related to the area under study. Third, he repeated the initial test. The degree of difference between the results of the two tests was, he stated, a measure of the childs' intelligence. Of course! Perfectly obvious! Except that institutionally this was totally revolutionary. The concept was simple, but its' implementation was a new challenge. Educators no longer had the freedom to say &quot;No use in expending effort on these kids, they are unteachable&quot;. The challenge was to create simple challenging activities that the students could do, yet activities that would provide &quot;stepping stones&quot; to activities of increasing complexity and importance.This is a miniscule outline of the book. It should be a bombshell in the Education community. Interestingly enough, the book is out of print! As one who has observed the Education community closely for a long time, it would be surprising if it were otherwise. The author has spent approximately the last ten years in a research project involving the teaching of Technology/Math/Science in the elementary grades. The present attitude is that we will teach the most rudimentary trivia in the elementary grades, with total disregard for the ability of the students. The book shows a procedure that can start very early and enable kids to learn important, complex concepts. Oddly enough, it places the responsibilty for education on the Educators instead of on the students! What a novel concept! This book is a powerful tool for anyone that considers the education of our disadvantaged children important."},{"Title":"Changing Children's Minds (A Condor book)","review":"The previous reviewer says at one stage that Feurerstein &quot;was&quot; I hope this does not give the wrong impression. The great man was still very much alive when I heard him speak several years ago at the University of New South Wales conference organized by Hawker Brownlow. If you ever get a chance to hear this man speak don't pass it up. The chance may not come again. What you get out of hearing him will depend on what you know of his work and reading this book beforehand would be a good strategy. Feurerstein is not a rev 'em up motivational speaker with a few clever tricks up his sleeve (of which there are a few on the conference circuit). He makes a sincere attempt to present his work in a serious way and the more you know of his work the more you will appreciate how difficult it is to do a short presentation on it. It is well worth spending a couple of thousand dollars to go to the International Conference of the Institute for the Enhancement of Learning Potential. This runs every year at Shoresh near Jerusalem. I went over and it was one of the best things I have ever done. Back to the book itself. The techniques described in it are not just applicable to &quot;poor&quot; students. They are applicable to all students up to the highest level of intellectual functioning. Doing a course in these techniques does not just give the instructor the tools to help struggling students,it changes the instructor themselves. The materials are a self developement course in themselves. There is no escape! This book does dwell upon the use of the techniques in low functioning students but other works on this topic give a broader perspective. One of the reasons Feurerstein has chosen to work with Down Syndrome children in particular, is because of frustration with attitudes which suggest you can't teach intelligence. When children improved markedly under his guidance then people would say &quot;Well they could not have been so bad to begin with the original assessment must have been wrong&quot;. With Down Syndrome children no-one can deny that they have trisomia. I have seen some of these children and the way they function and the attitudes of the staff of the Institute. It is wonderful! I have seen the materials in this book being used at the school for gifted childrn in Tel Aviv, and have used them myself on a range of students of all abilities. It is time consuming, and it is difficult to persuade some parents that doing activities which are not reading and not calculation are really helpful and worth the time spent. There are worksheets dealing with teaching spatial orientation and Visual transport for instance which are pre-reading skills. The use of the word &quot;retarded&quot; in this book bothers some people extremely, but don't let it get to you. Feurerstein has a particular definition of this word in mind when he uses it and its not supposed to sound insulting. If you are not an academic just read in &quot;behind&quot; and go on to find the treasures that this material contains. Well that is my push to get this book back in print and boost the sales ratings. It is a shame to think that this great man may not get the recognition that he deserves in this lifetime. His is a labour of love. Somebody please nominate him for a Nobel Prize."},{"Title":"Jeffrey's Favorite 13 Ghost Stories","review":"This was a gift.

She, like Kathryn, was a good story teller, but I would wonder why she chose bedtime to scare children.This is a collection from the five out of print Jeffrey books. The Bell Witch in Adams, TN, as witnessed by Andrew Jackson was wrongly named (Kate) -- from the two family members taunted by this \\"devil\\", it shows definitely to be a male. He was jealous of the wife and loved the daughter.The snake charmer in the hills of East Tennessee was just plain stupid who took a fatal choice with his fiddle playing -- the rattlesnakes took their revenge for all the snake skins he had collected one by one. He still plays the devil's instrument on still clear nights as the rattles keep time with the music.The farmer who \\"vanished\\" in broad daylight in Gallatin, Tennessee, was a made up story by the 'Cincinnati Inquirer' in the 1880s; it never happened similar to the story made up by a Chicago paper around that same time about the Indian Rope Trick. There is no evidence that either happened, only a tale to pass on for posterity.We all have a ghost story to tell, one from the past or one we experienced as an adult. Actually, my experience was with both, and they were \\"good\\" ghosts. Someday, I plan to haunt the Tennessee Theater and the Knoxville buses -- but I hope that will be a long time from now.

This is an excellent radio mystery and contines to entertain me even now. The characters are well cast and play their parts superbly. If you like English radio mysteries, this is a keeper. Having listened to several of the Paul Temple stories, this one is still my favorite. The voices, music, and sound effects are all well done. If you are a fan of Paul Temple, Francis Durbridge's creation, and can still find this story, you can't miss by buying it."},{"Title":"Archie's Way: A Memoir of Friendship and Craftsmanship","review":"Some of us are lucky enough to find a true mentor in our lives, someone who opens our eyes to a special world, and in so doing, gives us a glimpse of ourselves. Such a person is Archie Raasch, the subject of Richard Probert's book Archie's Way. A man of few words and many talents, Archie is an unforgettable character whose down-to-earth wisdom is vanishing from our hurried world.Archie's Way sparkles with the joy of discovery implicit in new relationships. Probert's mastery of visual, sound and textural detail gives the book sensory complexity without being overbearing. A few of the mechanical descriptions, though were a little too technical for one unfamiliar with the landscape of the workshop. But this was only a minor flaw and did not distract from my overall enjoyment of the book.There is a line of tension throughout the book that is skillfully drawn so as to tantalize the reader to discover the true nature of Archie and to tap the wellspring of his enigmatic quirkiness. The later chapters move from the technica of the machine shop to the mysteries of the wood shop and the labyrinthian paths of Archie's woods. There amidst the fragrance and beauty of the natural world, the layers of Archie's character are respectfully revealed, the book takes on a warmth, much like the patina of well-worked wood.Probert is an engaging storyteller with a wonderful sense of character. Archie's Way is a rewarding glimpse into a sadly disappearing way of life."},{"Title":"Archie's Way: A Memoir of Friendship and Craftsmanship","review":"This short memoir is a true love story. The author loves both shopwork and his friend Archie. It is hard to tell which this book is more about. You need not be a shop - either metalworking or woodworking - enthusiast to enjoy the book. Archie was a truly interesting guy and the author portrays him well. The memoir is appropriately brief. Mr. Probert does not waste time nor is there any hint of self-aggrandizement (always refreshing in a memoir). An enjoyable quick read."},{"Title":"Archie's Way: A Memoir of Friendship and Craftsmanship","review":"A true story that will take you back through the years.

Funny, sad, sweet, and imbued with the scent of sawdust and cutting oil throughout, it's the kind of book that anyone who has ever done any kind of woodworking or metalworking should read. Through work (which may be art without your knowing it), the best kind of lasting friendships are built."},{"Title":"Archie's Way: A Memoir of Friendship and Craftsmanship","review":"Wonderfully crafted story depicting life in a small midwestern town.

I was captivated by the engrossing writing style of Mr. Wennberg and was re-educated on the key points surrounding the abortion issue. This is a must buy for any thinking person interested in the ethical debate on abortion."},{"Title":"Life in the Balance: Exploring the Abortion Controversy","review":"I discovered Life In The Balance by Robert Wennberg in 1989. I was shocked by Wennberg's conclusions concerning abortion, including: 1) &quot;...the woman has the right to decide which burdens she will or will not bear (p.173); 2) &quot;...we ought not to seek to criminalize abortion...&quot;(p.175); and, 3) the woman has the &quot;right to make the central decision&quot; (i.e., to have an abortion or not to have one)(p.175).This is a Christian &quot;pro-choice&quot; book, and, coming from an Evangelical Christian background, the book is the only one of its kind. It terribly misses the mark in terms of Biblical exegesis, namely because there isn't any.Throughout the book, Wennberg downplays the status of the fetus and creates sympathy for the pregnant young lady. He denies that a fetus possesses personhood at any stage, and even suggests that infants lack personhood as well (p.48-49). Thus he sets the stage for infanticide.Wennberg's ambivalence about unborn and born children is chilling, because the Bible - by contrast - portrays God as being intimately related to the unborn: &quot;Your hands shaped me and made me... Did you not clothe me with skin and flesh and knit me together with bones and sinews? You gave me life and showed me kindness and in your providence watched over my spirit.&quot; (Job 10:8-12). And many other similar passages from the Bible, Wennberg ignores.I actually wrote a book, no longer available for purchase, which is a response to Life In The Balance. If you search for my name at OCLC you can find it at a number of libraries. Otherwise, there is an online version as well. I go into much greater detail in my book than space affords here.Wennberg flies in the face of the 99.9 percent of Evangelical Christendom which is pro-life."},{"Title":"The Power of Yiddish Thinking : The Way to Mastery Through a Kind of Verbal Karate","review":"The Title should give it away.

Many smart kids cannot raise their reading level because of limited vocabulary. Unlike some other skills, a good vocabulary cannot be achieved over a short period. Young kids need to learn and read extensively to snowball their words. This book is a great help. It organizes essential third grade words in 24 lessons, and teaches them with activities and drills. Its well-designed questions help to clarify the related words that kids often misuse otherwise. The word selection is thoughtful and suitable for 3rd grade level. My child used it for learning as well as for assessment. He finished it in 2 months.For further word practice, I found Beestar weekly ELA program has more such drills (a nice web site at http://www.beestar.org).

I have to admit those words on the cover I have not idea what they mean and this made me feel bad cause they are supposed to be for children. So I bought them and conquer them! The books use a very easy way to let people(children) understand and remember. The only thing is the price is kinda high, more than $10 for a very thin book(they are about 80 pages each book.)

The words featured are important and interesting - not baby words - and every day we see the words we've been working on in the newspaper and hear them on the radio.

I was looking for something that would walk me through all aspects of the program in a way that was easy to understand. Unfortunately, this book didn't meet my expectations at all. The first few chapters gave an adequate overview of the layout of the various windows, menu bars, etc., but as soon as the book progressed into work samples I started feeling lost. The progression of the sections didn't seem to flow together in a logical way, and the practice scripts and projects were sometimes poorly explained. By the time I reached Chapter 10 or so I was feeling like a total imbecile for not understanding the examples. I finally gave up on it and bought Practical Visual InterDev 6 by Michael Amundsen, which has exactly what I wanted--clear, concise, step-by-step examples.

Back in 1859, his seminal work, \\"Farm Drainage: The Principles, Processes, and Effects of Draining Land with Stones, Wood, Plows, and Open Ditches and Especially with Tiles -- Including Tables of Rain-Fall, Evaporation, Filtration, Excavation, Capacity of Pipes; Cost and Number to the Acre, of Tiles, Etc, Etc.\\" was published by A.O. Moore & Co. of New York, and sold for $1.00. Presumably the copyright on the original has expired and this is a reprint.Technologies and costs have changed in the past 150 years, so these parts are obsolete. But, the book still has historical and literary value. The term, \\"French drain\\", comes from it. Here's a quote from the original, found at http://www.concordma.com/magazine/janfeb00/frenchdrains.html:\\"No child, who ever saw a cellar afloat, during [an] inundation, will ever outgrow the impression. You stand on the cellar stairs, and below is a dark waste of waters, of illimitable extent. By the dim glimmer of the dip-candle, a scene is presented which furnishes a tolerable picture of \\"chaos and old night,\\" but defies all description.\\"Empty dry casks, with cider barrels, washtubs, and boxes, ride triumphantly on the surface, while half filled vinegar and molasses kegs, like water-logged ships, roll heavily below. Broken boards and planks, old hoops, and staves, and barrel heads innumerable, are buoyant with this change of the elements; while floating turnips and apples, with here and there a brilliant cabbage head, gleam in this subterranean firmament, like twinkling stars, dimmed by the effulgence of the moon at her full. Magnificent among the lesser vessels of the fleet, \\"like some tall admiral,\\" rides the enormous \\"mash tub,\\" while the astonished rats and mice are splashing about at its base in the dark waters, like sailors just washed, at midnight, from the deck by a heavy sea.\\"The lookers-on are filled with various emotions. The farmer sees his thousand bushels of potatoes submerged, and devoted to speedy decay; the good wife mourns for her diluted pickles, and apple sauce, and her drowned firkins of butter; while the boys are anxious to embark on a raft or in tubs, on an excursion of pleasure and discovery.\\"To avoid such scenes as the above, every cellar which is not upon a dry sandbank should be provided with a drain of some kind, which will at all times, secure.\\""},{"Title":"Shalako","review":"This western from Louis L'Amour first saw light-of-day in 1962 as a Bantam soft cover, and has since been reprinted in both soft and hard covers. The action of the novel takes place in the year 1882 with the main character, Shalako, being as lean as 'a famine wolf', a person who could be 'a brooding man, a wary man,' who had little trust in him. He was the quintessential loner of the west, especially the Apache west. He was strong as many of Louis' most memorable characters were, and I believe him to have been patterned on Louis' himself.With Louis L'Amour's death in June, 1988, we have no further 'new' material from his pen. But thankfully we have many westerns such as this one that can be read, and reread.And after innumerable readings, this is yet one of my favorite ones. The character appeals to me, as does the time frame of the Apache wars in Arizona, and the international European collection of people. For me this book has as much character development as you will ever find in any of L'Amour's work. But again, I read Louis L'Amour for fun, for adventure, for escapism, not for a lesson in literature such as I found in college. I think too many people look for things in L'Amour's writings that he never, ever intended.As a man who really knew the desert from experience, books such as this one come across reeking of love of desert and experience. Sometimes when reading a L'Amour such as this one, I pull out one of my hundreds of Arizona Highways magazines to soak up the visuals of his desert writing.If you read this L'Amour and do not find it favorable, I find it hard to think that any of his writings could please. This is pretty much what the man was and did.Read this one of the Sonoran Desert and the Apache and enjoy. Take a full bandoleer of cartridges and full canteen along though, for it can get mighty dangerous and thirsty out there in the desert, roaming around with the Apaches on the rampage.Semper Fi."},{"Title":"Shalako","review":"This story hits the ground running and never stops.

If you enjoy a good western, this is a good one to read."},{"Title":"Shalako","review":"Originally published in 1962 this book ranks right up there with L'Amour's other early works like Hondo and Fallon before he was cranking out so many books per year under a contract with his publisher. Chief Cato is leading war parties of Apaches out of Mexico across the border into the desert, hoping to draw some braves off the reservations. A party of European big game hunters far from the nearest Army post is in their path. Shalako, a real character who is wise in the ways of the desert and the Apaches, stumbles across the group and agrees to try and help them get out safely. Lots of Indian skirmishes in this one, plenty of action. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Shalako","review":"Despite the three star rating, I like this book. The problem is L'Amour has a way of killing off the Indians like they were of no more importance than a fly being swatted on the wall. It's like the guys on Star Trek that get beamed down and you just know they're gonna get zapped. That's how his Indian chararcters are. They are there just to be zapped. Their lives are meaningless. It's a shame, because he was a pretty good storyteller, if not somewhat cliche at times."},{"Title":"Shalako","review":"In the Cinema Hall of Shame, there should be a branch for books that Hollywood screwed up. One of them would the Louis L'Amour \\"Shalako.\\" The novel is excellent but the film - even with the great Sean Connery - is awful. Shalako - one of L'Amour's gritty, intelligent Western heroes - runs across a European hunting party that is soon trapped between Indians and outlaws. It takes all of Shalako's skill and bravery to get some of them to safety.L'Amour was not enamoured of aristocrats but his portrait of them is honest and nuanced. A few may be snobs but, in the book, they display good traits too. In the film version, the party is second-rate stick figures. The Indians - in L'Amour's time they were called Indians and it wasn't a pejorative term - are savage but they, too, are fully rounded in the novel. They have different values than whites and some of those values are not admirable - which is why L'Amour books are not politically correct - but realistic.One of the author's best."},{"Title":"Shalako","review":"Arrived in great condition. I couldn't put it down until I was finished reading it."},{"Title":"Shalako","review":"Louis Lamour's book Shalako is a very interesting book. It is very easy to read. It is about a man named Shalako and he rescues a group of European hunters from Apaches. The setting is the Mohave Desert and along the Mexican Border.The hunting parties' leader is a wealthy general. There is women in the group to and other wealthy men. Shalako first meets the group when he helps one of the women of the group back the parties' campsite and this is when he discovers they are going to be attacked by Apaches. Shalako then runs away from the group. But is instincts tell him to help the group escape and to take them to safety because of a beautiful woman traveling with the group and the other women in the group.The book is as exciting as all of Lamour's other books. This book will make you get lost in it sometimes. You know like you're the main character and you can hear and see everything he does. The book is very easy to read and not boring. The book will keep you wanting to read it and find out what happens at the end. Some parts of the book will keep you on your toes because of the danger and excitement. Also the book is not very long only about 150 pages. Personal I don't like long books because it seems like they go on for every and every. I think if you a person that likes short book and a exciting story this is the one for you.I have read many of Lamour's books and I think he is a very good author. He also brings back a exciting time in your history with his novels. I really did enjoy the book and if you don't want to read the book the check out the movie \\"Shalako\\" that is based off the book."},{"Title":"Shalako","review":"What else can you say but it a L'Amour.

This title was fast paced, lots of action, interesting characters (the Sean Connery film was pretty close to this novel's storyline) and the usual deadly Apaches and ruthless gunmen out for themselves. L'Amour's novels are condensed, so don't expect a sprawling epic for the most part, just tight stories and lots of gunplay and galloping stallions and sweat. One major problem with this one, his main characters are constantly 'squatting on their heels'. This happens a lot in this one. A minor point, but why know kneeling or one one knee or some such. Lots of hot coffee gets consumed also. Still, a solid action-packed western with a fleshed out lead characer that was nicely done."},{"Title":"Shalako","review":"I really enjoy reading Louis LaMour's books and am trying to collect all his books (except for the Hopolong Cassidy books, don't care as much for them)."},{"Title":"Nun: A Memoir","review":"Mary's story is the story of thousands of young Catholics who searched for God and found Him/Her in the convent, seminary or monastery. She tells of the strictness she experienced in the noviate and as a fuly vowed nun. You and I get to experience the life of the convent from the eyes of this dedicated nun. She begins to doubt the austerity and restrictiveness as a result of the openness of Vatican II. She takes the plunge to Freedom. We see her struggle to find the same God experience outside the Convent. She does find this in her marriage and new life. What I like best is that Mary shows her deep appreciation and love for all those nuns she learned and lived with. It's a book that will move you to tears, remembering the old ways."},{"Title":"Nun: A Memoir","review":"Mary Gilligan Wong's Nun is quite simply the best of the semi-fictionalized nun memoirs that have been written in the last 35 years. It tells the poignant tale of Mary Agnes Gilligan, good Catholic girl, who leaves her home in Illinois in the 1950s to enter a pre-convent girls' school run by the Sisters of Blessing. Wong's intense narrative chronicles her years with the sisters, roughly 1957 through 1968. At the outset, Mary Agnes is a dreamy-eyed American girl who wants to leave all things secular to follow Christ and live as his bride. But matrimony to a crucified bridegroom takes it toll in many humiliating and infantilizing instances. Those of us who had encounters with nuns will recognize the kernels of painful memory in each of these scenarios that Wong so clearly limns. What happens to dreamy-eyed Mary Agnes? In becoming Sister Mary de Paul, she enters the Medieval world of nuns living in the modern world. The sixties explode outside the convent's walls and Sister Mary de Paul begins to chafe at the restrictions of convent life and at the impositions of her superiors, who treat their novices and postulants as children--all in the name of upholding the Holy Rule that governs a nun's every move and every thought--from the way she walks, to how she talks, to how she eats, to what she does with her eyes; the Rule dictates that a good nun at all times keeps custody of herself. She does not galumph. She is Christ's bride and must act accordingly. What is so refreshing about Wong's narrative is that she does not bash the Catholic Church, the pope, the sisters; although she may challenge some of the Church's outmoded tenets, Wong ultimately acknowledges the gifts she received as the crucified groom's wife: a love for nature and the seasons of the Church, an understanding of the need for solitude and contemplation, the simplicity to be had in a regulated life. What, ultimately, seems to drive the young nun from the convent is her desire to help people, to change the world, to make a difference...to do that first before being a nun. But first, she must take on the greatest challenge of all: that of confronting herself, of coming to know herself, not as a nun in a community, not just as a woman, but as a human being."},{"Title":"Nun: A Memoir","review":"Mary's life as a nun started in 9th grade. Why do people become nuns? For her the purpose was to strive for the highest goal she knew. Behind the scenes she tells how she was popular in the high school for nuns, the pranks they played, the fun they had, plus how their lives were ordered down to the last detail. They had to get dressed alone in their cubicles by dressing under their nightgowns. That way they were never indecent. Finally she asked herself if the life of a nun was worth throwing away a normal life and family for. Really intersting book. You won't be able to put it down!"},{"Title":"Nun: A Memoir","review":"It is an excellent biography. Mary Wong decided to be a nun when she was only 14 years old. She was influenced by the nuns at her Precious Blood Elementary School. They always smile and are very kind to the students. They are patience and knowledgable in the classroom. However, she was too young to see the emotional layers underneath the cheerful surface. Only had she entered the convent, she realized the conflicts between a normal life and a community life. Most important was that she had to &quot;give up&quot; her family, including her father, her mother, her brothers, and her sisters. She was only allowed to see her family on special occasions. After 12 years struggling and trying very hard to fit in the community life in the convent, she gave up and decided back to the &quot;world.&quot; In this book, Mary Wong described the strictness and restrictness life in the noviate. What I like most is that she shows her respect and love to all the nuns she learned and lived with. Even though she left, she still believes that &quot;best things are more than bad things in the life of convent.&quot; This is a book that reminds my own experience in Catholic school in the mid-1970s. The fun I had with the nuns and the things I learned from them. It is a book that makes you remember the &quot;good old days.&quot;"},{"Title":"Nun: A Memoir","review":"Was replacing an original copy of this book that is no longer in print. Husband was a neighbor of the author growing up and I had misplaced his autographed copy. Was happy to purchase this replacement. Was very pleased with condition of the book and the speedy delivery. Item was exactly as described. Happy Amazon Buyer!!"},{"Title":"Nun: A Memoir","review":"Why does this happen to me??? I begin a book, it's capturing me: my mind, my heart...then all of a sudden, it takes a turn for the worst! I thought, without a doubt, such would NOT be the case with this book because I was pushing toward the end, and still feeling full and satisfied, hardly able to put it down! Then I started to feel things unravel. Don't get me wrong here: this was a strong book, with a powerful sentiment. I was especially drawn my this woman's desire to serve God as a lifetime vocation. I enjoyed reading about her life growing up, identifying with much of what I read, seeing myself in her as a young girl. I can appreciate one's desire to serve God so fully, so passionately. Indeed, I admire it. But when this woman decides to finally leave (for reasons which just didn't quite satisfy me as much as if she would have left earlier after developing the same similar health problems as many of the other nuns), it's as if she not only tosses the Catholic church out the window, but God as well! Now, listen...I'm sorry to lower the overall score here, and I'm sure those of you who have read the book will probably heartily disagree with me. I'm not, nor have I ever been Catholic. But being a Christian, I feel like this: if you don't want to be a nun, FINE! There are certainly other ways to serve God. But don't decide NOT to be a nun, then act like you don't even KNOW God's word, like you have no desire to be obedient to this God you claim you felt called to serve. When the author decides to leave the convent, she becomes involved with a man, and the dropping of a very particular clue leads us to believe she ends up having sex with this man. Okay. There's nothing wrong with having sex, Mary, but WHY NOT GET MARRIED FIRST!!!!???!!!! Is celebacy only celebacy when ordered to bind yourself in it??? Doesn't God's word still count for ANYTHING when He commands us not to have sex outside of the bounds of marriage???? Why is it that when I read about priests and nuns who just can't take the celibate thing anymore, they have sex within these \\"meaningful\\" relationships, but they don't get married???? Obviously, by marrying, they would have to forsake their vocation, but aren't they being just as disobedient by blatantly disregarding God's word??? Or doesn't the Bible matter anymore??? Is it just that nuns are overwhelmed with a rule for this and a rule for that, that when they finally do taste a morsel of freedom, they run with it??? I don't know, but I was just disappointed. I mean, after Mary left the convent, she spoke a lot about her travels, her intellectual conquests, etc., her marriage to a Protestant (was he at least a believer??? She doesn't even SAY!!), but she really fails to say anything about whether or not she still has a passion for God; she doesn't mention ANYTHING about the continued importance of her RELATIONSHIP with God...it's all about the world, and freedom, nail polish and male \\"friends\\". Sure, I can understand that she feels she has a lot to \\"catch up\\" on. I can really appreciate this. But what happened to this all-consuming desire to serve God? What happened to that \\"pull\\", that \\"tug\\" in her inner being? I get the impression that lots of other things became much more important, and that now she just wanted to \\"live life\\"...suck the marrow out of life!! I know, I know, I'm strange, and no one will probably be able to relate to my point of view, but I'm used to that. Thanks for listening to me ramble (had a lot on my mind...I just finished the book last night)."},{"Title":"Weep not, child (African writers series)","review":"This was a quick read portraying the struggles of a young boy coming of age in Kenya with the onset of the Mau Mau uprising and the opression that led to it. The novel's simplicity may make it seem like an elementary book, but this is what makes it genuine and a good beginning for anyone who is just starting to learn about the atrocities that happened throughout white man's rule of Africa and what is still going on today. It's not hard to see why Ngugi was so wrongfully punished for his bringing these events to the forefront as he definitely was making some point-blank political statements (and very brave)."},{"Title":"Weep not, child (African writers series)","review":"Njoroge is a Gikuyu boy who is enters into a western school. He feels that education is the only path for him to help his family, his village and his country. Yet, his dreams get destroyed. The Mau Mau uprising sends his proletariat brothers into the forest killing settlers and trying to get England to leave Kenya.Ngugi's characterization of the uprising and the people involved is quite interesting. Some characters are connected with the Mau Mau not because of high-minded ideals but because of personal grievances with others. The white characters are considered outsiders by the Gikuyu but consider themselves Africans.Njoroge becomes the synthesis character. Through his education he connects with the colonizers; he has a romantic connection with the collaborating chief's daughter; and, at home he is connected to Gikuyu past. He predicts that \\"tomorrow\\" there will be a new Kenya and he and the chief's daughter will be the foundation of it.Weep Not, Child is Ngugi's first novel and it reads like one. His next novel \\"The River Between,\\" with a similar message, is a far better work. I would not make this a \\"must read.\\""},{"Title":"Weep not, child (African writers series)","review":"&quot;Weep Not, Child&quot; chronicles a young boy, Njoroge, as he grows up admist the Mau Mau war and the conflict between the African natives and the British colonial rulers. The book is in essence about the hopes and dreams of a young boy coming being affected by the outside world and how the outside world changes a person.The novel also addresses the political conflict that was occurring in Kenya in the 1950's. The author incorporates a description of the power of the white rulers, the bitterness of the Africans at being enslaved on their own land and their attempt to rise up against the tyranny, and finally deals with the poor relations between the blacks and Indian merchants, who are looked down upon by the black community.I read this novel as a part of my IB English class. We read this book in combination with &quot;1984&quot; (Orwell). It was a very powerful story when it dealt with Njoroge's life, his thoughts and his feelings but due to the length of the novel (136 pages) one only gets a fairly superficial explanation of the historical and cultural context of the book. Also, this novel is a book in translation, so some of the sentence and grammatical structure can be a bit tricky at times. All in all, a very good book."},{"Title":"Weep not, child (African writers series)","review":"The story concerns itself with an important period in the life of the author's tribe in Kenya in the 1950's - the Mau Mau Emergency at a time when I myself lived in Kenya. It does not pretend to be other than a subjective fictional account and yet is more accurate than the recent supposed historical account by Caroline Elkins, outrageously inaccurate as that is. Ngugi's book goes to the heart of a young boy whose burning desire is to get an education at a time when conflict and killing were all around him. It is beautifully and simply told with a very authentic 'young' voice."},{"Title":"Weep not, child (African writers series)","review":"Got this book very fast, and was in good shape as well.

Not as rich, in some ways, as River Between, but a very compelling journey into the problems of resistance at the dawn of a comprador age."},{"Title":"The Professional Radical: Conversations with Saul Alinsky","review":"We've heard a lot lately about Saul Alinsky, the founder of the community organizing movement that gave us ACORN and Barack Obama, the man who Hillary Clinton wrote her Wellesley honors thesis on, and the man who dedicated his book Rules For Radicals to Lucifer, \\"the first radical...who rebelled against the establishment and did it so effectively that he at least won his own kingdom.\\"But reading the man in his own words, you find a more interesting and less monochromatically evil personality than such a resume would imply. W.F. Buckley described him as \\"very close to being an organizational genius\\" and he employed that genius in a passionate pursuit of what he thought of as justice. His utopian vision was flawed, his methods were often immoral, his ends were sometimes unworthy or misguided. But I still can't help admiring his brutal honesty. For example, in 1965 he already saw that \\"the Poverty Program was bound to turn into a prize piece of political pornography. It's a huge political pork barrel, and a feeding trough for the welfare industry, surrounded by sanctimonious, hypocritical, phony, moralising crap.\\" I couldn't agree more. On the subject of race relations, he was refreshingly contemptuous of \\"guilt-ridden, screwed-up, neurotic liberals\\" and their overweening hypocrisy.It's also kind of an interesting story. Alinsky's first experience of community organizing was teaching his fellow college students how to steal their meals from local chain restaurants. When the University of Chicago gave him a graduate fellowship in criminology, he wormed his way into the Capone gang as an observer.Don't get me wrong. The figure that emerges from a second look at Alinsky is still not all that attractive. But it is much more interesting than the caricature portrayed by Glenn Beck et al. If you can imagine Dorothy Day as the unbelieving child of orthodox Russian Jewish immigrants, with a completely immanentized, earthly faith and hope and no notion of charity whatever, you pretty much have him."},{"Title":"Soulwinner","review":"Many years ago, I participated in a week of outreach led by Lex Loizides at the end of the week he presented everyone with a copy of a paperback Christian book- C. H . Spurgeon's the soulwinner. Why that book you might well ask. Why would a book written during the Victorian era in London make my list of books every christian should read?Quite simply there is no book more calculated to unsettle us from our willingness to accept a form of chrisitanity that was as alien to Spurgeon as it was to Paul, that when week after week no one gets saved in our churches. Spurgeon expected salvations every time he preached and got them.Spurgeon outlines the kind of preaching we need to preach, but also the kind of people we need be to win souls. If you want your heart stirred to greater faith, and greater work for souls there is no better book to read. It is short and a great introduction to this man of God who was probably the greatest English speaking preacher to have ever lived. I cannot recommend it highly enough.Spurgeon is no hyper-calvinist urging a message that says \\"whosoever may come\\" but at the same time he is no Arminian either. His faith in the sovereignty of God in ordaining both salvation and the means of salvation inspires his confidence that God intends to save many by the means of us his servants.Be warned, if you read this book and respond to its message you will find yourself dissatisfied with the state of the church today. If it drives you to your knees crying out to God to help us to see a restoration of soulwinning preaching it will have done its job well- as it has with many before you."},{"Title":"Soulwinner","review":"I believe that the Bible clearly reveals God's sovereignty in salvation. Beginning with the person and work of the Holy Spirit in regeneration (John 3:3-8; Titus 3:4-5). The work and provision of the Son, who justifies the sinner by the redemption paid by His shed blood (1 Peter 1:18-19; Col 1:20), and of course the purpose of the Father who according to His good pleasure causes us to be born from above (Eph 1:3-4,11; 1 Peter 1:3). However, as children of God who have been rescued out of the power of darkness, our soul's desire should be to reach the lost. We are afterall ambassadores for Christ (2 Cor 5:20), and faith comes by hearing the word of Christ and the glorious gospel (Rom 10:17). I admit that sharing the gospel message has been something that I have failed miserably at. After reading this heart-felt book by an author I have deep respect for, I have been given me even a greater passion for reaching out to the lost. Psalm 97:10 says \\"You that love the Lord, hate evil\\". What could be more evil than to keep our mouths closed, when we may be just the vessel that God would use to save a soul from an eternity of torment seperated from Christ."},{"Title":"Soulwinner","review":"If you want to learn about the art of winning souls, I highly recommend that you study Spurgeon's Soulwinner.

An unexpected blizzard just stranded Jennifer Glenn in the heart of the mountains, and her boots aren't made for walking. But the Jeep's buried in a snowdrift and a lonely log cabin is the only shelter for miles around. Just her luck: there's only one bed. She's not about to share it with Logan Taylor, even though the handsome rancher swept her up in his arms and carried her over the threshold. He can just take the chair by the fire like a gentleman--if he is a gentleman--and he can just stop calling her darlin'. Or she'll never fall asleep...STRANGE BEDFELLOWHappy holidays were only a memory for Dina Chandler in the years after her husband's plane disappeared over the jungle. But the Christmas to come will be a celebration like no other...now that Blake has returned. His long ordeal has changed everything--except his passionate love for the woman who was once his wife. Winning her back will be the greatest challenge--and the greatest gift--of all.And my review:These two stores were marketed as having been \\"updated\\" for the 2003 release date, but from what I can tell, not much has been changed. There are references to cell phones, email and PC's, but that's about it. The attitudes of the characters are very dated, especially in the gender roles.For example, in DARLING JENNY, the heroine comes to the big city to land her dream job. She's had years of studies to prepare, has dreamed of this for most of her life and worked so hard...and she's come to be...a secretary. With all the buildup, I would have expected that she was going to be a lab tech working on cancer research. Nope, her dreams are of typing and filing and making coffee. (Not to knock secretaries mind you, I was one myself, but don't make it sound like the heroine is out to change the world.)And her \\"evil\\" boss, the man that she's running from? He wanted to have sex with her. The way it was hyped up about how cruel he was, I thought he must have called her into his office and raped her on his desk. Not dated her and expected to have consensual sex. Hey, I have no problem with a woman who doesn't sleep around (I admire women like that, usually), but her attitude just goes to show the book's age.Once the hero showed up, he and heroine descended into petty bickering that lasted for most of the book, in between a few heated scenes to show progress in their relationship. And I couldn't stand the way the hero kept treating her like she was a stupid little girl. I'm sure many men did treat women this way in the 70s, but it's not exactly what most women today would find romantic.STRANGE BEDFELLOW also showed its age. I didn't have a problem with the recycled plot (man comes back to claim his wife after being declared dead), but I did have a problem with the hero. He was supposed to be tortured, but instead came across as mean. I got as far as the first \\"love\\" scene. I put the word love in quotes because there was no tenderness or love that I could see. It was more of the hero saying \\"I had to be celibate for two years, you're my wife, I want sex, so lie on your back.\\" Not romantic. Geez, buddy, give the woman at least a day or two to adjust to the fact that you're not dead. How about \\"I love you so much, Dina, I've missed you and want to make love to you\\"? Nope. Just \\"I'm horny, give me sex, now!\\" I know this was often par for the course, given sexual attitudes in the 70s, but it's little more than offensive to today's modern woman.As a very happily married stay-at-home mom with a young son, I don't really consider myself a hard-core feminist, but even I found these stories irritating with their dated portrayal of women and over-arrogant men. Not recommended by this reader."},{"Title":"Maybe This Christmas","review":"The book was really good, but when I got to page 151, it didn'tfinish the story of My Darling Jenny, instead it jumped to page177 and went on with the next story Strange Bedfellow. I thought this was weird. Is there pages missing or what?"},{"Title":"Maybe This Christmas","review":"You'll find that a lot of books written a long time ago just don't translate well into today's world. 30 years ago, attitudes were different. Take Jenny for instance, in My Darling Jenny. She found it really hard to get a job WITH HER DEGREE, all because she was a young, attractive woman. I'm not going to say it would be any easier today with our economy, but surely they wouldn't laugh in your face. I only read the first story in this book actually, as I don't have the stomach to try the second one. But it was enough for me to decide to put it back on the shelf.So let's take a thorough look at My Darling Jenny. Jenny is 22, just a year older than myself, and has all the maturity of a 16 year old. And the cause of all her troubles is because she is basically a prude. Hey now, don't get me wrong...she's got every right to wait until her wedding day, but Jenny here is just a tease. That's a harsh view, but I just don't have any love for her. She just really got into their kisses and the decides that no, you can't touch me at all! And oh my Lord, Logan...\\"I'll touch you any damn time I please!\\" WTF? Are you engaged to her? Are you dating her? Cause as far as I can tell, you don't even LIKE her...that sounds like the start of RAPE to me. And it's all because he just...loves her so bad. Yeah, I rolled my eyes too.So anyway, Jenny runs away after Brad wants to have sex with her and she cries and says no. He basically tells her he was taking her out on dates and stuff just to get in her pants. Lovely. But someone had to 'screw' her up. She runs to see her sister in Wyoming and her plane is diverted cause of the weather. So she's in the airport and she notices this guy looking at her. Right away she's got him pegged as a womanizer who just wouldn't give a fig about anyone but himself. She's obviously so experienced. Turns out the guy is her sister's boss and our hero of the story.From the moment they meet, they throw barbs at each other. I thought kids stopped flirting like this in the 5th grade. She doesn't even try to like him, cause remember, she's got him pegged already. Then we meet her sister, whom Jenny suspects is in love with Logan. In her head she's seeing lots of stuff between them. But turns out her sister who is supposed to be 27 is just as immature when it comes to her love interest. This Dirk guy. He's an artist and Sheila (the sister) wanted him to get a 'real' job so he'd have a steady paycheck. This is probably also dated, as today I don't think that would have been a really big issue. But he refuses and she tells him to go and she lives in misery that Logan understands and Jenny misinterprets.Oh and at this point, Jenny is in love with Logan. SKIIRRRRRRT. Let's put the brakes on a second here. Jenny is in love with Logan? WHERE did this happen? Last page I was on, they were treating each other like crap. What, did show not tell not exist in the 70s? Instead of showing this love between Jenny and Logan, the author steps up on the NON-EXISTENT romance between Logan and Sheila. I mean, I was even starting to wonder!Oh oh oh and the Brad guy shows back up at the hotel that Logan owns/Sheila manages. But no, he wasn't coming after Jenny. In truth he'd probably forgotten all about her. But as soon as he sees her, he's proclaiming love to her and stuff. And since Logan supposedly is in love with Jenny himself, this just pee-pees right in his cornflakes. He starts making up ridiculous rules so that Jenny can't see Brad and guess what? She never confronts him, though it makes her 'seethe with anger.' Whatever.So now Dirk is in the group and Sheila seems to be talking to him again. Jenny sees Logan at a ring shop, buying an engagement ring that she things is for Sheila. At this point, I'm not sure it's for Jenny either. But the four go on this ski trip and Jenny get guilted into it cause Logan tells her he wants this to be perfect for Sheila. Cause he's going to propose to her? Or to Jenny? Or is Dirk and Logan going at it? At this point I just don't know anymore.Sheila gets hurt though. Put a ski pole through her foot (ouch???) and broke her arm. So Logan dictates that her kids go stay with their grandparents and Sheila and Jenny come stay at his ranch. He even gets him mom to convince Jenny to come. Poor poor Jenny. She keeps busy by cleaning the house and cooking and stuff. Cause Logan doesn't pay much attention to her. (Remember, this is Jenny's POV). One night she gets up to go make herself some tea. Like in an actual tea kettle with a teabag and stuff. Logan shows up in the doorway \\"I thought you were asleep.\\" and startles her, causing her to spill a little of the hot water on herself. He reacts instantly, chiding her like a small child. Jeez, I burn myself all the time in the kitchen...it happens.So he rushes over to her (he's shirtless, she's in a 'short robe' is all we're told.) And he kisses her. She's all into the kiss too now. Then she realizes that hey, kissing is naughty and my virtue is slipping away, and tells him to stop. Surprise, surprise, he doesn't. He rips her robe and kisses her harder. She tears away, \\"I hate you, don't touch me\\" ladida and he declares that he has the right to touch her anytime, anywhere he pleases. He kisses her again I think and then tells her to get out.The next morning she packs her suitcase and hops a ride to the airport to go back to Minneapolis. Well turns out the flight doesn't leave for like, 5 hours...so she's a sitting duck. I'd have hidden in the bathroom or something at least. So Logan appears and they have this heart to heart talk. He's loved her from the beginning, and she loves him so much she'd just die if he didn't love her. Dirk and Sheila are getting married and the ring Logan bought was for Jenny. They kiss and makeup, despite the fact that he was well on his way to raping her last night.Gee, there were so many butterflies in my tummy at the romance of it all, I just couldn't sleep the rest of the night. No wait, that was nausea. Folks, do yourself a favor. Let such stories stay in the 70s. They don't belong in our times today."},{"Title":"Maybe This Christmas","review":"I picked this book up at the library just so I could get a taste of Janet Dailey - OMG, what a waste of my time! I didn't even bother reading the second story - Darling Jenny was more than enough! I skipped through so much of it because it literally hurt my head to read it. Just flat out awful and the storyline was just flat out stupid!"},{"Title":"Maybe This Christmas","review":"This book purchase was a HUGE mistake! It is a 2-in-1 book, and the two stories are from 1973 and 1974. They are Neanderthal romances at best - the male leads are domineering, aggressive, inconsiderate, and completely unheroic. These are not romance stories by any stretch of the imagination, and the book itself is a bit like a wolf in sheep's clothing. The cover indicates that you might be in for a nice Christmas tale or two, but the cover was just a sales feature. The stories have nothing at all to do with Christmas and, in fact, do not even take place at Christmas-time. I think it was a horrible way to introduce readers to this author, especially if you have never read her stuff before (which I hadn't). Perhaps this author has improved her storytelling since the 70s, but based on this nonsense I wouldn't waste my time with her again. The stories were poorly written."},{"Title":"Building a Greenland kayak","review":"After doing what I thought was exhaustive research on the subject, I started building my skin on frame kayak. I based most of my building on Cunningham's book, Building the Greenland Kayak, an excellent resource. But after struggling and failing with the rib bending step, I decided to purchase the Starr book. After Reading the rib bending section (Mark calls them \\"frames\\") I realized that Mark Starr offers some more novice-friendly solutions to skin on frame construction. I immediately went back and read the entire book before proceeding with my project. Would I still recommend the Cunningham book? Most certainly! As a matter of fact I would recommend reading and researching any material available to you before building a Greenland kayak. But I would definately begin my research by reading Mark Starr's book."},{"Title":"Building a Greenland kayak","review":"The book has all of the esential information to build a Skin On Frame Greenland Kayak. While at times the instructions may be vague, the reader is reminded that the Kayak is built to meet the builders specific needs.

The book is very detailed and provides many insights from the author regarding Greenland style Kayaks.I would definitely reccomend this book."},{"Title":"Building a Greenland kayak","review":"This is a book that de-mitified the contruction of a greenland kayak.

We read it over and over again, and he can do a sign or a sound or a word for each of the animals now. The language of the \\"story\\" by Leah Gale is incredibly simple and repetitive (which is probably what kids love about it), but the illustrations by an early-career Richard Scarry are wonderful for all ages. My husband is particularly fond of the \\"beautiful white nay-nay.\\" (Our son calls horses nay-nays because, according to the book: \\"'Neigh-neigh,' says the horse.\\") In addition to the featured animals: horse, cow, sheep, chicken, pig, turkey, duck, cat and dog, there is a barn owl in the illustration of the farmyard in the first page and a tiny mouse hides in several other scenes, so your kids can learn those too. I would have never gone out and bought this book new--it was a garage sale find--but it's been a total hit, so it'll definitely stay in our library for a long time!UPDATE - We just had turnips for the first time. My now 19-month-old thought about this concept of turnips for a while and looked me right in the face and said \\"Sheep.\\" Why? Because we've read this book a thousand times and Farmer Jones gives turnips to the sheep. To be quite honest, one of the reasons I wanted to cook turnips was because they look so damn pretty in this book. Suffice it to say, this remains and influential volume in our house. :)"},{"Title":"Richard Scarry's The Animals of Farmer Jones (Big Little Golden Book)","review":"This fun book brings back a great memory of reading it to my, then 4 year old nephew Anthony.We were cuddled up on the couch just being silly and he brings the book over from the coffee table for me to read to him.

Found the usual amount of errors: exercises that fail, wrong figures, etc. It is still better than most. You will learn a great deal about SQL Server 7. The one error most annoying is the fact the authors wrote the book with SQL installed on a domain controller, not on a member server per Microsoft's installation instructions/recommendations. Once I figured out what they had done then Chapter 5 and parts of Chapter 8 worked since my install was on a member server. Remember the SAM on the member server never receives a copy of the SAM on the PDC so you have to tell the member server about domain accounts by logging onto the member server itself and placing them there via user manager.However this book does not do much for the test. I have taken both the Beta Exam and the Live Exam and passed. The chapter review questions are extremely easy. Compared to the real exam this book lacks the scenario type questions you will see that are given to you from the perspective of \\"you're the consultant on site. How would you do this...\\". While this book did cover traces and replaying them it was a very light run. It did not cover how to modify them and then replay them. Also not covered were issues with NT that could cause SQL to halt/fail.If you plan on taking the test I recommend the following strategy:Use this book Use Transcender (I was a Beta tester and it is excellent)Use Books Online or better yet buy the actual documentation set.Good LuckSteven C.

I used this text for several years and I appreciated its accessibility to a wide variety of students.The most valuable function of the book is that its evolutionary interpretation provides students with a set of non-subjective categories to use as tools. Students apply these categories to many expressions of religion and discover that they can analyze religions without feeling compelled to compare other religions to their own sets of beliefs and practices.Paradoxically, the freedom to be objectively analytical in their approach to religion provides many students with opportunities to revisit their own sense of religiousness. It supplies a useful and safe context for meaningful class discussions and for individual papers.Both the young-adult college students and the older students seem to find a lot to identify with in In the Presence of Mystery. The younger students tend to be open to (and opened by) the book's perspective. The older students tend to be enthusiastic about interpreting their own life experiences through the book's themes and categories.The style of the book is engaging and informal. I have not found another text that can do as much as well and I highly recommend it as an introduction to religion."},{"Title":"In the Presence of Mystery: An Introduction to the Story of Human Religiousness","review":"This book was a real page-turner for me.

In 1993 Professor Samuel P. Huntington wrote an article entitled \\"The Clash of Civilizations?\\" in Foreign Affairs Magazine. This article generated a considerable amount of interest and criticism and two follow-up books. Professor Huntington expanded his original thesis into a book \\"The Clash of Civilizations\\" which was published in 1996. At the same time, his original article, along with 7 critical responses and a rebuttal of this criticism by Professor Huntington was also published. The book being reviewed here is the book containing these critical articles, hence the term debate in the title.Huntington's thesis is that future international conflicts will be based mostly on cultural lines, resulting in a clash of civilizations, with a very important one being the clash between the civilization of Islam and the West. Seven distinguished professors and journalists, namely; Fouad Ajami, Kishore Mahbubani, Robert L. Bartley, Liu Binyan, Jeane J. Kirkpatrick, Albert L. Weeks, and Gerard Piel, wrote the critical articles contained in this book. As noted, the book also contains the original article and a rebuttal to these seven articles. It is important to read other viewpoints and these articles make an important counterpoint to Huntington's book and should be read along with it.Be forewarned however, this book is only 67 pages long, of which 25 pages are taken up with Professor Huntington's original article, with an additional 12 pages allotted to his rebuttal of the criticism leveled against it. Most of the critical articles are very sketchy and very short. One of the articles is only a single page long, one is only two pages long, two are four pages long and two are five pages long. This leaves only that by Fouad Ajami, which at ten pages is long enough to develop its criticism. If you already have the book that expands upon the original article, you will be getting relatively little new material for your money. If you have neither book, this (the debate book) is a nice place to start since it provides the original article and opposing views. Then, if you are sufficiently interested in more, you can get the book containing the expanded version of Professor Huntington's ideas. It would have been nice if both books could have been combined, but this was not possible as there are different publishers for each."},{"Title":"The clash of civilizations?: The debate (A Foreign affairs reader)","review":"This short book does an excellent job of providing the reader with both sides of the \\"West vs. the Rest\\" debate. In addition to Huntington's essay, originally published in the fall of 1993, there are several counter-essays that argue against Huntington's original \\"Clash of Civilizations?\\" The book is finished off with another essay by Huntington, a counter to the counter-essays, entitled \\"If Not Civilizations, What?\\" Even though the essays were all originally published in the early 1990's, alot of their arguments still ring true in the world we live in today."},{"Title":"The clash of civilizations?: The debate (A Foreign affairs reader)","review":"I enjoyed the original book but this debate replies don't go in depth to become intriguing.

Protests against Danish Mohammed-Cartoons (2006), Hamas in Gaza, war against IRAQ, trouble with IRAN.And therefore there is no end of TV-discussions how to react. Huntington, former foreign policy aide to the US State Department speaks of so-called \\"fault-line-wars\\", which exist between the cultures (religions) and will give endlessly smouldering. As examples the hunter Huntington specifies among other things the Gulf War and Afghanistan.Hotspots seemed to be on the fault lines between the religions in Chechnya, the Middle East, Tibet, Sri Lanka, and Bosnia. In Yugoslavia the Serbs where supported by Russian diplomatist while Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Iran and Libya provided arms to the Bosnians. Yugoslavia is an example of what happens to a country where religious factors become the means for identifying oneself.And it could develop worse: Koran-Sura 9, verse 5: \\"Fight and slay the pagans wherever you find them. And seize them, beleaguer them and lie in wait for them, in every stratagem [of war].\\" Islam teaches that Muslims must not befriend Jews and Christians. Surat Al-Maidah 5:51 says, \\"O ye, who believe, take not the Jews or the Christians for your friends and protectors. They are but friends and protectors to each other.\\"In the chapter about how to stop those \\"break-line-wars\\" Huntington writes: \\"The force along cultural break lines may stop for a while completely, but it rarely ends really.\\" \\"These problems become still more complicated, if the cultures involved do not have a core state.\\" Hierarchy-creditor finishing sentence of this important chapter: \\"A break line war cooks from down highly, a break line peace seeps from above down\\". We hope, Huntington will know, which at the end is \\"above\\". Another unsentimental, very tough-minded Huntington analysis: \\"The conflict can disappear fast and brutally, as a group extinguishes the other one.\\"The fact that cultural difference could brought to coexistence, into an equilibrium, supported by a progressive deliberated secularization of all denominations (accompanied by a sober transformation of all too denomination-linked educating systems) - such roots of thought we unfortunately miss in this provoking sermon, mainly dominated by a military perspective..."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"I enjoyed reading Brave New World, by Aldous Huxley. This book is an eerie look at things to come. A reason that I personally enjoyed this book is that it is very interesting. The reason for this is the novel is not very far from fiction. In this day in age with the onset of cloning, perhaps all the issues discussed in this book may, eventually, become reality. This book eludes to the dangers of a standardized human that is controlled entirely by government, like \\"big brother\\". From reading this book there is one phrase that is shown to be Ironic. This phrase is the motto of the \\"world state\\". The motto is one of the first things read; it is \\" COMMUNITY, IDENTITY, STABILITY\\". The irony Is that people don't really have their own identities. What the phrase means is that shun everyone not in your community, play the identity you were assigned at birth (Alpha, Beta etc.) and keep the \\"cog in the wheel\\" society stable. I also enjoyed this book due to the way the some of the chapters were set up. I like they way the author split up some of the chapters into parts. These parts show what is happening in a different place at the same time. In conclusion I would recommend this book to anyone that likes science fiction, or any type of science. This book is a classic. Perhaps it will be looked back upon as a manual for a new society."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Brave New World is not a book that can simply be read once and forgotten. No. One must analyze the book, and always with an open mind. &quot;Open mind&quot; meaning that one may need to look beyond the literal meaning of the words, and one must not take offense to the context in which Huxley writes. It is not a pornographic book, and it is not a book promoting sacrilegious ideals. To fully understand the novel as a whole, one must look deep into the mind of Huxley to even attempt to figure out what he is trying to say. The entire novel must be looked at with the air of sarcasm. Huxley is not condoning evil and sin; rather, he is making a mockery of it! He is presenting the reader with an example of a society that has gone wrong, totally wrong, and he wants the world to be aware that the direction in which it is headed is not for the best, and in fact the world should stay as far away from extreme conformity as possible. The world of which Huxley writes is the antithesis of what the human race really needs."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"I had heard of this book all through high school. It had been constantly recommended to me by my English teachers because of my loyalty to language, writing, and being rather &quot;left-wing&quot; (or so I was called otherwise).In my senior year, a previous teacher gave me a copy out of the depths of the old book room. It wasn't in any of the class curriculums anymore, and they were old, beat up paperbacks waiting to be reopened.The book is beyond revolutionary. I gave it to a friend to read, and she loved it as well (and she is very critical when it comes to philosophy and the human existence in fiction...as am I). I encourage every person to read this book - whether you have been thinking to do so for quite some time now or you have never heard of it before!"},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"When the reader realizes that this book was written in the early 1930's, he must be stunned by the insight Huxley had for the world that would unfold in the late 20th Century. While, for the most part, the ideals and events of his &quot;Brave New World&quot; have not come to fruition in our society, some of the undertones of our culture are certainly evident in this book. It is also a grave warning of the dangers of absolute Socialism, in other words equality without quality, life without challenge. This was so well written, with every character being worthy of sympathy. Even the most cruel of the Utopians is to be pitied, for we see how truly empty their lives are. This is a book that should be read by everyone. Boy, would this make a great film."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"This had the potential to be a good book and Huxley certainly wasn't a bad writer for his day, but his main purpose in this book seems to be to get a message out, and I'm not sure I can buy that message. Basically the thesis is that it's good to be unhappy. The main characters are sick that this world has no unhappiness and they want the right to be unhappy. I cannot understand this since I would rather be happy than not. If this was just a satire about an immoral modern society, then I could understand. His predictions certainly are not too far off the map. If you are curious, try this book, but personally I did not find it enlightening."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"In this book there seems to be something missing. I love the world Huxley creates, but he goes for the obvious. In other words, I could tell where the book was going to go when Bernard suggested taking the Savage to the real world. There is so much more that Huxley could have done with the world he creates. I should say that when I first finished the book I probably would have given the book 4 or 5 stars. However, after thinking about the book for a few days I realized this is a 3 to 3 1/2 star book."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"I read Brave New World because I really liked 1984 and some people recommended it as similar. I really have to dissagree. Whereas 1984 had a plot, characters and a point Brave New World had none. It is basically a description of a futuristic world with this bit thrown in about The Savage. The Savage is a strange combination that Heller made up of religion, primative life, and something like voodoo. Not a very impressive book."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"There is something special about this book: it was written based on the vision Progressives have for the world. Aldous Huxley's brother, Julian was a Progressive. Julian shared his belief on eugenics, population control, sterilization, and propaganda with Aldous. Aldous decided it sounded like an interesting novel. Fiction based on fact.If you follow what is happening in the U.S. and across the globe, you will see the reflection of truth in this book. The attacks on religion, history, individuality, and truth are all present in 2011."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"This book is on many a top 100 reading list. Aldous Huxley has the reputation of being an intellectual giant. His heritage places him in the land of England, the place where all of the great literary giants come. A Brave New World unfortunately does not live up to the credits,pedigree or even the cult following that chases after it.Summary: In a nutshell this book is a mess. I am assuming that the majority of individuals that rate this book high on a novel list or 5 star it on here on amazon do so simply because A Brave New World is filled with satire in a dystopian society. Unfortunately for me that is not enough to warrant a five star rating.Inconsistent plot line runs through this book. The main character \\"Savage\\" does not show up until half way through the book. All of the character names are a play on words. The book takes as many shots as it can at the American Capitalist engine.The big negative for me is that it is just unbelievable. Savage, essentially an uneducated or \\"home schooled\\" Indian has a high level intellectual conversation with the main antaganist Mustaph Mond.Breakdown Review:Storyline: I give 1 out of 5 stars due to unbelievability.Writing style: 3 out of 5 stars. The satire somewhat works and the writing style itself doesn't fit into the genious category.Depth/Inspiration: 4 out of 5 stars. Despite the flaws this book is bound to inspire the creative gene in others. Unfortunately the humanistic undertones will lead many an individual down slippery slopesEntertainment/Education value: 1 out of 5 stars. Not as entertaining as the hype behind the book and the writer. I do not see any education value in this book aside from how to write satire or how to write a novel to inspire a nation of conspiracy theorists."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Although Huxley's writing within this novel feels stiff and wooden, his ideas of what the form the future might take were surprisingly close to the mark. Although written in 1930's England, Huxley's envisioning of a society in which patriotism was measured by how many consumer goods an individual bought is eerily reminiscent of President Bush exhorting us to \\"just go shopping\\" after 9/11. Of additional interest is the use of the mood-altering drug, Soma. In our currently over-medicated society, this, too, seems all too close to Huxley's \\"brave, new world.\\" We also seem to be moving closer to Huxley's portrayal or a society's unwillingness to accept aging and the physical changes that occur within that process. In Huxley's world, people are euthenized at 60, with much cosmetic surgery occurring prior to that age to retain a youthful look. He missed on the euthenasia matter; spot on with the cosmetic surgery.The problem with the book lies primarily in the stiff style in which it was written. Not having read anything else by Huxley, I'm not sure if this was used for stylistic affect or simply Huxley's style. The consequence is that none of the characters moved beyond their 2-dimensional flatness, including the character with whom we were meant to most identify, the savage."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Aldous Huxley's work in Brave New World is really earth-shaking, I believe. No one has more acutely stated the problems of today's society than Huxley, and the scary part about it, is that he did it 60 years ago. In my day to day life I see unsettling ghosts of the brave new world as it approaches. Think about it, with cloning now, genetic engineering, and our ever increasing consumption of drugs. It won't be long before we're popping soma and conditioning artificial children. Truly a mind-expanding read. I would recommend it to anyone that has ever been angry with society."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"I am delighted to have come across another satirical novel written in the same fashion, THE LAST DAY, by Glenn Kleier. In THE LAST DAY, Kleier tackles the subject of authority in organized religion with outrageous wit and irreverence. LAST DAY is a classic, watershed novel in the manner of BRAVE NEW WORLD. I found it a riveting read, and one that I greatly encourage all Huxley fans to experience"},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"This book is more the type to read when you just don't feel like doing anything and want to just sit down and read, because once you pick it up you can never put it down... It is one of the best books that I have read in my entire life even if I am at the tender age of 15... I recomend this to any student in high school or if you are going to be in any Analysis of Lit class in Fairbanks then I know you are going to want to pick this book for your parrallel reading novel... so if you just can't make up your mind just pick up Brave New World because it is an awsome book..."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"I really like this book because the message in hidden in the story. I've only read 1 chapter, but besides the bible, this is my favorite book!"},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"great like a cold coke and whiskey early on christmas morning. like the future it is numbing to drink and do but endless giult is born the man of science"},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"This book explores the future and what &quot;utopia&quot; should be. It gives a peek into where humanity will go wrong and gives mindblowing descriptions about what society will be like. A great storyline and plot that can be hard to follow at times but a very entertaining and exciting work overall!!"},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"It is completely effective, despite the fact that there are about 3 million copies of it. The last lines chilled me. READ it now! Oh, and to the people who said we are TURNING into brave new world; there have always been extreme social classes- why don't we focus on out-of-control technology instead? Hope no one saw that NBC tv-movie about this book. It was so commercialized and had so little to do with what the book is about, it was painful to watch. Buy the real thing! If you are literate and are somewhat intelligent, you should love it!"},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Don't get caught up - like so many have - in trying to over-analyse this book. It's themes are obvious, its message is quite clear. It doesn't need psychoanalysis of its author to understand the message that he brings in the pages of Brave New World. Just understand that being human = frailty, emotions, and irrationality, no matter what we are taught. Nothing can subdue the human-ness of us all, no matter how much we are conditioned and sterilised. That is the lesson of the book."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"I really liked this book, although there were some parts to it that I didn\`t understand. The author creates a future world, where humans are genetically engineered to &quot;be happy&quot;. I think the idea behind this book is to point out some of the weaknesses of our society (eg. our reluctance to face our problems - we tend to take some &quot;soma&quot; instead, which is a widely used drug in the book to make people forget their problems)and to make us aware of what could happen in the future to humanity if we aren\`t careful. The future described in the novel is very realistic and some of it is already starting to show up - whether we like it or not. When reading the book, you get the feeling (or maybe you don\`t) that something is wrong with this future world. Engineering people to work and be happy is wrong, because the happiness they are feeling is not real. I guess it doesn\`t make any sense now, but after reading the book it gives you something to think about. A great book!"},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"I was 15 the first time I read this book, 30-something years later it still remains one of my favourites. Everyone should read this book. If you liked A.B.N.W then I recommend another one of my favourites, Animal Farm. Happy reading."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Aldous Huxley presents us with the ideal Utopia. All social concerns erased with the pop of a pill, political concerns usurped via caste system, and morality is no longer in existance! The barrage of vivid images and elaborate themes, in combination with Huxley's lyrical wit elevates Brave New World to a trancendent level of literary excellence."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Brave New World excellently depicts a future that very well may happen, a terrible future that shows mindless masses and an immpossible-to-break caste system. People are grown in &quot;Hatcheries&quot; like plants, and are conditioned for death and show no remorse at a fellow mans passing away because there is no individual in this society. &quot;The World Controllers&quot; believe this to be pure happiness and think that it's citizens would never leave but they fail to see the difference between pleasure and happiness and the striving of the human mind to be individualic."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Quite simply, this novel was as perfect as could be in its premise, ideas, themes, and characters. The succinctness of the narrative style is very much effective. One of its strenghts was the genuine feeling I had while reading it that it was written in the time and world of its setting. this makes it more than a mere political pamphlet, a la 1984. A classic and a must-read. A prophetic vision of the &quot;last man.&quot;"},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"I first read this book in my high school junior English class and couldn't put it down. I just had to keep reading to find out what happened. I have read it two times since then and finally broke down and bought it. The book is about a controlled society hundreds of years in the future and one man, Bernard, who feels something is missing from his life. The first chapter is a bit confusing in parts but it picks up after that. I don't know how anyone could find this book boring, I found it fascinating."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"In an age when commericalism is common place, this classic is even more scary to read. And, of course, by reading it you are undermining one of the basics of this distopian society: buy new things all the time. Sound familar? You beat it does. The characters aren't as well developed as I would ideally like but the focus is on a society where the individual is lost so there is a reason (or that's what I tell myself ;-)) A great read for high schoolers just investigating the world around them with a critical mind and a terrifying read for those of us caught up in the material world already."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"This is an excellent book, depicting a future where babies are born in bottles, 60 identical twins are common. There is no god, only a leader, his Fordliness. There is no lonliness or sorrow due to soma, the drug of the future. Pain is not necessary, and everyone is happy.... or are they?This book does have some low spots, and thats why it doesnt have 5 stars, but it is well worth reading."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Huxley definately managed to make errie predictions about the future that have ended up coming ture in some mannor. The sexual revelotion, genetic enginering and mood altering durgs are all predicted within this work. Huxley also makes a storng statement by having the society revere Henry Ford as a god, demonstrating symbolicaly how we worship technology. These points should have been left to an essay however if you ask me. The characters in this book seemed to have sereval personalities that the auother switchs between at his convienace. At some points Lenina seems to be different from the rest, capable of love and feidilty as opposed ot causual sex. Then at other points she's as shallow as everyone else. Bernard seems at some points to be vitruious and ready to reject what society has placed in front of his eyes. At other times however he is taking advantage of John for his own benefits and reveling in the flase happiness that he once denounced. This made it very difficult to develop any ture bond or feeling towards the characters because you are never sure of their personality. While I concede that humans are many facited and often contradicte themselves, the changes in this book are so abburpt and unexplained that Bernard and Lenina seem to betery their own personalitiesThere are also aspects of the book which are just very stupid. The fact that people play sexaphones is a pathitic overstatement of the point the auother is tring to make. Some of slogans used sound so dumb it is hard to fathom that people accepted them, this takes away from the storyBrave New World falls short with badly written charcters and some aspects that were so overly simplistic and obvious they became stupid."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"I have to say this is one of the most interesting and intriguing books that I have ever encountered. Huxley is an absolute genius - painting the perfect picture of a societal Utopia which is anything but that. His characters are vividly portrayed and you wil find yourself constantly asking the question, &quot;what's going to happen next?&quot; The book deals with issues we face today: drugs, sex, and the media; almost acting as a futuristic reading of things that are becoming true. There's a reason this book is considered a classic: read it."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Huxley's Brave New World is a novel written in the thirties about genetic engineering used to create a utopian society, and shows the dangers of &quot;playing god.&quot; This book is very prophetic because our society is facing many of these circumstances now in the 21st century that Huxley presented in his writing almost 70 years ago. It stands as a warning for our society as we seem to be striving for the society Huxley created even though that society was obviously not as perfect as its rulers felt it to be. Destroying hunger, disease, and old age may seem like a wonderful idea but with such things can come a great struggle for power and further control over individuals' lives. The novel really makes you think especially about our current society and how close we may be to achieving Huxley's &quot;Utopia.&quot;"},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"A truly thought-provoking book. It makes you realize the price of giving up truth and beauty for ignorant bliss. A painful honest, unlimited world will always be superior to content sheltering in my mind. &quot;Those who give up freedom for the privilege of safety deserve neither.&quot; Let's just hope to the world doesn't end up in the state of the one described in BNW, a not completely unlikely possibility."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Although the book has some interesting ideas in it (like bokanovskification process and conditioning) after the first few chapters it becomes a repetition of the beginning chapters. Some reviewers think it wrong, even foolish to compare it with 1984 but since they are in the same genre (they are both anti-utopias), we can make a comparison between them. And when I do that, I find Brave New World weak and shallow. When I first read 1984 a few years ago, it arrested me so much that when I finished reading in the middle of a night I felt a chill. It affected me so much. But at the end of Brave New World I said &quot;Is this the end?&quot; Also I read Huxley's &quot;Island&quot; 5 or 6 years ago and I simply hated it. I don't understand his obsession with drugs. In Island, there was &quot;Moksha medicine&quot; which the author approves and in Brave New World there is &quot;Soma&quot; which I am not sure if he approves or not. Also the book doesn't give us an insight into the whole structure of the society, it mostly dwells on matters like sex and the discouragement of individuality. But I still recommend the book as an anti-utopia. Lovers of science fiction should also read &quot;1984&quot; and &quot;A Canticle For Leibowitz&quot;."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"I read this after learning of its dystopian storyline.It is widely heralded as one of the greatest books, often included amongst titles like 1984. I love 1984 and Animal Farm so I thought \\"what the heck?\\"I thought this threw in a more technological aspect to the dystopia. It also included some important concepts like the fact the the characters were not harshly treated by their masters, but rather their masters controlled the people by allowing and encouraging base activities like sex and drugs. The concept of intentional destruction of the nuclear family was also prominent.So, the book isn't bad at all. Sadly, a tremendous amount of the concepts can be seen in modern day society. So I learned something from the angle of the book. I also liked certain elements of the way the author writes.However, this book did not really speak to me like 1984 did, The inner workings and the \\"why?\\" of the government weren't really expanded on like they were in 1984. There wasn't any real suspense or anything that made me want to keep reading like 1984 did.I am glad I read it and I give it three stars because in reality, the societal ills today are a combination of both 1984 and Brave New World. But for a good read, 1984 is far more interesting and insightful."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"I love this book so much! It got here in great time and in great condition. I could read this over and over and over again!"},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Aldous Huxley's 1932 novel Brave New World presents a vision of consumerism and mechanization, where social strata are bred into the biology of factory-produced twins, and stuporous stability is the highest government ideal. I found myself captivated by the book's system of society, its veneration of Henry Ford, and culture of instant gratification. If Orwell's vision was pure fascism, this is pure capitalism.On the downside, Brave New World is nowhere as intellectually deep as 1984. The plot and characters are underdeveloped and inconsequential. Huxley makes the joy of reading solely in its exploration of his (brave new) world, but that can only carry the book so far. Throw in a compelling plot, differentiated tone of story-telling, and dynamic characters and it might have been perfect.Continued at: [...]"},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Once again a book that garners acclaim but leaves you (me anyway) feeling like you wasted precious moments of your life--ala On The Road.

Awfully shaking. Terribly good!"},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Brilliant. If you think about it, humanity has never succombed to brutal dictatorship and suppression of the people for extended periods of time as in many negative utopias, but in Aldous Huxley's vision we are done in not by suppresion, but by the trivialization of everything we hold dear.

It's hard to find an acceptable school book that's interesting enough to keep you hooked on reading it; Brave New World is a wise solution. Although it can be hard to comprehend at times (when they describe the overall landscape of the Utopian civilization), it is a most interesting read.

It is a classic examination of social ills and evils that affect us now and will continue to affect us in the future. I would recommend it to any senior high school or college student who is selecting a literary work to read for English class. It is also great beach reading, but you need to concentrate on the plot and information in the book, so no dozing off!"},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Huxley projects the future from the perspective of a man impressed by industrial efficiency. It's as if society springs from a conveyor belt. Inefficient norms like marriage and family are eliminated. I wonder how he might forecast the future now in an age of post-industrial corporatism. Certainly that world would not be as streamlined as his brave new one. This book remains a thoroughly enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Just like 1984 and Fahrenheit 451, Brave New World purveys a chilling look into a futuristic, dystopian world. Although I didn't find this book as interesting as 1984 or Fahrenheit 451, it's still an important book worth reading. The main thing I found lacking in Brave New World is character development. None of the characters were the least bit interesting. Although Huxley apparently was making his point by having the characters bland, sometimes rebellious, but at the end, not achieving redemption or solitude because of their lack of depth, strength, and courage, it didn't make the plot very thrilling. In some ways I felt that there wasn't much of a story, just mainly a tour of Huxley's dystopian world. However, despite some of its flaws, Brave New World is a great journey of a book to take for its intriguing look into a future that we hope won't come in full circle anytime soon."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Aldous Huxley has some pretty caustic observations to share about industrial society in this futuristic novel. In his Brave New World, happiness is the supreme good, industry and science have made happiness possible for all, and as a result mankind is diminished. Most of the book was rather slow going for me but the \\"trial\\" scene where the Controller explains himself to the Savage was worth sticking around for. I also enjoyed reading how a writer of the 1930s imagined technology 600 years hence: people traveling in helicopters and rocket planes, going to the \\"feelies\\" for entertainment, and so on."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"The book, Brave New World, written by Aldous Huxley, was not one of the most impressive books I have ever read. It did have thoroughly extensive descriptions, and the characters seemed consistent. Unfortunately, the plot had a dark mood, and the seemingly pointless ending was disappointing.The novel takes place in the world far into the future, after a devastating war, when a world-wide utopian society has been established. People are grown from cloned eggs, put into a social class before they have reached infanthood. All of the set morals and opinions they are supposed to have are engrained in them as children through association experiences (ex: electrocuting them when they see flowers, so they associate flowers with pain) and a recorded vocal repetition played as they sleep.The main problem occurs when 2 of the main characters, Bernard and Lenina, vacation at a Reservation, a place that has been left \\"uncivilized.\\" From there, they bring back 2 \\"savages,\\" John and his mother, who had been left there years ago on the assumption that she had been lost in the woods. When John sees the way \\"civilization\\" functions, he is both appalled and horrified. He becomes increasingly frustrated after falling in love with Lenina, who treats her affection towards him with an overly-casual manner.The \\"Brave new world\\" expression is a quote from Shakespeare, which John developed an interest in while in the Reservation, though the books are banned in the rest of the world. The mood is set from the start. Thousands of look-alikes are raised to think alike, act alike, and respond alike. People have all that they want and want nothing that they don't or cannot have. Family figures are considered a gross joke and are unheard of (you can just imagine how this makes John feel when people react to his mother!). Marriage is nonexistent, and commitment to a single person is highly discouraged. Everyone is supposed to belong to everyone else.All things are black or white and nobody even thinks about the possibility that there could be more, that something grey might exist in the world. Overall, I might recommend this book to anyone who is really into utopian societies where not everyone is happy, but there is no real escape from any part of it. It might be good for someone who enjoyed reading the book, The Giver, except for the fact that in, Brave New World, the storyline turns away, at random, from the path it seemed to have set up for itself. It would probably not be appropriate, fully comprehended, or interesting for anyone under the age of about 13 or 14 years old."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"My Opinion: I didn't find any characters that I was able to like. One is given a choice between insanity and lunacy as Huxley says in his forward. I picked neither. The book was dark and depressing. This might have been the point, but I don't have to like it. I would have liked it more had there been a main character that was more of a hero or an individual in this society of clones. If it would have been more about Helmholtz's struggles or if John would have been less crazy, I think it would have been better for me. Instead we are faced with the horror of drug addicted society members and the insanity of a savage that has a warped set of morals."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"A prophetic vision of a distant future, where humans are hatched, and choice is a thing of the past. Brave New World describes a regimented, worldwide government where men and women are bred into a particular caste, and conditioned from infancy to appreciate their lives as workers and consumers. Sometimes it seemed an attack against communism, at other times a treatise on \`stability with happiness' versus \`instability with human struggle.' Regretfully, the characters were unlovable, and at times seemed barely human. The struggle against the government turned out to be not much of a struggle at all, more of a polite conversation with some tears. There was no fear or darkness, and only a little bit of contention. Towards the end, the characters turned didactic, quoting Shakespeare and waxing scholarly. It made the story feel more like an essay than a book. For a touching futuristic tale of governmental intrusion, read Orwell's 1984 instead."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"In the novel Brave New World, Aldous Huxley, creates the scene to take place in futuristic England. People of this day and age have changed completly. Instead of being born and rais for a mothe, they are by a muchine. They are thought how to live they life by teachers. To their bodies and personalities they are artifically made. From birth they are choosen if they will live a upper class life or lower class life. Their are five diferent levels in the caste system. You are catigorized by the amount of air given to you at birth. In the society of the book stability is everything. You really have no control over the way your life is going to go. With this in a enviornment it raises change, conflict and problems.In the novel Brave New World, it insights you on how the future mighyt be. It gives you a totally different look on things. The main thing is that the kids are raised be machins. Like in our society, people take drugs to escape reality. In this book it is called Soma. I think this is preaty much all they would take throughtout the novel. Instead of going to school in the day throughtout their life they get tought in their sleep. They get thought the goods and the bads. They would shock the things they didn't want them to like. Another thing is there are no book allowed anywhere at anytime. I think they would learn what the government is pulling on them.The meaning behind the book is for little kids it would be harder to understand. It has many perplexing questions. I recommed this book for adults and college people, because they could get the questions Huxley is asking."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"I just finished reading Brave New World.Here is my take on it.Huxley was an aristocrat from the upper echelons of British society. He was extremely well-heeled. His family was incredibly distinguished in politics, arts and science.No doubt Huxley, like his peers, also kept vivid memories about the horrors of World War I, the Great War. Indeed, Brave New World was written during the inter-war period. The gruesome nature of WW1 left its indelible mark on every living person in Europe.Being an aristocrat, and witnessing the horrors of WW1, Huxley was desparately afraid of the complete breakdown of the hierarchical society in which he was so comfortably placed. It is clear that he was terrified, for example, by the prospect of biological weapons spoiling everything. (By his own admission he did not forsee nuclear weapons, thank goodness.)The Bolshevik revolution in Russia, with the rise of the working man, must have also played heavily on this young aristocrat's mind.Also, the development of awesome new technology such as the mass production of automobiles and other consumer goods seemed to signal, to Huxley, a breakdown in conventional society in which the great refined men of arts and science dominated.So, Brave New World is Huxley's reaction to these traumatic events. The book is his concept of what would happen if you combine the horrors of modern warfare, the rise of the working class, and the advent of high technology.But, you see, it did not turn out like that. Nothing like it.Huxley remained convinced, for example, that society had to be stratified into classes. Well, sir, it doesn't. Notice in Brave New World the prominence of Alphas and the lowly status of the Epsilons. Well, lo and behold, the real-life Huxley was an Alpha-Plus!Huxley simply could not envision a society in which a person of modest background could become an Alpha-Plus through hard work, grit, and innate intelligence. Huxley believed that Alpha-Plus's were born as Alpha-Plus's and Epsilon's were born as Epsilon's, as simple as that.So, the fact that babies are decanting from bottles in Brave Bew World as Alphas, Deltas, Gammas, and Epsilons is actually a strange comfort to Huxley. Although he realizes that the concept is an abhorrent one, the bottom line is that the class hierarchy is preserved in Huxley's Brave New World, to his advantage! Isn't that interesting?Well, I could go on, but I have made my main point. I could say that the novel is poorly written. Or I could say that most of what Huxley forsaw did not turn out to be true and most of what turned out to be true Huxley did not forsee. But that would be unfair, and once could level the same criticism at Jules Verne and H.G. Wells without really getting anywhere.So, I leave with the final thought of the day...Huxley did not believe in the concept that human spirit is distributed equally into all of us, from the poorest of the poor to the richest of the rich. Huxley believed that the lion's share of the spirit went to the aristocratic class. That is why they are the aristocrats: because at birth they received the lion's share of human spirit! Well, balderdash to you, Mr Huxley. Your Brave New World will never come to pass because you and your ilk and never going to be put back in charge."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"amazing story line, i love the author just there are scribbles on every page and many sections are hi-lighted i dont think i could ever buy another book from international books"},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"this has got to be the most boring book i have ever read, & maybe that is because i am younger & it was written in 1932 but it was horrible i didn't understand a dang word.. i am very dissapointed too i was really looking forward to this book .."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Written in 1932, perhaps Huxley was looking at the extremes of communism and Naziism which attempted to shape society into a utopian country filled with happy workers that were completely loyal and obedient.

The conflict between 'happiness' and the fulfillment that comes from struggle and pain has rarely been explored in such a relatable manner."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Brave New World by Aldous Huxley is a keen observation of the possibilities that could take place in the future if the presnt trends of the day continued. Huxley envisioned a future where social and genetic engineering altered the fundamental nature of human life. The bureaucratic nature of government continued to expand and had a more restrictive influence on human freedoms. The government had a systematic program for indoctrinating children to conform to the accepted social constructs of the day.People lost their revoultuionary fervor because they had an illusion of freedom. The people in Brave New World lived a hedonistic lifestyle where unlimited sexual gratification and the use of the pleasure drug soma caused few people to question the controversial measures of governmental and bureaucratic institutions. Huxley displayed a keen insight that people would seek to escape the confines of modern life and seek excitement in more primitive environments. People went on vacation in \\"Savage Reservations.\\" In a way, Huxley predicted the popularity of shows like \\"Survivor.\\"The plot of the story is fanciful and outrageous. Brave New World is not a great book from a literary standpoint. However, it is an important commentary of the dangers of social and genetic engineering. Huxley was right on by inferring that people in modern society would tend to stop paying attention to important political and cultural developments and seek to insulate themselves in a fantasy world of pleasure. This can be seen in the fact that large segments of American society protested the Vietnam War while few paid much attention to American developments in the conflicts with Afghanistan and Iraq. People were too busy playing fantasy sports, video games, posting on social media sites, and completely absorbing themselves in the products of the entertainment industry.Despite any weaknesses in the book, Brave New World is an essential read for those who are concerned at the eroding civil liberties in America. Huxley was a keen observer who has a lot of important things to say. Don't be distracted by the more ridiculous developments of the plot. A deeper analysis of the governmental policies and the resulting constructs of the core values promoted in the society make this an illuminating commentary on the dangerous trends of the current day."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Fantastic read.

I saw:That people will do anything to escape their pain.Medicine can enslave people.Most people do not want the responsibility of freedom.There will always be people who resist tyranny.And More."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Before I write the review, people should know that Brave New World Revisited is usually included in Brave New World. Even though they didn't specify that in the copy I bought, that was the case, so before you decide on buying both, get this one first to see if the other is included.I remember finishing this book while I was dropping down in Poland, and it dawned on me, \\"Oh my God, we are living in the Brave New World!\\" It seemed implausible to me that this was the case because Huxley wrote the book in 1931. That's 81 years ago. 81 years ago man! Do you know how long ago that is? He had no idea that the media would turn into the manipulating monarchy it has become; that we would be living in a totalitarian world, where the television announcers preach peace, democracy, and other hypocrisy, while the leaders of the world sit in their billion dollar mansions, sipping on billion dollar champagne, reveling in the unfolding of their master plan.I found it quite amusing that he called Mustafa Mond, one of the leaders of Brave New World, The Controller. I only realized the propensity of calling him such a name by the end of the book because he was literally in control of everything. What was most frightening to me is that he was in control of the information that the people could access. He knew about God, Shakespeare, and many other things from the \\"Old World\\", but in order to keep people subjugated and obedient, he deliberately chose not to allow this information to be spread to the general public. Don't you think that the real leaders of the world, the ones behind the iron curtain, know very well about a variety of things which good actually lead humanity to be liberated? \\"But how can this be?\\" you may ask. \\"That means that the world is being run by bad people!\\" Well, if it wasn't do you think there would be any form of war in the world?We are living in the Brave New World Huxley prophesied all those years ago, where the information we receive is controlled; where we, as Huxley put it, are content with our slavery. We have forgotten our humanity. We have forgotten that we are people, that every single one of us in a individual that deserves the utmost respect, and we have been conditioned to cling to the mass organizations because we feel a sense a completeness once we are a part of something. That is what they want. They want a group of blind sheep going wherever the road takes them, and not setting their foot down and saying \\"No! We want it differently!\\"It is a terrible state of affairs, and if you look back at the history of the world, you will see that any dissenter to the status quo has been silenced, crucified, and put down. When I say crucified, I don't just mean Jesus on the cross because he told the Jews they had it wrong. I am also referring to people like JFK, Martin Luther King, and John Lennon. Their voices were heard by millions of people, and they were starting to become a threat, so they were crucified by the murky evil men sitting behind the curtains. How dare I mention these \\"mere mortals\\" with the name of the \\"Lord and Savior\\" Jesus Christ? Well, read a little about the history of Christianity; the fabrications which have made us believe that Jesus was the son of God; that in order to be saved, we have to be obedient sheep and to turn ourselves over to Christ. This is exactly what happened in the Brave New World in Huxley's book: information manipulation and information control to keep the people obedient and domesticated. If you dig deep, you will realize that the only thing that Jesus preached was love, and if you dig even deeper, you see that even he said that all external ordinances are not only unnecessary, but harmful because the people who do them feel like they are exempted from performing acts of love. Open your eyes and see. All you have to do to see the truth is to let go of the beliefs you have blindly clung to all your life, and look at things with an open mind. Chances are, the beliefs you have today aren't yours, but were slowly seeded into your mind until you were convinced that they were yours if you really, really think about it.In my opinion, information control and information manipulation is by far the most dangerous thing in the world today. The mass media (including wikipedia) choose what you think. National Geographic documentaries won't tell you anything either, and CNN is probably the biggest horse show running in the world today (apart from the O'Reily Factor). In order for us to be liberated, it is essential that we start reading books. There are where the answers lie; not on Wikipedia, or YouTube, or a DVD documentary where the director has probably been told that he can't show a large portion of the truth because it would be too dangerous. Books. Books Books. Start reading. Whenever you want to know about a subject, buy a book about it, and even then, be skeptical. Keep digging. Dig deeper and deeper until you are entirely convinced by what you have read from different sources that what the authors are saying is true. There are far too many liars in the world today for you to be content with watching anything, so my advice to you is to open and book, and start reading."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"in the 2 worlds of 1984 and brave new world i find myself liking brave new world much much more. In the two differing views of a disutopian society i find that using drugs and sex to keep the population happy while socially engineering a class system based on genetics is much more believable than using fear and misery.Where Brave New World really prevails is the way in which are social controls are bred into our children and hailed as advances in the happiness of our people.Pick it up, read it, love it."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Like 1984, this book(written in the thirties no less) comes scarily close to our current society. Drugs and sex are nothing new now, but then these ideas must have sounded crazy. What sounded crazy to me was that no one could be alone. If I do not have at least one night to myself a week, I get super cranky. No wonder John exiled himself at the end. All of those zombies taking drugs and chanting slogans would have driven me crazy. Then there was the constant conditioning. Obviously this is something we face daily with laws, rules, policies, mores, peer pressure and of course, marketing. Most familiar was the conditioning done so that people would gravitate towards activities that require the most equipment. In the end, it's always about big business directing us. Even President Bush's answer to a nation in mourning was to tell us to go out and shop. Why give the babies electroshocks when they look at flowers? Because nature is free. We want them to be consumers instead. *rolls eyes*One thing that really bugged me though...why did they need birth control? If they were controlling everything else about these people, why did they just sterilize them?

Although it was written long ago, it is strangely plausible to the world today.The characters are interestingly developed with appropriate detail. The setting is futuristic, but not odd. And the plot moves along well."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"I've been hearing people talk about this book for years, and frankly, having not read it, I underestimated it. Well, I finally read it (bought it used for 48 cents), and wow--it really got me! Had this book been written this year I would have been blown away by it, but that it was written 80 years makes it all the more shocking. I don't know much about Aldous Huxley, but he really nailed it with this one. What affected me most of all while reading this book was absorbing the realization that the dystopia Huxley creates on paper is so incredibly parallel to the world we live in now: a world of comfort-seeking, sex-seeking, medicated, thrill-seeking blindness, where truth takes a profound backseat to following the herd and keeping in line at all costs. I also found it profound that this book gave me an opportunity to self-reflect the ways in which I compromise truth in order to follow the herd. It's so hard to be different from one's peers and to forge a new way. The pressure to conform is massive. But, as Brave New World points it, conformity is sick.I did, however, feel the book had some weaknesses. I felt the parts with the Savage were rather tiresome at points, and that his character became dull for me after a certain point. He was presented as a foil for the mindless dystopian world of drugs and sex and conformity, but I felt he was also lost in so many ways as well---desperate for romance, hyper-attached to his disturbed, abusive mother in an immature way, and self-abusive. He was not the visionary I would have liked as a foil. I'm not saying this would have been easy to write, especially 80 years ago, but I felt the Savage was the book's main weakness. I felt Huxley found it much easier to criticize society and humanity's sickness that to create a positive vision. The positive vision in this book was implicit and rather hidden. And considering the horrors we are wreaking on our planet and on children, a positive vision needs to be ultra-explicit!"},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Aldous Huxley was the brother of Julian Huxley, a fervant eugenicist and darling of the robberbaron banker Elites. It is hard to know whether Brave New World (BNW) is cautionary, or a piece of predictive programming. It represents a worldview where social order is based on a sort of biologic caste system- not due to breeding or genetic manipulation (this book predates the discovery of DNA), but due to postnatal treatments designed to dumb people down to the level appropriate for their preordained station in life. Naturally, the \\"Brave New World\\" has a pyramidal structure, with Elites at the top, and a much broader base of \\"Deltas\\" in the slave caste. It is perhaps one of the most frighting ideas of all time that technology could become a tool of subjugation, pushing the world into a neo-feudal prison instead of elevating us on a pathway to collective self-actualization. The totalitarianism in BNW is as thorough as that depicted in Orwell's 1984, but of a softer variety. Where Orwell employs a paramilitary police force to enforce Big Brother's oppressive rule, Huxley's society secures obedience through drugs, slicker, more corporate-looking propaganda, social controls, and economic incentives. There is more carrot than stick, but the Brave New World is a hellish nightmere nevertheless.As technology marches forward, gaining momentum as it goes, one wonders whether some of these developments might be inevitable. But the idea that technology will be the root of our problems is as flawed as looking to technology to save all our problems. Social problems need to be solved (or averted, I hope) by changing attitudes. The key to preventing a Brave New World does not lay in halting the progress of science or industry; it lies in prizing the one thing missing from Huxley's nightmare state: civil liberties"},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Brave New World is one of the three biggies in utopian/dystopian literature. Yes, there are many great dystopian novels out there but George Orwell's 1984, Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 and Aldous Huxley's Brave New World always seem to grab the most attention.In Brave New World society is being controlled by brainwashing people, drugs (soma) and a form of entertainment called \\"Feelies\\" which like a motion picture that provides touch sensations as well as sight and sound. People don't have mothers and fathers in this society; everybody is engineered in a lab. There are various castes that people are born into. The castes are Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta and Epsilon (in that order). Alphas are the highest level - they are world controllers, psychiatrists and the like. Epsilons are the sewage workers, foundry workers, etc.Brave New World starts by following Bernard who is a high level Alpha-plus. He is one of the higher level individuals but he doesn't fit in. He is noticeably small compared to other people in his caste, he seems to be looked down on, and even by those who is below his caste level. There are rumors that alcohol was accidentally administered while he was incubated.Later on in the book somebody from outside of the society comes into the picture, he is known as the Savage. The Savage is from an Indian pueblo in New Mexico. The Savage is completely different from these people, which creates some very interesting scenarios.Brave New World is expertly written. Huxley's prose is exciting and very creative. There are some very interesting plot developments, especially towards the latter half of the book when the Savage is brought into the negative-utopian society.Check this book out - I highly recommend it! Brave New World is a very fun read that never seems to have a dull moment."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"i read Brave New World in high school and it is one of the few books that i specifically remember disliking, probably due to the fact that the teacher and i consistently butted heads. so, in an attempt to give the book a fair second chance, i eagerly picked it up for the February installment of the English 101 Classics Challenge at The Olive Reader. i actually surprised myself and read it in a day and a half, which for me, means that it was at least half decent.if you've never read BNW, then i would really suggest giving it a read. it just seems to be one of those few books out there that comes with a societal obligation to read it, and re-read it. it's not that its the best book i've ever read, but rather that it is a very applicable book, one that speaks volumes about humanity and the impact of technology on such things as art, free will, and ethics. although i don't really remember much about my first read-through, i'm certain that the takeaway from 10+ years ago to today was vastly different. as the world evolves, so will the parallels of a book such as this. much like 1984 by George Orwell (which i should also re-read someday soon), BNW is truly a timeless classic.the storyline is simple, following a few workers from The Central London Hatchery and Conditioning Centre, a human hatchery, where embryos are developed, conditioned and ultimately brought up to be ideal citizens of various \\"castes\\". Alphas are all genetically unique and are naturally the most intelligent, highest functioning individuals, whereas Epsilons are replicated by the hundreds and stunted in their growth and development to mindlessly, happily even, fulfill the more mundane needs of society.\\"Alphas can be completely socialized - but only on condition that you make them do Alpha work. Only an Epsilon can be expected to make Epsilon sacrifices, for the good reason that for him they aren't sacrifices; they're the line of least resistance. His conditioning has laid down rails along which he's got to run.\\"through the various workers, we learn the cultural standards of this futuristic world where there are no mothers or fathers, no marriages or boredom, and therefore no apparent sadness. this \`future' that Huxley constructed back in the 1930's is really not all that far off from where we are today, which makes the few extremes a little too realistic for comfort. for this reason, i now understand why this is so popularly taught in schools. i wish i'd gotten more out of it the first time, but i'm very grateful for the re-read.i think my favorite part of the book is all of the various hypnopdic messages, such as \\"Progress is lovely\\", which was received by a child for \\"five hundred repetitions once a week from thirteen to seventeen\\". some were absolutely hilarious and added a haunting reality to the power of subliminal messaging. and, naturally, the plot develops as some of the characters begin to question these universally accepted messages.'He laughed, \\"Yes, \`Everybody's happy nowadays.' We begin giving the children that at five. But wouldn't you like to be free to be happy in some other way, Lenina? In your own way, for example; not in everybody else's way.\\"'all in all, this is and will probably always be a very good book, well written and constructed. the characters are entertaining and there is a lot of gratuitous sexual content (although non-graphic) and drug usage, which is not surprisingly the only thing i actually remember from my earlier read. my only real complaint is that there are some lulls in the flow of the writing, particularly toward the end where it feels as though Huxley brings the various themes together in a stumbling sort of manner to the conclusion. but, that aside, i enjoyed the reading and would definitely recommend it to everyone."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"I read this because my 15 year old granddaughter had it assigned in a high school English class. Tomorrow they start discussion groups. It is hard to imagine talking about the sexual explicity of the work in a class. I don't know that I could talk about it one on one with her myself.My first reaction was how many artifacts and social institutions Huxley has anticipated. Resort hotels in the Arctic with television in the bedroom (yes, 1932). The hospice Linda ends her life in, not very different from the hospices of today. Test tube babies. Helicopters buzzing around like Vietnam. (Not so frequent in the skies for civilians today). No we don't have \\"feelies\\" but the explicit sex in movies today mirrors the intent. The sexual revolution where birth control has led to loveless relationships. Institutionalzation of the one night stand.The most alarming thing about the book is the acceptance, as in Plato (as another reviewer mentioned) of a class based society with jobs assigned on the basis of ability. Not that it is any different from the Hindu system of castes. Test based discrimination of the early Chinese state is not that different from the SAT state of today. It violates the \\"American dream\\" of equal opportunity.The book does not seem to hang together very well and the insertion of the Reservation scenes is not realistic. However, it does give a chance to introduce the Savage and his role as representing a moral human being, or at least moral based on the general morality as perceived by the UN and possibly the civilized world of today, espoused, if not practiced.I am glad it assigned for the sophomore year of high school. It took me many years to arrive here. It raises questions covered in the world history class she is taking at the same time and I hope the discussions of the students in the next few weeks will remain talking points for them for many years to come."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"This should be mandatory reading for all high school seniors.

Huxley had tremendous insight considering this book was written in the twenties. This is very much the world as it is becoming in Western Civilization. Huxley paints the terrible picture of a perverted society where the individual is not capable of being an individual at all.If I may then I'll compare this to 1984. This is totally different. Instead of a super state or &quot;Big Brother&quot; control over the masses through brute force, here we have a society of people who are living in a very perfect and peaceful world where people are bred through a mechanized process. The family has been successfully destroyed. Through genetics a caste has been put into place and each person seeks his own happiness or contentment.Emotion is almost a crime in a Brave New World, while sexual promiscuity is encouraged. The people here never want to feel unpleasant and they ignore things that are plainly unjust. The people live in an almost drugged state where entertainment, recreational drug use, and easy sex are the substance of life.This book really brings it all home. The problems today that face us are spinning out of control because the people care no longer. Morality in the freedom of the individual has been replaced in the Brave New World by a sort of political correctness that is more of a collective sense of what is right and what is wrong that is conditioned into the fetus as it is developing.This is a great book today and will be a great book tomorrow as the human race is constantly increasing in technoloy. This book offers a choice between total security and safety (and a bland life) or an uncertain life where every man is his or her own master of destiny and may stand as a individual and free.

For the first time since 'To Kill a Mockingbird', I feel that I have read something with some merit, some worth, and a very obvious and startling lesson to teach.Whilst some believe that 'Brave New World' argues against the nightmarish anti-utopia ( or utopia depending on your perspective) presented in the book, I would infact argue that Huxley's intention was to hint at the benefits of a society positioned somewhere into between the blissfully ignorant stable environment of the Brave New World and complete individualism and creativity. After all, there are very obvious benefits in the new society; a lack of disease, an abudence of blissfully ignorant happiness, and more important a lack of suffering. Do we need suffering to achieve contentment? The book presents the idea that perhaps we do, though it gives no answers for any of the many questions it raises to the reader.The environment presented by the author is quite the paradox. You either face annihilation should you choose to ignore the strict codes of conformity, however the other option could be worse, a world without worth, emotions, a world which falls at the knees to science, though ironically sees the danger in science. The island, lying somewhere between the spectrum sounds brillant.The book has fault, but is intensly scary and thought-provoking."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"This is one of those books that I have been wanting to read for about twenty years, have started a few times, have been somewhat uneasy about my ignorance of - and now, finally, I did it. Was it worth the long wait? Did I spend my time wondering just what on earth had been the delay, delighting in a classic that had almost gotten away from me, ready to pass it on to friends and review it glowingly for you, my trusting public?Not quite.A Brave New World is, in my opinion, one of the most overrated books I have ever read. There are so many flaws in this story and silliness in the writing I scarcely know where to begin. It isn't that there are no redeeming factors to it - although there are few. However, to have this book anywhere near a list of classics or must reads, or (I can hardly believe it) greatest books of the twentieth century, is laughable. Yes, I do realize that sometimes a good book can suffer because of it's lofty reputation and often will not quite live up to what the reader expects. With that in mind, I tried to be objective and shelve any preconceived ideas I had about it. Even taking this rather liberal view, though, I just did not like it.To start, my first objection is the lack of depth to this new world. The picture Huxley paints is incomplete. At no time does one lose oneself in this society, feeling the air the characters breath and tasting the food they taste. One doesn't cry when they cry or laugh when they laugh. It all remains sort of cerebral. The characters are weak, perhaps intentionally so. There is nobody to like or dislike, there is no protagonist. The whole thing reads like a first draft that desperately needs to be fleshed out a bit.Furthermore,the one thing that Huxley seems to really want to hit us over the head with is sex. The characters all \\"have\\" each other all the time, having another person being as routine as going to coffee with them. The problem is this is quite literally the overarching idea of the whole book. If one can recall anything of A Brave New World weeks after reading the book, it is that sex is readily available (as are drugs). Apparently, if you glean nothing else from this book, you really, really need to glean that much. This free love is celebrated very easily because the theories of Freud have been manipulated and adapted to the point that the notion of mothers, fathers, sisters and brothers is obsolete; birth control is carried on a woman's person all the time and everyone is completely autonomous. It is an interesting subject and one that could have been explored much better if Huxley had wanted to; but he seems satisfied with an almost adolescent preoccupation with highly attractive women armed with birth control and ready to fornicate all the time. The concept never gets much further than that.The world Huxley imagines is one where all languages except English have ceased to exist (although there are different castes of peoples which bear such titles as Alpha, Beta, etc.) This inconsistency is never addressed. What Huxley must have thought was a clever play on words in switching \\"Lord\\" (God) for \\"Ford\\" (creator of the assembly line) is repeated ad nauseam throughout the book. Laboratories produce scores of identical twins all designed to enjoy factory work, and children are reared in state-run nurseries where they are brainwashed in their sleep and - Huxley never avoiding a chance to mention sex - they are encouraged to engage in erotic play with another. These amateurish ideas are littered throughout the book and make it more of a comedy than a commentary. Further reducing the book's sophistication is the amazing coincidence of the main characters running into a \\"savage\\" on one of their trips who just happens to be the spawn of one their own kind (a civilized person). The odysseys of this savage into the modern world is a storyline for which I simply had difficulty drumming up enthusiasm. It revealed nothing of human nature other than pat, simplistic assertions that it is better to live life properly, pain and all, than to spend it having random sex and taking drugs. Which I do not find to be an earth shattering theses.To compare this book to 1984, which many do, is an insult to a book that I consider to be a masterpiece. I have re-read 1984 many times and never fail to enjoy it; I had difficulty reading A Brave New World even once. While there is some enjoyment to be found in the ideas put forth in this \\"classic\\", it is about the same amount of enjoyment one would get from reading a paper written by a junior in high school entitled, 'What I think the Future Would Look Like,' - a paper that would, no doubt, be censored by her teacher for being too preoccupied with sex and excessive in uninteresting puns.bookshelfish.blogspot.com"},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"This book is written well, despite it's use of lofty language, but I found it very disturbing. It makes a very solid, good point, that if we'e not careful our own ignorance can lead us into oblivion... and that sometimes what we consider utopia can cost us our creaticity, happiness, freedom, and individuality... this book is rather scary, if you want a slap in the face or a rude awakening-- read it.

But even so, the name of the book and the general concept stayed, so I finally decided to finish what I started, even if it took me 30 years.With various oversights, it would be accurate to say that much of this feels like it could have been written \\"today\\" (relative). Some funky language and stilted dialog are easy to overlook. I don't know if that was deliberate on the authors part (his own version of \\"newspeak\\"), or just 80 years of progress...Also necessary to overlook is some of the technology. Altho the author is making a social commentary, and not technological predictions, the technology presented is not as deeply ingrained as it currently is.When you read this, written 80 years ago, and think that the first test-tube baby was still 40 years in the future, you get an idea of the foresight the author had.Perhaps every older generation will bemoan the direction of the new generation, but while reading the book, simply follow the depictions of promiscuity, abandonment of ethical morals, and various other social issues depicted in this book, it would not be far fetched to agree with that.My complaints for this book is two-fold:About three-quarters into the book, after the introduction of Mr. Savage, the focus is completely upon him. What becomes of those earlier characters we met?The ending is abrupt. I think I do understand the ideas behind the final chapter(s), which we can discuss in comments, if anyone would be so inclined, as I don't want to give away the whole thing, but I do kinda wish it was wrapped up in a more substantial way...All told and done, this is one of those books which should be on everyone's \\"must read\\" list, but I doubt I will re-visit this particular book at any point in the grim and morally bankrupt future."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"We are treated to a glimpse of a possible future world where friendship can still exist.

Soft voices whisper into small children's ears as they sleep, repeating the same thing over and over again: \\"Everyone belongs to everyone else, everyone belongs to everyone else...\\"This is the alien world so perfectly portrayed in Brave New World, Aldous Huxley's unusual masterpiece. In this futuristic Earth, people's lives are fully planned out for them before they can even talk, right down to their thoughts and actions. Emotion and creativity are replaced by complete conditioning and soma, a perfected and accepted drug. No one is ever alone, for this would provide an opportunity for people to think for themselves. Those that manage to do so are sent far away from others, for any uncontrolled thought could lead to the end of this seemingly perfect society. One such outsider is Bernard Max, an average Alpha whose blood-surrogate, it is rumored, was tainted when he was a fetus. His persistent curiosity compels him to visit a Reservation, one of the last places where \\"savages\\" are kept. When Bernard returns, he brings along one of these savages, who knows of emotion, religion, and art. He is thrust into a world that is anything but familiar and faces the horrible realization of what the rest of the planet has become.This book gives a frightening look into what a world free of diversity or passion would be, a flawless world that we are, in many ways, slowly becoming. It depicts one interpretation of perfection; thousands of brainwashed robots doing what they're told and surviving on artificial happiness. It's vivid description and realistic characters give life to a situation we find averse and yet recognize as terrifyingly similar to our own. True, we are not conditioned from birth until adolescence, but is not our every action influenced by what is directly in front of us? It seems we are just as prone to control we may not be aware of.From inquisitive outcasts to overwhelmed strangers, Brave New World is a fast-paced science fiction thriller that will leave you questioning your own lifestyle. It will more than satisfy any reader looking for a fulfilling classic."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Imagine a society with absolutely no pain or suffering, no heartache, and no possibility of wanting something you cannot have. This is world which Aldous Huxley creates in his novel Brave New World, a horrifying dystopian, fictional community. Written in 1932, Huxley paints a picture of an \\"ideal\\" society in which all of the people are perfectly content, everyone is satisfied with their positions, and no one ever desires something unattainable. Though apparently idyllic, Huxley, in fact, presents the frightening truth, for these citizens are constrained and confined by their own perfection. Each person is genetically engineered and pharmaceutically anesthetized to produce the perfect addition to the society; any individualism or radical thoughts are utterly shunned and forbidden. Through Huxley's use of strong characters, each with a separate identity, and the vivid portrayal of the evils of a highly advanced society, he successfully creates a novel still relevant today as a warning for future - and our - generations.Each character of the novel plays a separate, essential role in thoroughly depicting the horrors of the dystopian society. Although each character, I feel, has a strong personal identity, few people of the novel have close relationships, which may be attributed to misery of the society, for few strong bonds can be formed. True passion does not exist, after all, for a place with no real pain has no real happiness. Huxley depicts the detachment between people as a \\"norm\\" - it is considered ridiculous, absurd, and even shameful to desire simply one person. Lenina's singular affections for Henry Foster cause her \\"sensible\\" friend Fanny to rebuke her: \\"It's such horribly bad form to go on and on like this with one man\\" (41), thus making Lenina branch out and see other men, such as Bernard Marx. When Bernard takes Lenina on a holiday vacation to a Reservation in New Mexico to see the \\"Savages,\\" she represents the ideal member of the society by dismissing the acts of the Indians as grotesque and terrifying and viewing such normality as aging and diseases as sickening. Lenina's complete conditioning and lack of desire for anything more than her \\"perfect\\" society shows the horrifyingly ubiquitous control of the seeming utopia. Lenina's character makes the reader realize with a jolt that once one is sucked into the society, there is hardly and chance left to want anything more. Bernard Marx's character, the initial subversive voice in the novel, is unhappy despite his high-caste status. His desire for a more intimate relationship with Lenina portrays that something other than what the society has conditioned is still possible. Finally, John the Savage is an insurgent character in the society, demanding the \\"right to be unhappy\\" (240). John realizes that in the attempt to be rid of all unpleasant actions and feelings, the society was also rid of true pleasure, passion, and love. John alone desperately craves a marriage to Lenina, knowledge through reading, and yearns for true feelings, but realizes that these things are nowhere to be found in the society. He states, \\"You got rid of them. Yes, that's just like you. Getting rid of everything unpleasant instead of learning to put up with it\\" (238). However, John and Helmholtz Watson immediately strike a close friendship, possibly owing to the fact that they both possess dissident opinions and are dissatisfied with the society. Overall, through the development of various critical characters and their lack of strong personal relationships, Huxley depicts the evils of the society.Huxley explores the evils of the society as presented by loss of freedom and lack of individual responsibility as seen throughout the plot. Many carnal pleasures are offered to people, such as soma, a drug used to calm any tension or sadness, and the \\"feelies,\\" a type of movie in which people participate in the sensual acts. People such as Lenina use soma as a means of preventing any pain or unpleasant emotion, thereby becoming extremely dependent upon the happiness and \\"mini-vacation\\" it provides from everyday trials and tribulations. Through distribution of this drug, the government maintains control over the people. Stability in the society is the ultimate goal and is achieved rather successfully through control over such drugs, conditioning, and the threat of expulsion to a remote land such as Iceland. Each person is conditioned to their status, ranging from Alpha Plus, the highest caste, to Epsilon, the lowest. People know nothing more than their own caste, and therefore desire nothing else. Bernard, though dissatisfied with his position as an Alpha, is often kept in check by risk of being sent to Iceland. There is no freedom or responsibility to be found in the society; no one challenges the caste, for they genuinely believe they are working together for a common goal. After all, \\"everyone works for everyone else\\" (74).When Huxley wrote this novel, he did not expect to see anything similar actually occur for hundreds of years; however, the effects of the dystopian society are becoming terrifyingly clear in today's world. More common than ever is pre-marital sex and less personal bonds as people rely on communication technology such as the internet and cell phones to sustain relationships. In addition, people are becoming less and less tolerable of withstanding unpleasantness and desire instant gratification, precisely what Huxley warned against. Perhaps we should take greater note of Huxley's message and heed his caveat before virtuosity becomes possible through three half-gram tablets.By: Priya"},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"In the post 9/11 world, it has become almost clich&eacute;d to remark on the disturbingly prophetic vision of George Orwell. But whilst 'Brave New World' may not have quite the eerily recognisable elements of constant surveillance or a government that maintains power through continuous war against amorphous enemies, it is perhaps a deeper, more philosophical treatise on the relationship between individual and society, and one that is just as relevant to the way that fragile relationship is developing today.In Brave New World, Marxism and capitalist consumerism have been synthesised, via science, to produce a society where unhappiness has been abolished but which has no other justification than its own pointless existence. People are brought into the world artificially simply in order to produce goods and consume goods. Meaningful relationships between individuals are taboo, art as a conduit for truth has been banned, the function of science is to enable sterile, pain free, pre-determined lives, from the test-tube to the unmarked, unwept for grave.From the vantage point of 1932 Oxford, Huxley saw the dominant ideologies of his age as being equally crushing to not only the meaningfulness of individual existence, but also to that of civilisation itself. Brave New World can easily be framed as just another treatise on the eternal battle between individual and society, but Huxley presents the conflict in a deeper way, even beyond Orwell's great novel. This is evidenced above all in the fusion of Marxism and capitalism as the stifling creed of his dystopia. These two ideologies, despite their manifest differences, both see the rights of the individual as paramount, freedom from 'exploitation' contrasting with 'freedom to choose'. Huxley shows how both leave the individual less free than ever.This, of course, is something that has been portrayed in print and film many times in the decades since. But what ensures that the novel remains a timeless classic, is its vision of an alternative relationship between man and state. Although the novel is rightly regarded as celebrating the individual's battle against an oppressive, restrictive society, it also presents culture as an end in itself, the ultimate value of human existence, and in doing so gives society an importance over and above any individual. Huxley asks not so much what is the way to individual happiness or 'liberty', he asks 'why are WE here?' Man is not made for society, nor is society made for man, instead society is what separates us from the animals, creating, through culture, art and science, something greater than itself and yet enabling each individual life to possess a higher meaning. Only, however, if we are allowed to be individuals in the first place. Brave New World is a forewarning of what a society would be like that loses those insights, a society that however, is becoming increasingly recognisable as that of our modern consumerist social democratic nations."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Brave New World was a good read, if slightly flawed. There were certain points to the story that were interesting, such as the themes of commercialism and mass production (embodied in a deified Henry Ford) vs. Art, embodied in the story through Shakespeare. Or the ironies such as how the culture has lost the &quot;unnecessary&quot; concept of religion and yet, in its place, deify Ford.However, I often found just as interesting were ways in which BNW unwittingly reveal certain patterns in both literature and in history. For example, how many science fiction novels deal with the problem of how an advanced culture can deal with menial tasks necessary for the society but undesired by that society. Or how Huxley developed the ideas of destroying the old (Shakespeare, classics of literature and music, etc) as a part of his dystopia which, when read, seems outlandish and, at times, silly, until one considers that China's Great Leap Forward, which occured AFTER the writing of this novel, echoed so many similar ideas... the eradication of the classics and anything referring to history.Not as much a classic as 1984, but still intruiging and well worth the read."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"which shows mankind with private helicopters and having replaced God with Ford.

What if Hitler had these technologies during WWII so he was able to not only exterminate the Jews but to clone more people with the dominant traits he thought so superior? We (as a society) have already been confronted with Orwell's Big Brotherly surveillance of society as can be seen in the movie \\"Enemy of the State.\\" What will happen when and if the cloning technologies of \\"Brave New World\\" also enter our society?

In \\"Brave New World\\", contrasting with what happens in the Orwellian \\"1984\\", where people is pressured into unresistance trough coercion in all its forms, people acquiesce into submission trough easy access to pleasure, inebriating themselves with Soma, a type of drug most powerfull to produce the passivity desired by governants. Isn't it something familiar to us in a society surrounded by instant pleasure (alcohol, drugs, cigarretes, instant love and so on)? Don't we all need a kind of Soma to get by trough our daily lives?

Many literary classics, although thematically fascinating, can be ponderous. Just take a look at the intense verbosity of Victorian authors (who were paid by the word, mind you), and you'll know what I mean. Brave New World isn't like that, though. The prose is light, even airy at times, and engulfed me swiftly. It was only toward the denouement that the words became heavy, but by that time, I'd been inured to the writing style.It's quite amazing how the book is as relevant today as it was when it was written. Perhaps a couple of the futuristic devices seem quaint (and the lack of atomic energy a little odd, yet not offputting), but the science is artfully vague enough that current technology can easily fill the gaps.I can see echos of the book in all sorts of utopian literature and film: from Orwell's 1984 to Zardoz.

In this new world children do not have parents, but are produced in fertilization and conditioning centers. Already during hatching the World Controller decides who will become university stuff and who will be a backward semi-moron. After birth the people are kept in a permanent state of adolescence, with the ultimate aim to hunt after pleasure and to consume goods in order to help economy. We follow 4 individuals who make different choices with regard to their future and co-operation with the system.This book was written at a time when these matters were probably rather far-fetched and futuristic, but nowadays there are a lot of things which are frighteningly recognizable: for instance the cloning of people and the total brainless materialism and search for pleasure for the sake of pleasure.

It occured to me recently that although I seemed to feel somewhere in my bones that this statement was true, I hadn't read the book for over six years and couldn't even remember the name of the main character. That being said, having recently devoured Aldous Huxley's landmark novel &quot;Brave New World&quot;, I must most empahtically again declare that this is one of THE MOST IMPORTANT BOOKS I'VE EVER READ!What makes a book important? I think it has something to do with how well its themes and sentiments resonate with the world you experience from day to day. A quantity measured only by how many more truths you can see in unexpected places like the news, the grocery store, or a conversation around the water bubbler. &quot;A Brave New World&quot;, though written at the beginning of the century, seems to have been written with a vision and a penetrating lesson for today.The world described in Huxley's account is streamlined by science and technology, driven by open-ended corporate goals, and carried on the backs of a populace socially-trained from birth to continue an existence without question or meaning. It's a world shackled by a facism with no face or name. Contrary to Orwell's visions of a future entrapped by the ever-present 'Big Brother', Huxley's version of slavery is one enforced by ignorance and pleasure. A theme that seems well-suited to the comfortably worked, television-encased, numbed to violence and tradgedy, pill-popping, bacteria petri-dish America that exists today. It's impossible to read this book without seeing even some of his most outrageous symbolism come alive in the reality of today. To say it is a book that resonates is an understatement. To say that it is an important read is necessary."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"you've got to read it to believe it. Yes it is a brave, totally new world. Huxley words his text like non-before. I have never read a book and can actually visualize it like watching a movie. one chapter has written like a commercial, you can visualize it as the scenes flash back and forth between a conversation and the motto's of the World State. Ooh, that is brave new way of writting a book.I feel for John the Savage in the book and can see how people treat an outcast (some one they don't consider the same) then and now and probably still the same in the future. It's terrible to see a difference can be named &quot;the Savage&quot;. Huxley has used many famous politic figures' name : Marx (refered to Carl Marx) Linina (Lenin -- the rusian politician) etc. to enrich his plot --to give you an idea of a conformed world that is structurized like Communist Society. A world that if you were raised and born into a class, you are it -- alpha, beta, beta-minus etc. The world seem like an Utopia like Marx's once fatacizes but once the dream has become a reality, the structure/the politic itself is destructed. Once something is new and better, they are scared by it. Scared to see the structure they have is an unstablized one. Huxley, in the book, hard-pressed the fact of his world state's motto &quot;COMMUNITY, IDENTITY, STABILITY&quot; to give you the idea of how well and organize Marx wanted his world to be.

This is no sci-fi book, and neither should it be clumped in the &quot;dystopia&quot; category; no, this book introduces all sorts of ideas and questions everyone's perception of the human condition. Anyone who is trying to grasp some comprehension of the human condition (and who isn't?) ought to read this book to gain a radically new perspective.

It's very interesting to think about what can happen in a distant future.It's great to consider how babies could be created by men, the ways of finding satisfaction, and the different types of people that could exist in an upcoming civilization. The vision I found in the book - a \\"perfect\\" world, without feelings , where everyone is only searching for personal pleasure - could be very shocking, but very realistic.On the other hand, the story has no much action, that's why some parts could be tedious to read. The descriptions are great, but sometimes they are too long. The story could be better with more action.However, this is a very good book, and I recommend people to read it and analyze it carefully, because I'm sure they will discover many things about our current society that could encourage us to a Brave New World."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"When someone writes a novel (or develops a theory in a simple conversation) about the future he's not necessarily trying to be a &quot;Nostradamus&quot;, &quot;play god&quot; or other such nonsense attributed to Huxley. First of all we all are opinionated about what's to come even in the not so close future. It's natural, it belongs in human sense to try and foresee where we are going because projecting helps us avoid mistakes, or, helps us &quot;correct&quot; our steering.Huxley, more than half a century ago sees a society heading to a world full of cloned non-individuals who are conditioned with scientific (and horrifying methods) from childhood to behave in specific ways and fulfil specific &quot;social missions&quot; or &quot;assignments&quot;. There's no free thought except for inside the frames you have been planned for and the illusion that your thoughts are indeed your own.People (or the clones that inhabit Huxley's Brave New World) are born and kept into chambers where messages are repeated to them 100s or 1000s of times until these messages become a mentality that the clone sees as his own. Arts have been reduced to more scientific propaganda where there is no message to be conveyed except for the &quot;feel good&quot; effect that keeps things &quot;quiet&quot;, there is no objections and no critique because as the clones are very well convinced &quot;what is there to criticize&quot;.For those with the occasional lapse in &quot;reasoning&quot; there is 'Soma' , a wonder drug which everyone takes and which soothes down your tendencies of questioning or depression. The uniformity is ruthless and anyone who (somehow) manages to step out of line is sent &quot;away&quot;, usually in some place with rebels similar to him where conditions are harsh and opportunities for survival are scarce.This is summarily Brave New World as seen by Huxley and if we try, or as we keep trying to see whether he did indeed have a point we can only compare with what we currently got. This is the only safe passage to a &quot;safe&quot; conclusion.In that respect Huxley proves to be frightengly right even if the current methods dont seem similar to the ones described in his book (but who's to say they wont become such?).While uniformity in today's society might not seem all-encompassing it's not in Huxley's book either. Today, people might not be conditioned from birth in chambers with countless repeated messages but they are conditioned through a uniform school system with uniformed dogmas. They then keep being conditioned with centrally controlled media and any objection or tendency for questioning is similarly thrashed by the weight of &quot;public opinion&quot; which is of course not the product of individual thought.And as for the wonder-drug 'Soma'?While we might not have a wonder-drug (yet) we have a plethora of other drugs which we all (or almost all) take for exactly the same reasons may those be alcohol, cigarettes, softer drugs, or harder or even the omnipresent anti-depressants which are becoming as common in use as alcohol.What about the feel good arts, the 'feelies' as they are descibed in Huxley's book? Go into any record store and look at the charts. If you still have any objectional, individual thought in you, you wont see anything but message-less, critique-less, thoughtless art that only wishes to calm you down, to soothe you like a 'feelie' would. Sure, music that doesnt fit those lows exist but are you &quot;trained&quot; to find it or are you &quot;conditioned&quot; to understand it? The same applies for books or for movies.Being that this is a review for a book and not a sociological analysis (which would probably take not one but many other books to start with) I'll keep it simple:Huxley is indeed accurate in what he foresees based on his times. And while this development is not (or is it?) fully developed yet, while it will probably get a lot worse before it ever gets any better, the point remains the same. Had Huxley been living today and tried to write the same book i dont see how it could've been any different. If anything it would only be more scary or more discouraging concerning our course as a species what with cloning now being reality and not sci-fi anymore and with science being even more a servant to those that pull the strings for &quot;our own good&quot;.Some reviewers here say that the author is not charismatic or that literally looking at it he's a mediocre writer that has a powerful idea but doesnt know how to lay it out well. There might be a degree of truth in all of these claims but, in my humble opinion, with such books this is totally besides the point.Huxley wants to express a fear, an angst, that not only he has, but many of us, before him, and after him. This is strikingly obvious. In in that &quot;mission&quot; of his he succeeds beyond any doubt because the present serves as hardcore evidence for his claims.Along with '1984' by Orwell this book is not simply a &quot;dystopian&quot; classic but a great sociological analysis disguised as a novel. Its value is more than meets the eye especially when one thinks that our eye is not trained to meet much."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"When Brave New World was published (in the 1930s), the thought of a totalitarian form of government taking over a large portion of the world (or even the whole world) was not impossible. Today, of course, that threat seems more distant, but the possibility is still there. The most horrifying effect of this new, dictatorial civilization is the corruption of art and science. As Huxley himself points out in his foreword to this edition, his \\"Brave New World\\" is one in which science has been greatly perverted. Instead of science being used for the convenience of man, man is being molded and shaped according to the progress of science--a terrible possibility.This Brave New World is one in which everyone is happy. This happiness comes, though, at the expense of both passion and thought. People are happy because they cannot be passionate--they do not pine over a lost love, do not desire anything they can't have (they have sexually promiscuous relationships indiscriminately, and say \\"everyone belongs to everyone\\"), and do not ever feel sorrow at the death of someone they know. They are created artificially, and thus have no parents or familial connections. They never marry. And even if they DO ever feel depressed or overwhelmed, they can always take soma (a mind-altering drug which does the job of alcohol and narcotics without the side-effects) and take a \`holiday' from their troubles.People are \`conditioned' to feel and act a certain way from conception. There is no concept of instinct--every ideal, thought, feeling and belief a person has comes about both because of certain injections they received while fetuses and because of various messages played to them in their sleep when children. In effect, they are programmed, and feel no pain or sorrow because they are not conditioned to. This raises an interesting question--are these people really oppressed? After all, they are happy, they feel none of the sorrows and difficulties that free-thinking people do. And their lost liberties (thought, feeling, etc) are not missed--in fact, they don't even know they should miss them. \\"Mother\\" is an obscene word, and so is \\"chastity.\\"The central conflict of this book comes when a \\"savage\\" (from a \`savage' reservation in the Southern US where people are allowed to continue with familial and religious beliefs, but not allowed to leave) is brought from the reservation to live in society. His home on the reservation was dirty, stinky, and full of hate, cruelty, and disease, yet, in the end, he actually prefers this kind of existence to the carefree one he is forced to live. In effect, he would rather have liberty, and all the pain that comes with it, than ignorant bliss.This is one of the most thought-provoking novels of the twentieth century, and deserves a place next to such books as 1984, Animal Farm, and Slaughterhouse Five. It is perhaps less-known than these other classics, but it is every bit as good and ingenious a story, and every bit as poignant in its look at society."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"I re-read (read it for the first time in high school, YEARS ago) this book along with my 15 y.o. daughter who was reading it for school. At least for me, the concepts and thinking within the book were even more disturbing and thought-provoking from the viewpoint of an adult, than they were when I was an adolescent. BNW has challenged me to seriously re-think some of my attitudes towards security, conformity, and protectionism ... both at the governmental and personal levels. I think it's easy in our (American) culture to be lulled by the message machines out there into thinking that life is basically about the pursuit of pleasure and ease. This book suggests that there is more to life than that, but doesn't try to give you the answer about what that &quot;more&quot; is. In that, it opens minds and serves as a thought starter. What more could you ask from a book?I encourage all parents who are buying this book for their kids' school book lists to take the time to give it a read themselves."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Creating a depiction of what the future can hold is a task that Aldous Huxley tackled in his 1932 published book, Brave New World. It tells the story of two main characters, Bernard Marx and John ?the Savage.? The rebellious Marx is filled with an inner hatred towards the Utopian society. John is an outsider with many dissimilar views on Utopia. Both live in a controlled world that divides humans into a caste system. The story begins 632 years after the brave new world (Utopia) has existed. Babies are born in test tubes, a person?s future is determined before birth, the state police control the people?s freedom, Soma is a substance that prevents the people from opening their mind, and the new world is ruled by dictators called World Controllers. Huxley enlightens the reader with a curiosity for the new world but does not give Marx or John the influence to change Utopia into democracy (or sanity). Marx is merely a thinker; he does not show any action towards his belief on society. I believe the intensity of the climax would be greater if Marx took initiative with John to spread the word of freedom and democracy. Although John tries to teach society of open-mindedness, he fails and ends up being in the hands of the people. The novel would serve a better purpose in change than in persistence.With the climax not being fulfilled to my expectations, Huxley does create a forecast when writing about the topic of overpopulation. This is only one example in the novel where Huxley is picked out as a predictor and makes me speculate where our society could be headed. In the 1930?s economists were afraid that the population of life on earth was outgrowing the availability of natural resources (Paul, Warren. Brave New World-Cliff Notes). Huxley foretold this bold statement. In his novel, the depiction of the state police keeping track of how many infants were born and the plan of social role before birth, was comparable to the problem raised in the 1930?s. Issues like overpopulation and human restrictions add great curiosity to the story, making Huxley brilliant at his work. He leaves you wondering what this world may come to if our freedom is ruled by a higher dictatorship. I recommend this novel to anyone seeking a possible outlook on the future of our society."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Brave New World is Aldous Huxley's vision of a future utopia. It happens approximately 600 years in the future from now. The principles of mass production have been applied to human reproduction. There are no parents: everyone is born from bottles. There is no love or hate, there is only eternal happiness. \\"Everyone belongs to everyone else\\" is one of the sayings that people are indoctrinated with. However, since happiness is the norm there is no struggle to attain it and no sense of peace with having it. People take Soma, a drug to fight depression, every day just to excape from reality, to make life a little more \\"bearable\\". The rigid caste system is enforced by treatements to embryos while they are still in the bottles in which they are grown. The intelligent people (Alphas) are enhanced and the people who will be menial workers (Epsilons) are starved of oxygen and fed alcohol as fetuses to retard their brain and body.The main plot of the book is how a young man brought up on a Native American reservation adapts from the reservation to living in the \\"Brave New World\\". The promiscuity of the society he is thrust into completely confuses him. He doesn't understand the pursuit of pleasure to the exclusion of all else. However, this is all the inhabitants outside the reservation know. The main character is completely confused by the total lack of true emotion that they have for each other."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"i was told to read this book this one day when conversing over the book \\"1984.\\" so as i read this book, i had 1984 in mind and may have influenced my perception of Huxley's book.it is a tremendous book about what life could be like in the future. in one way, our society is already heading in that direction with how free we are with our sexuality. i was in romania on a visit two months ago and saw a program from England on TV about sexuality. the program was amazingly blatant in its advice to people. it said things like \\"yeah if your husband isnt pleasing you enough, then a secret lover will work.\\" and other things similar.it was also very interesting how Socialist the society seemed in Huxley's book. i dont know if he was criticizing Socialism (or at the time Communism) or saying that it was inevitable that society would lead to that.in the end though, it is a worth while read for anyone who wants to think. ..."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Aldous Huxley's Brave New World predicts a utopian society set several hundred years in the future. The society Huxley presents is emotionless, sexually promiscuous, and dependant upon drugs. People are peaceful because they have been conditioned to fulfill their place in society. Huxley portrays a dismal situation in which people have no control over the events in their life.Written in the 1930's, Huxley's book predicts many technological advances that are finally materializing about seventy years later. Several of these technologies include rapid of transatlantic flights, the ability to clone, and portable music devices. As a result of these predictions, readers are left wondering how close today's society is to achieving the Utopian society that Huxley predicts.Brave New World has been challenged frequently and banned as well. Many critics claim this book is unacceptable because of its language and moral content. The language throughout the book isn't offensive, but sexual promiscuity, drugs, and immorality are encouraged in the Utopian society Huxley presents. Ironically, many books are banned in Huxley's Utopian society.I came to a horrific realization after reading this book because I believe that Huxley's proposed \\"Utopian\\" society is feasible. Huxley did not intend this to be the case; but he intended this book as a fictional work. I don't think that this book should be read for its realism, but for entertainment."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Huxley's Brave New World has often been described as a chilling prediction of a sterile future world where people are genetically engineered into 'castes' and are unable to advance or better themselves.But is this such a bad world? Someone has to clean toilets. Someone has to sweep streets and collect garbage. Would it not be better to have these jobs done by people who are happy with their lives. In Brave New World everyone below the top caste is inbred with an awe for the Alpha group who are the leaders, movers and shakers of the world. There is no fear of rebellion. People live lives of peace, harmony and tranquility.So what is wrong with this picture? Why do we so fear the very things we seek? What is it in human nature that we want the savage to take root amongst us and tear down our sacred cows? Indeed the savage is the only 'personality' in this book.Brave New Word is relevant because it questions our view of the society we want. In reality we do not want to live a life of social outings and days on the golf course. Man needs adversity in order to thrive. What is it in the nature of man that craves hardship, dirt, pain and risk? What does it say about us as a race?If you haven't read this book, you should. It is one of those must reads which can change the way you think about life. In style it is short, sterile and spare, a reflection perhaps, of life in the Brave New World. There is no adventure here, no great story that will thrill you. But this is a book you will not forget."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"I have read this book several times and I like it better each time I read it. In the tradition of 1984 and Farenheit 451, it bring about the horrors of what could happen in the future if we allow it to happen. Mankind's seeming inability not to mess around with Mother Nature is always getting us into trouble. It is particularly unsettling that the advent of cloning is now upon us, ways of us genetically altering DNA and affecting the way cells are grown in the lab. I hope every scientist who works in these cloning labs has read this book, because it would scare the pants of them, or it should. It is interesting to note that this book was written in the 1930's, way before anyone had heard of genetically altering cells or cloning. Obviously, Mr. Huxley, the author, was a true visionary who saw the possibilities of what could happen long before most other people did. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"I was assigned Brave New World in my AP English class, and I started off with a rather poor impression of the book from my teacher. However, as I read more and more, I realized it is a masterful prediction of what happens when people want to be efficient and happy as opposed to free. While I don't believe Huxley's prediction of a future world is accurate in all aspects, the resemblance to our modern society is becoming all too real. I was reminded somewhat of Fahrenheit 451, but Brave New World is a much better work than Fahrenheit 451. This book made me question my personal ideas of what true happiness is. The reader has to decide, based on the book, whether happiness is a personal standard or if happiness could be attained through careful control by a government. I definitely recommend this book for anyone to read."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"I was tremendously eager to read Brave New World. It is a legendary book, and its thoughts on the future have continued to illuminate the present, decades later. On that score the book is brilliant and visionary. However, AS A NOVEL it tastes like cardboard. The characters are hollow and the plot is clumsy. Fortunately it is a short book, and fortunately, Huxley's remarkable insights carry you through to the end. Still, given that it is a novel, I have to downgrade it for its clumsy design. I ended up reading this more as a historical document, rather than for its literary style. That said, lower your expectations, and plunge in. Huxley was a man of remarkable foresight and one with a keen eye to the social dilemmas posed by technology."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"The Heritage Press Brave New World is one of their most successful and integrated book designs.Cataloguers sometimes report that it is bound in leather, but the glossy orange-red with black and silver details is actually vinyl. Illustrated with gravures by Mara McAfee, including a little helicopter which is repeated as a design motif, the book has ample margins and is printed in Palatino with Chisel chapter numbers and stick-up initials. In a black slipcase.

The references to Shakespeare are well used in the text and make it one of those little gems that keeps you looking for more. On the scifi nerd front, the futurismic world of happiness at the cost of intellect is one of those ideas that gets repeated often enough, but that is only because so many people love to pilfer from Huxley. I really enjoyed Brave New World, even if there were a few philosophical points on which I disagree with Huxley (particularly the false dichotomy he expects the reader to blindly accept). As a dystopian writer Huxley is rightly placed with the greats like Orwell and Zamyatin.Oh yeah, and Leonard Nimoy was great in this movie, they should make it into a book."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Brave New World is a great dystopic and satirical novel. Aldous Huxley created a world where babies are created in test tubes; love, art, literature, religion, and even science are all things of the ancient past; promiscuity and brainless happiness are qualities to be revered; people are conditioned to be satisfied with their place in society, no matter where it is. These concepts sound outlandish and crazy, but in some ways, this is our society today. Just look at the stars we choose to idolize, like Britney Spears and Paris Hilton). Also, the discouragement of people who do well in school by calling them \\"nerds\\" or \\"geeks\\" exemplifies this as well.This novel also shows us where we might be in the future. Many dystopic novels and movies have utilized the idea that the masses will be tamed and controlled by mass drug use, such as the film Equilibrium and The Futurological Congress by Stanislaw Lem. Who knows if we are yet to develop such a drug?With the introduction of John the Savage, into the story, we see that some of our ideas and our social norms have no place in this society. He doesn't fit in to the \\"savage\\" society because his mother is from the world of decadence beyond the wall. He also doesn't fit into that world because he holds on to his literature and religion, even though he has limited knowledge of both.Huxley did a great job of showing that happiness 100% of the time shouldn't be the only thing we, as a society, strive for. Other things are more important, like freedom, creativity, and compassion."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Due to years of hypnopedia, the two million inhabitants of the Central London Hatchery and Conditioning Centre: Alphas, Betas, Gammas, Deltas and Epsilons, work contentedly day after day and year after year at the job for which they have been conditioned. Beyond the brainwashing, the sole motivator for their uncomplaining efforts is a psychotropic drug called Soma. But one citizen, Bernard Marx, an Alpha Plus psychologist (top of the pecking order) and hypnopedia expert during the time in which Brave New World is set, 632 A.F. (in the year of Our Ford), is feeling disillusioned. His pat reply to the sunny phrases (like (p 50) \\"Everybody's happy now,\\") spewed regularly by members of the brainwashed masses, is that particular mantra's conditioning regime (e.g. (p 62) \\"Two hundred repetitions, twice a week from fourteen to sixteen and a half\\"). Wanting to establish a nontraditional relationship with a woman \\"known\\" to many, Lenina Crowne, he entices her with a date involving entry to a place of limited access: the Savage Reservation, where humans are viviparous (elsewhere, humans are fertilized and formed entirely in test tubes). The couple is stunned at what they encounter: an elderly man, a woman nursing, and a slovenly, aged-looking mystery woman from their own world (off reservation, humans are chemically \\"preserved\\" into youthfulness until age 60). Unsurprisingly, the mystery woman and her son, ostracized for their differences on reservation, fare even worse in the Other Place.Beyond the obvious issues like social class, behavioral conditioning, cloning, religion, morality, mortality and cultural differences between peoples, are those involving world politics and politicians. Huxley's fantastic, futuristic tale, first published in 1932, was ahead of its time in many ways, and will likely strike a chord with readers one and all. Also good, 1984 by George Orwell, The Giver by Lois Lowery, and Planet of the Apes by Pierre Boulle."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"To fully appreciate this book, one has to take into consideration the fact that it was written more than 70 years ago. The author creates a society where there is no individualism, where everyone belongs to everyone, where there is no mother and father. Perhaps you may compare it in some aspects to Plato's Republic. In short, the author shows that sometimes the price of stability is humanity, and he shows you what a society that has paid this price looks like."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"The main thrust of this novel is a description of a future where social stability is the primary concern of the \\"World State.\\" People are altered prior to birth to fit into castes of different ability and social strata. Pain and suffering are much reduced by eliminating the emotion involved in personal interactions, filling leisure time so that people don't have time to think, and by using the drug soma. The characters and plot are incidental to the description of the World State.Although this novel is interesting, and possibly ahead of its time, the passage of time has seen this type of future and its variations depicted many times in mostly bad science fiction books, movies, and television shows.

The book shows Huxley's extreme creativity with \\"feely movies\\", people being created in test tubes, and hypnopaedia. There are so many concepts, motifs, and themes, it is hard to distinguish them all. The main concept readers grasp is a social and scientific revolution.Brave New World lets us follow many little stories, all taking place in the future. There is \\"civilization\\" and the rest of the non-conformed world When the two are brought together, both sides are equally fascinated. The member of the uncivilized world becomes disgusted with the new worlds lifestyle of sexual promiscuity, technology advances and constant happiness. People are generic and unaware of the hardships in life, as simple as mosquitoes and pests, and if anything upset them, they took a gramme of their precious euphoric drug and mentally left society.\\"Civilization\\" has no tolerance for mothers or fathers and individualism; the sole fact that the \`savage' was born the natural way caused a huge uproar. Books are in verbal form and Shakespeare, the Bible and anything with a unique voice are completely unknown to their perfect world. Everyone is generically made through a long scientific process and then conditioned for many things, like emotional detachment to anything, and sexual playtime being acceptable. When people start developing a mind of their own, they are shipped to an island to be themselves, instead of corrupting society.The major downfall to the book is the slow reading, while reading the long scientific processes, my eyes crossed and I had to force myself to refocus. There really is no stated plot, just a bunch of ideas of society, human nature, and the revolutionary future of freedom and captivity. Towards the end of the book, the story really becomes interesting, and ends in an unexpected twist, leaving you wanting to read more (finally!).

People now turn towards the government for their comfort not a chapel. What has happened? Science has happened. Man has taken the role of God and Man now has indirect control over everybody, everywhere. Children aren't born nowadays. The truth is, most people don't know the word &quot;parent,&quot; and the people who do are afraid of it. No you are not born, Man creates you. You now start as an embryo in a little jar. That jar sits on a large conveyor belt moving slowly towards adulthood. Why has man chose to do this? One word: Stability. This is not the only surprise that Huxley intertwines into this faced paced piece of scientific literature. He portrays an unimaginable life that blows you mind away. His writing style just grabs you by the collar and pulls you into to this amazing story about life in future time. This scientific masterpiece isn't just about the future. Aldous Huxley ties in the story of a Savage brought in from the Malpais Indian tribe. He is oblivious to world outside his clay house. When he is brought to sense about the brave new world that he was born into, it disgust him to the largest extent. This roller coaster of a book will keep you pinned to you seat throughout the whole ride. It is definitely a must read."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Brave New World is a worthy book, that is not nearly as dark as it could be. A truly unrealistic view as to what may happen in the future allows for a comfortable distance between what is put forth in the book and what is possible, yet some elements to be seen in Huxley's world can be seen in our own, even today. An excellent choice for anyone looking for a book that can provide intellectual stimulation while remaining enjoyable and entertaining."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"We read Brave New World for sophmore history and when asked wheter we would like to live in the world so vividly painted by Huxley, the class was in a 50-50 split.

It forces to make a decision and come to our own conclusions.What makes this book so great is that very equivocalness that made the 50-50 split; it can be construed in many different ways. The book is good but be sure to have a dictionary near by unless you can readily define terms like &quot;viviparos&quot;. Read the book slowly and look up theuses of words you don't understand because it is getting increasingly important that people read this book carefully. Our society is heading towards the society portrayed in Brave New World. There are many parallels to our society like the drug &quot;soma&quot;. We too have drugs like soma, the biggest being alcohol. Perhaps we will be faced with a decision: either to live in the cold, efficiancy of the &quot;perfect&quot; government where we would live in blissful ignorance, or will we choose the imperfect society where we would be subject to suffering.

Better than &quot;1984&quot; and &quot;Erewhon&quot; put together and served with soma.Peter Kreeft, an amazing writer and literary scholar, listed Brave New World as one of the SIX books of the 20th Century that he would make everyone read if he were God. In my opinion, that's a bit extreme, but I can almost agree. BNW is the most sobering (and clearest) fictional picture we have of the possibilities inherent in viewing mankind in strictly utilitarian terms. In the nearly seventy years since BNW's first printing, our world has made great strides in the science of biological engineering, oftentimes very overall beneficial strides. It is just such &quot;advancement&quot; however, which makes Brave New World all the more poignant a read in the year 2000 and beyond. May we &quot;use&quot; it to dispel any cherished myths we may have about social salvation through technological expertise. It could just as easily have been called Grave New World!"},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Brave New World is a novel about one of the dimmer paths into the future that humanity may oneday embark upon. It is a novel that asks humanity which is more important: the search for truth and the attainment of knowledge or the pursuit of pleasure and happiness(whatever that is). It asks humanity if it is better to live in a world where the individual is just as important as the system, or whether the former is merely a trivial cell of the higher organism. A central criterion to this question is the role of science, which Huxley shows as being both good and evil: the enlightenment it provides also serve to cast shadows. While science is central to truth and beauty ( Inventas vitam juvat excoluisse per artes), it does also work in malevolent ways to eliminate it. Science does offer humanity the path to self destruct and live in idle blissfullness (If you would like to live in such a manner, read this book and see the consequences...). Regarding the mechanics of the novel, it is weak in character development and the corresponding environment in which these characters dance. Rich settings and fully realized characters are not what the book is about, however. They are merely props for Huxley to project his message. Since the message is the primary focus of the book, this does not detract away from the novel in any grave manner. Furthermore, the presentation of the novel's content is very well constructed, wherein it scores most of its merit points. Witty, comical, and very satirical, Huxley masterfully presents his ideas. The chapters filled with the most meat (or tofu for the vegetarians) must be 16 and 17. Chapter three is perhaps the most intense and experimental section of the book, where a multitude of conversations are presented all at once, and it is up to the reader to decipher exactly who is saying what. A most definite read, however, not as shocking as perhaps it once might have been, for quite a few of the predictions seem just around the very near corner, and some have already been fulfilled! Enough staring at this monitor, I've a headache...where's that damn half gram of SOMA...after all, how does the rhyme go?..."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"This book is a classic. Not because it is the best written book of all time, although being pretty good. It is the fightening parallel with our own world that is so scary.Aldous Huxley dreamt up the scariest vision of the future he could, satirizing the trends in people he saw. The result is so much frighteningly closer to our own world than to his. Huxley hardly missed anything.His is a world of constant noise. Life is filled up with meaningless entertainment and drugs that mean that people don't have to think about anything. Everyone assumes that their world is great. They are told so, and can't think differemtly. People now are more easily led than before. People sit and watch primetime TV, which is so very much mindless entertainment. &quot;Things are better now...&quot;This is a world of asthetic perfection. Huxley satirizes the cult of the youth and beauty by having everyone look beautiful. And no one visibly ages past about thirty. Look at the beauty industry. Look at the infomercials. Everything is geared to play on people's insecurity about their age. Women can't be a natural size without the media telling them they're fat by spreading size 0 models over everything we see.Huxley's world is one where everyone is born on a conveyor belt. Sex is only for pleasure, not reproduction. The use of artificial insemination and the rise in the use of contraceptives mirror Huxley's vision (not necessarily in a negative way, of course.)There are so many further parallels. Huxley's nightmare dytopia is not so far from our reality."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Brave New World is a downright chilling book. It is far more terrifying than any other book I have read. The horror in this book come from the fact that Huxley presents his vision of the future in such a way that one cannot decide weither it is good or evil. Adding to the horror is his description of the Savage reservation and of the society of Alphas experiment. These two things are meant to represent our current society. He presents the unsavory choice between our world with its violence, disease, and sorrows and the future world of castes and conditioning. People have commented here and in other places that the residents of Huxley's Brave New World are not free. This is not entirely true. The future people of Brave New World are completely free in their world because they do not know that it could be different! This is what makes Brave New World so difficult for me to categorize. Are the Epsilons oppressed? No, because they cannot know anything different than the way they were made. Yes, because they did not have a choice in becoming an Epsilon. Is it wrong to sacrifice freedom for stability and peace? No, because then there is no war or hatred. Yes, because there is no independant thought. Is it wrong to desire the future that Huxley presents? No, because there is no war, disease, hatred, violence, instability, or sadness. Yes, because there is free sex, drugs, no freedom of thought, no parents, no old, no past, no history, no God, no change, no love? All these questions are raised when one reads Brave New World. None of them have clear answers. I see trends toward Huxley's future in our current society. Commentary on Huxley has generally concluded that it would not be a good thing for our world to become like Huxley's. Why? Would it truly be so terrible? The people of Brave New World know nothing else. What exactly is it that is so terrible about Huxley's future? Is it Brave New World an evil world? I cannot decide this. That is why Brave New World is so terrifing to me. This is absolutely a m! ust read book."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Having read this book for a high school English class about 10 years ago, I recently stumbled across it and decided to read it again. What struck me this time around was that Huxley's vision of &quot;Utopia&quot; was not as purely evil as it is often portrayed, but only excessive in its manipulation of every aspect of its citizenry's existence. Nor is the Reservation that John was raised on some sort of idyllic throwback to a happier time in human history, for it was just as unforgiving of difference, of variation from the norm, of free thought, as the &quot;civilized&quot; London.This time, I read the novel as an appeal towards finding a medium between these two extremes. That's what John set out to do at the end, to find a way of life that he felt that he had earned and that he deserved through patience and struggle, and not handed to him because he was decanted as a certain category or denied him because he physically differed from those around him.Huxley's greatest prophesy was the way the Savage's struggle was turned into entertainment for the masses. Our own culture seems to have become just like the one in the book, where if it isn't recorded and broadcast to the masses, it doesn't count. A world where every intimate detail of the private life of an individual is deemed the property of all, valid to commented upon and ridiculed, subverted and manipulated to fit the agenda of anyone who so chooses to use it."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Huxley and his Brave New World has a permanent place in the annals of literature. It is forever mentioned in the same breath as 1984 as a warning of the dangers of dystopic society.And as Dystopia, it works very very well indeed. Whereas Orwell's dark world is essentially sateric and unlikely to occur in toto, Huxley's world is all too easy to imagine coming to pass. Humanity segmented by ability into roles they cannot surmount. Unrestricted procreation turned into a violent taboo while sexuality is made readily accessible. And most of all... a world where everything is designed to make you happy. All the games and work and social groups are meant to keep everyone feeling very close and happy with each other and themselves, with drugs a last resort to ensure a holiday.Part of what makes the Brave New World frightening is that no evil mastermind is at its head. Its leaders believe in all the principles their followers do, and if freedom, individuality, art and science are sacrificed onto the alter of perpetual group happiness, well, is that too high a price to pay? If so -- don't worry about it. Have some Soma. Relax. Be happy.Sadly, the text of the work doesn't live up to the concepts of the work. Huxley's expositional style is weak, sounding almost like an old time radio announcer barking out description and editorializing all at once. There is little subtlty in the Brave New World -- everything is painted with a broad brush, to ensure maximum effect at the cost of readibility. The dialogue never really rings true, either. If this were written today, it would have trouble being published.But it wasn't. And if far more sophisticated and technically proficient examples of Dystopic fiction have appeared since, it is due in large part to Huxley and his Brave New World, who paved the way by daring to sound the hardest warning of all -- Death by Happiness"},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"This was a gift. The person receiving this was pleased. And, they said that they were happy to receive it."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Aldous Huxley creates in this book the &#34;Brave New World&#34;, a hilarious commentary on what may be considered a scientific ideal set in the future, or commentary on the expectations in his own 20th century realizations of a scientific movement. Either way, the &#34;Brave New World&#34; does not disappoint the reader. You can expect a little hilarity in every chapter concerning his observations indicative of a heightened sense of awareness of the concerns in society. Those things that the modern world takes for granted are copiously elaborated in his &#34;Brave New World&#34;, unexpected and uniquely distinguished with an air of humor. His observations are elaborate and of a keen sense and the writing is excellent and a joy to read. The chapters are relatively short and never laborious or containing any sense of tedium.

They can't believe the prophetic element to the novel."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"I find it surprising every time I've read this how much Huxley gets right in his predictions of the future. Some of the horrifying things in the book look possible now. When is maximizing the value we place on technological and social progress actually good for humanity, and when is it detrimental? Very valid questions about the psychological, sociological, and ethical impacts of technology are raised which are valid to this day. I'm not a Luddite, but I sometimes wonder if that position wouldn't be reasonable."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"everyone should read.

My grand daughter needs to read it for school."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"I chose to read Brave New World because I had heard that it was very similar to Nineteen Eighty Four by George Orwell, which is my all-time favorite book because of its dystopian nature. Now, Brave New World is also on the list of my favorite books, for the very same reason. This book makes you question marketing methods and moral issues. I thoroughly enjoyed how Aldous Huxley brought historical figures to life with the allusion of names to scientists and theories that he used in the book repeatedly. The symbolism of zippers throughout the book communicates how their society is formed by convenience. The novel is extremely ironic, which is shown through many conversations that characters have and ideas that are portrayed as well such as sacrifice, art, and age. This book was written in 1932, which is fascinating because of how closely it reflects today's society of consumerism and technology. Brave New World has given me a new outlook on individuality. It is a difficult book to get in to at first, I had to read the first nine chapters twice, but it helped me understand how their society was formed and brought up. This is a deep book with elevated diction, eliminating the opportunity for everyone to read it but the ideas presented are invaluable."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"This was a book I had read in high school and really enjoyed. I thought this would make a great addition to my library at home."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Could this happen? A world where &quot;civilization is sterilization&quot;. A world where eugenics and state-sponsored conditioning determines the likely outcome of everything, including an individual's proclivities, dreams, and ambitions. A world where freedom of thought is disdained in the interest of stability and happiness. A world where God has been dethroned and locked in a closet because mankind no longer has any use for Him. In Huxley's Brave New World, all choices have been eliminated and replaced with a pre-programmed sense of self and duty. Although written long ago, this work still presents the reader with many relevant things to think about today. And it is somewhat disturbing to notice that many of things that compose this brave new world are, in fact, either in place today, or someone is working on them."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"I feel that 1984 and B.N.W. can be compared as long as one admits that each has vast differences that make each equally special to the literary world.1984 is a straightforward, easy to read, entertaining tale of a dim future.Brave New World is more philosophical and a harder to read than 1984. However, if you are willing to stick with BNW--afterall it's not THAT long--you'll come away amazed at the book.What makes BNW so unique is that it remains accurate and possible even though it was written nearly 70 years ago. Huxley did it just right.This story is humorous as well as bleak, and one can eiasly see how our modern society is quickly entering into a society much like the one found in the, \\"brave new world.\\"This may be among the best s.f. books ever written--along with Dune--and should be required reading. Often, it is. No doubt in a hundred years or more, this book will become a main part of the s.f. cannon. Or, however, if Huxley's predictions are true, Our Ford may not allow it.Afterall, it IS a tad old. (read to find out why this is funny)Summary: Go read it already!!! It's worth it."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"After reading both Aldous Huxley's Brave New World and George Orwell's 1984, I have come to the conclusion that both of these men were not so much visionaries or prophets, but they did see the world in a different light than most: they saw it in its true light. I just read BNW and was absolutely blown away that someone had done such a great job at attempting to portray the scary rate at which we are sending this world into a state of total denial, where we allow propaganda to rule us, and to lose our voice completely. Huxley's writing style, which moves swiftly and smoothly, really captures the essence of a world in which everything is just assumed to be the right thing and no one speaks out. The society in the novel is basically one where everything works very orderly, and anything out of the order is considered to be uncivilized. And when life becomes too much for a given person, they can take the precious soma tablets which, knowing Huxley's extensive drug experimentation, would supposed to resemble acid or other strong hallucinogens. I loved this book and could not get enough of how nearly everything that Huxley commented on was true, or something that is headed down the road for the future. Some people read material by Orwell and Huxley and are scared by the things that they basically predict that will happen in the not-so-far future. However, I just listen to these predictions and I don't think of them as predicitons. I think of them as true statements about today's world and the things to come if we continue to follow down this path."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Brave New World is a must read, and becomes more relevant with each passing year. Much of Huxley's vision of the future is within our grasp: it is but a step from choosing the sex of one's babies to conditioning the physical and mental attributes of embryos; a step from the continual advertising bombardment of today to the consumerism of 'end don't mend', a step from TV to the feelies, a step from Prozac and Ritalin to Soma.However Brave New World is not the terrifying vision of the future many make it out be. This is because Huxley contrasts his sterile, engineered society of the future with the grimy, superstitious society of the reservation. Huxley asks: is it better to have poverty, violence, art and freedom; or order, conformity, comfort and banality. After all happiness is still happiness even when produced by artificial means. The balance between order and chaos is a fundemental choice for any society.All in all a thought provoking book, and therefore highly recommended"},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Brave New World by Aldous Huxley is a surprising story written in its time period. It talks about the future where everything is \\"perfectly\\" manufactured so everyone is the same. There is a social hierarchy where your place in life is determined before you're heart even starts beating. Then according to your class, your mind is warped to think that you have the best life out of everyone even if you were the lowest rung on the ladder. Then after being coaxed into this life, the \\"savage\\" world comes to surface. This story tells about a shift in perspective when the truth comes to light.This narrative was written in the 1930's when genetics and test tube babies weren't even known. Yet, the author has the imagination to think of ideas similar to this and the \\"assembly line\\" of human reproduction where it is a version of the assembly line that Gerald Ford used to build cars. The assembly line is a lot alike the test tube babies that we have today. In test tubes, genes are taken out that are unwanted and new ones are put in to produce a perfect person. The \\"soma\\" is also another aspect of the modern world's daily life. The soma of Bernard and Lenina's time is the depression medication of today. When you're feeling blue take a couple of these and you will feel better. It is what society depends on to be happy.Most authors would write the future as hovercrafts, spaceships, and other distant planets. However, Huxley had a different point of view. This fascinating book tells the story of how the future might have been from the perspective of 1930. Surprisingly aspects of this book are so familiar with the everyday happenings of today."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"I always enjoy Orwellian novels and those on dystopias, and though BNW was worth reading to see Huxley's view on a bad path, I found the substance of the novel seriously lacking. It lacked a main plot pulling the whole thing together. He jumped around from protagonist to protagonist, leaving you begging for him to settle on one dissenter, but instead all you get is four or five wishy-washy ones. Take a gram of Soma before reading this one."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Simply superb! Huxley's Brave New World is so well written in every single way that even the forward was interesting. I have not come across a book this good for a long time. The plot is innovative, the story is captivating, the characters multi-layered and well presented, and the writing - ah, flawless!Brave New World invented a seemingly improbable world of perfection, where science had taken out all the elements of misery, where everybody is happy or so they seemed. Yet, Huxley's Brave New World is but a satire of the current world we live in. Then, through the touchstone experiences of a Savage, Huxley cleverly pointed out lackings of the current human condition. That is the genuis!The story is so engaging that you could not put the book down. The ideas presented are thought provoking and intellectually stimulating. At the same time, the writing itself was so fluent and beautiful that the reading experience is simply heavenly. I recommend this book to everyone!!!"},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Brave New World is a phrase taken from Shakespeare's Tempest:Brave New World O, wonder!How many goodly creatures are there here!How beauteous mankind is! O brave new world,That has such people in't!)It depicts a dystopia (the was word coined in 1950s, two decades after the book was pulished -- meaning a place directly opposite of Utopia). Huxley paints a bleak, dark place, situated in remote future, where humanity has chosen the wrong course for its progeny.Brave New World surprised me by both by its brilliance and -- in some areas -- its shortcomings. For example, in this book, published in 1932, reproduction is carried out through in vitro fertilization. This process also employs another technique, called a rather tongue-twisting bokanovskification, whereby one zygote is treated to churn out up 96 clones (How eerily prescient, taking into account that the first mammalian clone, the famous sheep Dolly, was created not before 1997. Current record of producing most clones from a single cell is still a paltry 9 mice). Some scenes in the book even remind one of the rows upon rows of test-tubes humans in the recent movie The Matrix. This process of reproduction was so fantastic that the great science fiction writer Isac Asimov could not visualize it even in 1957! While writing his scifi classic &quot;The Naked Sun&quot;, he depicts a colonized planet Solaria, where humans had become so reclusive that the presence of any other person in their close vicinity is absolutely abhorrent -- they meet each other through a 3D holographic device. But however nauseating the presence of any other human being near them, even those hermits produce babies in the good old fashion of us mortals! I'm sure Isac Asimov didn't read Brave New World, did he?But on the other hand, the characterization of Huxley leaves much to be desired. All characters are one-dimensional and stiff. Lenina (the heroine), Bernard, Linda, the director and others are as life-like as street-shop mannequins. And I found the character of the Savage - champion of the cause of freewill and old-fashioned humanity -- the most unbelievable. I fail to comprehend how a person who lived all his life in an almost pre-historic environment and who never read any book in his life except the works of Shakespeare (how did he manage to understand him is another matter!) can be so erudite and so thoughtful as to engage in philosophical discussions on history, psychology and human behavior? I think this is a big flaw that mars an otherwise brilliant book.It would be worthwhile here take into account another great 20th century dystopia &quot;1984&quot; by George Orwell. Although it's hard to compare these two novels but in my opinion 1984 is much more terrifying and Orwell's future world is much grimmer than Huxley's. And his characters, too, are more believable."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"I came upon this book for two reasons: I had heard about it quite often from various sources, and I have always been interested in books that dealt with how society could go wrong, namely dystopic novels. Huxley's masterpiece proved to be enjoyable and extrememly thought-provoking. His predictions about the prominence of science in society is eeirly similar to the present day.This novel contains many truths that were in Plato's Republic: eugenics, separate classes which performed certain tasks, children raised communally, the destruction of the family, etc. And, as in the Republic, this society appeared great in theory, but in reality it was vapid and lacked meaning. All the citizens are slaves to their conditioning, and only when an 'uncivilized' person enters their society can the reader truly comprehend the horrors of this Brave New World. For those who enjoy novels that make you think about society and the future, this novel is for you. Often compared to Orwell's 1984, it is actually quite different, yet has similar themes. Enjoyable and thought-provoking."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"It seems that I have a very different interpretation of this book than others do. I suppose Huxley meant for it to be a condemnation of the World State utopia. But I don't see it that way. I see the novel much more as a tragedy of the human spirit.Huxley paints a picture of a world where almost everyone is happy and content. Why is this so bad? What no one ever really seems able to explain is why a life of misery and hardship is truly better than life in the World State. WE may not find satisfaction in it, but maybe that's just a product of our own masochistic minds. Why condemn those that do find satisfaction in it? Why must we drag them into our pit? I see in these reviews reminders of the way that the natural humans in the novel shun John. The World State is &quot;different&quot; and must therefore be attacked- never mind that almost all of its inhabitants are perfectly fine with their lives. That doesn't matter! They MUST be made to see that pain is good! What?For me, the center of this novel is the tragedy of John- a man unable to live anywhere. A man torn to shreds by his own soul, and then turned into an amusement by society. THAT, to me, is the heart of the book. That sometimes there is no right and wrong- there is only the unbearable fact that some people simply aren't made for the times or culture that they're born into. What do they do? How do they survive? Unfortunately, in John, we see the fate of so many great and original thinkers."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Many have found Huxley's Brave New World to be an accurate and intelligent social commentary. Thus far I have met no one with an opinion similar to mine. I think Huxley's message is garbage. We are supposed to appreciate the finer things in life? what are they? the things that have appreciated in the past? Ironically when I read this, I discovered a perfect world. No disease, no poverty, everyone is happy, if &quot;superficially&quot; so. Even those that are dissatisfied get their own little islands, to engage in their romantic ideals. The majority of people have never truly appreciated the finer things in life. The average person is not a wine taster, the average person, doesn't watch theater, the average person would rather read Grisham than Tolstoy. The message is completely moot. It's never been truly applicable. The appreciators have always been a minority.Even though the message is trite, and pointless, I did find the novel itself quite entertaining, and well written. More importantly I feel that people should read this critically to develop their own ideas. Whether agreeing or disagreeing. Remember also that no society is without its conditioning."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"I cannot understand why someone would label this book boring. I found the first chapter (about 15 pages) a bit slow but after that it picked up quickly. Don't be fooled by the &quot;this book sucks, it's sooooo boring&quot; reviews. The book is easy to read (the writing is a bit flawed but easy to understand) and presents a thought provoking idea about our society."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"The Brave New World is a story about the future. The story takes place in Europe. In The Brave New World there are no families. There are no mothers and fathers, husbands and wives, brothers and sisters. People were not allowed to have children. Every body is produced through science. The country is run by a man called the Director of Hatchery and Conditioning (DHC). The DHC conditions everybody to what he wants people to know. In this story there is no pain or anger. When somebody begins to have a bad feeling they take a pill called Soma, and it makes them happy. The main characters are Bernard, Lenina and John. Bernard goes on a trip to a place called the Reservation. The DHC allows Bernard to take one guest, but also warns him about breaking the rules of the city. The DHC lets Bernard and his friend Helmholtz Watson know that if they keep on breaking the rules they will be exiled from the country. Bernard chooses Lenina to go with him. Together they meet a boy named John who turns out to be the DHC's son. Bernard decides to bring John back to the city were they live. Bernard thinks this will save him from being exiled for not following the rules. When Bernard brings John back, the DHC gets embarrassed and quits as the ruler. A man by the name of Mustapha Mond is next in line to be the ruler.John was my favorite character because he expressed how he felt. John did not want the DHC and the government to control his life. He wanted to live under his own rules. John was not scared to say what he felt unlike the other characters. A comment that typified John was, \\"But I don't want comfort. I want God, I want poetry, I want real danger, I want freedom, I want goodness. I want sin.\\"I could relate to being in a place that I know nothing about. Last summer I went to Denver for three months. To me it was a new experience. I did not like it. The people and weather in Denver were different then I'm used to and made me feel uncomfortable. I stayed there for three months to see if my attitude would change about my new surroundings. I missed my friends and family a lot. This played a big role in my wanting to come back. That's how I think I relate to John by not feeling comfortable in my new surroundings.I have to say that when I first started reading this book, I did not like it because I did not understand it. Huxley did a good job in explaining a lot of my questions in the ending chapters. My favorite part in the book was when John and Helmholtz Watson were alone with Mustapha Mond. They were not afraid to ask why world is how it is. Just because people are happy does mean that taking soma is the right thing to do.I would recommend this book to everyone. I would surely recommend it to all my friends because I think that they would like the book. People who like science fiction would probably like this book because it takes place in the future. The author looked at science and technology and wrote about how society could change and how technology could take over society."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"This book is a literary masterpiece. It depicts a future world so barren and so devoid of promise that the only thing scarier than it is the fact that it's already coming true. The book is comparable to (although very different from) Orwell's 1984. No use comparing them, as many have done. They are both great books, and should be read by everyone.That said, Brave New World is not for everyone. Sorry to be frank, but an idiot cannot read this book. I know two immature people who started reading the book (and didn't even make it through the first chapter) that said it was &quot;retarted&quot;. Okay, so there. If you're gonna read this book, do it right. Don't read it while watching TV or listening to the radio. You have to read it on it's own and read it slowly, to truly understand it. Because it can be quite confusing at times. For example, early on in the book there is a part where two different scenes are taking place simultaneously, and the character's thoughts from each of the scenes are spoken, but with no note of who is saying them. You have to be really paying attention to the book to get anything out of it. And yes, it does have very deep meanings. Read this if you are looking for something a little more thought-provoking and serious than your usual run-of-the-mill action novel."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"I do not understand at all what everyone is raving about. Mediocre writing, snail-like pacing, and shallow stereotypes (the semi-rebellious anti-hero, the hard-core Messiah/revolutionary figure, the orthodox romantic interest, the benevolent omnipotent despot are Bernard, Savage, Lenina and Mond, respectively) aside, the idea of this book is absurd. Sure, the denizens of Huxley's Ford-ruled world (and the replacement of &quot;God&quot; with &quot;Ford&quot;; I found that amusing for, oh, about three seconds) seem perfectly happy to me, and the book is written in such a cock-eyes and unbelievable manner that this &quot;Brave New World&quot; doesn't seems at all depressing; it just seems like another way to live life. This is a crushingly pointless book."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"It eerily predicts a lot about the consumerism and pleasure seeking of our current society which is slowly turning sex into entertainment, putting aside its reproduction.

What I love most about this book is the scientific approach presented, children are now produced in laboratories and one individual was raised in a \\"savage\\" environment and is later introduced to the futuristic society he'd been dreaming about. I love the last few chapters that follow the savages' breakdown and attempt to free people's minds about the horror of the society they live in.The ending is very intense and the overall message of the story is very brilliant and imaginative, but it may offend some people because of the explicit sexuality in the book and some ultra-religious folk may hate it as well but if you're open minded I suggest you read this book."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Many people these days worry about our society turning into the nightmare of George Orwell's 1984.

Those, like me, revisiting after thirty years or more, will read it feeling a slight unease. While the world it envisions is not ours, there are disturbing parallels. I recently started to reread some of the old science fiction, that from the 1960's and 1970's. While some are now dated and are of interest as historical curiosities, this has survived the test of time. And this was written in 1931! The technology described in the baby factory has shocking parallels today. A society based on consumption, of goods and entertainment, is strangely topical. Huxley wrote this book as an \\"anti-Utopian\\" novel. In his day, the increasing pace of life, mechanisation and the fear of \\" Americanization\\", were topical issues. I am not giving this 5 stars because it is the best book I ever read, or even among the best. I am not in love with any character nor do I admire their world and enjoy my time there. I give it 5 stars for the astonishing vision, and message that is valid even today. I find it just as disturbing now, in my 21st world, as those who first read it in the 1930's would have, in fact more so as we seem to be making progress towards this vision."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"I went into this book expecting a science fiction book that introduced extreme new ideas of what the future could be like. The first part of the book did give me that, and I loved it. The rest of the book, rather than just science fiction, was more a view of humanity and it's evolution because of the science fiction in the book. I loved every second of it."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Brave New World is a masterfully written piece of literature that captured my imagination. For people who enjoy fictional novels that also analyze basic human interaction and distinct social norms, Brave New World encapsulates both and is definitely the perfect read. Personally, I enjoyed the sheer differences between our upbringing through families and the form of child\\"birth\\" and childhood experienced by those in the book. The conventional forms of child rearing are thrown out in order to create lasting stability. They conceive children in test tubes, shock them through the Bokanovsky Process, and grow them in containers in massive room. Occupations and caste already determined, these children grow into what the government want them to be. They become a product of the government, and reflect the values and beliefs that the government want in order to achieve stability. The government controls every aspect of everyone's life, whether directly or indirectly, from the time they are conceived in test tubes to when they die. The government's micromanaging of its citizens is what causes the stability, and therefore they also remove the individualism from the person as they control them. This is quite obviously different to how we raise children in our society, but the vast effort put into these differences and other differences in society or humanity are what make Brave New World an intriguing novel. The places that Aldous Huxley chose to keep similar to our society and humanity are what help present the ideas of social change expressed in the book. The most common place where similarities are drawn is through human nature. The humans are naturally selfish and seek to better their situation, even when the community and unity of people is stressed in society, as it is in Brave New World. These parallels allowed me to understand the differences in Brave New World better, and thus made me enjoy the complexity and wittiness of the book. Aldous Huxley took his views on society and human nature and wrote a gripping novel about the true meaning of being an individual."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"I'm fascinated how an authors writing reflects the times they are living in. This book was published in 1932 after being exposed to WWI, the Great Depression, and the rise of political ISM's. He hits the nail on the head by showing that even with so called \\"utopian society\\" not every one is happy. What is the old axiom - \\"You can't please all the people all the time.\\" This book is a very good read; but, tries to tackle to many issues all at once.Not that it doesn't make a good story; but, I find it peculiar that all of the authority figures are male and the women are moronic materialistic sex objects (which I can point to several examples in todays society). The most disturbing issue to me was the idea that if a woman got pregnant the \\"father\\" was able to cast her off to the savages with no remorse."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"This is the original book that started the dystopia genre of novels. Futuristic, yet believable. It is hard to believe that this was written in the 1930's, because it reads like a modern book. If you are American, the occasional British English spellings might throw you off a bit, but still easy to comprehend.Pros:*Novel that started an entire genre.*Still extremely relevant.*Realistic...almost everything. Idioms, slang, descriptions, entertainment and names.*Drugs (Soma) and Sex abound. (It works in the book. Just believe me.)Cons:*Switches main characters in the middle.*Doesn't give very much background on the formation of the World State.*Nowdays the Savage Reservation seems unlikely.

I just didn't get it... well, I \\"got it\\" but I don't get what all the hype is about.In BRAVE NEW WORLD the people of the new \\"Civilized\\" world believe they are happy because they want for nothing. All needs are met and all pleasures are provided to them, including mood altering drugs and constant casual sex (everyone belongs to everyone), while marriage and religion are dirty words. They live in a class system that is programed (brainwashed) into them from conception, of which by the way, happens in a lab, no mommies and daddies. But are they honestly happy? Can they be? These people lack any true individualism, connection, passion or actual choice; so really they are a society of glorified meat robots. Then there are the Savages that live in small tribe like communities outside Civilization. These are a Native American-like people with a mesh of religions, cultures and a traditional moral standard. At about the halfway point in the book, the two societies cross paths... and the reader may now commence comparisons. So who's better?...Really they're both a mess.All that, being what it is... a utopia with a definite philosophy (agenda) on how society would best be run, fine I'll except all that, the concept itself holds some interest, but for me it was the execution of BRAVE NEW WORLD that bombed. The story felt...disheveled and scattered and most importantly I felt no connection at all to any of the characters. Really I couldn't care less what happened to any of them.

These books (BNW, 1984, Darkness at Noon, etc.) were instrumental in creating my persistent world view, quite incompatible with the official communist propaganda during those years. So, I wound up here in 1968 and had a wonderful life ever since.At my old age I decided to return to the Huxley's book - I remembered only a few things, the caste system, the strange combination of words 'orgy porgy' and a few details.I am very satisfied I read the book again. I vaguely remember that more than half century ago I most likely skipped the 'philosophical' discussions between Savage and the Controller. They are still very much relevant today - we are surely more close to the 'brave new world' now than decades ago. 1984 was a more proper image of those years and some events of the fifties were vitually described in Koestler's Darkness at Noon.Now we are back to many issues of the consumer society satirized by Huxley by his extrapolations. We do not have the universal 'soma' but a plethora of illicit or 'prescription' drugs that keep many people in an altered state of apparent happiness.The thirties of the last century - before Hitler's and Stalin's murderous power grabs - are bit closer to the first decade of 21st century than we may be aware of.The only issue that is a sheer fantasy in the book is its complete determinism based on environment. Somehow, the society manages to completely (OK, with a few exceptions) determine human lives regardless of genetics, just by manipulating the vats used for gestation. This betrays a certain ideology I consider extremely unrealistic: we surely depend on the conditioning before and after our birth but our genes are as important as the environment. Heredity is mentioned in the book in passing but the whole caste system - extreme to the point of sheer fantasy - has nothing to do with it.Interesting for an English author who grew up in a society based very much on hereditary privileges. He may have been a prototype for his Mr. Savage - rejecting his society 'values' completely."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Pretty grim vision of a future where everybody is happy and sedated and zombie-like.

In forecasting this \\"Brave New World,\\" Mr. Huxley however made one judgment error, that of time. Whereas genetically engineered \\"Bokanovsky Groups,\\" conditioning centers, artificial food, feelies, Soma, electromagnetic golf and Riemann surface tennis, World Controllers, savage reservations, and the fanatical maintenance of physical youth into old age are the rage in the world of 632 A.F., today we already have Dolly and the know-how to clone other mammals; the all-pervasive and hyper-influential media; artificial food and vanity-induced body part upgrades; virtual reality; Prozac and Viagra; a plethora of far-too-realistic computer games filling our living rooms, arcades and exponentially growing centers of \\"joy\\" such as Las Vegas; ridiculously greedy and corrupt CEOs of unprecedently powerful global corporations; incredibly poor city ghettos and rural areas; and of course the recent craze for the face-freezing and wrinkle eliminating fountain-of-youth serum Botox. Do we really need another five centuries to finish the last 10 % of our journey from Huxley's world of 1932 to the future of his novel?Mr. Huxley takes the reader for an unforgettable tour of the Brave New World, gradually showing us that even in an environment where genetically, biochemically and psychologically induced happiness is the sole societal goal, misery still persists and destroys. In his typically brilliant fashion, the author contrasts the psyches of four outcasts from the \\"utopia,\\" each of whom is alienated from the \\"perfect\\" society to a vastly varying degree and for a very different reason. The interactions amongst these four outcasts and between them and their Soma-Bokanovskied la-la land society forms the core of perhaps the most important and relevant novel written in the 20th century. No, it is not the best written novel of the last century (although perhaps the wittiest), but it is the one that all of us should read and re-read - I just finished my third reading -- until its central message really sinks in: we must each do everything we can to avoid the \\"welfare-tyranny of Utopia\\" that most certainly awaits us otherwise, if it isn't already here.Oh Ford!"},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Maybe I was not in right frame of mind when I read the novel, or I should not have read Orwell's 1984 so soon before, but I found Huxley's novel too tedious, complex, subtle and unengaging.

Its technological jargon is perplexing, and so on.

Where everyone is related to everyone else and there is no violence, hatred, lethal diseases except a few which haven't been able to be destroyed yet. Everyone in society is organized into a caste system, Alphas, Betas, Deltas, Gammas and Epislons. Alphas are the higer class working at the best and highest paying jobs. While, the Epislons are the lowest class and they work jobs like janitors, garbage men etc. Each caste also wears a specific color that is associated with them. I believe Alphas and Betas wore gray and Deltas and Epislons wore khaki colored clothes. The book focuses on the combined stories of four characters. Bernard Shaw, the hero of the story who does not belive what this world is doing and he demands to change it. Henry Foster, the sterotypical corporate worker who does everything he is told no matter what. Lenina Crowe who is the whore of the work place she has slept with about every guy and she one day takes an interest in Bernard. John, the outcast, the savage who is brought into their world by Bernard and Lenina when they visit his reservation. Huxley parallels the savages to our own society and he shows how greatly science can affect things. In one part, Lenina sees old people and she blushes at the sight because its not a part of their world. Because everybody is engineered and the nutrients in their body are replaced every few months and their metabolism is stimulated so they are always in good health and will never grow old. Or when Lenina sees trash laying about, dead bodys etc. In her world everyhing is kept sparkling clean not a trace of liter anywhere. Everything is kept in perfect order so the people in her world will never have to worry about anything. IF they want something all they have to do is push a button and it will be give to them. The American Dream! This book is chock full of information and satire of our society. In one chapter of the book, the whole chapter consists of snippets of dialogue and its very hard to follow whats going and who is saying what. Also, in the beginning of the book when the director is describing how decanting works, and how the embryos are cared for. It gets very overwhelming and you will find yourself lost if you dont take it slow and easy. In order to understand it you must focus on what you read at all times otherwise you will find yourself lost. Do not read it in public places if you do you will be totally lost! I would recommend this book for anyone who like science or books that poke fun at our society. I personally love these kinds of books but if you don't like lots of science information tossed at you at once then this book is not for you."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"With the advent of cloning, the Human Genome Project, and people working at making &quot;designer babies&quot; this book is (unfortunately) very relavant today. And even if science does not allow us to do quite what Huxley suggests, there is more to what he is saying.It is useful to consider the two types of dytopias that Huxley and George Orwell predicts. The latter is one of totalitarianism, like a Soviet state, or a dictatorship. Huxley predicts a society where everyone is lulled into believing they are ahppy, that they do not realize that they are being manipulated, directed, guided and herded like sheep. All the while they are happy, accepting it.Many argue that technology like television, the Internet, and many others are doing this today. WE live under a subtle form of totalitarianism than Orwell predicted in 1984. This is worth thinking about, reflecting on as we read this timeless book."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"I had to read this book for school, usually I hate the books I have to read for school, but in the case of Brave New World I was very pleasently surprised. Brave New World is an awesome book that was written about 70 years ago, but is still set in the very distant future and still has an effective message today. This book is set in a utopian future where the entire planet is one nation and almsot everyone is happy. The people are kept happy by having a view of sex as something commonplace and with many people; they are also kept happy by a halucionogenic drug that everyone takes called soma. The book portrays that author's views on almost every aspect of society (religion, sex, science, ect.) and is the sort of book that can have many different interpretations. Brave New World is the kind of book that once you read the first chapter you want to keep reading just to see what happens next. So far, this is one of my favorite books, and I would definately recommend it to almost everyone."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"The characters are irritating and one-dimensional. The too frequent shifting points of view are unnecessary and confusing. Aside from the occasional glimmers of dry wit (not including the \\"Our Ford\\" joke which tires out quickly), the writing is for the most part flat. Even the orgy scenes manage to be dull. The latter half of the novel is simply a rant of Huxley's personal beliefs, all of which have been stated elsewhere and more eloquently. There are no real deep societal insights. In short, extremely overrated."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"In Aldous Huxley's Brave New World, the creation of a perfect society many years into the future consists of no sadness, no marriage, sexual freedom, pre-determined social castes, and access to \\"soma\\" for psychologically envisioned vacations. All of the members of society are constructed in a laboratory and are led by World Controllers, under the great Ford. There is no religion, there is no love, there are no ideas-- these are dangerous for a utopian world. In order for all people to be content, happy citizens, they must be controlled. They must be all the same. Bernard Marx is different. His differences from the others make him search for something more in his life. When he takes a trip to New Mexico to observe the \\"savages\\" (who get married, have children, etc.) he encounters two people that end up returning to the civilized life with him. One of the savages, John, ends up despising the way of life that Bernard and others live, and struggles to fight against what he believes is insanity.Huxley's invented society is curious, but not at all impressive. There were not significant details or striking differences from normal society, although due to the time the book was written, the ideas that were provided do deserve credit. It was also very difficult to like any of the characters. The reader was not able to get close with any of them, let alone Bernard or John, who were the significant to the outcome of the story. Neither character exemplified a lot of heart or personality, and when the story was over, the reader did not really feel for either of them.The reading level of the book is not as hard as one might expect, and if you are looking for a challenge, don't look here. This is a quick and easy read that does not require much thought. For all you 1984 fans like myself, this book is not a comparison. It probably could best be described as a third grade version of 1984, with less interesting ideas and less complicated conflicts. It was a decent story and I am glad that I have read it, but I don't really know how this book received as much recognition as it did. It's kind of like one of those \\"ehh\\" books that you read and sort of forget about. If someone asked you about it, you'd probably think for a couple seconds, \\"Brave New...what?\\""},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"This book is heavy on ideas, light on plot.Those looking for an engaging story and characters they can identify with had best look elsewhere.

Though this is a noble purpose, it's not really good for much else.Sorry, Aldous Huxley lovers. I'm sticking with Orwell."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"A fictional but eye opening look at the dangers of capitalism and where we may be headed."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"First I'd like to say is that this book is well ahead of its time in terms of ideas and messages. When I discovered it had been written in the late '30s (I was halfway through the book at that point) I couldn't believe it. It reads like it could've been written in this decade, and the technology described in the book is practically attainable already. Huxley's ideas are good: that if social and technological trends continue, we could end up in a world with no individualism and no love.However, I have problems with the book as a work of literature. The prose style isn't that good (although I've been reading a lot of Joyce lately... I wonder if that hurts?), the characters mostly just annoy me, and to top it off, the book's message is presented in a completely unsubtle fashion. When John finally kills himself, I wondered why? Was his death supposed to finally convince us, if the previous 260 pages hadn't already done so, that the future Huxley describes isn't worth living in? I was pretty well convinced after about 50 pages. Or was John supposed to be some kind of martyr? If so, he failed, since the people in the future are obviously happy and it had been established in his conversation with Mond that they couldn't be changed. Which brings me to the characters. In a work like this or 1984, I need to have someone who's outside &quot;the system&quot; (socially) that I can identify with. In 1984 I can identify with Winston for most of the story. In Brave New World, I couldn't identify with anyone. Just when I thought I could identify with Bernard (intellectual who gets no chicks :) he either turns into a sniveling whiny loser or rejects all his ideas so he can sleep with more girls. Helmholtz didn't appear enough to be able to identify with him, and his laughing at the mother and father concept bugged me. And John, who seems to be the one I was meant to identify with--how can I identify with a completely uneducated savage who alternately quotes Shakespeare and beats himself? Ultimately it just didn't work for me on the level of 1984, to which I (perhaps unfairly) compare it in my mind."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"This book can be related to the society in whole. Most books can do this. Some things bother me about the book. I was mostly confused what his point was while I was reading the book.I really did not care for it. NBC"},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Brave New WorldAldous Huxley takes us on an adventure into the future to witness society's possible outcome in his famous science fiction novel, Brave New World. Written in 1932, Huxley presents society a century or two ahead of time, predicting the capabilities of mankind with the consistently rapid development of technology. Huxley grasps imaginative readers and provides them with opportunities to expand their horizons in predicting the future.Taking place in London, society is set up in a Utopian form of government where everyone is treated the same. In the novel, feelings such a love, sadness, and gladness are not accepted; instead, people take a drug called \\"soma\\" to stop their mixed feelings and make them forget about their problems. Babies are no longer born to their mother and father; instead, they are born in predestined nurseries, and there are five different types of people: the Alphas and Betas and the Gammas, Deltas, and Epsilons. In a communist type government, each type of person is conditioned and trained to know their purpose and job in life at a young age by using repetition of words on the infants. I found this method used by Huxley fascinating as it closely relates to many experiments used by the famous Sigmund Freud such as the salivating dog. Every time he rang a bell in front of the dog, he would give the dog a treat and the dog would then salivate. Eventually, the ringing of the bell alone would cause the dog to salivate, even if there was no treat; this is impressively the type of conditioning that Huxley uses on the people-they are experimented on by the use of repetition physically and verbally.The structure of the story is in third person and is shown by many different characters from the book as many characters play crucial roles in the famous novel. Bernard in the story symbolizes the famous communist leader Karl Marx as he strives in the story to keep everyone equal no matter the circumstances. \\"Ford\\", the higher spirit that everyone worships, represents Henry Ford where the people are treated in an assembly line fashion. The lusting Lenina is a sex symbol that represents the image of people avoiding their problems with sex and drugs; no one faces their problems, they all turned away, especially Lenina. Lenina is an object to men, the woman that every man wants to sleep with. Main character, John, also known as the \`Savage', is an important factor in the novel as he's from the normal civilization that we basically had in the past with the Native Americans. John is taken into the \`New World' and attempts to express to the people the meaning of emotions and different feelings, but everyone is extremely confused by his way of life and are more entertained than convinced. Another important character in the story is a man by the name of Mustopha, one of the ten world controllers. He displays himself as a full believer to the communist ways, but deep down he wishes the structure of society were different as he hides religious literature in his office such as Bibles and scriptures. Mustopha tries to tell himself and the Savage that the new way is better, \\" [...] And if ever, by some unlucky chance, anything unpleasant should somehow happen, why, there's always soma to give you a holiday from the facts. And there's always soma to calm your anger, to reconcile you to your enemies, to make you patient and long-suffering. In the past you could only accomplish these things by making a great effort and after years of hard moral training. Now, you swallow two or three half-gramme tablets, and there you are. Anybody can be virtuous now. You can carry at least half your mortality about in a bottle. Christianity without tears-that's what soma is.\\"Huxley may shock readers with his incredible predictions of the future society as he proves to be on the right path. In fact, Huxley is so accurate that readers criticized his work when Brave New World first came out, claiming that his work was way out there and far too sexual; but taking a look at the casual sex in our generation today, Huxley's on the right track. In Brave New World, the Savage attempts to help convince the people of London that their ways are unhealthy and that they need God to reflect on their lives, \\"If you allowed yourselves to think of God, you wouldn't allow yourselves to be degraded by pleasant vices. You'd have a reason for bearing things patiently, for doing things with courage.\\""},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"I've been reading a book called Brave New World... the girl at the counter asked me if i was reading it for class or pleasure.

I try to read both at least once every couple of years. An Amazon customer review for 1984 recommended Brave New World as a book that might appeal to fans of George Orwell, so I bought a copy and read it. It was somewhat of a disappointment.The Afterword in my copy of Brave New World mentions that one contemporary critic in 1932 when the book was first published considered it Huxley's idea of a \\"thin little joke\\" stretched into a novel. After reading the book myself I'm inclined to agree with that. Where 1984 is filled with intrigue and rings a profound warning about the oppressive nature of totalitarianism, (and how very appropriate that was in 1948), Brave New World is simply a thin little fantasy about a future society where human reproduction is clinically reproduced, and human individuality, religion and families have been banned for the sake of peace, happiness, free love and free recreational drugs. An interesting idea perhaps in the hands of a better writer, but Huxley doesn't do much with it. His characters are neither interesting nor humorous and the narrative is much too thin, saved only by a few segments of crisp dialog in the second half of the book.The conflict is between the primitive John Savage and modern London society, to where Savage is taken from a New Mexico Indian reservation that is still steeped in ancient tradition. \\"The Savage\\" as he is called behaves very oddly, rejecting the philosophy of the Brave New World. The idea here, I surmise, is that life is a struggle and it is that very struggle that makes it worth living. This is the underlying message in Huxley's book, and one cannot argue that there is a lot of truth in it. But where Orwell was warning about the clear and present danger of Communism, I'm not sure to whom Huxley was addressing his warning, nor what it was they were supposed to be warned about, especially in the year 1932.1984 will long remain a classic in the canon of political literature but Brave New World is not in the same league.

However, I would certainly not recommend it to most, as it lacksan interesting plot, and tends to get awfully confusing at times. Nothing in this novel compels thereader to finish the book. The language used is very awkward, and often requires the reader tore-read passages in order to understand the slang that Huxley has created for this novel of his.

It deals with a dystopian world set in London in 2540. It depicts a human population that is genetically manipulated and reared entirely in test tubes, then brainwashed to be totally subservient to the caste to which they are designated. Considering this book was written at a time when the world was in the depth of an economic depression it is no surprise that it depicts a world dominated by the industrial complex, devoid of free will, totally subservient to a form of government that is both socialist and capitalist. As with any science fiction novel read several decades after it was written, the reality of technological progress may have surpassed the vision of the author or not yet matched it. The structure of DNA was not revealed until 1953, though it was certainly understood well before then that certain traits were heritable and the field of genetics has undergone a veritable revolution since then. So, it is no surprise that Huxley's description of genetic engineering lacks a lot of the specifics we now take for granted, making the book seem somewhat dated. If the plot were more engaging or the character development were stronger, than the novel would still stand the test of time, but it seems to come up a bit short in both of those areas. Compared to two other very good dystopian novels written after Huxley's, Orwell's 1984 (published in 1949 and focused on a society devoid of human rights) and Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 (published in 1953 and centered on a hedonistic, anti-intellectual society where most books are banned) it is clear where Brave New World falls short. Both 1984 and Fahrenheit 451 depend more on their character development and the timeless themes of human struggle with society and personal relationships."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Aldous Huxley was born in England in 1894 and saw his first novel - \\"Crome Yellow\\" published in 1921.

The 'civilised world' has become a radically different place - although everyone is, technically, happy it's cost a certain amount of 'free will'. The family unit no longer exists, with children now being created in a laboratory. Since the overwhelming majority of women are 'created' sterile, the entire population's physical and intellectual development can be carefully controlled from conception. This level of control ensure that - with only very few exceptions - people are happy fulfilling their pre-determined role in society. (Members of the 'Epsilon Minus' class are bred for menial labour, while - at the other end of the scale - members of the 'Alpha Plus' class are bred for their intelligence). Promiscuous sex and recreational drug use is encouraged, and only a deviant would consider abstaining from either. Similarly, spending time alone is considered abnormal, while monogamy is practically a perversion. One of the book's key characters is Bernard Marx - an Alpha-Plus, who has some rather dubious tendencies. He's planning on taking a rather unusual trip to a \\"Savage Reservation\\" : in these places, the primitives who live there have children and raise families in the time honoured fashion. They also grow old and don't consider cleanliness to be \\"next to fordliness\\".I've slightly mixed feelings about \\"Brave New World\\". I was a little disappointed - though, with the constant comparisons to \\"1984\\", I think my expectations of it were maybe a little off. The elements of the book dealing with indoctrination, conditioning and bio-engineering are certainly relevant to today's world - however, the book just didn't make the impact it could have. Part of the problem, for me, was that the book's focus shifted so often from one character to another - next to Winston Smith, the characters that appeared here were a little flimsy. Similarly, I didn't find Huxley's Brave New World quite inspiring the same depth of feeling as Orwell's Oceania. Nevertheless, it's certainly worth reading, and I can see why it's so highly thought of."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"This book has been held up as a comparable to Orwell's 1984. It's not. Huxley is just trying to write about a lot of sexual intercourse and still get published in a previous era. There in no serious discussion of the societal woes that are the subject of the book until the final short chapter."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"This is overrated the book is boring as hell. I wouldn't recommend it to someone unless they were forced to read for a class."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Huxley's Brave New World was a clear pioneer of early dystopian novels. The book is a frequent pop-culture reference, and is still a must-read for that reason. But, it's questionable whether this will stand the test of time.The novel revolves around a hyper-sexualized people that focus on pleasure and happiness - at the cost of reality. The basic premise is novel and exciting, but is aging. Newer dystopian novels and films (i.e.,The Children of Men) seem to have a grit and closeness to reality that Huxley's book never delivers.As most dystopias aim to warn the ills of centralization, this follows suit. Unfortunately, the history and possibility for the development seems underdeveloped and unexplored."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"always keep in mind that it was written in the late 30s. The story, as well as the details, sound really actual."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"This is a tough read if your head's not in the right place, but a good book. I'll read it again someday."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"This novel was simply hilarious. I loved the concept of 'pneumatic,\\" referring to not just the characters in the book, with their inflatable breast implants, but the blow up doll world of the future, a time that has already come and continues to haunt us in new and different (exciting?) ways.I read Brave New World so long ago I'll have to read it again. I just remember that it is a book in which the government has total control of society, and \\"him who don't fit through the needle's eye,\\" as Gil Scott Heron would later sing, is doomed to suffer in this \\"Brave New World.\\" Hence, total obedience and not much in the way of the government as it continues to grind its hobnailed boot into your pathetic neck. Government controls the masses through propaganda, drugs and domination of all media.Interesting thing about Huxley. Before he hit it big with Island, Brave New World and other works, he wrote Italian romance novels, whatever an Italian romance novel is. That, at least, is what according to a city bus traveller I met in Austin, Texas. Soft porn? Dunno. Also, he never became a US citizen, even though he was offered citizenship while living in the USA. Reason? He refused to say that he would be willing to kill someone in defense (Huxley would have written \\"defence\\") of his country (in this case USA).If you like stories about Big Brother and the future and a time when all uncertainty has been taken away and all you have to do is to wake up and become a zombie for yet another day and follow that little voice in your ear or your head, then this is for you, written by a man on the same intellctual plane as Arthur C. Clarke, George Orwell, Anthony Burgess, Joseph Heller and Kurt Vonnegut, just to name a few.Five Stars.

Something for me to check into..."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Generations of adolescent boys have sneaked this novel past their elders' censorship to read about the sex and the drugs. Aldous Huxley didn't intend for people to interpret his novel as advocacy for hedonism, but many of us have, myself included in high school.Coming at it as a mature man, I notice that Huxley assumes a high degree of cultural literacy, especially based on what intellectuals thought about \\"modern times\\" in the first three decades of the 20th Century. A thorough understanding of the novel would require considerable background reading in sources which have become obscure now. How many people have lately readThe Scientific Outlookby Bertrand Russell, for example? Huxley apparently had, along with the now unreadable utopias by H.G. Wells. And who reads T.S. Eliot's poems these days to understand what Huxley meant by calling sexually attractive women \\"pneumatic\\"?Huxley's portrayal of Lenina Crowne, at first glance a vacuous and shallow woman in this futurist utopia, seems to have become even more relevant now than when he imagined her based on the young American women he saw in Hollywood circa 1930. Lenina's conversation with her friend Fanny in the dressing room after work could almost come from a contemporary chick movie. It wouldn't require a stretch to imagine that Lenina carries a smart phone on her fashionable Malthusian belt, has Twitter & Facebook accounts, and goes to feelies based on the plot of the Twilight novels.Huxley doesn't seem to know what to do with Lenina's character, however, because she shows some potentials for growth which Huxley doesn't explore. She belongs to the Alpha or Beta caste,, for example, yet she likes wearing green garments, even though her conditioning should have made her averse to that color because the proletarian Gamma caste wears green as its identifier. And towards the end of the novel Huxley indicates that Lenina has started to appreciate the Savage's point of view about love and sex. Her brief relationship with Bernard Marx had primed her to head in that direction, given that he wanted to talk to her and get to know her as a person before bedding her, when she considered that strange behavior.Despite the novel's flaws and loose ends, it has aged remarkably well and still rewards reading as an anticipation of the more obnoxious aspects of life in the 21st Century."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"I'm sure you know that this book is worth reading so I'll skip that part and just tell you what this version has that is different from other versions. The end of this book has a few interesting bits to read.Reviews from 1932: There are some responses to the to the book at the time it was released, they are all negative. Its pretty amusing that people really hated this book at the time it was released, partly for the writing and because of the openly sexual lifestyles the characters lead.A short biography: Well not so interesting.and...A letter to George Orwell: This letter was written the year of the release of 1984 (1949).

The only thing that I did not like was the ending of the book. Although it was symbolic, it left you hanging and wondering what would happen next. The interesting thing about this book was that, Huxley wrote it so long ago that he could not have possiably know what was going to happen in the future. The funny thing is that the book is starting to come true in some ways. Recentley, scientist have made advances in the study of cloning and been successful in recreating animals.

It refers to the reality of human beings and to the reflections about it. A good advice for those who want to start it is to read The Republic by Plato before it, and to be surprised, after finishing it, by the large number of points they have in common, and that &quot;Brave New World&quot; is not just a Science Fiction Novel (poor is the man who is blind to his own senses). The sacredness of &quot;Brave New World&quot; is to show humanity that all the solutions and salvations we are looking for in technology are completely useless if we can't distinguish between our problems and our blessings."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Sex and no love, babies and no sex, prozac and no emotions. Human cloning is the only missing ingredient to the fulfillment of Huxley's stunning prophecy - and even that's just up the road a stretch. Frighteningly accurate. Downright eery considering it was written in 1932. This was the first book that made me realize anything is possible in the pages of a book. It went on to prove that man truly is limited only by imagination - and even Huxley's wildest imagination may be surpassed by reality long before even one century has elapsed.

Not only does Huxley describe the drug problem present in our own society(soma), but he also talks about test tube babies,fertility treatments,genetic tampering et al. It\`s almost as if the author built a time machine and went to our present.Forget what they say about Brave New World being a vision of the future. It is really a vision of our present.Having said that, I also consider Huxley\`s caste system to be the next development in our society."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"First of all I'm not really into Sci-Fi or any things from that sort I would much rather spend time reading about ordinary people with ordinary lives and ordinary problems (like what people suffer from in our world today) I think its much more interesting than reading a book with the Star Wars Robot/alien themes, They just sound so incredibly unbelievable and immature to me. However this Book is not your typical Sci Fi nonsense books that are only written for the purpose of entertainment alone, what makes this book different is that the author had a moral lesson behind it, which makes it a rather interesting read. This Book was assigned for my English class and I had to read it as analyze the characters and the themes of the book which made it easier for me to understand. I feel that having English as my second language & the fact that this book has been written in the early 20th Century made it for me and for modern readers who don't speak English as their first language hard to understand and follow with the story. The writing style is the only issue I've found in this book that made it painful and frustrating for me to go through it, otherwise I think it would've been a more enjoyable read. The Book has a really good plot line though.The setting is in the future, people are living in what seems to be a Utopia (flawless community) at least from their POVs. People are kept under control by upper powers who uses sex and religion as ways to control people & keep them from getting a rebellion or knowing too much. People are divided into stages (classes) with certain names, duties and each stage has a certain intelligence and held a certain job (nether to say each person is programmed to do certain things according to his stage). People are almost turned into robots (they are brain washed to believe that books are poisonous & so is flowers and its ok for them to sleep with as many people as they want etc.. So to say the moral standards of their lives is different than us but most importantly people are MADE in factories instead of being BORN they are even taught that mentioning the words mother and father are just like saying the F bomb, people have NO families and makes NO families since its believed to be incredibly bad & shameful to have a family, after the death of someone he/she is just thrown away just like throwing an old vacuum who've been worn out by many years of use & no one feels sorry for the loss of it because it can always be replaced. Love or rather feelings is not something the people of this world posses, since they are brought up to be quite promiscuous they don't know the meaning of commitment or loyalty to one person.However everything falls out of place when one of the lower classes gets pregnant and gives birth to a son (John)who is fathered by one of the upper world controllers who left her on a savage island while they were on a vacation because he thought she was dead. Away from the perfect world John is brought up in the island of the savages, he sees his mother sleep with as many men as she can and that cause the people of the village to whip her as well as call her a slut because of her misdeeds, unlike the other people in the Perfect world he doesn't belong to any category (class) therefore his brain isn't programmed like the others he have emotions just like a normal human being and he also learns to read, he reads books by Shakespeare that talks about Love, war and Loyalty & dreams that one day he will find the love of his life. However one day as two people from the perfect world are vacationing on the islands they discover him and his mom and they bring them along as they return to their Utopia. This much doesn't surprise his mother since she grew up there but for John its amazingly shocking to know how different the life in the Perfect world is than the life he has had while living with the savages. The Book talks about how he feels he doesn't fit in & eventually the shocking end ( I personally didn't see it coming)"},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"i love the whole book. I love that Christopher Hitchens introduces the book and that it has the revisited edition in the back. Its everything a reader would want for a classic like this."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Huxley's Brave New World, hardly needs a rave review as it has already received many and further has been recognized as a literary and cultural icon of the 20th century. In addition to it's being recognized on many lists as one of the top influential novels of it time, it also has the distinction of being one of the more challenged books by those who believe that banning challenging works is a positive behavior.Huxley comes from a distinguished family that is no stranger to controversy. The book itself clearly takes on controversial issues such as religion, sexuality and projects through the vehicle of science fiction and futurism a world that could be the logical result of trends that Huxley observed in his day and age. Ironically, those who react so strongly to those elements that Huxley portrays probably miss that rather than being a proponent, as they appear to presume, Huxley may in fact be sounding the alarm and attempting to illustrate the need for change.For having been written in the early 1930's, Huxley's work remains remarkably contemporay and readible today. Issues such as technology and hedonism have hardly diminished in terms of their impact in western society.Having read this book in the Kindle format, I would be remiss to mention that the book reads well in this medium and that any well read person would do well to add this to their library not only for the skillful manner in which Huxley brings tough issues to the fore, but also to grasp the manner in which this book has indeed shaped many of the moral and ethical discussions of today with issues such as stem cell development, abortion and cyber development.I read this book because I felt by not reading it to this point, I was neglecting an important work that I've heard referred to in many different contexts. Having read it, I can confirm its value and power and recommend it as needful reading whether the reader is completely in agreement with the underlying message the book conveys or not.5 stars for content and the Kindle medium.Bart Breen"},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"It's no exaggeration to say that \\"Brave New World\\" is one of the most significant books of the twentieth century. Its social criticism is keen, its prophecies are shockingly accurate, and its theme of restless humanity struggling under the bonds of oppression is a timeless one. Other reviews will tell you much the same: this book deserves to be read by everyone living under Western civilization, and reread several times.I say all this, however, with one major reservation - the story is lousy. To elaborate: The first half of the book follows Bernard Marx, one of civilization's discontents, an outsider who smells something rotten at the core of this eugenic utopia. Halfway through the book he befriends John, a \\"noble savage\\" from a nature reservation who grew up without any modern technology. Bernard decides, as a sort of anthropological experiment, to bring his \\"savage\\" friend back to civilized London. But once he becomes keeper of the hottest attraction in town, Bernard's newfound popularity goes to his head, turning him into a shallow, contemptible jackass. The story abandons him to follow John the Savage, who takes to this Brave New World as a cat takes to water. He detests it, its lack of emotion and humanity, and boils with such moral indignation that he's finally driven to, shall we say, desperate measures. But I'll say no more: no plot spoilers here.Huxley begins with a fascinating premise, but its execution is flawed. This reader, for one, didn't know where to lay his sympathies: Huxley discards Bernard once he has the Savage to play with, and soon even the Savage becomes into a mere receptacle for Huxley's own moral outrage. Other characters begin to show the glimmer of redeeming qualities, but nothing ever comes of them. A didactic tone prevails throughout the novel, and the most important confrontations read more like philosophical dissertations than dramatic scenes. It's obvious early on that Huxley is more preoccupied with his ideas than his characters, and his fiction suffers for it.But these shortcomings are purely aesthetic (and to Huxley's credit, he confesses to them early in the Preface). Huxley may not have been a brilliant storyteller, but he was a brilliant man of ideas. That's why I cannot recommend highly enough the companion volume to this work, \\"Brave New World Revisited,\\" a series of essays Huxley wrote in 1958 to expand upon the social forces at work in the novel, particularly brainwashing and propaganda. (There's a paperback edition available on Amazon that contains both works.) Huxley is at his very best when he's writing nonfiction; he encapsulates whatever idea he's examining, anticipates the reader's questions and objections at every turn, and carefully lays out the implications of the idea. And these essays are especially remarkable, not only because the phenomena they describe are sublimely monstrous, but because these phenomena have, in great measure, come to be.More so even than George Orwell's nightmare society, the bleak, inhuman future of Huxley's \\"Brave New World\\" seems to resemble our own world more with each new decade. That's why it's important to read and reread this book. Huxley has stood the test of time, if not as storyteller then as social prophet. His world is as original, terrifying, and prescient as it was when he conceived it."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"I had heard several rave reviews of this book, read it was on the banned list for a while and saw it listed on preparatory reading lists for college bound students. When I first started reading it, I could not understand why schools assign it to high students. As I got into the book, I realized it has several social lessons to be taught. I think the most important is the idea of a perfect society. Greek philosophers started the idea and it remains somewhat popular today. Conservatives will balk at the sexual openness, references to soma and the genetic manipulations discussed in the book, but the best lesson is shown through the character development of the main characters and the ultimate fate of John.Huxley shows that a perfect society is like communism, good in theory, but not applicable in today's society due to one main factor: individualism. Humans thrive on their \`uniqueness' and Huxley's new world eliminates it much the way Marx and Engles discarded it in the Communist Manifesto.After finishing Brave New World, I can see why schools assign the book. It is well written and educational for students and adults alike."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"This is a great book to challenge the belief that there should be no pain, aging, sickness, etc. in our life.The government believes that by controlling everything in the environment, and by creating classes of people based on chemical tampering and subliminal programming during the incubation process (as babies are developing in the lab), people can be made to have a \\"happy\\" and productive life. The problem is that emotion, spirituality, liberty, and questioning is not allowed to disturb the tranquility of this existence.The Savage from a reservation outside of this environment is brought into the story about a third of the way into it to question this type of life.I think the story dragged a little bit, which is why I gave it four, instead of five, stars."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Huxley takes science fiction and satire to a new level with his novel, Brave New World. Brave New World provides an anti-utopian perspective taken place in the future in which technology, totalitarianism, and control rule. The story begins in a factory in which embryos are being genetically made. In this scene the Director show how people are conditioned and placed into classes and also forced to be subjected to meaningless sex. Unfortunate for them!!!!!. As the book continues Bernard Marx, Carl Marx, is later introduced as an unfit member of his social caste and till John is introduced he is our main character. He is later joined with Helmholtz, who is his best friend. Both have distinct discontent of the World State. Bernard's character begins to unfold in his love stricken attitude towards Lenina, which offers a sense of disfunctionality in a society in which love is not to be shown and we finally get a sense of emotion. While his love and lust for Lenina continues her character begins to spread as they travel to the savage world, New Mexico. In the Savage World they meet John, the main character. John reveals an incriminating secrete that forces the Director to resign. Furthermore, john leaves the wild to come to civilization with Bernard and Lenina. John begins to fall for Lenina and displays true affection towards her, but she only wants to have sex with him. In his stay in the city he becomes a show and tell by Bernard. Bernard becomes very famous and popular through his relationship with John. John and Bernard fall out and feud. While in civilization he has many altercations with angry mobs over soma, a drug that everyone takes when feeling depressed or overwhelmed. Unable to handle all the horrid actions of a World State, John runs away to a secluded island. He begins to reconcile with his actions in the world until citizens finally recognize him and force him to recount his stay in the World State. Overcome with disgust he commits suicide. Thorugh all the accounts of the main characters, Huxley proves that totalitarianism is an unsuccessful form of government by using satire, technology, and drugs."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"This novel is a biting critique of the over-scientification of the emerging modern world, and in particular a scathing critique of early movements towards behavioral conditioning, as well as towards psychoanalysis, mass production, the use of drugs to affect and modify behavior, as well as mass consumerism, all of which had begun to appear around the turn of the 20th Century.Huxley creates an imaginary \\"overly controlled,\\" \\"overly conditioned\\" and \\"overly bureaucratized\\" utopia, one that was supposed to produce world stability and unattainable and unimaginable individual happiness under a regime of benign tyranny. However, when judged by the results and effects on its inhabitants, the utopia turns out to be just the opposite: an avowed dystopia.Mustapha Mond, one of the characters and a member of the ruling elite had decided that all of art must be sacrificed in order to increase the overall happiness of the society. But in a discussion with an inhabitant who existed on the margins of the managed state, he was surprised to learn that the individual, the character, John Savage, disagreed with him and made the radical claim that in order to be free, and even to maximize happiness, people must be allowed the right to be unhappy as well to be happy.From before birth until they were in the grave, the lives of the inhabitants of Huxley's imaginary London were conditioned so that every aspect of their lives were carefully managed by strict rules and by state administered drugs to create the kind of behavior that best suited the needs of those ruling the state. Even fetuses were treated chemically to produce the kind of intelligence that the ruling bureaucrats had decided were in the best interests of the kind of societal stratifications and chosen roles within society that the ruling elites had decided were necessary.American satire rarely gets better than this and not since George Orwell's Animal Farm and his equally effective, 1984, has a single piece of political fiction sounded as many cautionary alarm bells as this cautionary tale. It has proven amazingly durable and prescient in retrospect.Five Stars."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"We are treated to a glimpse of a possible future world where friendship can still exist.

Naturally the author Aldous Huxley builds his own scenarios and draws his own conclusions through the characters speeches and description of experimental history.Bernard Marx who is about to lose his job because he is different (vary different) form those around him, decides to take a vacation to visit the Zuni's. There he meets a misplaced person named John. Together with the help of Bernard's friend Henry they intend to change the world. So they find out the world is incapable of changing.We get an Ayn Rand type speech from Mustapha Mond one of the world controllers' that helps you realize that in this brave new world the three friends are the anomaly.

Huxley came from an aristocratic English family, he hobknobbed with the intellectual elite, his Brother Julian was the first director of the new world order creation UNESCO. Make no mistake about it Huxley was in the know with what the world elites had planned in store for the masses because he rubbed elbows with them.So much of this stuff, while not quite the extreme thats in the book, has come to pass. Test tube babies being grown in labratories, intentional dumbing of the masses, destroying the family unit, sexualizing children, making having multiple sexual partners socially acceptable, taking drugs to make yourself happy, creating a new religion out of mindless conformity, even the \\"10 World Controllers\\" in Brave New World are awfully similar to the ten oligarchical banking and business families (Rothschilds, Rockefellers, etc) that rule the world now.So yeah I think Huxley was letting the cat out of the bag here. The same way Orwell did, except Orwell was exposing the terror and fear side of the coin which the new world order also employs. Orwell showed how they control you with torture, terror and violence if you don't go along with the program. Huxley showed how they control you and turn you into a Pavlovian dog with Prozac, porn and various petty distractions."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"A very different look at an Orwellian nightmare, a very 1984-esque negative utopia, depsite the fact it was written some 12 years before 1984.

No respect for the dead (death conditioning), no deep relationships, in fact, there's a promotion of promiscuity. Lenina is the perfect World State citizen, and is proud of her pneumatic way of life. Hoorah for John Savage and Bernard Marx!"},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Aldous Huxley's genius is fully revealed in this wicked satire, which in addition has become an uncannily accurate look at trends in the technology and society of our own time. There are so many points in this book where you are ready to laugh and shudder at the same time. While there are many frivolous puns and jokes scattered throughout, not to mention ridiculously overblown character interactions, the message is ultimately quite serious. We are still prostrating ourselves at the feet of corporations which claim to be advancing the cause of science, being &quot;connected&quot; and &quot;happy&quot; is now more important than anything, and journalistic ethics have indeed evaporated. This novel is in some ways the best portrait of the 1990s yet written--our own contemporary writers, for the most part, are too inhibited or ignorant to say what's really going on."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Although the book has some interesting ideas in it (like bokanovskification process and conditioning) after the first few chapters it becomes a repetition of the beginning chapters. Some reviewers think it wrong, even foolish to compare it with 1984 but since they are in the same genre (they are both anti-utopias), we can make a comparison between them. And when I do that, I find Brave New World weak and shallow. When I first read 1984 a few years ago, it arrested me so much that when I finished reading in the middle of a night I felt a chill. It affected me so much. But at the end of Brave New World I said &quot;Is this the end?&quot; Also I read Huxley's &quot;Island&quot; 5 or 6 years ago and I simply hated it. I don't understand his obsession with drugs. In Island, there was &quot;Moksha medicine&quot; which the author approves and in Brave New World there is &quot;Soma&quot; which I am not sure if he approves or not. Also the book doesn't give us an insight into the whole structure of the society, it mostly dwells on matters like sex and the discouragement of individuality. But I still recommend the book as an anti-utopia.

An example of an Alfa is Bill Gates; an example of a Beta is a regular Doctor or a CEO; and example of a Gamma is a regular clerk or a teacher; an example of a Delta is a McDonalds employee; lastly, an example of an Epsilon would be an unemployed person or someone from a primitive area.Ok now the book review. I'd say that the only reason this books surpasses 1984 by George Orwell and Animal Farm by, again, George Orwell is that the story is becoming true. The book is about a despot style government ruled by the God like FORD. There is a story to it, but I believe the story is there to help you understand its government. Brave New World Revisited will help you understand the philosophy of Brave New World. This book is very interesting, but very hard to read (at least for me. I'm in the 7th grade, as of now). I recommend this book to anyone who has a anyone who has an open mind for Political books or books that mark a philosophical foreshadowing for the government"},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"1984 and Brave New World were never part of my high school curriculum, but they both intrigued me, so I read them back to back. I expected 1984 to be the more intellectually stimulating book as it is the more famous of the two, but it was Brave New Word that really blew me away. This book had me wanting a society like this-where we are bred to be happy with our social class and occupation no matter what level we are at. Just think, no more insecurities or competition! I found this book more effective than 1984 because it was a society I wanted whereas only a moron would want to live in the dreariness of 1984. Huxley made me want this society, which caused me to think even more."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"I've read this book four or five times. It makes no particular predictions for the future; rather, it savagely satirizes its era and ours--the antithesis of the banal &quot;1984&quot;. Those readers who dismiss &quot;Brave New World&quot; merely reveal the shallowness and mediocrity of their own thought and vision."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"To the twilight covered hillside, They came from every side, Those who knew not death, Had never wanted, never cried, To watch a madman dance.Society so sick, so shallow, Adults starved as children, Now watched in curiosity, With their questions of why and how, Their conditioning left to chance.Solitude unscrupulous, And socially a sin, Isolated everyone, In bottles from within, They die as they begin.Their factories turn out and out, The essentials of their lives, And as the worker bee survives, They swarm as one within the hive. And in synthetic placitude they grin.As a student in 1984 I read this book for the first time and as I finished was immediately inspired to write the poem above. I was moved by the Savage John's grief and passion for life as a free thinking and feeling individual who opted to take what everyone else felt was the hard way. To not mask pain, feelings of isolation etc. with an all encompassing &quot;happy pill&quot; called &quot;soma&quot;. The future world that is a happy dream to its residents was, unmasked, a nightmare in disguise to an unwary outsider."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"First of all, I'd like to say that I'm frustrated by people's comparisons of soma to prozac, ritalin, etc. Anti-depressants do not make one &quot;trip out&quot; at all, especially not like Huxley's soma. They are not escapes from reality. I'd compare soma to some street drugs, but never to medicine that helps Attention Deficit folks function like normal people, or to the mood stabalizers a mannic depressive person might need. I understand that people are trying to say that Huxley's vision is today, and while there are significant similarities, the world within the book is not our world. A possible future? I seriously doubt it, but that isn't an invalidation of the present-day issues this book brings attention to.That said, the story is very interesting. I've only read it once, and haven't had any intellectually stimulating discussions on issues it brings up, but the possibility of such discussions gives great value to the book. It flowed very well (except at the end of ch3) and was enjoyable.Early in the book I was drawing parallels to Orwell's &quot;1984&quot; but the similarities for the most part disappeared around ch7. Huxley's characters are much more real than Orwell's in my opinion, and I followed the plot with much more interest than I did with &quot;1984&quot;. I could connect with each character; I felt like I was inside thier minds, not because Huxley tells us so much what they're thinking, but he shows it (as in ch6 in the Lenina/Bernard incident). Each character is believable and alive, and that more than anything keeps me engaged.I liked the way the characters were introduced and how I couldn't seem to label any one of them as The Main Character. I also couldn't define a &quot;good guy&quot; and &quot;bad guy&quot; because there was no right and wrong view. Everyone was justified in thier own way. Sure there aren't families and monogomy, but no one saw anything wrong with that. The people didn't desire fundamental societal change, and those who did weren't executed or anything, they were given opportunities to live within environments compatable to thier wants and needs.So hey, it's a good read, especially after attemping Dicken's &quot;Great Expectations&quot;. =)"},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"sorry i just wrote this so that there would be 667 votes and not 666 im not very religous but i find that number to be very strange and disturbing. holla back im going to buy this book"},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"At the foremost beginning of this novel, I was presently surprised that this book was what it surely seemed to be. Even though Aldous Huxley, the author, was very in-depth with all the matters of this \\"brave new world\\", Huxley, seeming intentionally to make the affairs of these characters public. Showing that this frail society of inventors, in Freud's world of perfection, was in-fact defect and a result of a greater problem with themselves at the very heart of the situation.The characters, by design, are with out a doubt shallow, and find it hard to maintain a singular deep relationship with anyone but him or herself! Furthermore, this novel is plainly a disgust to read. If not finding it a pleasure to read, but how about for ridicule among those whom read it? To think that a society, like this one, could be thought as having any type of perfection is insane. This particular Utopian society is a jumbling mess. Perhaps the idea for this story is to place the image in our minds eye that at any given moment societal views could be skewed.Upon the reminiscing of all the information compiled into this one book, I find that Shakespeare would have something to say about this particular concept of thinking. Besides, he is a key element to the later part of this book however; I do credit Huxley for his creativeness in this venture. Seemingly fearless to write on such a topic, un-avoiding the possibility for a fueled debate on such a matter. The courage one must have in attempting to elaborate on such a confrontational issue is bold alone in itself. He deserves the praise of a true literary marvel. Huxley has a masterful mind, challenging those who might revolt to such literature. I have a feeling that this novel will continue to bring controversy to the market even in the twenty-first century as it did in the thirties, and the interest of all whom may read it. This novel is a drug, like soma, that keeps you coming back for more, no matter how much you dislike the book. It becomes very addicting.I have read the online responses time and time again for A Brave New World and it still baffles me why some think a perfect world, with happy people, sterile and having test-tubing, daily drugs to numb pain and more is any way logical whatsoever. What's the point to this all? The question remains as, why? The issue of concern is that in this World State,in which they live is not perfect, they are not perfect. What defines perfect? You decide."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"I don't get it. It's very unusual. Controversial in its time, but still widely read throughout schools in the United States. I must say it wasn't all bad, the ideas he portrayed were revolutionary and original, although I was extremely let down at the end. It is clever that drugs aren't for pleasure anymore, they are everyday, for the use of increasing entertainment. That's how someone explained their interpretation, but I still [dislike] my English teacher for making me read it.

Such a complex and creepy look into a superfical world into this book was hard to grasp, this just wasn't the type of book I expected. I prefered 1984 and Animal Farm much more than Brave New World. I mean, it's hard to say that emotions can errupture with just a little pill, and vice versa. Oh well, maybe I'm a bit tuff to give such a beloved classic just 1 star, but that's what I deeply and truely think this book deserves. I'll stick to my old favorites: Eliot, Hardy, Orwell, Willa Cather, Wharton, Dreiser, and Gustave Flaubert. Hehe, I never get to tired of my favorites. Viz., I didn't like this classic."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"The novel Brave New World by Aldous Huxley is about an English utopian society in the future. The main characters are one of 96 clones just like themselves, and the novel guides the reader through their everyday lives. Huxley introduces some interesting concepts and ideas, but the text lacks flavor.The tiresome novel slowly drags on discussing the differences between their culture and that of today. There is no distinct storyline to engulf the reader's desire turn the pages, and it has a dry personality. Huxley declines to develop his characters and they lack a certain realistic dimension.There isn't an identifiable incline, climax or decline of the novel. Turning the pages is like drudging through a marshy swamp. Its dull continuation of information isn't intriguing, however the thought that this type of society may someday consume our world does open up the reader's mind to a shocking truth.The novel is well written, but isn't recommended for people under the age of fifteen due to many adult topics and concepts within. It is directed toward people interested in expanding their imagination about possible future societies, but doesn't have the action and suspense to keep the pages turning, so don't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"There could not,to my thinking, be a greater gap between celebrity of a book and its actual merit. The writing is vapid, tiresome, and often unintelligible. Often praised as of far more psychological and societal value than 1984 or ANIMAL FARM, such claims are thoroughgoingly absurd. In fact, I quite wonder what substances got into Huxley's bloodstream and crossed the brain barrier when he was writing this drivel-ridden casuistry.P.S. My dismissive contribution here may prompt some of Huxley's ardent devotees to desire initiation of a mass debate. No thanks.

SO TRUE!I could do without so much drugs and sex in a book but I guess you gotta put that in there if you want to sell a million copies. Next time try haveing dinosaurs instead.

Overall, though, this book was pretty ok."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"This book contains so much of what I dislike in would-be literature. It's awash in generalities, blatantly didactic, guided by facile thought, caked with corny wordplay, and it displays no serious appreciation for language. It's not even an entertaining read.When it comes to characterization, Huxley is like a cataractous portrait artist who paints with a mop and roller. The inhabitants of the &quot;Brave New World&quot; are daubed with such broad, dull strokes that they are essentially mannequins modeling ideas rather than clothes. No character exhibits more than a single character trait, and that trait is always a contrivance. &quot;But this goes hand-in-hand with Huxley's message,&quot; you say. &quot;He's trying to make a point.&quot; Ugh! Perhaps, but...Like all dime-store artists and intellectuals, Huxley goes for the generic and general over the specific and particular. Huxley's sweeping generalizations capture none of the magic that makes each individual's experience so unique, complex, and interesting; rather, they reduce human experiences to miniscule variations on simplistic, generic, and monotonous themes. As William Blake emphatically declared, &quot;To Generalize is to be an Idiot&quot; --- this epithet fits Huxley to a &quot;T&quot;.But, of course, Huxley's muse traffics in pedantry, not poetry. And, without belaboring the point, Huxley's socio-political broodings are uniformly and embarrassingly obtuse; and, his prognostications are no more prophetic than those contained in any horoscope. Regardless, I don't care for socio-political theorizing in storybook form --- it is both intellectually and artistically lame.Another warning: Huxley's penchant for linguistic costume jewelry will cause ardent lovers of language to wince repeatedly. Here is just one of Huxley's extended witlesscisms: &quot;while our Ford was still on earth&quot;, &quot;cleanliness is next to fordliness&quot;, &quot;Oh, for Ford's sake&quot;. God, Lord, Ford (as in Henry) --- Get it! Get it! God help you if you're amused.&quot;Brave New World&quot; is so asinine and inartistic that it almost works as a parody of didactic literature. &quot;Brave New World Revisited&quot; shows that Huxley was not kidding, though. That Huxley was serious about his sophomoric ideas and silly writing provides some unintended and tangential humor, but only very little. Somewhat funnier is the fact that this book winds up in many literary &quot;lists&quot; and &quot;canons&quot;, which are themselves ridiculous, middlebrow gewgaws with slight and unintentional comic value. Final word: &quot;Brave New World&quot; is intellectually dull, artistically worthless, and more than a little kooky.Highly recommended to those who vehemently disagree with me. Everyone else can safely skip it."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"The phrase \\"Just do it.\\" may seem ordinary and simple but to those who have been exposed to Brave New World such a phrase is symbolic of what some may call Aldous Huxley's vision. In his vision of technological advancement, Huxley proposed a very enlightening prophecy. It would be one that the future would prove to be most accurate and realistic. As a visionary, Huxley's work is not only a cold portrait of the future but a warning of what is yet to come if man does not conquer his need for instant gratification and his fascination with technology.In Brave New World \`s ominous setting, Huxley illustrates a society, which parallels to the world that we know. In this world we see the promotion of drugs, sex, and unity. Huxley uses this world to question the direction of where we as a people are headed. He questions our future through his vision. His many visions allow us to peak into his thought. For example, he envisioned a place in which, life was created in a lab instead of between two human beings. He also imagined the destruction of life due to a nine-year war. Huxley's entire book is evidence of him being a visionary. It is in his many foresights from classes of human beings to the pre-conditioning of minds that we see his vision and what would eventually manifest into his prophecies.Huxley's prophecies are extremely accurate. Huxley sends a fierce warning to the world by showing how technology could eventually lead you to become Epsilons in a world where, \\"We also predestine and condition. We decant our babies as socialized human being, Alphas or Epsilons, as future sewage workers.\\" Such a prophecy has yet to come true but many others such as the creation of life due to cloning. Despite arguments the science world has created clones of animals, like the well-known Dolly. Some believe we have also cloned humans. Among other prophecies was the promotion of sex. With the overflow the internet and pornography such a prophecy is fulfilled. Like those people within Brave New World they are able to access information regarding sex very easily. In fact, it was promoted with the younger children experimenting with each other's bodies. Today, with a few clicks of a keyboard a children can indulge themselves in enough information regarding sex that they could make a career in sharing such information. Another prophecy is the conditioning of our minds with phrases like \\"the ending is better than mending\\". Today's conditioning is done to consumers with phrases like \\"Hungry Why Wait?\\" and \\"Can you hear me now?\\". In a sense, Huxley's biggest prophecy is the destruction of everyday feelings such as pain, fear, pride, and individuality. With the world of science and the influence of television such a prophecy is true. Both science and television allow you to conform to a certain way if you choose to. Science allows you to change your body or create a false high like those with soma. Television allows everyone to conform to a certain style and promotes certain behavior through entertainment. Huxley's prophecies are evident and are extremely accurate.It is in the curiosity and instant gratification of man that will drive mankind into the abyss of a Brave New World. Huxley illustrated such an idea through his indirect reference to Henry Ford. Ford, most known for the assembly line influenced a mass movement. It was a movement toward production but not just any type of production, mass production. Thus, people began to desire for items and they were readily accessible. In the long run this affects people in general not because of the production but because of the mentality. It is in that mentality that we see the citizens of Brave New World eager to want and receiving. It is in that desire that we loose what gratification we hold for those things which do not come easily. Instead we settle for those things, which characterize a utopia, happiness, unity, and joy. By doing this we give up the right to be free, the right to think, and ultimately, the right to live.Aside from instant gratification it is the curiosity of man that will lead him into a utopia. Man has the desire to reach the unreachable. It is the knowledge in Brave New World allowed them the know how of cloning people. This curiosity is what allowed them to forget about the past and focus on the future. With curiosity of man comes the grace of technology. Huxley clearly illustrates that technology allowed these people to condition the minds of others and pre-determine their purpose in life. The paradox in with this is that the items that are supposedly making our lives easier will eventually lead to our destruction.Brave New World cannot be prevented. Man has a desire to learn. With that desire to learn he finds a way to make life easier. He also finds knowledge. With that knowledge comes a desire for one thing or another. In the end the focus is placed on bringing about an instant feeling of good. When we continue to focus on what makes us feel good then fate will lead us to a utopia. It is inevitable. This world will become our Brave New World"},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"After reading CONQUEST OF PARADISE, a frightening book about the decline of civilization into a worldwide totalitarian police state, I was compelled to go back and read this classic. In BRAVE NEW WORLD, Aldous Huxley grips the mind, and keeps you locked to the book's pages as he describes a future, one which is completely homogeneous and conformed. Practices like artificial conception and genetic tampering are the standard in this uniform society, where very few choices are allowed, and questions are rarely heard. CONQUEST OF PARADISE also examines similar technological advancements in our day by studying the development of molecular nanotechnology and its implications. Huxley skillfully describes this gloomy premonition in incredible detail, and in many instances, including artificial insemination and genetic altering, he predicted the actual future. If it does nothing else, this book should send an ominous signal to today's society.

I'd have to agree with what a friend of mine said about this book. It should not be read in high school. I think that it's point would be missed. At face value, it's a fascinating read. Huxley's world is so upsettingly vivid that it lures the reader in and makes one turn pages continuously. What's even more fascinating is the social commentary beneath the outward appearance of the novel. And I think that would be missed among adolescents.Brave New World is the story of a world that has come to be after the \\"nine years war.\\" In this world, individuality is no longer welcomed. Humans are no longer born in the traditional sense of the world. They are grown. Mankind has been reduced down to genetic manipulation and is created on an assembly line. Mankind comes in various ranks. There are the best of the best, golden and chiseled, and there are the worst of the worst, the fetuses who are injected with alcohol while they are growing. Whether the best or the worst, each person serves a very specific function to the new society.There are so many disturbing aspects of this book. Mother is a word that causes people to blush since there are no mothers anymore. Love is disgusting and unfathomable yet sex is encouraged even as children during \\"erotic play\\" time. Contraceptives are carried around on a belt worn by women. Relationships do not exist beyond sex. People are discouraged from ever being alone (after all, one may have time to think). And if one ever gets unhappy, all you do is take a soma, a hallucinogen that makes everything o.k. God does not exist.God has become nothing but a myth that society mocks and laugh at. God has become replaced with the term \\"Ford\\". I must say that Huxley had excellent insight into what the invention of an automobile could lead to. The book is filled with \\"Oh Ford!\\", \\"The year of our Ford\\", and \\"his Fordship.\\" I can't help but think of the first commandment and the story from the bible of the golden calf. \\"You shall not worship false idols.\\" Huxley has given us the extreme of worshipping false idols and shows societies tendency to replace God with material possessions. The soul of a human has been replaced with chemicals, \\"groupthink\\", genetic engineering, and false happiness. What we are left with is an empty shell; a robot that looks like a human. Sex exists to make people happy, not to reproduce. If reproduction occurs, there are whole buildings dedicated to abortion. Motherhood is not welcomed in this brave new world. And what a brave world it is to make so many assumptions.Huxley has created a masterpiece that was relevant from the day it was published and will always remain relevant. It is a telling example of what the loss of spirituality can do and of the necessity of so many emotions that we perceive as negative.This book was read for the banned books challenge. It's ashame that people ban books such as these. Yes it's disturbing, but it's message is one that should be heard by all. It warns of the dangers of banning books that make one think. It shows the power of the human mind that actually is able to think out of the box. It opens one's eyes to the dangers of being just like everyone else. It's a book that should be required reading, but maybe not in highschool. Save this one for the college years.I loved the cover to this edition. It drew my eye right away. Greg Kulick did the cover design and illustration. It's the Harper Perennial Modern Classics edition and it is packed with extras in the back. I recommend this one!"},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Sobering. What was merely creepy 25 years ago in high school now has the frightening force of reality behind it--Huxley's prophecy is coming true. Though most everyone is familiar with the basics of the story, there was a wealth of detail that had escaped my first reading. When the pain is taken away, society becomes a giant feedback loop--seeking nothing but sensation.Huxley's Brave New World portrays a society devoid of pain and purpose--he argues that his creation is the inevitable result of science untempered by morality. He hints that the exigency that led to the Brave New World was war and one cannot think of a more likely scenario. This is science-fiction that has utterly transcended its genre because of the clarity and accuracy of its vision that an uncontrolled science would lead to tampering with life itself. Birth control, the abandonment of \\"traditional\\" morality, recreational drugs without side effects, and genetic engineering were all foreseen by this book from 1932.The utter triumph of the society is manifested in the fact that there is neither desire to escape nor ability to challenge the status quo. It is interesting to note that though genetic tampering is currently rather benign--we select for good looks, intelligence and hope to create a genome free from annoying defects like proclivity to cancer and other diseases--Huxley argues that you can't make a civilization of alphas thereby affording a justification for the purposeful impairment of the majority of the population. The problem with Huxley's alphas is that they are intelligent enough to overcome conditioning; they have to buy into the system because they are smart enough to know otherwise. If they don't, society banishes them to an island--which, in reality, is a prize bestowed only on those who can appreciate or desire freedom. For example, though well-aware that the society he \\"controls\\" has sacrificed art, science and progress, Mustapha Mond decides not to go to the island but instead adopts the idea that the highest goal of mankind is freedom from pain, obligation and choices.And, presciently, that is the promise of every modern politician that has any success--they wish to bring us a world free from pain and labor, to save us from ourselves. The world is losing an appreciation for the value of pain, the satisfaction of labor and the value of choices. Huxley saw it coming in 1932 and the conclusion that the world is heading down that path becomes inescapable with only the slightest reference to contemporary events."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"I was shocked to read Brave New World and see so many similarities in the same World I am living today.

Hopefully not..."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Huxley did an amazing job of foreshadowing a possible future for our human species when he wrote Brave New World. The story begins with an introduction to utopian life where people are not born, but engineered, and conditioned from birth. Their lives are planned out and pre-destined, not subject to cause and effect. Happiness is expected and if one starts feeling overly stressed or upset, soma, a drug similar to ecstasy, is taken in grammes to alter the disposition. Sex plays an unusual and rather comedic role providing an antithesis to the way our society views it. Individuality is scorned, tolerance for lower castes is not allowed, and heaven forbid you question your way of life. But this is exactly what Bernard Marx, our antagonist proceeds to do. Full of plot twists, symbolism, and themes that force you to relate modern society with that of the utopia described, Brave New World is a literary masterpiece that is well worth the read."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Brave New World, by Aldous Huxley, is the story of a utopian society set in about 600 A.F. (After Ford). Ford, the father of the Model T, replaces the God figurehead in Huxley's novel. The characters exclaim \\"Ford!\\" in moments of great emotion and make the sign of the T on their stomachs. In this dystopian society, all cultural elements and the intellectual pursuit of science and truth have been sacrificed for a world of comfort and convenience in which war, poverty, hunger and disease have ceased to exist. Eugenics is the basis of society with Alpha Pluses at the intellectual peak and of the greatest stature and the Epsilon Minuses at the bottom of both. Sex is not only treated casually, but promiscuity is expected as a duty. When all else fails, the hallucinogenic drug soma is dispensed to keep the masses at least opiated. The main character, an Alpha Plus named Bernard, searches for what he feels must be a truer meaning to life. He befriends a peer who seeks desperately an art he can not define nor find. Their quest becomes more realistic upon a chance encounter with the Savage who is ironically much more cultured and intellectually awared than this genetically engineered pair. Bernard's search highlights the central theme of the novel: Will humanity sell out culturally and intellectually for comfort and security? Is suffering a necessary state for the moral health of humanity? Aldous Huxley's upbringing in a family renowned for its scientific and literary pursuits is evident in this well executed novel. I strongly endorse this book as one of my all time favorites and a sure classic."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Within this timeless cautionary tale, one will discover that the moral spirit of the world can become more corrupt through the self-conscious reduction of chaos that surrounds and molds it. Add this brilliantly thoughtful Huxley piece to his pile of outstanding visionary titles."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"In Aldous Huxley's book Brave New World people live in a world where humanity is carefree, healthy, and technologically advanced. Warfare and poverty have been eliminated, all races are equal, and everyone is permanently happy. In theory it is a perfect world.But is this really the world we want to have and are these \\"perfectly\\" trained people the people we want to be?Those are the questions posed skillfully by Aldous Huxley.Therefore this book is a very good one and I can recommend it without any restrictions."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Huxley's dystopia novel of a world controled by \\"placating\\" it's public is one of the most fascinating an eerie portraits of world humanity put together.Written in the early 30's this book is still incredibly relevant and holds the test of time.Two main characters in Huxley's novel produce the most perfect irony of the flawed state. One tries to shun those trying to control him, the other is stuck in a world he hates but can't force himself to leave cause of his complacency. It is the craft of conformity that Huxley is getting at, and the obsession that we as people have with comfort and control that is brilliantly portrayed.Awesome book."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"This remarkable book was written around 1931. As far as I know, it is the earliest of the modern utopia novels (\\"1984\\" and \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" for example). You may not want to read my review if you haven't yet read the book,or don't want to be exposed to a summary of it:It is a story, centered in London, of a world where life is lived out in controlled, contented bliss. Genetic engineering contributes to a smoothly functioning caste system. Sexual promiscuity is the norm, even instilled in children. Birth control is the norm. Behavior altering drug use is the norm. Physical attractiveness is at a premium and youth is artificially preserved throughout lifespan. Materialistic consumption is prized. Entertainment occupies non-work hours but does NOT include reading. Independent thinking is unacceptable. \\"God\\" has been replaced by \\"Ford\\", literally (science and industry!, not superstition).A couple of characters are introduced, who behave counter to the culture. They eventually are banished. We get a glimpse into the true thoughts of a World Controller, who has a safe containing BOOKS. A central character (The Savage) is introduced, having been imported from the undeveloped American Southwest. Although a primitive, he was self-educated through study of an ancient volume of Shakespeare. He is rather pan-theistic, worshipping an assortment of gods that he has became aware of, including the Christian God. (He seems to be doing the best he can with the information he has). His love relationship with a beautiful but totally indoctrinated London girl destroys him (he is chaste - she is a cookie cutter product of the society and he is appalled by her ready sexual promiscuity).In the end, The Savage cannot function in this society and takes his own life. The reader may assume that the society absorbs the entertainment available from this event and moves on blissfully.Who wins, who is happy, who is right? My conclusion: If there is no God, the pleasure seeking utopians were right on track. The Savage was a superstitious primitive who squandered his life and a multitude of opportunities for fun and happiness. Conversely, if a Creator Deity does exist (whom The Savage clearly sought with a whole heart), then it would appear that The Savage moved on to a superior state, and indeed had lived out his whole life in a superior fashion of obedience. The utopians live out their reward in the present state, squandering eternity.The Bible (mentioned in the novel, a copy hidden in the Controller's safe) asserts that The Creator is self evident through his creation, and all who reject him are without excuse. Correspondingly, there are multiple allusions in the novel to fascination with nature, such as the night sky. Such interest is supressed by the utopian society or course. I think that is the bottom line of Huxley's Brave New World. Living for this world (serving self), or living for the greater, unseen one (serving God). A great matter of faith, and the essence of all decision making."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Reading \\"Brave New World\\" for the first time, quite some time after it was originally published, definitely affects how you read and perceive the book. Instead of reading it as sort of a \\"sci-fi\\" tale, it struck me as a book that seems to explain, in certain areas, where the world could be heading. With science improving and government becoming more controlling some aspects of the book are not so far fetched. I would not go so far as to say that we are heading for a world exactly like the one in Huxley's book, but the book is a good example of how ridiculous such a world would be."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"I am a student at Mercy High School in Middletown, CT. I found \\"Brave New World\\" interesting, although one of the more confusing books I have read, and I didn't understand the ending until I read it a couple of times. I understood what was happening when I had finished the book and was writing a summary because it gave me time to think over the plot. What I liked was that \\"Brave New World\\" was short and I could read it fairly quickly. I wouldn't say that it is my favorite book, but I do not regret reading it. It wasn't the science fiction that I usually read, but I can see why, for its time, it would be considered science fiction. However, I don't think it would be science fiction today because cloning is already such a big part of modern science that reading about it doesn't have the same effect that it would have had in the fifties or sixties. You would all enjoy the book which makes you think about what happiness really is -- being safe or being free?"},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"3 1/2 StarsReplace soma with television, harvest centers with embrionic stem cell research and controllers with the United Nations and you know where we stand right?This is a very light and entertaining book that will only take a few hours to finish, but you will think about it for many more. Its dystopian entertainment value more than makes up for its simplistic writing style."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"I believe that this book provides an expos&eacute; on the nature of power and controll and the roll of education as well as political and social culture in this process that is second to none (that's right, including Orwell's excellent book 1984). However, ultimately I feel that this book is inferior to 1984 if only because the actual story of the book is so poorly written. Unlike 1984, where I found I was able to enjoy the book on so many levels, be it as a character study or as a political essay, Brave New World, I feel, almost totaly lacks any effective story, plot or characters that really grip the reader in the same way as Orwell's masterpiece. I felt like I was the one injesting 'soma' as I was reading the book which made me not care about a thing that happened to the characters.That said, to be fair, if one reads this book solely with the intention of reading a piece on the politics of mass control, pacification, propaganda et al. then I believe one would be more richly rewarded for reading this book than one who read 1984 with this same intention in mind. Ultimately, it is more plausible and economical to control a mass population by the use of social taboos and hallucinogens as described in Brave New World than it is to control a population by montitoring everybody's every move and by force as described in 1984."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"The year is 632 A.F. (&quot;after Ford&quot;), and babies are no longer born. No one has a mother or father. In fact, those terms are now considered &quot;dirty&quot; words and are no longer used. Instead, everyone begins life as a test-tube baby, genetically and environmentally conditioned to fit into their own predestined social caste - Alpha (the highest caste, composed of society's most intelligent members), Beta, Delta, Gamma, or Epsilon (the lowest caste, composed of mindless semi-moron clone laborers). Godlike status has been conferred upon Henry Ford, and mass production is taken to frightening extremes. The world is considered stable, and everyone is happy. Working hours are light (and people are pre-conditioned to enjoy their work anyway), entertainment options abound, and promiscuity is encouraged. Taking the place of church services are weekly orgies. Happiness is the ultimate goal of existence, and if anyone should ever feel the slightest hint of depression, they are conditioned to turn immediately to the hallucinogenic drug called &quot;soma&quot; for immediate relief.However, among the ranks of the intellectual Alphas, there remain a few who question the desirability of this synthetic world. One such man is Bernard Marx (interestingly, most of the names in this novel are adapted from those of historical political figures and theorists - Lenina Crowne, Polly Trotsky, Benito Hoover, Sarojini Engels, Herbert Bakunin, Helmoltz Watson, etc.). A few places in the world that are not considered worth modernizing are set aside as &quot;savage reservations&quot; which are now the only places where people still live in a &quot;pre-Fordian&quot; way. Marx takes a vacation to one of these reservations, and ends up bringing a savage back home with him. This, of course, sets the stage for all sorts of challenges to the society's values.Perhaps I was expecting too much, based on all I'd previously heard about the book, or perhaps I would have been more struck by it if I hadn't already read &quot;1984&quot; by George Orwell, but Aldous Huxley's &quot;Brave New World&quot; came as a bit of a disappointment to me. It's definitely worth reading once, especially for fans of dystopian literature, but unlike &quot;1984&quot; it's not one I'm likely to return to for a second helping anytime soon. The ideas Huxley puts forth are valuable, but the delivery leaves room for improvement. The story just doesn't hang together quite tightly enough to pack a full-blown punch.The first couple of chapters are very interesting and seem promising, but after that it felt like the story deteriorated somewhat. As I said before, I do admire the points Huxley makes, but the book was not very compelling as a whole. Much of it takes the form of satire, which is fine, and even amusing, but then there are numerous points at which the plot goes far overboard and borders on the ridiculous. When this happens, the story ceases to be believable, compromising the strength of Huxley's messages. One of the things that makes Orwell's &quot;1984&quot; so terrifying and thought-provoking is that, though it is futuristic fiction, it is so detailed and serious that is actually seems plausible. Books like this need to be both plausible and scary for them to have an impact. If the reader doesn't get the feeling that such a world just might actually come into being, and that it is not a place they want to live, then it's hard to take the message seriously.My overall verdict, therefore, is that you should read &quot;Brave New World&quot; once, but, unless you're a real dystopia buff, I'd recommend checking it out of the library or borrowing a copy from someone else rather than purchasing it. It's a valuable piece for the ideas is proposes, and it's a quick and easy read, but it is not the most effective book of its type. The fact that it was written so long ago (1932) also means that it does not take into account any historical events that have happened since then, and perhaps this is another reason why it seems a little less realistic. I do not regret reading it, as having done so adds to one's literary and philosophical repertoire, but I much more highly recommend George Orwell's &quot;1984&quot; (written in 1948), which is both thoroughly engaging and highly thought-provoking."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"I could not entirely relate to the book, and would not call it one of the greatest works of English Literature, as some have coined it.Nevertheless here are some thoughts. It does not have the same nightmarish quality of social warning of George Orwell's 1984, and seems in some ways a mixture between the latter and the lighter more satirical Hitchhikers Guide To The Galaxy.Some have compared the world drawn by Huxley in this book, to the \`hedonistic consumerist culture of the West' but of course the totalitarian thought control rather reminds us of some other system that many have believed in and some still believe in, although in Huxley's world there is a lot less pain and bloodshed than there is when the world has had certain Utopian ideologies forced upon it!Unlike the world drawn by Huxley here, there is no soma, or pleasure to draw one away from the bloody hellish nightmare of Communism.Note the names chosen for the citizens of Huxley's Utopia/Distopia such as Lenina Crowne, Bernhard Marx and Polly Trotsky.Note also the compulsory study in \`Class Consciousness', and of course a type of thought control, which resembles today's political correctness.The taboo on the words \`mother' and \`father' bring to mind the fact that in some schools in Ireland and the UK, children are forbidden from using those words, as part of the war by the politically correct left against the institution of the family.Then the savage, John, who go's to the other extreme, away from the life only for pleasure, extols suffering and sainthood. His vicious attack on the young girl Lenina, for doing only what she knows, is disturbing. Lenina is of course not a [prostitute] or a strumpet, but simply responding in the way she has been conditioned to his declarations of love.The sad thing is that it is Lenina, who at the end seems to show genuine love, in a society where it is taboo.Only to be again mauled by John."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"What can I say about this book? Well, even though it is somewhat dated, you can still see a similar world as a possible future. It is less likely than it once was, with Bradbury and Orwell seeming more likely.In this future world, we have all of mankind addicted to pleasure. We have genetic engineering so that people have their roles assigned to them long before they are born. We have sleep teaching of children. We have a world of slaves who do not know they are slaves and without any masters.That is the most eerie part of this book - the slaves without the masters, the government that exists and doesn't exist at the same time. In order to keep the people complacent and happy, there are regular orgies and easily provided drugs.Many people will be turned off by that last bit, the sex and drugs culture, and that will become the focus of their concentration. Such is a symptom of the society, but they would miss the cause.This book is enjoyable on it's own, but it works even better as part of a study of dystopian futures."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"This has to be one of the most fascinating books I have ever read. It is listed up there with Orwell's 1984 and any other book that sheds light on a utopian society that is perfect on the outside, but empty to the core. I gave it five out of five stars for it was outstanding on many different levels including drama, romance and good old satire humor of a society striving/maintaining perfection. It is a must read for high school and college students. Don't pass this chance to read somthing good! I say drop Moby Dick and pick up somthing that will change your perspective on things instead of making you numb and sleepy."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Brave New World is a very confusing book. That would be the first sentence that most people would use to describe it. Biological jargon at the beginning is enough to put anyone below a certain understanding away. However, if you do understand the book, it is absolutely brilliant.Brave New World is a book which centers around a society in which all needs are catered to, all people are conditioned into liking what they do, and engaging in activities which biologically give pleasures to the body such as drugs and sex; Brave New World is a book about a society where happiness is the key goal, however the goal doesn't come without a price. Huxley takes us into a world where people are born into a caste system which they are conditionally brought into liking their way of life, and accepting other people's ways. Learning isn't encouraged; people are no longer born, they are cloned or raised from DNA. Identity is lost in this society, no one is anyone special, except a select few world controllers, who are merely the clockwork of the society.Aldous Huxley is brilliant in this book. He raises astonishing questions on the importance of love, of individuality, of age, of freedom, and of pain. He also asks whether those should be sacrificed so that everybody would be happy. I myself can't make the decision at the moment either, although if you have thought of what is really important to you in your life, I would encourage you to read this book. Brave New World isn't too close to 1984, which is a common misconception, as the themes of the two books are wholesomely different. I'd advise you to pick up this book if you don't know what your philosophy is yet, because this book will make you think. And that's why they would have banned it in the new world."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"This product arrived on time and in good condition.

The paper is thick enough to write notes on and mark with highlighter without going through the pages."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"As I read the first 50 pages of Brave New World, I could not help but compare it to Orwell's 1984. However, Brave New World definitely carves its own niche (not to mention it was published well before 1984). While quite witty throughout, it also gives a chilling look at the price of instant gratification at the cost of high art.It's interesting how Huxley's viewpoints change from the Director, to Lenina, before spending a good amount of time on Bernard Marx. The focal viewpoint seems to become centered on Bernard, only to switch to John in the last section of the book. I found it odd how Bernard's character was pushed to the side and shipped off to the island, while John becomes the central figure. It makes for a strange narrative structure, but it is one that ultimately works."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"This book will blow your mind.The writing is fantastic and the story is horribly thought provoking.I really don't want to say any more than that, because it would spoil the book. However I will mention that if you don't like to think about society in a critical way or have a problem with somewhat bizzare situations, you will most certainly NOT like this book.To everyone else: READ IT!!!If you're not sure, I don't know of a liabrary that doesn't have this book."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"This book is a classic and for very good reason. It has some powerful themes and is written in such a gripping way that you can't put the book down until you've finished. It doesn't have the darker, totalitarian, hyper-surveillance overtones of Orwells '1984', but gives an equally disturbing view of the future. The ideas of social conditioning and recreational drugs are especially chilling and makes you look at the world around you in a whole new light. I found the ending a touch lack lustre (hence the four stars), but the journey getting there is marvelous and will make you uncomfortable at times as you consider what life you'd prefer, the drugged easy utopia ,or the feeling savage lands. I guess that's a debate that we ask ourselves spiritually or in our everyday lives to some degree anyway, (simply getting by or feeling deeply and rocking the boat). This book is just an amplification of that. Overall a great read, with stirring themes that will play on your mind for some time to come and well worth the time taken to read it. One of those books that leaves your life richer for having read it.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"I'm not a big fan of sci-fi but I found this particular book to be very fascinating because it has just enough truth in it to engage your imagination. And what an imagination! It's the kind of book that lingers in your mind long after you've read it. What would utopia look like? How would you programme happiness? Unlimited sex without constraint or jealousy. Perfected genes and DNA. Drugs to remove anxiety and induce euphoria and eliminate boredom. Work you are programmed to enjoy. Simple, pat answers to difficult situations. And the price to pay is what? Art? Choice? Religion? Philosophy? Competition? Really a fascinating puzzle Huxley builds. And even stranger, there are no heroes and there is no rosy ending. There is no smart guys to solve the puzzle. Huxley gives you the puzzle with some pieces filled in. So it's mind expanding literature, exactly the kind of thing sci-fi does best. So whether you do or do not like sci-fi, I think it's still a worthy read."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Aldous Huxley's 1932 novel Brave New World presents a vision of consumerism and mechanization, where social strata are bred into the biology of factory-produced twins, and stuporous stability is the highest government ideal. I found myself captivated by the book's system of society, its veneration of Henry Ford, and culture of instant gratification. If Orwell's vision was pure fascism, this is pure capitalism.On the downside, Brave New World is nowhere as intellectually deep as 1984. The plot and characters are underdeveloped and inconsequential. Huxley makes the joy of reading solely in its exploration of his (brave new) world, but that can only carry the book so far. Throw in a compelling plot, differentiated tone of story-telling, and dynamic characters and it might have been perfect.Continued at: [...]"},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"I sent it to a friend in prison.

This book tells the story of the future that has no sense of ethics; only systematic operations. Aldous Huxley delivers this story well with great twists."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"This book, I am happy to say, was one of the most insightful and terrifying books that I have ever had the privilege to read. To clarify, I don't mean 'terrifying' in the sense that Stephan King is terrifying. Instead, I mean it in a sense of deep and utter horror at the society that is presented. Imagine a world where all of society is conditioned to be utterly loveless. All people have been created in a decanting plant and have been programmed before their very birth for the tasks that they will fill. There are five castes, and the amount of oxygen that the embryo is given in the decanting plant will determine what caste it belongs to. The lower castes are given less oxygen to make sure that they are stupid enough to enjoy the mundane jobs and empty lives that they will fill, and the higher castes are given enough oxygen to make them the society leaders - but only to a point. The moment the child is &quot;born&quot;, it begins to undergo a series of conditioning that includes both messages in their sleep and electric shocks. The ideas of a &quot;mother&quot; or a &quot;father&quot; are considered vulgar and utterly filthy, as is the idea of actually falling in love with someone. In fact, staying faithful to one person is the utter limit of social depravity, and the maxim of 'everybody belongs to everybody else' is praised to the skies. The lack of adult decision-making is encouraged, and all people are kept at an infantile level. All needs are instantly filled. And for everything else, there is soma, which is a drug that reduces the user to a cow-like state of bliss. Soma is what keeps the entire society placid and static.Enter into this world John the Savage, who was born on one of the last Indian reservations, and the only place on earth left where people are given the belief of loving and natural relationships. However, he does not belong there either among the primitive culture, and joins the 'modern' culture. There, he cannot reconcile himself to such a way of life, and he is finally driven mad and kills himself.In truth, John's sad end was the only possible ending for him. He could not survive in such an insane world as the modern society, and the primitive society would not accept him. As there was no middle ground, all that was left was death.I would highly recommend this book. Despite the fact that it was written in the early '30s, it could just as well have been written today. The focus is on the human, and as such it remains just as powerful and meaningful today (especially as the possibilities of genetic tinkering loom closer) as it was then."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"&quot;Brave New World&quot;, a fantasy of the future, which sheds a blazing and critical light on the present, is easily Huxley's finest work. This mighty novel of a soulless, streamlined Eden is the twentieth century's most brilliant, erudite and terrifying evocation of the future our civilization may be creating. Above all, &quot;Brave New World&quot; is a prophetic vision of natural men in an unnatural world, where freedom lies dead and all our concepts of morality are forgotten. It is easily the most shocking, open-eyed look at a frighteningly possible tomorrow."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"This book is probably my all time favourite . Though the characters are not the most established and strong in literature they al in some way represent the idiosyncracies and feeling in us all whither they be doubtful or lustful. It is mainly the concepts and storyline of this book that captured me. Written in 1932 it deals with today and tommorows issues forboding the 'grand society' so many people long for . A must read, hopefully when you're in you're teenage years. When you are done, read 'Brave New World Revisited'."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"This book has many good thought inducing ideas as well as an amazingly provocative plot. The only problem is starting the book and some of the more gnarled chapters. When starting the book you have to get in to the correct frame of mind. The book does not do this for you. My other grievance is with one chapter. The style in which it is written makes the reader work relatively hard to concentrate on what is being said."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Huxley's well-loved foray into cynical predictions about the future is a semi-enjoyable read that, while very good overall, remains very overrated. Huxley's tale lacks focus where focus is needed, and persists in dwelling on areas that it doesn't need to dwell on. Ultimately, you are left with a story that should have been compelling, but ends up being rather empty.Odd that today's high schoolers seem to prefer this over both '1984' and F 451, and this novel never reaches the stellar heights of those masterpieces."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Literary fiction that took a cynical view of the many proposed utopias that were being proffered through out the being of the 20th century is very common. Many of the great English language novels come from this time period where science, politics, economics, or ideology all seemed to have the answers to cure all the ailments of the world. Brave New World and 1984 (the comparisons are unavoidable, sorry) attempted to take some of these promises of a better tomorrow and follow them to a dark, and somewhat logical, place sometime in the future. When they were written, both books took on what the author's saw as disturbing trends and then used their narratives as a warning to the reader. They saw the first dominoes falling in a pattern they believed wouldn't lead to a future utopia, but in fact to a miserable dystopia.There are a number of trends that Huxley covers in his book; the the destruction of the family, mechanization of reproduction, mindless care-free lives of consumption and desire, governmental predestination of social/economic class, and lemming effect of group-think. The most wildly fantastic portions of his story involve the factory like breeding of humans, which calls for an understanding of human genetics and reproductive science that we still lack. His theories about the use of sleep hypnosis to mold the minds of the population to make them more apt for certain tasks are far fetched, but would certainly interest the corporate robber barons of today if it was possible to make compliant and happy workers. Where Brave New World is right on the money, is it forecasting the infantilizaiton of adults to be little more than spending machine that are constantly in search of new diversions. The \\"civilized\\" people in this story are petty, hedonistic thrill seekers that wouldn't spend more than a second or two contemplating the deeper value of anything.The story is broken into two halves. The first gives us a deep understanding of the future world the Huxley conceived so the reader can have a good sense for how it works, which becomes important to the second half. Only two of the first set of protagonists seem to have any depth of thought, which for one of them is a constant source of derision from his peers. They whisper that even though he is an Alpha, the top rung of the socio-economic ladder, that there must be something wrong with him since he thinks about things, or likes to spend time alone. This man named Bernard Marx, an illustration of the author's literary device of sprinkling real world names in ironic places, decides to take his ditzy girlfriend of the moment to see \\"savages\\" that live outside their civilized world. In this pseudo-native American reservation they come across John who was unlucky enough to be born to a \\"civilized\\" mother that was abandoned on the reservation. Bernard and John think it would be wonderful to bring John back to London; John because he has heard from his mother his whole life about the wonders of civilization, and Bernard because he can gain from it professionally. It turns out that John's dream of an imagined utopia is nothing like what he encounters, so things go very badly for him. As for Bernard, as a character he goes through some strange shifts just to end up a miserable weasel.Pros:1.) This book is frighteningly prescient. Not a day goes by that I don't think our society is getting more self-indulgent, illiterate or disconnected from anything that involves the denial of desires. Huxley called this shot amazingly well from 70 years ago.2.) The author creates a pretty immersive world that doesn't sound too far fetched. Some of the character are shallow, but they are supposed to be. Their lack of depth stems from their environment, which makes them convincing.3.) The last few chapters contain some amazingly deep philosophical analysis about man's place in the universe that I wasn't expecting. The conversation with Mustapha Mond is riveting.Cons:1.) Not many. Occasionally I had to look up some of the author's archaic adjectives for describing faces, but that was about it.Conclusion:READ THIS BOOK. It is a classic and I can see why. It is a wonderful example of a style and subject matter that was very popular at the early to mid 1900s, I cared about the characters, the world was unique, and the story has a poignant message. It is quick read that is well worth the time."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Alpha children wear grey. They work much harder than we do, because they're so frightfully clever.

Huxley's satire hits the nail on the head as it shows us a very frightening and very possible reality.What if people could be conditioned to think and act the way they do? We certainly know that such a thing is possible - just look at Hitler's Germany.. 'Introverts' who ask questions of their government can be effectively isolated and dealt with occordingly.. Drugs can not only produce the illusion of contentment and euphoria, but can also be used to control people and their dependence.. Is 'Brave new World' relevant to our current state of affairs in our present corporate world - I would say yes - it is already heading in that direction."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Reading Aldous Huxley's Brave New World was inspired by realising that I hadn't read any of a recent list stating the top twenty geek novels. Given that my impressions of geek literature being hardcore science fiction and adventures in elfworld it was pleasant to discover that this novel, over seventy years after its publication, is still fresh. I would tend to think, however, that its endurance is due to its satirical tone rather than any sort of geeky idolisation as, despite its futuristic setting, it deals more with its characters rather than the world around them.Set in a dystopian society in 2540AD or, as the book calls it, AF632 (AF meaning After Ford) the novel presents an almost perfect society where war and poverty has been eliminated at the cost of family, culture, and religion. The whole world is considered to be a single state and the central tenets are those, as you would expect, of the industrialist Henry Ford. Fordism is the semi-religious doctrine that permeates this society: his sayings are gospel, his name is said in vain, the cross has been replaced by the \`T'; indeed, in a motion similar to crossing oneself, the citizens make the sign of the \`T'. An interesting idea, perhaps, but the incessant expletives (\\"for Ford's sake!\\", \\"oh my Ford!\\", etc.) do lose some of their humour and power.It begins, with little narrative, in the Central London Hatching and Conditioning Centre, a place where human beings are raised are \`bottled' (raised in test tubes) and then conditioned via radiation and Pavlovian techniques to become one of the five social castes of society (the independent Alphas through to the half-retarded Epsilons). Once fit for society the citizens are then \`decanted'. The Director of this centre is giving a tour to a group and shows them the bottled embryos passing along a conveyor belt as they are treated with chemicals to determine the future intelligence and physical attributes of the embryo. He then shows them the nursery where some children are being conditioned to loathe, of all things, books and flowers.Then, moving on, we meet one of the world's controllers, a man named Mustapha Mond. He tells the touring children about the World State and the benefits that attempts to quash peoples' emotions and relationships has made on society. Indeed, in this world, there is no marriage, grief, or joy - promiscuous sex is actively encouraged, death is no big deal, and games only serve to further the economy.More characters, from here, are introduced into the narrative as Huxley's world escapes the Hatchery and Conditioning Centre and goes further afield. The self-conscious Bernard Marx gets permission from the Director to visit a savage reservation in New Mexico; Lenina Crowne, attracted to him, accepts his offer to join him. Helmholm Watson, a hypnopaedia writer (slogans that are repeated and learnt whilst citizens sleep) shows discontent at his job feeling, as an Alpha, that he is capable of much more. And, in New Mexico, they meet John and his mother Linda, a pair of savages discontent with their world. Returning to London attempts are made to integrate John into society but, his world is shaped by Shakespeare (he found a copy of his complete works) and he disagrees with the dystopian World State, arguing with Mond until each character goes their own way (John to exile; Marx exiled.) and the final denouement.Brave New World could have been better, there's no doubt about that. The obvious hindrance was a narrative that never really centered on one character: one minute we were touring the hatchery, the next we're following Bernard who, in turn, slinked into the shadows when John was introduced. Huxley has ideas, though, and amidst his obvious taste for neologisms (centrifugal Bumble-puppy!) gets his ideas across fairly well although this can be at the cost of the narrative as the climactic argument between John and Mond goes back and forward with neither being right. The World Controller argues that society is better off when nobody reflects on the past, when people aren't given any time to themselves, and when there is nothing to be emotional about and that eliminated studies (history, religion, science) are wrongs that require control while John, in his misunderstanding of the World State, believes that people should have freedom of thought and be allowed to suffer emotions to make them human. Of course, in a world where people are made to order, made on Ford's assembly line, he has little chance of ever making a point.The writing in Brave New World is fine, if a tad verbose at times or scientific at others (dolichocephalic!) with, as previously mentioned, a world of neologistic commodities (pneumatic armchairs, for example). Dialogue is alright and serves to paint a more accurate picture of the characters but it is not entirely realistic and sometimes serves as device for infodumps. The characters, however, are hard to follow as they feature for little periods and, while you get an idea of what drives them, you don't get a complete sense of their role within the story, especially as to their reactions by the novel's close.While I liked Brave New World one of the hardest things for me to do was imagine Huxley's vision as it would be incarnate. When I think of future societies I am given to thoughts of Fritz Lang's Metropolis but, when least expected, Huxley would throw in the countryside, savage reservations, and, unexpectedly, a lighthouse. I understand that these elements demonstrate a world that strives to be perfect but suffers from underlying problems (the people are kept happy by use of recreational drugs rather than any utopian positivity) that mean it is still a burgeoning dystopia rather than fully realised with its wheels completely greased. Overall, it's an attractive novel, full of ideas, but one that suffers from a lack of organisation with them."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"By: Gabriel Boudreau (GabeBoudreau.com)Aldous Huxley is brilliant in this book. I first read this book in public school as a child. It was required reading at the time. What they require for reading now days I couldn't tell you. But this book will open your eyes to the world that was Aldous Huxley.I am not sure if it is a para dime or not, but this book does reflect our current society. Without giving too much away he describes a world where people take a drug he calls \\"soma\\" to feel normal. With all the depression drugs crammed down American's throats to help them cope it reminds me so much of what is described in this book.A must read for anyone at any age. Younger kids will need mom and dad to help dissect it a bit. I hope they still have this book in public schools as required reading but I doubt it. Most youths I ask have never heard of the book, nor do they read much anymore.I remember spending a week or so discussing just this one book in class with a written paper etc. This type of writing has helped me in my creative writing and I put Huxley on par with Hemingway, and Jules Vern as my all time favorite author(s). This book will at any rate get you thinking about your life and how much \\"soma\\" you take.Enjoy."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Aldous Huxley published Brave New World in 1932, a dystopian fantasy written as a counterpoint to H.G. Wells' optimistic view of the future presented in Men Like Gods. Perhaps what's most amazing about Brave New World, is that Huxley wrote it before WWII, when the prevailing attitudes about the future were overwhelmingly positive.Brave New World is set in London in the year 2540. After years of war, a single World State is in control providing community, identity and stability for all of society. Sounds pretty good, until you hear what's been given up in order to get it. Reproductive technology and sleep-learning make this society possible. People no longer live in families. There are 5 castes of people all \\"hatched\\" and grown in \\"factories\\" of a sort. Alphas (the highest caste) are allowed to develop naturally and, to some extent, experience a kind of individualism. The other 4 castes are tampered with at some point in fetal development to limit intelligence and physical growth. All people are bred for certain jobs. These jobs aren't a prison, however, because the breeding also happens at the level of desires. They only could want to do these specific jobs. \\"Sleep-learning\\" is a kind of conditioning that keeps each caste in its place, and also creates in them consumer desires that keep the economy running smoothly. Additionally, the world population is strictly kept to 2 billion assuring there are enough resources for everyone.Much of the plot revolves around describing this society. The critical event is the recreational visit two Alphas take to an Indian reservation in New Mexico. They go to see the \\"uncivilized savages\\" who are not apart of the world society. They end up taking John Savage and his mother Linda back to London, to introduce them to civilization. This is where the title of the book comes from, a direct allusion to Shakespeare's The Tempest, where Miranda (living as a slave on an island) first encounters other people. She exclaims \\"O brave new world! That has such people in it!\\" It's an ironical title, as John Savage is not at all impressed with Civilization, and eventually tries to flee from it.What works: Huxley's fears, as it turns out were well-founded. Neil Postman, in Amusing Ourselves to Death compared Brave New World with George Orwell's 1984, and he contends (rightly) that Huxley's fears were closer to the mark (at least for modern Western society):\\"What Orwell feared were those who would ban books. What Huxley feared was that there would be no reason to ban a book, for there would be no one who wanted to read one. Orwell feared those who would deprive us of information. Huxley feared those who would give us so much that we would be reduced to passivity and egotism. Orwell feared that the truth would be concealed from us. Huxley feared the truth would be drowned in a sea of irrelevance. Orwell feared we would become a captive culture. Huxley feared we would become a trivial culture, preoccupied with some equivalent of the feelies, the orgy porgy, and the centrifugal bumblepuppy. As Huxley remarked in Brave New World Revisited, the civil libertarians and rationalists who are ever on the alert to oppose tyranny \\"failed to take into account man's almost infinite appetite for distractions.\\" In 1984, Orwell added, people are controlled by inflicting pain. In Brave New World, they are controlled by inflicting pleasure. In short, Orwell feared that what we fear will ruin us. Huxley feared that our desire will ruin us.\\"The most poignant parts of the book are discussions about the World State's decision to exchange the noble, the true, and the good for absence of pain and easy happiness.What didn't work: While necessary to set the stage, some of the factory tours in the first 6 chapters of the book were laborious to read. The book's entertainment value increases drastically from chapter 7 on.Read it if: you like dystopian novels, or are interested in cultural critique of Western society."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"It has been approximately 15 years since the last time I read \\"Brave New World\\". Reading it this time, I was more attuned to the criticisms of the book. Simultaneously, I was shocked by all of the raw sexuality which I had forgotten within the book. When so many things regarding an empty society converge in this book, it is easy to forget some. That being said, this is among the most important books of the 20th Century. It may be highbrow or hard to understand for some, but the overall message can not be overlooked.The book initially follows Benard and his disatisfaction with modern life. Taking his most desired woman with him on holiday, Bernard hopes to make sense of this life at the savage land (the current American Southwest). It is there that Bernard encounters a disposed member of the enlightened society and her son, John. John, who is referred to as the savage, is brought back from the savage land with Bernard. His mother Linda is also allowed to return. In this new world, John discovers a sterile world without pain. The drug name Soma is a cure-all for any emotional ailment and creates an overall sense of detachment from the world. With Soma, morality has devolved into just being pain-free and comfortable. Humanity is a product that is not regulated and created for greatest possible production as is evident in human production. In fact, production is such a high priority that (Henry) Ford has replaced God as a psuedo-deity.Even if the typical class of high school seniors that reads this book is able to identify many of the themes, there is a lot here for the adult world to appreciate. Every generation has access to a pill/drug/activity that is their escape. When that acitivity comes to dominate a person's existence, that person ceases to be human and the Brave New World comes closer to reality."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"I rank this up there with 1984.

The story is intriguing and well written. 5 stars!"},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"It is hard to believe that this sci-fi classic was written nearly 80 years ago. It world depicted within the pages of this book resembles the world we know today rather than the world of the nineteen thirties, when this book was written.It is a world in which women are sexually liberated and are not looked at askance for having multiple sexual relationships. People are programmed at birth to be satisfied with the status quo. One's future is predetermined. Most are satisfied and, of course, there is soma, an addictive substance that induces euphoria.There are a few renegades, however, who are not satisfied, for whom the pre-programming just did not take. These free thinkers have questions that they want answered. They are individualistic in a world where the individual is sublimated to the grand scheme of things that is firmly in place. They simply do not feel that they belong in such a world. They will soon find out what happens to those who do not conform.This is a book that provides a great deal of food for thought, which is why it has remained a classic in its genre. Provocative and prophetic, it is a book that will never cease to amaze, as the story is simplicity itself, but the themes are quite complex."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"You're probably familiar with the story, and its rather coded genius narration of where we are/headed. This edition presents some nice extras worth the read, Brave New World Revisited, and some further thoughts by the author. A solid book to add to your Huxleyian library."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"The dystopian society in Huxley's Brave New World combines the iron-clad totalitarian control of 1984 with the intellectually and emotionally stunted hedonism of Fahrenheit 451 for a uniquely unsettling effect. Set roughly 600 years into the future, Brave New World portrays a world ruled by a single totalitarian government. The society is organized in a strict caste system, with the physically perfect Alpha intellectuals ruling the world at the top and physically and mentally stunted Epsilon menial workers at the bottom. Families have been abolished and reproduction takes place in laboratories. The embryos are manipulated to produce predetermined mental and physical effects, and the resulting children are carefully psychologically conditioned to accept their lot. The story begins with Bernard Marx, an Alpha caste misfit who is wildly torn between his conflicting desires to rebel and to conform. Bernard makes a visit to a Native American reservation where he meets Linda, an English woman who had accidentally been abandoned on the reservation many years before, and her son John. Bernard offers to take them back to England, where John becomes an instant celebrity due to his \\"savage\\" ways. At this point the focus shifts to John, who challenges the society with his intense emotions and ideals.The somewhat abrupt shift away from Bernard and towards John is symptomatic of the simple fact that Huxley is less interested in the characters and the plot than in describing his hypothetical society. Luckily, his vision is disturbing enough to be interesting on its own. In the brave new world consumerism, sociability, sexual promiscuity, and psychotropic drugs are all compulsory. Individuality and emotional passions of any kind are relentlessly squashed. The situation is all the more disturbing in that the control is so insidious that most of the people are simply unable to imagine a different life. BNW is about the limitations we accept because we don't realize that alternatives exist. Like many readers, I first encountered BNW as required reading in high school. One brief scene managed to stick with me in the many years between my readings: it is a scene where a group of low caste babies are given picture books and flowers, then exposed to loud sirens and electroshock to condition them against these undesirable interests. The brutal killing of innocent curiosity and the thought of all joy in books and nature being wiped out in infancy made a powerful impression on me. The descriptions of the intensive conditioning of the children and the adults' total acceptance of the forces that stunted them was and still remains for me one of the most chilling parts of the novel.There are many criticisms that can be leveled at the novel. For myself, I found Huxley's prose rather uninspiring. More problematic to me was that although Huxley establishes stark contrasts between the \\"savages\\" and the \\"civilized\\" peoples in the story, neither society is an attractive place to live. John's reservation is cut off from the outside world by an electrified fence, and the people living there have no apparent access to modern science or technologies. Whereas the civilized world is overrun with mechanization and artifice, the reservation is overrun with disease and deprivation. John's society, like the civilized society, has no tolerance for non-conformists, and John's violent reactions to civilized society show his inability to step outside of his own cultural conditioning. The result is a depressing false choice between extremes. To be fair, Huxley himself admitted this weakness. My edition includes a forward where he notes the unrelenting pessimism of these alternatives and regrets that he did not include a third option. For all of its weaknesses, though, BNW remains a strikingly eerie novel, a gross exaggeration of trends that are a little too real to ignore."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Though easily his most famous book, Brave New World may also the least satisfactory for those readers who enjoyed Huxley's work from the first decades of the century--or at least it is less satisfactory reading for me. To wit, for others familiar with these earlier works, Brave New World may seem a bit heavy handed, a-literary, and more a compilation of typical Huxley themes than a continuation of the pleasing novels of the twenties and thirties. The writing and observations are without nuance, and with too large an intent to startle, stir and create paradox. There is the sense, in Brave New World, of the author being a skilled literary puppeteer entertaining and awing with his usual tricks. No doubt there are grabbing effects and counterintuitive speculations that might amaze and amuse the reader naive to Huxley's general cast of mind, but also a loss of the delicacy of Huxley's usual prose style. For those not familiar with Huxley, an example in another art form might illuminate: the song \\"I want to Hold Your Hand\\" was at the time the most popular Beatles song, full of interesting, crowd pleasing effects, but certainly not their best work, and geared to be popular amongst an American audience. In the same way, Brave New World seems an over-exaggerated display of some Huxleyen literary effects with his typical themes, and in some ways, seems less intelligent than previous more obscure works. The need to delve into scientific speculation, and the need to comment upon human society in a prescient way seems to have been a predisposition from the Matthew Arnold side of the family, as well as a white elephant burden from his predecessor, Thomas Huxley, Darwin's bulldog. Brave New World, though hailed as an important book, has the beginnings of some of his later, more idiosyncratic thinking such as the belief in the paranormal or ESP, where the pressures of iconoclasm and oppositionality to convention steered Huxley into erroneous, puzzling directions. In some ways, Brave New World is the summit of Huxley's career, in other ways, it is the beginning of the end. Damon LaBarbera, Ph"},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"_Brave New World_, first published in 1932, by writer and thinker Aldous Huxley is a classic science fiction tale that reveals a utopian future in which genetic modification, social organization, and designer pharmaceuticals have been perfected to create a system of perfect happiness. This novel along with George Orwell's _1984_ (1949) was to rank among the Twentieth Century's most chilling science fiction utopian/dystopian masterpieces. Indeed, Huxley was later to note not only the resemblance of his novel to Orwell's novel but also the uncanny accuracy of many of his predictions. In particular, the rise of genetic engineering, social organization, and designer pharmaceuticals to eliminate all discomfort and unhappiness has become widespread. Aldous Huxley (1894 - 1963) was a novelist, author, and thinker who was born in England and lived for a time in the United States in southern California as well as taking a particular interest in the Indian tribes of New Mexico. Huxley was related to the famous scientist and social Darwinist T. H. Huxley. This novel is perhaps Huxley's most widely known and its message for the modern world is very important. Indeed, the novel shows how it might even be necessary to choose unhappiness in order to be truly free.In the novel, all the characters within civilization live a life of mechanized order. Childbirth has become a thing of the past, and Malthusian policies have been implemented. However, at the same time \\"happiness\\" has been achieved through a special drug called \\"soma\\" (named after the mythical hallucinogenic drink) which allows the user to achieve a blissful state whenever depression begins to develop. Everyone in civilization is sexually promiscuous and as such is expected to be a functioning member of society. No one appears to grow old because of life enhancement stimulants; however, death is regarded as simply unimportant and the old are simply done away with. A system of perfect eugenics has been instated with society regimented strictly into castes, from alpha to epsilon. The world is ruled over by World Controllers including Mustapha Mond, one of the great world leaders. Furthermore, Henry Ford has become a messianic figure within the novel (as well as Sigmund Freud to a lesser extent). Alternatively, civilization is contrasted to life amongst the \\"savages\\", where civilization cannot be implemented and where the old ways still prevail. The \\"savages\\" are Indian tribes that are largely superstitious and still experience life's vicissitudes, while those among civilized society simply ingest soma when faced with difficulty.The novel begins in London at the hatchery for children (the process by which children are created after genetic modification since natural childbirth has become a thing of the past). The novel follows the lives of two individuals Bernard Marx and Lenina Crowne (who eventually are to travel to a savage reservation on holiday). Bernard Marx is considered a social outcaste because of his preference for being alone, his high intelligence, and his indifference to sexual promiscuity. On the other hand, Lenina is considered societally acceptable because of her sexual promiscuity. Bernard takes Lenina to a savage reservation in New Mexico where they are to meet Linda (a former member of civilization who became pregnant with the child of the Director of Hatcheries) and John (her son and now a member of the savage community). Linda (who has become a mother and now is seen as socially worthless by society) has become an alcoholic and a prostitute among the savage reservation. Bernard decides to take John and Linda back to civilization in an effort to regain social status after he has been threatened with banishment to Iceland by the Director of Hatcheries. Once they arrive back in civilization John confronts his father and thus completely destroys the Director (who has now become a father and is deemed socially unacceptable). Eventually the savage (John) is to learn about civilization and begin a relationship with Lenina (who is frequently using the drug soma). It is discovered that Linda is slowly dying and since death is not a concern among the civilized people she is allowed to die. John eventually is to meet up with Mustapha Mond, the Resident World Controller for Western Europe. However, upon Linda's death, John is tormented by mourning and guilt and eventually isolates himself, becomes horribly addicted to soma, and eventually apparently commits suicide.This sad tale shows us a world where an apparent utopia has been achieved. It is believed that all people are now happy and that all human worries and troubles can be cured through the drug soma. However, as it is discovered, not everyone is truly happy. Bernard is horribly depressed and a social outcaste at the beginning of the novel, and John is eventually to become miserable. Mustapha Mond addresses this issue when he speaks to the savage. He says \\". . . you're claiming the right to be unhappy . . . Not to mention the right to grow old and ugly and impotent; the right to have syphilis and cancer; the right to have too little to eat; the right to be lousy; the right to live in constant apprehension of what may happen tomorrow; the right to catch typhoid; the right to be tortured by unspeakable pains of every kind.\\" Thus, we see what the savage must really claim for himself in order to be truly free. In effect, this novel speaks to the meaning of life and the manner in which life is deprived of meaning in the totalitarian state. The novel also shows the potential horrors of genetic engineering and eugenics, the mindlessness of modern bureaucracy and the modern organized society, and the increasing prevalence of designer pharmaceuticals as a cure to ills. When this book was written it was believed to be a prescient look into the Twentieth century; however, as we can see this book is even more relevant today where much of what Huxley predicts has already come to pass. Just as Orwell's _1984_ showed the reader the world of the Twentieth century totalitarian state, this novel shows us the modern world, in which utopia has apparently been achieved, yet in which many are desperately unhappy."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"\\"Brave New World\\" is a novel of a particular, possible, future and has been a 'classic' since the 1940s.

Then, work against both of these possible futures."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"In his most coveted novel Brave New World, Aldous Huxley gives us a scathing look into a possible future, and asks us what we truly mean when we say \\"civilized\\", and why that doesn't always translate into \\"better\\". It is written is lively compulsively readable prose, in which Huxley does not force his vision on you he allows you to discover it gradually and in the beginning chapters he seamlessly tell us about the intricacies of his world, mainly through the way his characters react to various situations. It is a quick and suspenseful read and is best, at least this was my experience, in as few sittings as possible.The novel opens in a society where, \\"everyone belongs to everyone,\\" meaning promiscuity is not only condoned it is required by law. The concept of monogamy is a taboo, and all babies are genetically engineered for their respective social classes. They are then \\"conditioned\\", to enjoy whatever their predetermined service to society is. Meaning of you are a lower caste you will enjoy tour back breaking work because your whole life you have been told that is what you should enjoy. All this is done under the guise of \\"stability\\", which \\"civil\\" society values most.The socio political concept Huxley seems to be most audaciously critiquing is the idea of Utilitarianism a philosophy pioneered by a man named John Stewart Mills. The basic idea behind Utilitarianism is that a government should base all it's decision on what makes the most people happy. So if I own a house and six people want to tear it down to make an apartment building that is perfectly all right without my consent. There are a few intrinsic problems with this ideology, first being that every human being does not achieve happiness in the same manner. In Huxley's imaginary \`Brave New World' the society the \\"World Controllers attempt to correct this by conditioning classes to enjoy what it is they are supposed to do. But of course as in even the most organized societies there are oddballs. And his main protagonist is one of them Bernard, a member of an upper class, who by some scientific mistake looks as if he we're a member of one of the lower ones is naturally because of the societies materialistic nature to some extent ostracized from his peers and as I would imagine forced by the nature of that relatively extensive isolation, (in Huxley's society isolating ones self is looked down upon almost as much as monogamy), to question the merit of the his \\"civilized\\" society.Bernard, and his current mate Lennina go to an Indian reservation where they encounter an ancient tribal society where they have many masochistic rituals that are even more disgusting to those of Huxley's society then they are to our own. In this reservation they encounter a mother who had been stranded in that society and has given birth, her child has grown up ostracized to his tribal society, much like Bernard. He is given the choice to either stay in his own life or try living in civilized society. I will not go on so as not to spoil some of the interesting and tragic occurrences that befall him.I did find it interesting that in his introduction the late Huxley stated that he regretted not giving the savage a third less extreme choice. One of the most interesting things I thought was that he did have to choose between two incredibly flawed ways of life. Because it seemed to reflect some of the more difficult decisions we are still forced to make today in a polarized political atmosphere. But as are most artists who become most recognized by their audience for an early work, he must have become quite bitter towards it and become simply tired of hearing about it. (I would suggest reading the introduction after the novel seeing as it contains a few spoilers)There are a few issues I had with the ideas behind \`Brave New World' that prevented me from giving it five stars. (1 I am not entirely convinced that by any means of manipulation you can get the majority of people to enjoy being the post modern equivalent of slaves, although I must admit it was a disturbing idea. (2 Huxley sets up that \\"The Ford\\" came into power not long after an apocalyptic war in the name of stability, even after a great war I do not see people willingly giving up so much freedom.What I was most impressed with in \\"Brave New World\\" is how well it holds up with the scientific moral conundrums we face today. Genetic Engineering and cloning, corporate manipulation, and to be fair to the right the decline of what as seen as the true family, for a science fiction/satire novel published in 1932, this is the highest praise I can give."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Back when I was a high school student, many many years ago, this book was on the reading list, but our teacher decided not to require us to read it, opting for the Great Gatsby and Hiroshima instead. So I went down to the local bookstore and purchased a copy to read on my own.Along with Sun-Tzu's The Art of War, I consider this book to be a good investment.The mark of Good Alternate History is seeing something that could have happened if things had gone a different way. How might the Civil War have gone had McClellan not lost his nerve before Richmond in 1862, or finished off Lee after Antietem? Or what if Robert E. Lee had accepted Lincoln's offer to command the union armies? Or what if Hitler had been asasinated? What if the Soviet Union had fallen to the Gemans? What if Ben Franklin formed the Albany Congress into a successful government during the French and Indian war? Or what if these brainless 'Drop of Ink' race laws that once dishonoured this great country were never adopted.The Mark of Good Science Fiction is seeing something that couldcome if we do or not do certain things.The science fiction shelves of every book store are packed with garbage of lazer beam robats and elves that will never happen. Some set in the future. Others set in the past or in alternate worlds. Garbage callsed sci-fis. Absolute trash.It is a rare book that can be called Science Fiction. Science fictin like Brave New World.Brave New World. Look at the news of our present world. The decline of moral values in today's society plus Dolly the sheep clones and the growing power of the UN. Aldous Huxley's Brave New World is coming unless we change. That makes this book great science fiction."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"It was the German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer (1788-1860) who said \\"life without pain would have no meaning.\\" One would think that most people would want as little misery or anguish in their lives as possible (unless they're masochists), but I think the gist of Schopenhauer's statement is that if people go through life without feeling or experiencing anything unpleasant, then they're not really alive. They might as well be a beautiful mannequin. (Could that mean an afterlife in hell is more meaningful than an afterlife in heaven?) If people have no understanding of the bad, then they can't fully appreciate the good. Then there's that old adage about taking the rough with the smooth.The word mannequin fits as a description for the people in \\"Brave New World\\", in the sense that they are mass produced and identical. As a matter of fact they are clones, bred in the Hatchery, their role in life predestined through gene manipulation and mental conditioning.While the society in \\"Brave New World\\" is described as dystopian (lack of individuality, lack of choice, devoid of substance), there are some things to be envied too. Everyone feels secure with a sense of belonging, no one is starving in the gutter, there is no racism, no violence, no motivation for violence, and of course, no war. If anyone wants to check out of reality for a while they can take soma, a euphoric drug with no serious after-effects. Everything is unnatural and artificial. (But then, hasn't civilization always been unnatural and artificial?)In essence, everyone feels content. Well, almost everyone. Bernard Marx sees the world around him, and is all too aware of its insipid shallowness. He sees himself as an outsider, someone who finds it impossible to fit in. As a man who refuses to \\"join the party\\", he chooses to wallow in his own discontent, to indulge in his own intellectual superiority. He won't even take soma. Naturally, this kind of behavior draws some unfavourable attention, particularly from Mustaphor Mond, the World Controller.When Bernard takes a break from this society of claustrophobic togetherness, he travels to the United States, visiting a Reservation where people can live the \\"old-fashioned\\" way (fall in love, have families, contract disease). There, he finds a savage called John. Bernard takes John back to London, where he is seen as a freakish novelty, and Bernard, by association, enjoys a period of celebrity status. Like Bernard, John soon realizes how lifeless the people are and tries to escape.Written in the 1930s, \\"Brave New World\\" has an ambivalent quality about its description of the future. We naturally assume that the future will be better, that every generation is better off than the one that precedes it. The world we live in now (in the West, at least) does have some similarities. Sex has long since lost its taboo status. In fact, people never shut up about it. There are those who see modern society as decadent, immoral and ungodly. To the more fanatical types, it is so repugnant, they seek to destroy it and impose their own way of life on the rest of us. That is a price we pay for free will and diversity. When we live in a world where no one can agree, and people are too stubborn to respect the beliefs of others, there is always trouble.\\"Brave New World\\" is unlikely to be forgotten as an important piece of literature, but I prefer George Orwell's \\"Nineteen Eighty-Four\\" (1949) when it comes to dystopian fiction. It's definitely more bleak and terrifying than the earlier book."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"BNW set the standard for all the dystopian authors that follow, but it is fundamentally different from works such as Orwell's 1984, which though actually a criticism of early cold war brinksmanship and militarism, has been boiled down to 1984=communism=bad. Orwell was trying to make more complex points, but this was highjacked. The association of the dystopian genre with criticizing communism was reinforced by Ayn Rand's work Anthem which was used to advance her own wacky &quot;-ism&quot;. However one views communism or socialism, to exclude any self-examination of our capitalist consumer culture through these works, in the post-cold war world, is in effect a declaration that these books are irrelevant.Huxley's brilliant work, however, is undeniably a jab not at authoritarian communism, but crony capitalism and mass consumption for social control. Not only does this make Huxley's work the most relevant to our time and the most prescient, but it also reflects that he had a clear vision of emerging trends in his own time. BNW was written as, thanks to plastic and the Ford assembly line, Americans and Britons for the first time were starting to buy huge quantities of STUFF and advertising rose exponentially with the formation of the radio giants that now comprise the six outlets for all media content in the US. The role of consumer goods, exemplified by soma, was to placate the masses; it's a literal interpretation of the Marxist phrase &quot;opiate of the masses&quot;. The hyponpaedic verses of &quot;ending is better than mending&quot; echo the sentiment of today's consumer-driven society. If only Huxley had predicted television."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"I honestly loved this book. The first time i read it I was senior in highschool and just did what I had to do to get by for class. When I actually opened it and read it for real, my eyes opened up truely to a brave new world! Although this book is disturbing and messes with your mind in an ethical way, it also opens you to show the world could actually become liek this one day. Although we may not me labeled &quot;Alphas&quot;, &quot;Betas&quot; , ect., our society today does have the upper class, middle class, and lower class each with tehir repective roles in society."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Ah yes, after hearing President Bush's decision to federally fund stem cell research, I quickly dashed to my computer and here I am, writing a review for Huxley's Brave New World. Although commonly refered to with Orwell's 1984, Brave New World uses a different road to reach dystopia. In 1984, Orwell uses fear and supressing people as a means of governing, and uses constant war to maintain economic equilibrium. However, Huxley's world is completely at peace, there are no wars, and relys on creating a world of statisfaction for people, and wasting resources is the chief means of keeping the economy in stasis. Huxley depicts capitalists gaining control of the world, not Orwell and his stalinists, which is more plausible, and even does a convincing job showing what we may be like in eighty (yes, I am bold enough to say eighty years only) years. IF YOU DECIDE TO BUY THIS BOOK, Huxley wrote an essay reflecting upon Brave New World, and aptly dubbed it Brave New World Revisited. It would be an indespensible guide to getting a proper reading of such a good book (however, it doesn't get 5 stars because Dostoyevsky is much much better)"},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"1984 is very straight forward (though undeniably a masterpiece). It tells you what to think, and doesn't venture far from those ideas until the end. You hate Big Brother. It's that simple. In Brave New World, the line is blurred. While Orwell has created a government you love to hate, Huxley's totalitarian society is genuinely likeable. While their ideas are unorthodox by today's standards, these ideas manage to create a world without pain or suffering.This world is a place you would love to live in. Everyone is happy, industry runs like a finely tuned machine, and all of our world's discomforts have been eliminated. Yet, when we are introduced to Bernard Marx, Helmholtz Watson, and Johnny Savage, things change. It is difficult to know what to think or what Huxley is thinking until the book is over, and even then a very cryptic ending keeps us wondering. In this sense, the novel is superior to 1984.Also, Huxley has done a much better job of predicting the future (the book was written before 1984 and takes place roughly 580 years after that novel's time period). While some old science fiction clich&eacute;s have yet to be replaced by the modern ones, that is to be expected.Despite these successes, the book has a variety of faults. First, there are places where it is obvious that Huxley was rushing through them simply to get on with things. The savage reservation, John's fish-out-of-water tale, and the concept of the \\"islands\\" all seem wasted and thin. The savage reservation is particularly troubling. There are plot holes here with John's mother, the descriptions are too brief, and the chapters don't have the same complexity of the rest of the novel. The ending has the same feeling. It seems tacked on, without substance, and doesn't really say anything meaningful. It is too short, doesn't really relate to the questions in the reader's mind, and makes us dislike the character it deals with (that's how I felt at least).Huxley just jumps around too much. The characters seem undeveloped because of this. There is an incredible amount of potential for greatness, but the book falls flat of attaining it. I loved this book, but only because I forgave it for many of its faults.Read this as a companion piece to 1984. They make up for each others' weaknesses."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Contrary to popular prejudices, this book is not about a future totalitarian world made possible by genetic manipulation. A possibility of cutting &amp; pasting genetic sequences was not known to Huxley. (The idea of DNA as we know it occurred to Watson in 1953.) In fact, if you read the book, you will find that making of components of this brave new world is mainly through hypnophaedia (a kind of brainwashing) and use of drug. So, is our world in any way similar to the one Huxley describes? Not quite. I'd say it merely reflects the gloomy outlook the author had in the interval of two World Wars. Is the book against science? Not really. In fact, the Controller (in his Fordship) is well aware of the subversive nature of science. A totalitarian society has to control science, he says. If any one's going to argue that this book is for anti-science, he might have to rephrase: it is about controlled use of science. Overall, like Orwell's 1984, this book is about totalitarian society, where a person's free will is simple luxury. Wait, does &quot;free will&quot; exists? Consult Skinner's Walden Two."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"What's good about it is Huxley's vision - who cares if it's plausible or not so plausible, because it's interesting and vivid, and that's enough. If you want to evaluate the plausibility of it, fine, but the result has little bearing on the quality of the novel. That said, everything else about &quot;Brave New World&quot; is mediocre. The plot seems convinient (not to mention boring), and once a few chapters have passed, Huxley just ceases development of his vision to instead focus attention on characters - who end up being underdeveloped anyway.(If you haven't read it yet, I still suggest you read it, and judge for yourself. But I wouldn't buy it.)"},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"I found BNW very entertaining, and I was fascinated by Huxley's technological vision of the future. In a foreword to the book writen 30 years after initial publication, Huxley talks about the scientific/industrial/technological changes he did not envision while writing BNW--and he mentions that he did not forsee the importance of nuclear fission.Thirty years after Huxley's belated foreword, his vision of bio-production seems right on the mark--he foresaw the ethical issues of biotechnology, particularly cloning. But, obviously, computers are completely absent in this vision of the future. Much of the book takes place against a backdrop of what (to me, today) seem like &quot;Dr. Frankenstein&quot;-type laboratories--pretty funny.I admire Huxley for trying to envision the future--it's a risky thing for an author to do. I do find his portrayal of Native Americans and people of color entirely sterotypical. As for women...let's just say the Brave New World is a white male world. It seems to me he simply projected the existing political/sociological structure into the distant future, and I really did not sense that he considered an alternative. It didn't spoil the book for me--I just thought it was funny that the new world was really so old in that sense. (Yet with regard to sexual mores--it was quite different.)I enjoyed the book and I admire Huxley. But I found the sections of the book in which characters debate happiness and the meaning of the social order to be pretty bombastic, no matter how heartfelt."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"The wonderful thing about Huxley is that his supreme intelligence delights -- but never intimidates -- the reader. One is aware of being dominated , but pleasantly and ineluctably, in much the same way as one is overwhelmed by the playing of a virtuoso of the calibre of Jascha Heifetz or Glenn Gould. &quot; Brave New World&quot; is a characteristic product of Huxley's playful genius. One marvels at -- envies! -- his effortless resourcefulness and elegant prose. All these superlatives apply to any Huxley novel. But in BNW he achieved the virtually impossible feat of producing a work whose content exceeded the elegance of form that came naturally to him, thereby establishing his literary longevity. To echo one of my fellow electronic correspondents: Bravo Aldous! -- John L. Bell."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Huxley portrays a &quot;perfect&quot; society, where everyone is healthy and happy. Disease is non-existent, war has ended, and everyone has plenty of free time. Everyone knows there place in society.

Very good!"},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"This is a book which was written in the 1930's and had dramatic insight to the hippie revolution and even now with the genetic copying of species like Molly the sheep.

A book which, in my opinion, is better then Orwell's 1984. Brave New World is an illustration of Huxley's prediction of the world after Henry Ford makes it possible for mass-production of the automobile. The world, as Huxley preceives it, is run by Ford and the Controllers. Humans are born in test tubes, Promiscuity is encouraged and Soma ( evidently prozac) is taken regularly. Huxley's future is a future where the word &quot;Ford&quot; replaces God and Lord...where the words &quot;Mother&quot; and &quot;Father&quot; are considered dirty and inapproriate. All together his portrayl is terrifying, his descripitions of events: horrifying, and his new invented concept of &quot;Everyone belong[ing] to everyone else&quot; (Huxley), is outrageous.Recently; however, NBC has turned this wonderous classic into a sorrid love story of chaotic endings. Those of you who have seen this movie and now think that that is what Brave New World is really about, I urge you to think again. Read the book. Close your eyes and imagine. Step in to A BRAVE NEW WORLD."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"The Key to understanding the meaning of this book are found within Aldous' eyes. To know his life and the history of his period, that is, the substance of his projection, the associations are clear. What experience,-what fuel, kindled his vision? This question is key. And realizing this, one is not as tempted to grade Huxley's prophetic accuracy. An awareness of how people conversed during his period is also helpful in reading some drawn out dialouge. What may seem boring to the young reader today, was rather brazen in his day. Respecting these differences is key to the analysis of intent. Also, any knowlege of his other works will also allow a better grip on his psyche. Point Counter Point and The Doors Of Perception are a couple. I was assigned this book in high school and have since read it a few times. I found a biography at a yardsale that's from 1973. It was written by Sybille Bedford. What a life ole Aldous had. This provides great insights into his perception, his times, and his visions."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"although the ideas and concepts that huxly thought up were astonding and tantilizing, sometimes he seemed to drift off and lose the whole meaning. maby i feel this way because i'm on;y 15 and i was forced to read this book rather than choose it. but i believe that huxly had potential for a wonderful book but brave new world was not."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"This was a boook that I really enjoyed reading.

Althought it was confusing at times, it was fun to read and I didn't mind that I HAD to read this book."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"The Brave New World was an assigned reading for an English class. At first I didn't know what to think, but in the end, I liked the book. Although I don't agree with the exact concepts of the book, it was very interseting and kept my attention. The book presented ideas that most of us don't ever think about. I don't think that I'd ever want to live in such a world, but reading about one was fun. It's one of the best books I've read in quite a while. It seemed to have a little bit of excitement, mystery, fact, and certainly fiction. I think one of my favorite moments was when John began throwing the soma out the hopsital window. What excitement it was to see him finally stand up for what he believed in! I didn't like the ending of the book as well as the rest, but it seemed appropriate to have John kill himself. It was his only escape from this society. At first I thought this book was crazy and hopeless, but in the end, I enjoyed it a great deal.

But no generalization, however sincere, can faithfully depict such a complicated spectrum of so many people at such a sizeable arena. Still, the impression persists.)Aldous's Brave New World survived its own initial adverse reviews in the 1930s & rightly remains a classic - one that I first read in the 1960s & then again only recently, well over forty years later.

Over the main entrance the words, CENTRAL LONDON HATCHERY AND CONDITIONING CENTRE, and, in a shield, the World State's motto, COMMUNITY, IDENTITY, STABILITY.And so begins a Brave New World by Aldous Huxley. This book, along with George Orwell's 1984, serves as a warning that we may be headed towards a grim future. One is ruled by force, threat of torture, and constant surveillance. The world is in a perpetual war that justifies martial law. In the other, a World State rules a society of termite-like consumers, conditioned via neo-Pavlovian methods and hypnopdia to follow the dictates of society not by force, but because all their needs are met, and any cause for suffering or passion, or the need for religious transcendence, has been nullified in favor of stability. Though it might seem like a paradise, with promiscuity and recreational drugs not only encouraged, but mandatory, it was intended by Huxley to be a nightmare. In retrospect, which vision of the future presents a greater danger of becoming a reality?In a letter to George Orwell thanking him for sending a copy of 1984 Aldous Huxley praised the book, but said the following:Whether in actual fact the policy of the boot-on-the-face can go on indefinitely seems doubtful. My own belief is that the ruling oligarchy will find less arduous and wasteful ways of governing and of satisfying its lust for power, and these ways will resemble those which I described in Brave New World.I tend to agree with Huxley. Although North Korea might resemble the society of 1984, with Big Brother Kim Jong Il Watching and enforcing his harsh regime with threats of hard labor in work camps, it would seem to be an aberration whose days are numbered. On the other hand, while many of the things described in Brave New World may never come to be, others are becoming true at a faster pace than expected. In Brave New World Revisited, rumination on just such questions written by the author after a few decades had passed, he says as much. Revisited is included in some editions, and it addresses Over-Population; Quantity, Quality, Morality; Over-Organization; Propaganda in a Democratic Society; Propaganda Under a Dictatorship; The Arts of Selling; Brainwashing; Chemical Persuasion; Subconscious Persuasion; Hypnopdia; Education for Freedom; and asks What Can Be Done?We might not recognize the danger, but I say that we are rapidly losing our freedom, Brave New World style, not by some brutal dictator, but because we are too distracted to do the hard work necessary to maintain our freedom. Our short attention spans make anything beyond the sound bite too complicated to comprehend. If an issue can't be summed up on a bumper sticker, we don't want to hear about it. And we are all too eager to relinquish our freedom in the name of safety, security, stability, and let's face it, convenience and comfort.Anyway, Brave New World is an excellent book, and I really enjoyed reading it. I liked that two of the main characters, Bernard Marx and Lenina Crowne, were named after communist revolutionaries, but the society of the future was so oblivious to history that the World State didn't consider this a threat to their beloved stability. I loved it that they had substituted Henry Ford, the inventor of the assembly line, for the Lord. They just lopped off the tops of all the crosses so they were Ts, in honor of Ford's Model T. It was very appropriate for a society where no children are born naturally, but manufactured on an assembly line, just like Ford's Model T. There was even cloning, referred to as Bokanovsky's Process, to produce multiple copies of the same product, a human being. All babies are produced in test tubes at the Hatchery and Conditioning Centre. A forced caste system divides the citizens into Alphas, Betas, Gammas, Deltas, and Epsilons.Bernard Marx and Helmholtz Watson are two Alphas, but Marx is insecure because he is short of stature, and Watson is perhaps just a little bit smarter than the average Alpha. They started off to be the two most sympathetic characters because they both didn't quite fit in to the Brave New World, but once Bernard Marx returns from his trip to the Savage Reservation in New Mexico with John, the savage all that changes. While it may not quite be believable that a boy raised on a Savage Reservation would have taken to Shakespeare like a fish to water, it really serves the story well. It is as if Shakespeare symbolizes all that is lost in the Brave New World, and also, the title is taken from something Miranda says in Shakespeare's final play, The Tempest:\\"O brave new world that has such people in it.\\"This quote returns as a haunting refrain, each time becoming more bitterly ironic. There are also references and allusions to Hamlet, King Lear, Othello, and Romeo & Juliet--though the latter made Helmholtz Watson laugh. It was at this point that Helmholtz became much less sympathetic. He was still a citizen of the World State and bound by its limitations, though he at least sought to do more, to say something important. In the scene where Helmholtz is first introduced he confides to Bernard the following:Speaking very slowly, \\"Did you ever feel,\\" he asked, \\"as though you had something inside you that was only waiting for you to give it a chance to come out? Some sort of extra power that you aren't using-you know, like all the water that goes down the falls instead of through the turbines?\\" He looked at Bernard questioningly.\\"You mean all the emotions one might be feeling if things were different?\\"Helmholtz shook his head. \\"Not quite. I'm thinking of a queer feeling I sometimes get, a feeling that I've got something important to say and the power to say it-only I don't know what it is, and I can't make any use of the power. If there was some different way of writing ... Or else something else to write about ...\\"Anyway, Helmholtz tries to write poetry about solitude, a forbidden topic that gets him into hot water, but it is terrible poetry, and he can't really fathom the depths of Shakespeare. He has no frame of reference. As World Controller Mustapha Mond explains to a group of students:Mother, monogamy, romance. High spurts the fountain; fierce and foamy the wild jet. The urge has but a single outlet. My love, my baby. No wonder those poor pre-moderns were mad and wicked and miserable. Their world didn't allow them to take things easily, didn't allow them to be sane, virtuous, happy. What with mothers and lovers, what with the prohibitions they were not conditioned to obey, what with the temptations and the lonely remorses, what with all the diseases and the endless isolating pain, what with the uncertainties and the poverty--they were forced to feel strongly. And feeling strongly (and strongly, what was more, in solitude, in hopelessly individual isolation), how could they be stable?Chapter Three is masterfully done--kind of a round-robin that shifts cinematically between two scenes in the Brave New World: Mustapha Mond, the World Controller giving a lecture to some students, and Lenina and Fanny Crowne discussing Lenina's unfortunate propensity for seeing the same man for months. It not only provides the necessary exposition but the rapid shift back and forth between the two scenes juxtaposes the citizens of the Brave New World with the Controller, so you get theory contrasted with practice. The hypothetical and abstract with the actual reality.And when reality gets to be too harsh, there is always soma:And if ever, by some unlucky chance, anything unpleasant should somehow happen, why, there's always soma to give you a holiday from the facts. And there's always soma to calm your anger, to reconcile you to your enemies, to make you patient and long-suffering. In the past you could only accomplish these things by making a great effort and after years of hard moral training. Now, you swallow two or three half-gramme tablets, and there you are. Anybody can be virtuous now. You can carry at least half your morality about in a bottle. Christianity without tears--that's what soma is.One thing struck me though as I revisited Brave New World, and that was that the scenes where hordes of thrill seekers descended on John, the Savage, after he had been made the reluctant star of a \\"feely\\" reminded me of the Charlie Sheen melt-down. No, I am not elevating Sheen to the stature of the noble Savage in Brave New World, but merely noticing that the feeding frenzy of paparazzi and fans was eerily similar.The Bottom Line is that Brave New World holds a mirror up to our society but we are much too distracted by the latest gossip, multi-tasking with our smart phones, and watching 3D movies or so-called \\"Reality\\" TV shows to notice.Nineteen Eighty-Fourby George OrwellAfter Many a Summer Dies the Swanby Aldous HuxleyEyeless in Gaza: A Novel (P.S.)by Aldous HuxleyThe Doors of Perception and Heaven and Hell (P.S.)by Aldous HuxleyIsland (P.S.)by Aldous HuxleyThe Tempest (Norton Critical Editions)by William ShakespeareOf the Imitation of Christby Thomas &agrave; KempisOEuvres Philosophiques De Maine De Biran, Volume 2 (French Edition)by Maine de BiranApologia Pro Vita Sua: The Conversion of Cardinal Newman (Unexpurgated Edition) (Halcyon Classics)by Cardinal NewmanThe Varieties Of Religious Experience: A Study In Human Natureby William JamesSlowly, very slowly, like two unhurried compass needles, the feet turned towards the right; north, north-east, east, south-east, south, south-south-west; then paused, and, after a few seconds, turned as unhurriedly back towards the left.

I still ask myself, was the author in the know? ......hmmmmpick it up....."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"To George Orwell (E.H. Blair)Wrightwood. Cal.21 October, 1949Dear Mr. Orwell,It was very kind of you to tell your publishers to send me a copy of your book......Thank you once again for the book.Yours sincerely,Aldous HuxleyThat is correct, George Orwell had one of the first copies of 1984 sent directly to Aldous Huxley. Why? one might ask. Precisely because of the inspiration that Orwell garnered from Huxley's Brave New World.BNW is really a post-apocalyptic, post-moral thriller in which genetic engineering has reached not only its apex but perfection. The five classes of humanity: Alphas, Betas, Gammas, Deltas, and Epsilons are engineered to complete their specific tasks and to be absolutely content in doing so. There is no strife in London: no hunger, no want, no emotion. Love is free and encouraged; irrational/emotional ties are non-existent since all humans are born in scientific labs known as hatcheries and, therefore, never even familiarize themselves with either the term or the concept of family.The protagonist in BNW is an Alpha man by the name of Bernard Marx. While he is an Alpha, he is undersized and ugly due to a mechanical error while he was still a fetus. His physical appearance causes an early disenchantment with the \\"perfect world\\" (I refuse to use the word \\"Utopia\\" since More's Utopia was a satirical look on a place which was trying to be perfect, yet was far from perfect...both points that many people either neglect or are completely ignorant of when throwing about the term) and he wanders through life both depressed and bored with the status quo.One day, Bernard is surprised when his love interest (yes, Bernard, due to a glitch still feels) Lenina Crowne decides to go on a date with him. He decides to take her to the savage reservation (New Mexico) to descry those humans who are still \\"natural\\"; not yet genetically modified. On this trip, Marx comes across a man named John who happens to be the son of a former Alpha from London who was lost on the reservation many years ago. Marx brings John back to London and is the object of immediate envy and fame.John however, is also the object of fame; yet, he cannot quite come to grips with this new and artificial society. He is quite uncomfortable with the norms, the lack of mores, and the lack of emotion. Finally, fed up with the prodding and the display, John decides he cannot handle this new London.Huxley deals with many quite advanced scientific issues in his 1932 novel. Genetic engineering, helicopter flight, psychiatric drugs, scientific behavioral training techniques, etc. and basically comes to the conclusion that without moral guidance and governance, science and technology can quickly become the surest path to hell on earth...albeit, a content and sedated hell experience.BNW continues to fascinate me (this was my second reading of it) and I am quite sure it will fascinate any and all readers who enjoy a novel that does more than just scratch the surface. It is a deep, complex, and at times perplexing read, but more than anything it is thrilling and enjoyable. A must read.For more book reviews and suggestions, please visit: http://www.theunemploymentbenefits.com"},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"When I first read Brave New World as a high school student in the late 1960's, it seemed like a very serious book to me. Later, I reread it as an adult when my own children were high school students. At that point I recognized the self-depreciating British sense of humor that Huxley employs. A good example is the scene where the Director lectures a group of budding younger professionals on a cloning technique used in their facility. Here you can also recognize the British pride in doing more with less:Beckoning to a fair-haired, ruddy young man who happened to be passing at the moment. \\"Mr. Foster,\\" he [the Director] called. The ruddy young man approached. \\"Can you tell us the record for a single ovary, Mr. Foster?\\"Sixteen thousand and twelve in this Centre,\\" Mr. Foster replied without hesitation. He spoke very quickly, had a vivacious blue eye, and took an evident pleasure in quoting figures. \\"Sixteen thousand and twelve; in one hundred and eighty-nine batches of identicals. But of course they've done much better,\\" he rattled on, \\"in some of the tropical Centres. Singapore has often produced over sixteen thousand five hundred; and Mombasa has actually touched the seventeen thousand mark. But then they have unfair advantages. You should see the way a negro ovary responds to pituitary! It's quite astonishing, when you're used to working with European material. Still,\\" he added, with a laugh (but the light of combat was in his eyes and the lift of his chin was challenging), \\"still, we mean to beat them if we can. I'm working on a wonderful Delta-Minus ovary at this moment. Only just eighteen months old. Over twelve thousand seven hundred children already, either decanted or in embryo. And still going strong. We'll beat then yet.\\"\\"That's the spirit I like!\\" cried the Director, and slapped Mr. Foster on the shoulder. \\"Come along with us and give the boys the benefit of your expert knowledge.\\""},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"This novel is set in A.F. 632 Approximately seven centuries after the twentieth century. A.F. stands for the year of Ford, named for the great industrialist Henry Ford who refined mass production techniques for automobiles. I liked the time period this took place and that it was names after henry ford. The world is ruled by World controllers who ensure the stability of society. To ensure social stability, a five-tiered caste system ruled by Alphas and Betas has been created. The labor force comes from the lower three castes, known as Gammas, Deltas, and Epsilons. I liked how the labor force came from the lower castes of society. A drug called soma ensures that no one ever feels pain or remains unhappy, and it is rationed out to and used by every member of the caste. Social stability is further ensured through the use of pre- and postnatal conditoning.I didn't like how the book opens with the director of the central london hatchery and conditioning centre giving a group of students a tour of the facilities. I thought they should have waited till later in the book. They view the various techniques for producing more babies and watch as babies are segregated into various castes. After the babies are decanted from their bottles they are conditioned. They use Hypnopaedia to teach the children ethics. I didn't like how they used this to teach them ethics. While the babies are asleep ,ethical phrases are played numerous times so that the phrases will become a subconscious part of the each person.The world controller of western europe, his fordship Mustapha Mond appears and gives the students a lecture about the way things used to be. Before the Utopian world was established, he indicates that people used to be parents and have children through live birth.This led to dirty homes and families in them where emotions got in the way of happiness and stabilty. I agreed with this.Bernard marx is introduced as a short, dark haired Alpha who is believed to have accidently recieved a dose of alcohol as a fetus. I didn't like how his coworkers talked about him in derogatory tones. Bernard had a crush on lenina Crowne and she informs the reader that he asked her to go with him to the Savage Reservations serval weeks earlier. Lenina has been dating Henry Ford Foster for the past serval months ,but since long term relationships are discouraged , she agrees to go with Bernard Marx to the Reservations. I liked that she made this descision."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"I read the book 'Island,' also by Huxley, and loved it. So I picked up this one, heard it was a classic. Couldn't agree more. The ending was a bit confusing, though. What was with the feet? Anyway, it was great. A real timeless masterpiece, whatever that is. It definitely made me think. If I was the savage in that book, would I choose that horrible civilization where babies are made in bottles, or would I too go off and live in a lighthouse? This isn't a book that is easily forgotten, and I think that is the reason that it is still popular after all these years.P.S.

There is no love, no mother, no God. Instead, all praise goes to Ford and the only measure of like or dislike is the dislike higher castes have for those beneath them. All totalled, Brave New World is like most dystopian novels with the exception that, unlike most, it is hauntingly close to reality (as is also the case with another great dystopian novel, Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury)."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"I was not blown away like many other reviewers with this one. This tale of a frighenly perfect future world has its moments, and there are many of them, but overall I don't ran it with the best of the Future Shock type books. It was hard to find a character to like, as they were all so sterile from theyr future conditioning. Perhaps that was one of the points, if so, fine. But it makes for a dull read. The whole explanation of how things got like they are was done very well, with the teacher giving his lessons, and the lockerroom conversations going on all at once. I wish something similar to that technique could have happened more often. Overall, its a good book worth reading, it just doesn't pack the wight of a 1984 or Lord of the Flies."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"I think it's exiting to read a book from 1932, because it shows the fears of that time.

It tells the story of a utopia in the future, manufactured children, reconditioning, and simply of human nature. Aldous Huxley does an amazing job at taking such an advanced topic and making it seem somewhat real. I was disturbed by Brave New World, but also fascinated. His characters are developed to the perfect degree, and while eloquent in his words, he is also readable."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Of all the great Dystopian novels of the 20th century (others being Orwell's 1984, Zamyatin's We, Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 for example), this may be the most accurate, if not the greatest. Huxley describes a world based totally on material values, shamelessly hedonistic but also totalitarian in demanding total submission to its ethic. Such a place brain-washes its children and gives its adults large doses of drugs to maintain stability. Into this world, there comes the Savage, who has lived on an Indian reservation all his life. We see the horror of this world through his eyes. Rather improbably (but Huxley makes it seem natural) the Savage knows all of Shakespeare by heart, but the rawness and lyricism of the poetry makes a wonderful counterpoint to the cosiness and mediocrity of the Brave New World, where all pain and ugliness have been banished. A typical episode in the Brave New World is a 'religious' service, with Henry Ford as 'God', which ends in an orgy of sexual release. The Savage falls in love (as opposed to lust, which is the only intimate emotion allowed between men and women), tries to escape, but is ultimately destroyed. Like 1984, Huxley may have made his Dystopia too bleak - apparently there are islands to which dissenters are exiled, and it may be that on these islands, people have managed to combine the materialism of the Brave New World and the primitive spititualism of the Savage. We never find out. However, no one can escape being struck by the similarity of the Brave New World to own - Prozac, daytime TV, dumbing down, test-tube babies all have parallels in Huxley's creation. Read one of the century's great classics."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"this is the greatest book i have ever read.. i voted for it as book of the century.. don't hesitate to read this book.."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"After checking out this book because I'd heard it compared on the same level as Orwell's 1984, Brave New World was a dreadful disappointment. Why people think it's so great, I'd really like to know. Maybe I missed something. But to me, it seemed like a great premise that never went anywhere. It completely fizzled and died about 2/3 of the way through. Huxley couldn't decide what storyline he wanted to use, and finally picked the silliest, most childish one. He also had trouble figuring out which of his characters was the protagonist. First it was Lenina, then it was her lover (I forget his name), then it was the &quot;savage&quot;, and so forth. So, yes, Huxley and Orwell have written books with similar ideas. The only difference between the two is that Orwell carries off his storyline in a mature and captivating manner, like a true writer."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Few have read Huxley's Brave New World, and fewer have commented on its deep insight in the nature of science and politics. Although Orwell's 1984 is much like Brave New World in its political implications, Huxley has managed to show how science and the &quot;need to progress&quot; are used as means of controlling society. In this text, there is a deep sense of oppression arising from the strict rules and mentality of society. Genetic engineering is the norm and thus, the distiny of each individual is determined from birth. The difference is that this &quot;destiny&quot; is determined not by an omnipotent God, but by the scientists and the policy - makers who run the world. The novel goes further by depicting the &quot;enlightenment&quot; of one who refuses to accept the rigid stigma of the society. He enters an Indian settlement on the outskirts of the city, and is shocked to see the &quot;barbarism&quot; of the people there.In an attempt to understand the people, Max, the protagonist of the book, becomes confused and depressed and finally commits suicide. The Brave New World has taken its toll on Max but the world continues. Perhaps, this can be seen as a criticism of the &quot;Brave New World&quot; of America, and the disillusionment of its society. This is an essential read for those who really want to know the politics of science and the science of politics."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Brave New World is full of interesting ideas, from an embryo production centres and \\"hypnopaedia\\" to encouragement of promiscuity and partying for social stability. But it doesn't have a plot to put it all together. It only creates a world but not a story. And the ending is so anticlimatic that after the ending, when one turns the page, one thinks \\"That's it?!\\". However, it is the only complete science fiction book I've read, because it has scientific, political, and philosophical ideas, all together.I'd reccommend 1984 more than this book."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Aldous Huxley wrote Brave New World to illustrate how society can go wrong. It was a very good book, and pretty well written. I believe that it deserves four stars. In the book, everyone was pre-conditioned to think what the leaders of society wanted them to think, and to work unconditionally. They are kept happy with drugs and entertainment. It is, in essence, a journey back to the dark ages, where slaves and serfs are plentiful, disguised as the glorious advancement of society.When Huxley wrote the book in 1932, it was seen as a far-sighted prediction. Now, this horrible future could be awaiting us just around the corner. This book contains many parallels to modern life. Just as in the book, religion has almost been eliminated from public life, and replaced with total materialism. Now, everyone in the industrialized world worships themselves. In the book, every human baby is cloned, grown in bottles, and sleep-conditioned in the ways of society. We have already started down that perilous path. We may have already cloned the first human baby, and DNA engineering is not far off. Will this be the fate of our future? Only time will tell.Overall, my impression of Huxley's book is that it is a very good work. It is very accurate and reasonably well written, although I believe he stressed unimportant things at times. On the whole, it was a very thought-provoking novel. I had a hard time putting it down."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Much has been conjectured about the prospect of Utopia. Moreover, the lack of it is equally puzzling. Since the 1930s, not much progress has been made in way of a Second Eden. The slightest petty annoyance would have to be solved through the instantaneous release of popping a pill, for even mild societal upset would never do in Paradise and only sprout anarchical roots. Soma is the direct remedy to this conundrum, as Huxley readily admits, the benign and needle-free heroine guaranteeing a variety of \\"Life Lite\\" for dieters abstaining from reality. Huxley's experiences recorded in both \\"Heaven and Hell\\" and \\"The Doors of Perception\\" later detail the groundwork. Happiness, ever elusive, may only be achieved by its allusion; nominally, to convince people they are happy indeed. Hypnopaedia has potential for effectiveness certainly, provided that the opposers, sub-groups, etc. are gradually wiped out. \\"Benito\\" is doubtlessly a reference to Mussolini, a foreshadow of the coming day, heralding Communism, Socialism, and the other world powers attempting to achieve the mantra \\"everybody belongs to everybody else\\". Lenina Crowne offers the slightly questioning character representative of the reader who silently questions social strategy, but isn't so concerned as to miss her next Recreation Party.Moreover, why do readers accept Huxley's Utopia when it has not been fulfilled in its nearly seventy years of preemptory discussion? For the same reason it interests them; the grass is perpetually greener on the other side of the proverbial fence, though where that boundary shall be drawn remains yet unknown. It is fulfilled in a sense by the act of reading itself. Helen Keller is correct in surmising that literature is utopia, though it may be more accurately described as a form of self-indulgent urban escapism. Literature itself is able to assume the unattainable perfection of daily life that our reality lacks. It pretends no circumstance is too outrageous or too wonderful, seamlessly binding the tragic and the impossibly good. We accept these ethereal musings because they are fiction, the figment of another tangible human being's roving imagination, thus fulfilling our own. We yearn to believe that a perfect society on earth has the potential of existence, if only for those few vacuous moments on the written page. Literature isolates the wishful thinking of all men: that the abstract qualities of perfection are somehow physically attainable. Imagine for a moment the magnitude of a utopia. The world might be perfect, but would the human race be perfect in it?The answer lies in the greatest works of fiction themselves, generally a resounding negation which only reaffirms the basic engenderment of reality. In the beginning, we're enamored with a new book, uncracked spine, smelling of fresh ink and Starbuck's coffee. We eagerly fall into someone else's world like Alice down the white rabbit's hovel, stealing away in our spare minutes to turn a few pages during the lulls of the day, and become progressively more or less enchanted as the story climaxes to a turn of events which we may or may not approve, a hermetic passion demanding sacrificial comfortable chairs and adequate lighting, the occasional pair of gold rimmed spectacles. Sooner or later, at the average approximation of four hundred pages, the book will end. The reader's opinion will have been formed, usually summarized to the effect of \\"solid plot, poetic storytelling, mediocre ending\\", in laymen's terms. And the vicious circle, half price and half satisfying, begins anew with Oprah's latest selection of the month. In the volumes of critically acclaimed paperbacks, record breaking bestsellers, and classic works \\"of epic and timeless proportion\\" printed on cheap paper, lies the infinite potential of a fruitful quest, another chance at positively locating, identifying, and yielding our particular yen. Throughout history, the unanimous craving for a happy ending is the only enduring theme not available at your local caf&eacute;/book nook, leaving the reader hungry for more than one volume's words of wisdom, but one hundred and one prospective opportunities of recognizing life's essence in black and white.Moreover, the act of reading fine literature, short stories, or even the daily novelty of the newspaper, vaguely fulfills a nostalgia greater than ourselves. An inherent and indefinable necessity of mankind is the purpose of belonging. Idealistically, one reads the soul of the writer through his work, presuming he has any talent whatsoever. Be his ephemerally fated topic the romantic wooing of literature's immortalized Romeo and Juliet, the magic realism constituent of tumultuous but certain joy in the Buendia\` family's solitude, or the fully recyclable, daily disposable, read-it-once-and-throw-it-away newspaper heading informing the world of some great event no one had considered yesterday. Life's daily joys and sorrows stew in a common melting pot, a recipe from a cookbook with cosmopolitan ingredients equally enjoyed by citizens of the world, a base point from which strangers may understand each other.The reader's vocabulary is enriched, temporarily infused with the colorful expressions enumerated by a geographically diverse writer. His mind expands to another part of the world, guided along the cobbled streets of Medieval England, the worn footpaths of Macondo past Catarino's store on the Street of the Turks, the back alleys of Boston's Lower West Side or Germany's East End. In the quietude of one's own home, in the universal hubbub of the rush hour, a secondary entelechy is obtainable in an 11x8 inch square, not unlike a withdrawn office cubicle where the world makes sense because of a laptop and a corporate policy manual, but thanks to the benevolence of the author and Cliff's Notes. As proclaimed on an amazon.com bookmark, according to Christopher Morley, \\"When you sell a man a book, you don't sell him twelve ounces of paper and ink and glue - you sell him a whole new life\\".Or at least, the prospect of a Brave New World."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"\\"Brave New World\\" is a classic that is often limited to the belief that our present society is slipping or has slipped into this futuristic world.Huxley made a major error in presuming that mankind can ever agree enough on any one thing to form a new world order. Democrats and Republicans disagree on whether the sun rises in the east or the west. The expectation that nations would surrender their sovereignty is unrealistic.The only possibility of a new world order is an even more frightening...a \\"brave new world order of Islam\\" without the benefit of science."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Just having finished A Brave New World I am writing this review. The book is about a society where everybody is made in a factory and are brainwashed from day one to think how the government wants them to. Then a boy from the outside and is brought into this world that he doesn't like. He hopes that he will show people that living this way isn't right. I thought that A Brave New World was a great prediction about how Aldous Huxley thought this world would be like one day based upon the trends of politics and technology. The technology that is presented in A Brave New World is almost what technology is today. The way people live their lives is extremely close to how we live our lives in today's society. For the most part I enjoy reading this book, but some parts of it were either just confusing or were not detailed enough. I feel the Aldous Huxley was a smart man, but lacked in his ability to write. Aldous Huxley has written six other books that have been very popular. So, in conclusion I thought that this book was good, but I feel that the writing lack at little bit."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Have you ever imagined what the world would be like in the future? Aldous Huxley gives you a scary glimpse into his future in the novel Brave New World. He describes a world that is so remotely bizarre, it's almost unbelievable. This thrilling saga is an example of the serious science fiction that examines the darker side of the changes in the twentieth century.The book quickly caught my attention when it boldly described how babies were born, or rather decanted, in the laboratory. The scientists of the future used a procedure known as the Bokanovsky process. One female human egg can be made into 96 children on average, all of them completely identical in feature, form, and brainpower. When the babies are \\"decanted\\", they immediately get classified into a caste. The caste system consists of Alphas, Betas, Gammas, Deltas, and Epsilons, each caste having subcategories ranging from Minus to Plus.Throughout the novel, Huxley describes everyday circumstances in which these people take part. For example, the standard movie theater has been replaced with special presentations called \\"feelies\\", a type of moving picture that will give actual physical stimulation comparable to what the characters in the \\"movie\\" would be feeling. Spearmint gum has given way to sex hormone chewing gum- the favorite of one of Huxley's minor characters, Benito Hoover. The population eats grams of soma, a non-hangover-producing drug, every single day. The development of the soma was quite intriguing. In the civilization, Soma became not only a thing to add to life, but in fact the only reason for living. The idea of God has been dissolved to make way for their choice of worship, Ford, and his book \\"My Life and Work\\" has become the new Bible.Brave New World is Aldous Huxley's predictions of the result of a completely organized society, the scientific caste system, the abolition of free will by systematic conditioning. The people take regular doses of chemically induced happiness, and nightly courses of sleep-teaching called hypnopaedia.This book made me take a step back and question reality. The entire time I read the book, I wondered if the world could actually fully function in the way the book depicts. In today's society, we believe that prosperity is more important that happiness, that working hard for success in life is the ultimate goal. In Brave New World, Huxley shows how it might be if people began to think differently, but perhaps he shows which way of life society might already be falling towards."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Huxley's &quot;Brave New World&quot; depicts the world as some leftists aspire it to become: it is composed of a World Government that determines what our destinies will be at birth, conditioning them to be that, repressing religion, all concept of God, science, family, art, etc., all in attempt to squash the reality of truth or perception of difference among others. It is, in short, a socialist Utopia whereby all people and things are engineered to be equal. Huxley's portrait is terrifying in that it is not all that far-fetched. Entire institutions are based on such concepts, and Huxley portrays the characters here as fully in-tune and accepting to this reality. The lone exeption is, ironically, a character Huxley names &quot;the Savage,&quot; a Native American who, despite a lack of formal education, raises serious questions about the Brave New World, leading to tragic consequences.&quot;Brave New World&quot; is a bit disturbing at times, but forces the reader to think and see the world differently. It is indeed a book that changes one's view of government and people, and appears to remind us that it is government that serves people and not the other way around."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Aldous Huxley is an intelligent person. He has a back-round in psychology. This becomes very apparent in a Brave New World. The use of psychological evidence and theories makes the story interesting and at another level. It pulls this novel away from the rest of your typical Sci-Fi writings. Psychology is seen in the opening scene, with Bernard's life, and with customs.In the opening scene in the novel, there is a tour that takes place. It is not only a tour for the students in the novel, but for the reader as well. This is a formal operations style of learning for the reader. He or she is learning as they read. During the tour, the reader is introduced to the learning process of the offspring. The people of the Central London Hatchery and Conditioning Centre use Ivan Pavlov's Classical Conditioning. The use of an unconditioned stimulus (flowers) lead to the kids to be happy. Than a conditioned stimulus (very loud and frightening bell) lead the children to a controlled reaction of being frightened of flowers. After time and time again, the children pick up the unconditioned reaction of being frightened of flowers and screaming. This shows that the offspring can be conditioned to serve just about any purpose.Bernard's life has many psychological principals involved. His life shows the cruelty of society as well. He is an outcast due to his physical stature. There is no acceptance for someone like this in this world. He turns to a cult. He still feels very much like an outcast. Bernard is struggling in an early stage of crisis. He is much to old for it. Bernard is struggling in Erik Erikson's Identity V.S. Role Confusion. He needed to make an identity for himself, but was unable to.The customs of Brave New World much different as those of today. They use a social approach of psychology to live there lives. Also, a behavioristic approach is taken.The social approach of cultural differences is different, but also the same. We have God, they have Ford. We both worship, but two very different things. The cultural differences have changed into the world found in the novel. Behaviorism gets involved with the surroundings. The environment that the children are brought up in, will make them who they are for the rest of their lives. It is a situation that could realistically occur.The opening scene of classical conditioning shapes the reader for the rest of the novel. It gives a sense of direction and knowledge for the life forms in the novel. Bernard's life of being an outsider makes him fit his role in the novel. The customs of the novel follow a psychological order to make the novel. Huxley has a very familiar back-round in psychology."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"This is an incredible novel of world-shattering truth. Although Huxley&#8217;s prophecy might seem a bit over-exaggerated on the external side, the internal moral is one that our society today should pay heed to. At the time that Huxley wrote this novel, he foresaw our society becoming increasingly materialistic to the point where, as he shows with the overuse of soma, people would block out their emotions and pain by turning to methods once considered immoral (such as sexual promiscuity or the use of drugs). This society would be one in which moral values would change to fit the people&#8217;s current needs, thereby making religion seem an unnecessary thing of the past.His most important point, however, is the fact that through our need to continuously fulfill our materialistic desires, we will lose all sense of being. That which makes us human&#8212;-the ability to feel love, and to be free&#8212;-will be taken away because we will no longer be able (or even willing) to tell what is false from what is reality. Although the citizens of Huxley&#8217;s new world might think they are truly happy, they never really have a chance to know what happiness is. The image that they are given is one of being constantly high on soma, and being carefree and relaxed. After all, &#8220;One cubic centimeter [of soma] cures ten gloomy sentiments&#8221; (Huxley 54).The inner-lying truth of this novel is somewhat hard to accept in a society like ours, because materialism is so prevalent, and &#8220;keeping up with the Joneses&#8221; has become almost a nationwide competition. What we need to keep in mind is exactly what Huxley tries to warn us of; a desire to always have and be the best can very easily turn against us, and will be our ruin if we do not maintain a sense of morality and humility.This is a book that everyone should read. I guarantee that it will have a profound impact on the lives of its readers."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"This past summer I asked my closest friends to give me a list of the \\"best books they ever read\\", or at the least books that had the greatest impact on their lives. Thanks for this one guys! Today, in our time, talk of gentics and embryo meddling is common. I mean, we have all heard of cell splitting, cloning, and Dolly. This is nothing new. Aldous Huxley wrote his futuristic horror of gene meddling in 1932! The man must have been a genius!Huxley's story is his idea of what our future holds as he looks around himself way back in 1932. In 1932 many new inventions and ideas were sprouting so fast, it must have been a marvel to witness. Possibly the means to writing this somewhat horrific tale? In this book time begins with \\"the Year of Our Ford\\". Everything before that time is not considerable to the book's characters. In the year of our Ford...humans are grown in bottles. There is no natural birth, no marriages, and no special schooling and intellect needed to find your place and rightful job. We are a collection of rotating bottles in a gene \\"hatchery\\" lab. At certain levels some genes are mutated to produce different kinds of babies. Babies are cared for in the lab and fed subliminal messages until they are old enough to live on their own. Sex is merely a necessary act for these people, not ever for procreation. Some babies are born gifted, others less intellectual. The mutation of the embryos and the resulting child are how humans become sorted into their own social caste. Each cast of people have designated jobs and also, matching clothes. For instance, If you were lucky enough to be born an Alpha, you would wear green and have a decent job. You accept this because of your conditioning at the \\"center\\". If you were born an unlucky Delta-Minus, you would be unintelligent and become a sort of \\"worker-bee\\" and wear black.The Center, that creates and conditions these babies has a motto...\\"COMMUNITY, IDENTITY, and STABILITY\\". They seem to have it all figured out. Everyone is pre-destined for their place in the world. Huxley's fantasy future goes a little awry when a natural born adult (who grew up in a \\"zoo\\" because childbirth is so \\"dirty\\" and \\"ancient\\") escapes from his habitat and ventures into this \\"Brave New World\\". A fabulous twist to the almost psychotic stability of our future.(?)What will this \\"feak\\" man do and think of the new world? The answer is the answer to many questions we all have as we read this classic tale of our worse nightmares come true. We are the natural man, reading this book. We are just on-lookers into the world he braves to enter. Huxley forces us to be the \\"Freak\\" and feel the pain of what might be to come. I gave this book only four stars because while it is a fabulous tale, it lacks as a page-turner. I agree that it must be very informative for people in 1932 to understand the concept of genetics, but for a modern reader the pages of details can become irritating. Nevertheless, I wished I had read this one in High School."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"This book is inevitably compared to 1984, with good reason. But this book lags behind 1984 in the literary sense.Make no mistake. Huxley was a genius. He was far ahead of his time and had many ideas about the future that have become real. But the problem with the book is his writing.Orwell is such a fantastic writer that, while you shudder at the bleak vision he has for the world, you become more interested in the characters of the book. Huxley's characters are just props. Huxley felt like sharing his ideas, but he couldn't just write about them. It seems like he just inserted the characters in so that there would actually be some in the book. Without good characters, a book seriously lags. If Huxley had just been a better writer, the book would be worthy of the comparisons to 1984 that it always recieves."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"This book demonstrates the current errors in our ways as humans and our &quot;pursuit of happiness.&quot; All the time we continually make things better and try to make our lives easier, and generally only the lucky few of us get to enjoy these things. Brave New World is about a book in which humans are cloned into their social castes and are to either live a working life or an easy life in which there is no point but happiness. The lower classes are subdued by &quot;perfect&quot; drugs. This book will open your eyes and make you look at the current seperation between rich and poor and hopefully help you understand the serious implications it might have. It will prove to you that there really is no such thing as a perfect world."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"It was one of the most fascinating and intriguing books Ive ever read. There are two depths to this story and I dont mean intellectual, but rather you can decide to coast it and bounce from place to place accepting or you can pick the people you like and the ones you dont. Either way is perfectly fine, but it gives one different perspectives I beleive. I did both, choosing to side with some and dislike others but ultimately to tag along with the story and watch it. It is probably the weirdest yet most accurate thing I have ever read. The reality of it is frightening, and truthfully I hope the human society never reaches such a level. A human race laced with cold emotionless joy, nothing to fear (which is a defining factor in each of us) life carries itself it out with no point. Only a few who are considered essentially odd and one who has not been brought up in this terrifying surrounding but rather in the &quot;inferrior&quot; native culture can recognize any fault with society (which incidentally is the only reason this system works - every one is happy with it because there isnt any other way). It is almost to weird to read but its not really and if followed, it proves both margianally disatsifying but utterly rewarding."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Brave New World has to be one of the greatest books I have ever fell across. However, this is not because it is action packed or any other such nonsense that make up modern best sellers. The book does have it's own unique suspense, but it really shines in it's analysis of human desires. Imagine a world that's perfect. People who perform grunt labor are happy with their jobs, and everybody loves everybody. Childhood education consists of something right out of Rousseau's Emile, and subconcious repitition is used to smooth out any uncertanties. But, as this book points out, what if these uncertanties aren't always smoothed out, and classic literature is destroyed because it is &quot;old and has no modern use.&quot; This book shows us how gratification of our desires is only a temporary opiate, and that it is not worth giving up our sacrifices."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Want to point out a misconception embedded in the review written below. The message of this classic is exactly what the reviewer thinks it is NOT saying. Huxley's point is that the way of life of the &quot;Brave New World&quot; doesn't work, doesn't accord with human dignity or a general ethic that values individuality, doesn't work with a natural human life (as represented by the Native American hero). In the book, he wrestles with how to solve that problem without consigning people to poverty ridden, miserable existences. The worry that society was heedlessly and without forethought turning into the sort of society portrayed was exactly Huxley's worry.This book, used properly is a valuable aid to teaching a number of subjects. As a medical ethicist, I often use it to get college students to see what the moral dilemmas surrounding reproductive and genetic technologies are. I've also seen it used in courses about technology and society. As a piece of writing, it should be clear that this can be used more generally as an example of clear prose, a critique of socialism/totalitarianism/communism, or a political commentary on what a good human life is and ought to be.I'm very concerned that this error is being made in the course of an honors English class (regardless of whether the error was made by student, teacher, or both). The student who wrote the review should find out somehow - through a teacher or other resource - what the book is actually about.It's an enjoyable and thought-provoking read."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Brave New World is a classic science fiction which forecast a future world with its World State's motto being COMMUNITY, IDENTITY, STABILITY.

I'm really awfully glad I'm a Beta, because I don't work so hard. And then we are much better than the Gammas and Deltas. Gammas are stupid. They all wear green, and Delta children wear khaki. Oh no, I don't want to play with Delta Children. And Epsilons are still worse. They are too stupid to be able....&quot;This book was written in 1932. It still has its impact.

Okay, he has a very strong message, but then, his writing skills are non-existent. This book completely lacks fantasy and originality. As a result, the possible appeal of Mr. Huxley's ideas is overweighed in a hundredfold by the despise his &quot;prose&quot; (sorry for using this word here!) makes you feel. How is one supposed to enjoy the beauty of a wonderful landscape by a scribble of a three-year-old? Instead of this &quot;novel&quot;, Mr. Huxley should have written a short newspaper article titled &quot;Things I Don't Like&quot;.If Mr. Huxley is a writer, anybody who talks is a linguist. Reading this book leaves one perplexed - how could the author voluntarily expose himself to such ridicule?"},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"This order was GREAT!Collier County, Florida -- Have you heard the one about a homeowner foreclosing on a bank?Well, it has happened in Florida and involves a North Carolina based bank.Instead of Bank of America foreclosing on some Florida homeowner, the homeowners had sheriff's deputies foreclose on the bank.It started five months ago when Bank of America filed foreclosure papers on the home of a couple, who didn't owe a dime on their home.I will do more shopping with AMAZON!"},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"I had read this book as a required reading in college (many years ago) and I had forgotten how dismal I thought it was back then. My view has not changed. It give credence to the suggestion that a group of monkies hammering away at a bevy of typewriters could somehow produce a work of this sort. It appears that Huxley simply entered random words on paper as they popped up in his brain(?). Brave New Worlds, indeed.I would suggest reading Mad Magazine instead."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Brave New World is boring at the beginning, but it becomes more interesting later. I wouldn't recommend the book for everyone because it is very suggestive. I am reading it in my senior English class. This book has so much immorality that it shouldn't be allowed in schools. The book has good points and reveals problems in any society, but that doesn't mean that just because it is educational that it should be used in a school setting. I would suggest that if the book would interest someone they may want to read it on their own time, and not for a school class."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"After reading &quot;1984&quot; twice, with great interest, I was enthusiastic about another wonderfully horrible anti-Utopian novel. But I was really disappointed with BNW, supposedly the fifth greatest modern novel. The science-talk was too bulky and lengthy and very little of it contributed to the story. The characters failed to capture my interest, leaving me totally apathetic toward them and their trials. Their catchphrases (&quot;Oh, Ford!&quot; and the many subconsciously-learned rhymes especially) were important to the characterizations but became very annoying after a while. At times the quality of the text dropped notably, well below anything I'd consider to be of any literary value. Often at these points the characters, events, and time periods involved became very difficult to discern. The plot was interesting but stretched to its absolute limits, laboriously squeezing every last drop out of the concept. Since this is required reading for high school seniors, I had no choice. Had free will been involved, I would have put this away after the first twenty-five pages or so. I don't understand why this work is acclaimed at all, never mind so highly. But this is of course only my opinion... please don't send me any hate-mail."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Bought for a school assignment.

I personalilty prefer books that does not bring fiction to such a high degree, and is more realistic.If you are thinking about wether or not to read the book then think about this. What movie would you rather watch? The Matrix, Praties of the Carrdein or any SCI FCI movies? or The Itian Job, Ocean 12, and action movies? If you chosed Matrix then you should read this book.

It focuses on a discontent man, Bernard Marx, in a world where everyone is content, a man who asks questions and does things that are not socially acceptable, yet in the end, he does nothing.In Brave New World, set in the year 632 After Ford (2540 in our world) almost all of the human population of Earth lives under a system known as the world state, which uses a tightly controlled caste system, predestination for each individual, and brings up children in ways that can only be described as brainwashing. The only ones who live outside the control of the World State are groups of 'savages', living in reservation areas like Mexico- or New Mexico, whatever- and the Falkland Islands. I started to hate this book and the society it contains in a scene early in the book, in which infants are presented with books and flowers, and are given non-lethal but nonetheless very painful doses of electricity when they take a positive interest in them.This book presents us with a world that makes me cringe with horror every time I turn a page. A drug called soma takes you on a mental vacation, making you happy- why bother fixing your problems when you can just get high?- people are born in hatcheries, mother and father are dirty words, Sigmund Freud is Jesus, and Henry Ford is God.I seriously doubt that Henry Ford had ever intended for the world to look like this. The man was ignorant and probably egotistical in some ways, but few men have ever been so madly obsessed with power and their own ego as to seek to replace God with their own name. It may not have even been Ford's idea, but he still served as an inspiration to the wrong kind of people.But back to our, um, hero, Bernard Marx, an Alpha who is not as happy with the current system as everyone else. He doesn't spend every minute of the day in a group of people, and he doesn't sleep with every woman in town. He also uses soma much less frequently. He even goes to a village in New Mexico to see the so-called 'savages' himself, bringing back John the Savage, son of his boss, the Director of Hatcheries, causing him to resign out of shame and humiliation. I would not call Bernard Marx a hero- he has some of the makings of a hero in the story, especially in a work of dystopian fiction; he feels out of place, asks questions, and God or, um, Ford forbid, he even *thinks*. But what else does he do? In a nutshell, he acts on his unhappiness, goes to New Mexico, brings back a savage, makes his boss resign, and lives the high life until John and subsequently society reject him for the corrupt, repulsive fellow he is. What kind of hero is that?Fahrenheit 451, a much better book with a similar featured government and main character, ends with the main character, Guy Montag, escaping the city he lives in and joining a group of people who have entire books memorized, keeping those books safe until the extremely anti-intellectual government is overthrown, and seeing it attacked and destroyed by foreign aircraft with nuclear weapons. Guy Montag, in short, does exactly what Bernard Marx should have done but did not and could not, and the government in Fahrenheit 451 meets the very end that the World State in Brave New World deserved to.But no.The book ends with John the Savage hanging himself after whipping himself and the woman he has become attracted to, and the people of London and myself were briefly united in standing there at the end, wondering just what the point was and why any of it mattered. I cannot think of when I have disliked the overall story and ending of a book more."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"So anyways, I picked this book up thinking it would be an interesting tale about the future and totalitarianism. While it was about that, I found it difficult to find a plot. Aldous Huxley kind of rambles for a hundred pages, and then he introduces what then becomes the main character, Mr. Savage. He then quickly wraps it up in a crazy crazy way that was not at all what I expected it to be like. Normally surprises are good, but this was one of the crappiest books I have ever read, good night."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"This science fiction novel seemed to lack the credibility of many other sci-fi books around now. Huxley's incredibly boring and unrelatable characters gave me the urge to yell &quot;STOP WHINGING!&quot;"},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"The thought of God not being part of todays society would be almost absurd to those, and the thought of a man such as Ford, being referred to as God would be almost even more absurd. Huxley creates a vision of a perfect society. Where man plays God, and produces people in assembly lines, just as Henry Ford did. Shows how Karl Marx's theories were taken to their extremes and shows how Fascism could not work without some sacrifice. And above all shows the importance of human will, self consciousness, and the importance of liberty and freedom.This book should be shared with all of those who are interested. Because it shares knowledge, its shares more than knowledge, it shares wisdom about humanity, and about what we take for granted.This book is a must for avid readers."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"An excellent exploration of the human condition and a superb prophecy on the possible future of society. Strange and almost frightening at times, the plot is not fast flowing but rather an examination of the main character's emotions and opinions on society. A thought-provoking and philosophical book, Aldous Huxley's Brave New World is deep and meaningful. Whether looking for an interesting read to relax or a somber and philosophical view on the human condition, Brave New World will provide what you are looking for."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Before looking up info on the book, I thought it must have been written during the hippie era, warning about what might happen if the government took control of our lives. The book is insightful, the characters' thoughts and feelings changing dramatically over the course of the story. The characters start out satisfied with their lives in \\"civilization\\", where humans no longer have to deal with sexual reproduction---babies are made in factories, and there are distinct ranks and advantages among the people as they grow older. Upon meeting more people, and experiencing more of the so-called uncivilized section of the world, the characters begin to wonder if \\"civilized society\\" is as great as it is supposed to be...Also very thought-provoking, as it explores a world none of us have ever known, and probably don't want to know."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"I read this book as a teen-ager and was constantly putting it down because it was making me so nervous. I saw even then, at a young age, how possible it was for this world to become a reality. How many people try to lose themselves in drugs, alcohol, meaningless TV? We are closer to this Brave New World than we like to admit. Can this insanity our world is headed toward be stopped? I don't know but I fear that Huxley understood the human conditon all too well. We believe everything we hear on TV or read in the newspapers. Too many of us have left our intelligence and perception at the door. Wake up before it is too late and think for yourself. There was a version of Brave New World with Leonard Nimoy which presented a sort of happy ending for two people, which did not occur in the book but still leaves the Brave New World untouched. I won't say too much about John \\"the Savage\\" who was more human than the rest of the population but he is the mirror Huxley uses to show us how barren and sterile this Brave New World is. A place where every word can be uttered except mother and father. Children are born in laboratories. The family unit has been disassembled with all loyalty going to the state. As frightening as it is, it a must read for those who want to understand what is happening now and how easily it can happen. The question becomes: do we rule technology or do we allow it to rule us?"},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"I read this book when I was 15 (and have repeatedly read it since) and it is one of the books that shaped my world.

It occured to me recently that although I seemed to feel somewhere in my bones that this statement was true, I hadn't read the book for over six years and couldn't even remember the name of the main character. That being said, having recently devoured Aldous Huxley's landmark novel &quot;Brave New World&quot;, I must most empahtically again declare that this is one of THE MOST IMPORTANT BOOKS I'VE EVER READ!What makes a book important? I think it has something to do with how well its themes and sentiments resonate with the world you experience from day to day. A quantity measured only by how many more truths you can see in unexpected places like the news, the grocery store, or a conversation around the water bubbler. &quot;A Brave New World&quot;, though written at the beginning of the century, seems to have been written with a vision and a penetrating lesson for today.The world described in Huxley's account is streamlined by science and technology, driven by open-ended corporate goals, and carried on the backs of a populace socially-trained from birth to continue an existence without question or meaning. It's a world shackled by a facism with no face or name. Contrary to Orwell's visions of a future entrapped by the ever-present 'Big Brother', Huxley's version of slavery is one enforced by ignorance and pleasure. A theme that seems well-suited to the comfortably worked, television-encased, numbed to violence and tradgedy, pill-popping, bacteria petri-dish America that exists today. It's impossible to read this book without seeing even some of his most outrageous symbolism come alive in the reality of today. To say it is a book that resonates is an understatement. To say that it is an important read is necessary."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Instead of getting into the details of the book, which can be read in any other review, I think it is better not to even begin to speak about the plot and structure, and simply say the following words: THIS BOOK IS A WONDERFUL, THOUGHT-PROVOKING NOVEL.

Bernard is somewhat short for his caste, alpha-plus's are tall and in charge since they were bred and conditioned to be so. But Bernard looks past this, and his loneliness increases is ever wearying thought of the world around him. I enjoyed this book and I'm sure any young adult in search of &quot;piece of mind&quot; will enjoy it too."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"If you like science fiction books then you have to read this. Brave new world is about what would happen if our world got too controlling. It takes place on earth but a different earth that we can't really comprehend. Imagine that you have been \\"conditioned\\" from birth to like or dislike a certain thing to fit you social station. Imagine all of the people who have been born in the way that we know today are sent to a reservation, and that your only source of happiness was a drug called soma. Imagine that erotic play was normal for children as young as five and that those who do not participate in it are considered abnormal. All of those things are defiantly hard to imagine but Aldous Huxley brings them to life in this book of control, freedom and rebellion. I would give this book five stars but there is one reason why it does not quite disserve it and that is the ending. It seems like Huxley had a dead line to meet so he just ended the book with the simplest way he knew how. Although I suggest you read it for your self, who knows, maybe you'll like the end....."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Aldous Huxley's book is a strange encounter with a world that is not completely unlike our own. Many of the things that we do in our society are leading up to the events in Huxley's book, making it strangely prophetic, but at the same time not absolute. The distorted cloning of humans doesn't need to happen, but very well could.The most interesting thing throughout the novel is the utopian theme. Though the setting created by Huxley is a weird, doped up world, the people there all (think) they are truly happy. Well, almost all of them. John, having grown up outside of the utopian society, doesn't understand the values instilled by cloning or by using soma.Even though this book was written in 1931, it remains thought provoking; maybe even more so since some of the things discussed in Huxley's books are immeninent. We can clone sheep, who says we can't clone humans? We drug kids just to stay in their seats at school with ritilin, who isn't to say that we could all be taking soma in a few years, to \\"raise productivity?\\" More and more our society is becomming less about the individual and more about the collective, but not in a benign sense. People are measured by productivity. In Europe, they still have extended \\"holidays,\\" when American workers are lucky to have a job with paid vacation.Though I hope that our world will never be the brave new world that Huxley envisioned, I think that some of the warning signs that were clear to him in 1931 should only be more clear now to us. If anything, this book is a great story and a good read."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"From what i saw of the other reviews this novel is heavily compared to 1984... well i must say i absolutely HATED 1984 so for those people who hated 1984 also, this review of this book is for you!

He wouldn't and he didn't by claiming \\"he wrote Brave New World long before he had heard of We.\\" Two noted, \\"famous\\" for those so inclined, novelists called him out on it. To be influenced is not a four letter word, but instead it powers revelations.The novel. Set in the future with a retrograde societal caste system. Alpha, Beta...really? How is it that the Grecian alphabet is used in the epoch 632 AF (after Henry Ford)? It is implausible. The baby factory is an allusion to Ford's car plants and this nod is counter-intuitively turned on its head by the manufacture of inferior babies. Ford, ever, forever, the capitalist, would never stand for such nonsense. And neither will I. Every paragraph, every word in the novel is telegraphed, the pages turn themselves, one knows what to expect.Dystopia, the state and its representation, is more so pandemonium collected and redistributed, again and again to the point where the citizen and reader doubts his sanity. That is of course the role, undisclosed, of all governments, now, in real time. Stand underneath any government building blocking the sun and you are now standing in the shade of vertigo where the Dystopian citizenry flourish.Chris Roberts"},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"I've read this book about ten times in my life since my dad gave it to me in Junior High-it is a fantastic book, and the ideas expressed in the book are timely even today. If you ever read one book in your life, this should be the book."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"This book was very poorly written, it's basically the ramblings of a Christian fanatic who is upset that society has become less religious. He wrote this book by picking everything he disliked about society and then he sent it to the extreme end of things and called it a prediction for the future. For example, because sex was no longer frowned upon as much as it used to be he decided that in the future adults and children would be encouraged to have sex with everyone. This satire was just so poorly conceived, it's ridiculous. The most annoying part of this book for me was that the only religious book he mentions them banning was the Bible. He didn't bring up another religious text once. It's clear that the only religious book he cares about people banning is his own, and thats just plain low. It's not like I'm just annoyed that he didn't include my religious text, I'm an atheist so I don't have one. I just think that he shouldn't be so obviously hypocritical in his novel. I'm sure it has to do with the times he lived in as well as him but that still annoyed me. Anyways, don't waste your time with this man and his nonsense. Read something better."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"This book is supposed to show conern for a utopian society, which apprenly does not involve animals. If there is no science then how are the reasearchers able to come up with new maturing speeds.The story itself is horrible since nothing exciting ever happens and the author does not let the reader wondering whats going to happen next in this situation becuase the end of the book and the beggning of the book are not related that closely. Its as if i was reading the beggning of the book over and over again and nothing ever progressed.To prove a point, this book should onl be read by belivers of a utopian society or people who fear it and can beleive in this one. In other words, no one read this book becuase it is not beleiveable."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"I think this book was not very captavating. It was very boring and put me to sleep every 5 minutes. It's a good bed time book!"},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"DEAR READERS, I am writing this review to save you a waste of time, money, and paper. &quot;The Brave New World&quot; was given to my honors english class to read. Being a book lover I dove into the book reading the first 3 chapters before the day was out. It was then I found what a perverted, warped mind Aldous Huxley had. The book is about a man named Bernard Marx. Benard lives in a society where almost everyone is genetically engineered in a laboratory. As children they are manipulated to become one of the four social classes: Alphas, Betas, Deltas, and Epsilons. As adults, people in this society take drugs daily, and are encouraged to have intercourse with many diffrn't people, and prejudice among classes is common. In short this book is about people who's average lifestyle contains all of the wrongs commited today. This book was extremly dissapointing , and I can only hope this review will help encourage teachers around the world to NOT make us students read this book. thankyou."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"This boos is so weak, the narrative is so boring, thecharacters are so ridiculous and awkward, that I can't understand whatpeople saw in it. There's no climax, the plot is old cliche in the &quot;science-fiction&quot; (even being written in 1926) and people get saying that the book is &quot;prophetic&quot;, &quot;visionnaire&quot;.. Come on! IT is just boring. The end is laughable, the character who theoretically fights the organized civilization is also a &quot;robot&quot;, because he only says what he read in Shakespeare.

The World Controllers have created the perfect society with strict regulations ensuring that human beings lead an ideal and happy life. Through the use of genetic engineering, brainwashing, sex end the \\"soma\\" drug, all the members of this utopian society are happy consumers. Yet some very few people have a pressing urge to question the whole system. Bernard Marx for instance can't help having a feeling of discontent, harbouring a desire for solitude and a distaste for the pleasures of promiscuity. He has a longing to break free. Perhaps a visit to one of the remaining Savage Reservations where the old and imperfect life has been preserved will be the cure for Bernard's distress.In the same vein, readers may enjoy H.G. Wells's \\"Nineteen Eighty-Four\\" or Ray Bradbury's \\"Fahrenheit 451\\"."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"There was once a person in this world who felt no one individual was indispensable and that no one deserved to attract as much attention and curiosity as he or certain other people did. He did not believe that ideologies resided within people but rather felt that ideologies move forward in time with their own momentum and humans are but only vehicles for what is destined to be. He considered that everyone is totally entitled to whatever choice of words they may use to refer to this momentum, whether it be chance or fate or destiny or something larger. And he believed that lynching human beings does not abolish any given way of thinking for the same reasons. He was an ordinary man and believed that he was only human with both good and bad qualities, like any other. He was surprised and deeply pained to see all this hatred directed against him and others around him and this thirst for blood and he wondered why it had to be this way. He never thought of himself as being a polarizing figure but rather someone who always strived to seek middle ground in everything by trying to look at things from all perspectives including reading different viewpoints and attempting to look at both the good and bad in what he saw and believed there were other human beings in this world who shared his way of thinking. He had always felt that considering all perspectives on any arguable issue including attempting to look at and actually live life differently for a change was acceptable. He wished everyone would let him move on with his life to where he would not be attracting attention and controversy and deeply hoped that things for everyone around him would return to where they were before this started. He sincerely hoped that this was not too much to ask. The only criticism of this book is that one wishes that Aldous Huxley had not written the end they way that he did. However there is no question that the end was written the way that it was in order to strengthen the impression that this is nevertheless a piece of fiction!"},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"there were corollary tendency. without sshining light the new generation do you? uh?"},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"This book is well worth anyone's time to read. In it Huxley outlines what he thinks is going to happen to his world long into the future. It is almost uncanny how some of the things that he prophesies have occurred or are occurring in the present day. He talks about a world influenced by scientists and sociologists. He even mentions cloning! (Remember this book was originally written in 1931). What most people don't realize though is that Huxley thought his book was a comic book. Even though he thought it comic, he was still trying to put forth his forebodings for the world's future and for each individual's right to freedom. A sobering, but highly entertaining read."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"When I was in high school back in the early eighties, our English teacher, Ms. Applewhite, made us read this book. In the course of us reading the book, Ms. Applewhite brought in a news article about test tube experimentation. At the time I did not fully absorb the book, nor did I understand the significance of the article. After reading and understanding the book now, I see why she brought the article in: she wanted the class to see that Brave New World can become a reality.I won't summarize what the book is about because I'm sure there are reviews prior to this one that already did that. I will say that if Brave New World is still required reading in high school or college (or if you just happen to check it out from the library); students should read it again years after graduating (that is if you still have an affinity for reading books). Like Ralph Ellison's book Invisible Man, Brave New World is the type of novel one must reread. Aldous Huxley is brilliant, witty, and a master of putting together words and concepts (believe me, this book is layered with them). If ever in my life I meet Ms. Applewhite again I will thank her for showing me a Brave New World."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Brave New World describes a paradigm for a new stable world, where arts are surpressed, faith and God are abolished, a caste system is created into which people are trained to think and work right from their births, sexual pleasures are promoted and \\"soma\\" present a ready refuge from every sorrow, every burst of adrelin. The novel written in 1930s is outright brilliant in several respects: its a self-supporting surprisingly accurate prophesy of changing world order and how societies are organized, it is book of reflection where the very basis of God, our faith, our social, religious and cultural attributes are questioned, it is a commentary on sociology, it is book of philosophy where questions about freewill, nature of science and most importantly human nature are provoked. The book is a great read, and one of those pieces of literature that everyone must commit to, not only to read it, but to think about what the book hints at! Huxley's Brave New World is in many respects like Wells Time Machine, underlines how luxury leads to lack of extremes, pain and instability which nucleate each change, drive new inventions and inspire art and literature."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"This is one of the best books of all time because it makes the reader think of what our world will become. It compares the two sides of what the world can become, completely government run - ignorance is bliss or up to the individual - to feel is to be truly alive. Which way is better? Is there even a right answer?"},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Aldous Huxley's \\"Brave New World\\" shows us a perfect society where the government's control keeps the population joyous, and those with negative thoughts about it are exiled. As the novel opens in 632 A.F. (\\"After Ford\\", 632 years after the production of the first Model T), the reader is immediately shown the cost of Huxley's utopia - students are shown the hatcheries where babies are now developed in tubes and trained through sleep hypnosis to know their roll in life. Bernard Marx, however, wants something more; while on a visit to a savage reservation he meets a former civilian of the utopia who shows him new opportunities back in the utopia.I thoroughly enjoyed this novel. It is written with strong, descriptive language and you cannot help but manifest your own utopia (or dystopia) in your mind. Huxley wrote \\"Brave New World\\" as a dystopian novel, and it shows how the government controlling citizens lives so much is practically nightmarish . Brave New World is often Compared to George Orwell's \\"1984\\", because of their similar dystopian styles. I, without hesitation, recommend this novel to anyone who has ever enjoyed a read word."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Brave New World is a stunning masterpiece of Huxley's. Not only does it provide for a thrilling read that will not allow you to put the book down, but it is also captivating in its thoroughness of detail. It holds a complete explanation of an entire society that has been fringed on the advance of science and man. In the novel, man uses science for complete control over societal changes, reform, and stability.Huxley creates a dystopian society in which humans are developed rather than born. They are taught in their sleep and are brain washed into living the ways the government desires for them to. By controlling human \\"birth\\", the government also controls population, stability, and social status. The humans produced in the hatcheries are given to certain social classes; Alpha being the highest and Epsilon the lowest.Throughout the novel many modern ideals are shown to be taken to nightmarish extremes. Humans have no desire or motivation to think, sex has been degraded to nothing more than \\"Obstacle Golf\\", children play erotic games together, and the entire population uses the drug soma as a means to avoid dealing with any problems in life.Having a major interest in books depicting the \\"Utopian Society\\" or \\"Apocalyptic Times\\", this book was an astonishing enjoyment for me. I would most definitely recommend this book to anyone who has enjoyed books such as \\"Fahrenheit 451\\", \\"1984\\", or \\"Alas Babylon\\". You will find it to be among the most pleasing reads you have encountered."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"I loved this book. It is about a dystopian society where people are mass produced in assembly lines. Jobs are predetermined and everyone is content with everything because of subliminal messages received in their sleep since early childhood and soma, a miracle drug. The story is told from the point of view of a freak in society who cannot help but question everything, a girl who accepts it all and loves it, and a young man who was found outside the new cities and is now trying to adapt.This novel was creepy because I could see this happening in the future. Question nothing accept everything, stay in line do as you are told. I could not take it. There is no real happiness because there is no sadness. You can not know what happiness is if you do not have anything sad to compare it to. Everything is empty. The scariness helped keep my attention. Like staring at a wreck, it is horrible but you just can not look away.I recommend everyone read this. It will amaze and horrify. It is not particularly mushy or violent. It makes you think. It makes you contemplate the world around you. If you like this I also suggest reading \\"The Giver\\" by Lois Lowry, \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" by Ray Bradbury, and \\"1984\\" by George Orwell."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"I found Brave New World to be extrememly creative in the scope of the negative utopia which it portrayed. Unlike 1984, Brave New World focuses on a more indepth society,though at times more farfetched society, but it is one first novels to popularize negative future society and therefore Huxley should be praised as the harbinger of a literary genre which Orwell made so vogue."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"I read Brave New World in my grade 12 English class but am EXTREMELY glad that I had too. the book was mind blowing. Huxley is my new favorite author! For anyone who likes society the way it is this book will be an insult. I love the sadistic humour that Huxley shows. The novel is over the top and frighteningly realistic. Huxley is a genius. I'll be reading more of his stuff in the future."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"I enjoyed this book very much. Even though some aspects of the society were hard to imagine or relate to, I found many of the ideas to be very interesting. I found the society to be very practical in how it was run and with the efficiency in which it ran. I thought that the characters in the society fit very well. Overall I loved this book. I think, however, to fully enjoy this book, you must have an open mind to what could be and not what is."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"What can I say about the second greatest novel of the 20th century. This is a book that shows just how inhumane and unfeeling humanity can be. In fact, the novel's 'Savage', who is considered inferior to the Utopians, is the most human character in the book. The shocking ending will leave you reeling. Truly amazing, my hat is off to the late Sir Aldous Huxley."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"I read &quot;Brave New World&quot; as an assignment for my 8th grade class, and I loved it. The way Aldous Huxley portrays Lenina, Marx, and Savage could be viewed almost as a warning of what our lives could become. Comparing this with Shakespeare was one of the most enjoyable assignments I have ever had to do. &quot;Brave New World&quot; is wonderfully unique and I would advise any age group to read it."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Ok, sure, some stuff was wrong in his &quot;prediction.&quot; That was not the point. Huxley wrote this book to compare where he thought society was going; and to warn against the evils of totalitarianism, happiness/art vs. science, diminished family values, and control of free will. This was not boring as some people may have thought -- I thought it was until we started discussing it in my 9th grade english class. This is science fiction at its best!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"I'm currently in eleventh grade in high school. A Brave New World was a suggested book to read because of the content and reading level.

Wrong, but interesting. Although Huxley portrayed a society which pursues happiness above all else as inherently dystopian, in retrospect I don't think I would decline a chance to live like the characters do, after all life is finite and hedonism is only bad if you cant afford it. To Huxley's credit, &quot;World&quot; was written before 1945, after which it became painfully clear to everyone that no one was going let anyone be too happy for too long. Worth checking out."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"These 3 books are 3 of my all time favorite books.

Disease is non-existant, war has ended, and everyone has plenty of free time, with nothing to worry about. This is an excellent book, and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Aldous Huxley's 1932 novel Brave New World presents a vision of consumerism and mechanization, where social strata are bred into the biology of factory-produced twins, and stuporous stability is the highest government ideal. I found myself captivated by the book's system of society, its veneration of Henry Ford, and culture of instant gratification. If Orwell's vision was pure fascism, this is pure capitalism.On the downside, Brave New World is nowhere as intellectually deep as 1984. The plot and characters are underdeveloped and inconsequential. Huxley makes the joy of reading solely in its exploration of his (brave new) world, but that can only carry the book so far. Throw in a compelling plot, differentiated tone of story-telling, and dynamic characters and it might have been perfect.[...]"},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Book starts off great, then veers down a cul-de-sac. Must have been revolutionary for the time, but it now seems a bit quaint. Not a great book, but easy to read, pretty short, and something that, I guess, should be read. Often compared to 1984, which is an immeasurably better work."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Huxley was right on about some of his ideas of the future. Embryo farms where humans are bred like Catfish;subliminal advertising;in vitro fertilization.Thank Ford that some of his thoughts have not materialized and art and religion are still accepted by todays society.Huxley is more philosopher than novelist and his visoions are brilliant.No wonder his paranoia with the threat of Facism and Communism beginning to assert itself in Europe and the Great Depression casting doubts on the succcess of free enterprise."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Brave New World is a classic, a must have for heads and scifi fans."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"this book is great, it is the best book ever written"},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"After people have told me to read this novel several times, I decided to pick it up at the library. The first few pages intrigued me and as the novel progressed I became bored. I absolutely began to become disappointed in the praise that others have offered for it. I quit reading the book 3/4ths of the way through, returning it to the library shelves where it belongs as eye candy for the people who want to say they read it when they haven't. I read it, hated it, returned it. Good use of language but redundant in its explanations.Sorry to all you Huxley fans but I wasn't impressed."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"I didn't really enjoy reading this book too much. The main characters were annoying, and the writing style was unnecessarily confusing. The only redeeming quality to the book was the valid and interesting points on civilization as a whole.

Many of the problems lie in the writing and construction of the &quot;novel.&quot; Indeed, we have already hit upon the first of the problems. For Brave New World is clearly an essay, disguised by the thinnest veil as a novel. The story opens with a ten page discussion of what this new world is like, but because it is ostensibly being said by a teacher to students, it comes across as - as it indeed is - a lecture. This technique is employed by Huxley several times throughout the novel, and one is lead to question the control he had over his writing, or the time he spent thinking about how to construct such a story. Although Huxley does begin the novel with interesting literary techniques - the lecture is interspersed throughout with two different plot lines, which do create an interesting plot - he abandons them after the first chapter, and uses the characters only as a medium to show the reader what such a utopian world could be like. The consequences of this decision are obvious: the characters are static and lifeless, merely moving props to explain a world, and the reader does not - indeed, cannot - make any connection with them. And then, somehow, Huxley manages to switch protagonists halfway through the story, from a civilized man at odds with society, to a savage who comes into it and looks at it with a different prospective. Huxley's reason for doing so is obvious - he uses the savage to discuss the horrors of this utopian society - but the effect upon the book as a novel is devastating. The change in characters breaks any sense of unity, coherence, or integrity the book as a novel had up to that point. Even were one to address Brave New World as an essay about the consequences of our current obsession with science and power however, one would be disappointed. Huxley's predictions seem improbable and poorly thought out. For history tells us that a totalitarian government such as the one established in this novel would not be benevolent, endeavoring to make everyone happy, but tyrannical and oppressive. But within Huxely's own framework, it seems clear that he gave the implications of his society little thought - for why, in a utopian society brought about through mind control and genetic engineering and designed to make everyone happy, would you maintain an economy? Not only would it become unnecessary, but the capitalist system clearly breeds hardship and unhappiness for those without a certain amount of income.Perhaps Brave New World suffers primarily from the fact that it was published in 1932. It is dated.My advice, in short, is: read Animal Farm or 1984 instead, Orwell did it better."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Brave New World is an excellent book. However it was more then a book it is a commentary. It was written in 1931 at the rise of Nazism. The story is about a &quot;perfect&quot; world where humans are made in labs. This &quot;perfect world&quot; also bans the Bible and Shakespere the two biggest icons of humanity. The controller, Mustapha reads these books, but thinks they are useless. A &quot;savage&quot; by the name of John enters this perfect world and can't except it. He faced many hardships in the society and only wanted to seek solitude. He runs into people with names strangely similar to those of prominet people in the early 20th Century. Marx-Karl Marx. Lennia-Lenin,Pop\`e- Pope. In the end John wants to control his own fate and commmits suicide."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Is Brave New World actually all that much of a brilliant book, complete with social implications? Absolutely.Is Aldous Huxley a prophet? By no means.Although his ideas are genuine and the book is extremely well-written, and altogether hilarious, Huxley makes the assumption that there will never be any kind of social or political opposition to this type of a society. He makes the Brave New World too outrageous, too unbelievable to think that society would ever come to such a point, and indeed, it hasn't, isn't now, and never will. Perhaps liberal ideology is flawed, but democracy and the fact that there is opposition to the liberal ideas always preclude the implications Huxley asserts.So.. read Brave New World. Enjoy It. It may change your life, but never consider Aldous Huxley a prophet in any sense."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Try as I might, I just don't get the appeal of the Utopia/Dystopia genre. With it's idealistic philosophies and overdrawn characters, it leaves much to be desired by the realist. This book, who's plot is well known enough that I do not think I need to delve into it here, is very indicative of the whole genre. All of the characters are cardboard cutouts of the denziens of the utopian novel. There's the bewildered outsider, there's the one who can't accept the system, there's the one who accepts it whole heartedly, there's the victim of said society, etc, etc, etc. Yes, the book does raise important objections to the Totalitarian state and religious fidelity to science, however, these are actually fairly common objections that you do not need to read a 250 page book to figure out. If you loved 1984, give it a shot I guess. Otherwise, just read some critiques of Communist(and to a lesser extent, state capitalist) ideology."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Control of &quot;negative&quot; emotions through drugs and other distractions. &quot;Positive&quot; thinking in hypomanic denial of tragedy. Promiscuity without love, warmth without soul, slogans without meaning--and now, genetic engineering bought, sold, and patented. Huxley would have recognized the Borg of the Star Trek universe, and shuddered. See why. But hey, it's all good, right? Good to go? You go, girl. Look on the bright side. Everybody's happy nowadays."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"I really did not like the book. The author got somethings right about things today. But anybody predicting the future gets something right.I was bother by the lack of God in the book."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"While it will be difficult to write anything new or original about the impressions this book leaves, I feel I must try. I just read Brave New World for the first time after it had been highly recommended to me by many people. I've always been fascinated by stories of dystopian societies quite frankly couldn't figure out why I'd never read it. Well, now I have.The first thing I have to say is that I think this is one of those books people love to love. Not because it's particularly good but because they think it makes them sound intelligent and it's a classic. Don't get me wrong. I went into this with a great attitude. I love books like this. During the first several chapters, where we are introduced to this strange futuristic world where people are \\"decanted\\" instead of born and \\"everyone belongs to everyone else\\" as opposed to marrying and having families, I was highly entertained. In my opinion, these chapters were the best out of the whole book. Like many others have said, after such an intriguing beginning I was waiting on the edge of my seat for something to happen, anything at all... but nothing ever did. Granted, the culture shock situation Lenina and Bernard experience at the Reservation is a globally shared phenomenon and one that is relevant to everybody. The same can be said of John Savage's experiences when he visits the \\"civilized\\" world. The frustration, caused by irreconcilable misunderstandings and felt by characters on both ends of the situation, was for me both profound and cautionary... for about five minutes. Beyond that I felt completely dissatisfied.My major problems stemmed from two main sources: Unanswered questions and the utter lack of probability of events described in the book. Firstly, the unanswered questions. To me, some of the things discussed were so deliciously controversial they practically screamed to be explored further. For example, I get the whole \\"Our Ford\\"/assembly line reference but I was begging... pleading for some sort of expansion on that topic. Who is this Ford deity? Where did he/it come from and why and when? What earth shattering paradigm shift occurred to change Our Lord into Our Ford and what caused it? My god, I was going out of my mind with these questions, flipping pages like a madwoman to get to the answer, and then discovered there were no answers to be had. Along those lines, why is this a scientifically-driven, technologically-advanced society with no scientists? What happened to change the way people are, well, born (for lack of a better word)? Was it a war? A plague? A world-wide coup? It feels like Huxley just plops all of these dynamic impossibilities down in front of us, expecting us to swallow them without question so that he can get on with the story, and then fails to produce a decent plot.Secondly, the plausibility question. As far as I'm concerned, the whole thrill of reading a dystopia novel lies in the whole, \\"wow, this could actually happen\\" factor, which Brave New World sorely lacks. The commentary on the direction in which society is headed is a major thing for me when it comes to books of this genre. All I can think to say is that this book makes a better science fiction read than a book about our grim future. I'm sorry but unless the entire global population has a lobotomy... This. Would. Never. Happen. A fact that disqualifies Brave New World from dystopia status altogether in my mind, but then again I'm not in charge of the literary canon.I guess all that's left is what I like to call the \\"scary prophecy factor\\" and which is a necessary motif of all dystopia novels. When writing this book Huxley hit many a nail on the head as far as ongoing relevance to social problems. The brave new world's utter dependence on soma can easily be compared to our current culture's love affair with mood-altering, mind-altering prescription medication such as Prozac. However, if you want an even better, more sophisticated statement on the evils of an over-medicated society, watch the movie Equilibrium. If you want to explore the theme of censorship, one which is touched on throughout Brave New World but most heavily during the end, and which continues to be a pressing matter in today's world, read Fahrenheit 451 (or watch Equilibrium). Then there is the all-consuming dictatorship that controls the denizens of this strange civilization. To me, this theme is yet another in a long line of shabby pearls Huxley could have polished up real nice had he wanted to, but chose to stick to the \\"plot\\" instead. If you want to see really scary dictatorships watch V for Vendetta or read 1984. As for the genetic engineering thing, this is a scary prophesy that went a little too far in my opinion. While there is no way Huxley could have known what possibilities lie in genetic engineering, cloning, etc., when the book was written, the fact that this indeed has come to pass makes for a rather impressive topic in Brave New World. And yet... how far Huxley actually takes this theme is for me what causes the book to meander into pure, unadulterated science fiction. If you want to read a believable dystopia novel about genetic engineering-gone-awry read Oryx and Crake by Margaret Atwood. Now the sexual promiscuity theme is one that really impressed me, one that I believe to be almost totally original to Brave New World and one that has become an issue in today's society but was not so much when Huxley wrote this novel. To my knowledge sexual promiscuity has not been addressed in the same way in any existing dystopia books or movies as yet, although both The Handmaid's Tale and the movie Children of Men address the dilemma of women who don't have babies... in a completely unrelated way.People really, really like to compare Brave New World to 1984, sometimes even to Fahrenheit 451, for various reasons I'm sure. But to me, in my head, I was comparing it to Margaret Atwood's The Handmaid's Tale the whole time and unfortunately it fell far short. If you want to read a book that makes believable as well as hauntingly prophetic statements about what our possible terrible future could look like, read Handmaid. It's longer and more complex, but the payoff is that much greater. And did I mention it's actually believable?"},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"While going through my stack of unread books this summer I noticed that I still had a copy of this book from High School, at the moment I am two semesters from graduating from college. So, I figured I should read it as I am an English major and most English majors have read this book.Why I bothered I do not know.The plot to this book was poorly executed, the characters were weak and I just didn't really care.Instead I suggest \\"1984\\" by Orwell or \\"We\\" by Zamyatin, if you are interested in this topic. Especially \\"We\\" as it was written before either or these two books and is my personal favorite, but is tragically ignored."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Let me start with my main peeve about this work: it's just not that realistic. A society that would homogenize its people to the extent described, stifling scientific curiosity in the process, would not last very long. Societies need the rumble and tumble of all kinds of people people bouncing off each other, or else they lose any drive to move forward and grind to a screeching halt after only a few generations. History makes it very clear that any disaster of any significant magnitude--say, earthquakes, hurricanes or pandemics--would soon wipe out civilizations that are so ill-adapted to change. Also, Huxley makes it seem as if human hatcheries and communal raising of children are bad ideas in and of themselves. I don't see why. Sure, they might seem rather odd for our current societies, but I can see how they could work for future ones.Huxley is right though about the horrors of childhood indoctrination, but let's face it: people pretty much do that already, since parents fill their children with all kinds of superfluous notions like religion. The truly bad part is using drugs to deliberately keep people stupid. So, if people would be genetically predisposed to be a geniuses, they could still wind up being near retarded because of chemical intervention. That's not only bad, it's idiotic beyond description. Geniuses are a rare breed, and societies can't afford to suppress their highly needed capabilities.Still, this wouldn't be so bothersome if Huxley had come up with a compelling story with interesting, rich characters. Uhm, no. I find all of the main characters in Brave New World to be obnoxious to the max. They often respond in totally unrealistic, moronic ways to their circumstances, and I often caught myself wishing they'd be kicked off some ledge at some point. The worst offender is John. How the heck did he get so small-minded? Wasn't he a Shakespeare buff? You'd expect someone like that to respond a bit more maturely when being confronted with a different society. I also can't believe for the life of me that a person who is so articulate and so knowledgeable about Shakespeare's works would be so downright appalled by the mere idea of a woman wanting to have sex with a man. Just saying \\"no\\" would have sufficed, John; there is no need to physically abuse the woman who expresses her attraction to you.Huxley also appears to be incapable to write convincing female characters. Where the men in his stories could be seen as somewhat believable, although highly brain-damaged, individuals, the women are usually nothing more than talking showroom dummies. Whether this is due to misogyny or simply lack of ability is not clear, but it didn't make reading this book any more enjoyable.All in all, I believe the classic status of this work is not quite justified. I guess it just got published at the right place at the right moment."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"How does this sound to you?You live in a society where your every physical need is cared for, and all things sensual are avaliable whenever you like. The price? You don't get to think. What happens if you think? You get deported to a beautiful tropical island where everyone else thinks.So you're happy until you realize you're not, and once you do, you get sent somewhere you can become happy on your own, with others like you.Sounds good to me.That, in a nutshell is the society presented in this novel. Huxley tries his best (or does he?) to make is sound horrible, but I'd take it any old day. I like tropical islands.Enjoyable, but not ominous, and certainly not sucessful in its predictions."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"I read \\"Brave New World\\" when I was in high school, and now, over 50 years later, I wanted to read it again. Yup! I got the book I wanted. It isn't in the best of shape, but it's readable and it's what I wanted. What's to complain about?? I think \\"1984\\" was more pungent and foretelling! There. Is that 20 words?? Have a great day!! Talk to your Savior Jesus! Thank Him!"},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"While its portrayal of the future is not as apocalyptic and frightening as that of 1984, it is indeed more worrying, since 1.We're beggining to see certain elements of it in todays world, and 2.Some elements of Huxley's future are dangeroulsy attractive.The society in which people live in the book is, one could say, almost perfect. No one has any kind of hardships or worries. You work your hours, get into a helicopter that you yourself fly, go play some Centrifugal Bubble Puppy or some Obstale Golf, go home with the girl (or boy) of your choice (which of course will be different than the one yesterday, since &quot;everyone belongs to everyone else&quot;), and have sex all night. Then go to work the next morning.But things rarely are what they seem, and as you deepen yourself in the story and listen to the counterpoints that John Savage discusses with the Controller, you come to realise that, while everyone is basically provided for and in a way happy, and the whole of society remains &quot;stable&quot; (and if they're not, they just take a Soma-Holiday); their inner lives are incredibly empty of any kind of true love for anything or anyone, or any individualism, both phisical and intelectual. Its not that they are not allowed to express themselves or to love. They're just conditioned and engineered like that. That plus the incesant cloning of the Epsiloms and Gammas, the (Human) Hatcheries, the intense promiscuity, the strange rituals and religious Zeal for &quot;Ford&quot;, the Koskanofski groups etc, add up to make a very insane future. One which I'm afraid, if we don't look out, we are in danger of arriving at very soon.I reccomend you read this book. If you liked 1984, you're gonna love this book. While its wildely different to 1984 in the future it portrays, it is closer to happening."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"I am a senior in high school this year. I am taking an advanced placement English class and this book was in our curriculum. Like most high school students I skim over books that don't look interesting, but when I was skimming over this book I realized that there is a lot to this book that I needed to take time and find out.The main points of the book that I enjoyed were the social commentary relating to being alone and being an individual. I also liked the very idea that this book was written so long ago, but shows exactly the way that our sociaty is and will turn out because of our own misguided views. I believe that Huxly had a few mental distortions of his reality when he wrote this, but he definatly had a grasp on where the future was headed.This book also contains a lot of subject matter pertaining to sex. Which makes it a more adult oriented book, but on the other hand there is so much reality in this that it should definatly be read by everyone.Although this book has extream adult content and takes a good analytical mind to fully comprehend the hidden meanings in some of his social satire, this is a great book for the high school class room."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"While reading this, I had a feeling somewhat like the one I had while reading 'the tripods trilogy' when I was a little younger."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Reading this text for a Science and America in the 20th century course in college, I am struck with the similarities between Huxley's fiction and present-day Earth. I constantly reminded myself that the work is indeed fiction. The book raises a gamet of questions regarding ethics in medicine, love, and society in general. It is quite a controversial text great for discussion, yet evokes feelings of violation, vunerability, and fear. One should be thankful the work remains in the fiction stacks at local bookstores and libraries worldwide.Shocking and Exquisitly written with great detail."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"If I could give 6 stars in this review I truly would. I am a senior in high school and I found the first chapter a little hard to follow because I didn't understand what the book was about. After reading about 2 more chapters...I was hooked! I began to fully appreciate the value of this classic. Aldous Huxley has been engraved in my mind as one of the best writers of all time. I would recommend this book to everyone but I must say that I don't think that it is an easy book to read. So, go for it! You'll enjoy it but have patience at first. When you get into it you wont be able to put it down."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Huxley's work portray's a future in which both love and neglect go hand-in-hand.

May the Ford be with you."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"This book needs to be read by more people. It is, quite simply, one of the great works. A world where foetus's are manipualted to produce certain 'types' of citizens is chilling. And the society itself is frightening. And yet... it works. When one steps back, the true horror of this book is not (to me) that it resembles our own society in so many ways, but that it works, and that everyone is happy. Genuinely happy.Perhaps this is what utopia is... and we can only pray it never happens."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"I love when an author takes a serious look at the current day and can express their thoughts to future events! Huxley is a master touching on topics very much in today's society.

Setting the anti-technology standard carried through by cumming's poetry and Orwell's prose a half-generation later, Huxley adopts a sensationalist, slightly racy stance toward his subject matter: technology vis-a-vis power. True to his cinematographic experience (Huxley later turned to film writing), this book is part tabloid, part far-fetched sci-fi, and all fun. It's a literary masterpiece to boot, with substance to back up the style. A must read! Buy it today!--Justin Laird Weaver"},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"This book is more than just a book, it is a classic. In under three hundred pages, readers find themseves disgusted and intrigued. This intense book provokes an unexplored question: What is more important Happiness or Freedom? You choose. A world with &quot;conditioned&quot; people; humans that are hypnotized to believe they are happy. With not a worry, no parents or babies (you were born out of a bottle), no resumees (you already have a job according to your caste) and no marriage (you can never fall in love). Nothing to complain about. If they do, a little Soma does the trick. Takes them to cloud nine. But things aren't as simple as they seem....a little visit from the savage John, an unconditioned man, changes the lives of three human robots living in this dystopia. But in the end, it changes his own life. He finds the truth within himself and for the world around him. He discovers this Brave New World."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"In 1931, Aldous Huxley published a book which was controversial, intelligent, and contained a prophetic message for the future. That book was &quot;Brave New World&quot;, and seventy years later it is just as relevant as the day it was published. The book takes place in the not-so-distant future when the world has finally acheived a utopian society. In this society, people live lives which where already planned out before their birth. Humans are genetically engineered in a way which would best service society. Everything is for the good of society. Books, religion, poetry and individuality have been outlawed. But one citizen, Bernard Marx is starting to question the world in which he lives. This book is not only creatively written, but expresses an important message: The choices we make and aspects of our individuality affect the society in which we live."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"This book is such a thought-provoking novel. All of Aldous Huxley's works are great, but this book is his masterpiece. Though the story is set in an unimagaginable background, the characters are so real and moving. Brave New World is well worth your money. I highly recommend this book to anyone 13 and over."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"In his book Huxley depicts a future society in which everyone is genetically created to serve a certain task for all of their life. I agree with Huxley's cry to save the individual. This book is excelent at showing what could happen if we lose our diversity. The thing I didn't like about his book is the lack of attention he put to his characters. One of the styles of the book however is to focus on society as a whole so I can understand why he shied away from developing his characters. Still, it was hard to see what motivated most of his characters. All in all I though it was a good book though, and would recomend it to anyone interested in distopian fiction."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"It is amazing how Aldous Huxley created a conditioned society 70 years ago, that reflects so much of what is going on in the world of 1999. John Savage's character represents a hopelessness that art, literature, and religion are to be extint and have no place in a secure pleasure seeking environment."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Huxley has epitomized the futuristic world everyone wishes for but cannot live in. He tells a tale of a corrupt future where people are kept drugged to be happy. An amazing world with no morals or conscience. Except for one man, born outside the controlled Utopia of the modern world. He is a comparison for a person of our modern world. This is a great book and I highly recommend it for any reader intersted in what will happen in the future."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"I have never read a book so thought provoking!

It is into this world where emotions are controled from infancy and humans are manufactured with specific jobs in mind that &quot;alpha plus&quot; Bernard Marx brings John the innocent Savage.This book will be enjoyed by anyone (unless they happen to be an Epsilon or have alchol in their blood-surrogate).I hope they make it into a &quot;feelie&quot;some day."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"The book starts out boringly, but as we move on it catches the reader in such a way that you have to complete it before you can go to bed.

I feel that the author has given us two extremes in the shape of Civilized Society and Savage Reseravation. The ideal society lies somewhere in between the two."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"I was assigned this book for 11th grade British Literature. At the beginning of the book, it is very risque (especially for an assigned book) for example - the society thinks children are not normal if they don't like to participate in erotic play. This book, however, turned out to be the most fantastic book I have ever read. I loved it. If you liked Brave New World, you'll love The Handmaid's Tale by Margaret Atwood."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Brave New World. Such a fitting title. A venture into the reaches of insanity. Who but Huxley could have imagined such a concept? Mass production of humans, unlimited sex, legal 'coke'...Although initially appearing a perfect society , the scene quickly changes as one discovers his savage side, his human side. Finding oneself to be independent, and not 'one cell in the tissue of society.' Such a society is an impossibility, and must be regarded as one.

(I say so far, because I have many more to read in my lifetime.) I feel that the theme of the book, the reason that makes it so powerful, the reason it is a work of genius, is completely overlooked.Many people label Brave New World as one of the &quot;dystopias&quot;, with 1984 and We. Both are great books and accurately portray a true dystopia, but Brave New World is completely different!If you would read the forward by Aldous Huxley, you will find the true meaning of Brave New World. He was not speaking of politics, with a communist rule taking over and instilling the Utopia on people, or how society could go wrong on itself.The true purpose of Brave New World is labeling insanity. Huxley says how hard it is to be truely sane. Society (the utopia) and religion (the land of the barbarians) are the two insanities we face. In the preface he regrets not having put in a middle opportunity, like the opportunity we are currently in, but the two extremes were brilliantly written in the novel.This book single-handedly shows you how insane we are as we live in society, and how insane we are when we go to church, temple, synagogue, or worship any diety, spirit, etc. Have you ever wondered WHY you worship these invisible things, why you hold allegance to invisible borders in countries, and why you fall victim of the irrationality of both society and religion?Perhaps the most gripping scene of the entire novel is the end, in which the Utopians are laughing at the man whipping himself in repent. The scene is a summary of the main idea in Brave New World, that religion and society are insane!I think people are missing out on one of the greatest books of the twentieth century."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"I found that the idea behind a Brave New World was intresting, but the book itself was pretty boring. Brave New World is a lot like 1984. For example it dealt with society in the feature and described a totalatarian government. Except in Brave New Wold there is not much of a story line and you never get to know the characters. The whole book is pretty much just describing how their society is run. Another poroblem I found with this book is that there is never a climax and nothing exciting happens.

In the beginning I think it took too long to get to the story. Maybe the beginning is meant to explain the world the events take place in. But it did not work for me. Then the book reached a part where I felt things were starting to happen, characters to follow were introduced.. But there was not one character you could've followed through the hole story. And that is something I think I would've needed here. I did not really care what happened to the characters.I really like the idea of the story though! The world as so different than what it's like really. I think if the world would've been introduced while introducing characters and the story going forward, I would really have liked this book. But not every book is suitable for everyones' tastes, so this one just was not meant for me. There were parts where I really got into it but they were too short for me to stay excited. Sci-fi for me can only work so often."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Brave New World absolutely rocked me--it's the quintessential dystopian novel and a true classic. Set in a futuristic, atheistic world, it presents a truly horrifying nightmare vision of what society can become, a consumer-based machine that is completely mechanized and lacking humanity.It's hard to believe that it was written so long ago (it was written in 1931). It's testament to the author's incredible insight and almost eerie intuition, because I feel like there are many ways that our current society does represent his vision. Huxley had a deep understanding of societal issues and an extreme viewpoint of evolution. Brave New World is set at the Central London Hatching and Conditioning Center, where they develop a scientific process for cloning, that they call \\"The Bokanovsky Process.\\" Embryos are developed to produce twins, and then put into different castes where they're conditioned to play certain roles in society until they're fully developed.The exploration of the \\"new world\\" Huxley creates so vividly is riveting--the setting alone is enough to keep you turning the pages. I did have some issues relating to some of the characters, though; I wish some of them had more dimension. The premise is so creepy and provocative and unique, it really makes you wonder if something like this could ever happen.Brave New World is very compelling and thought-provoking.

It seems, we've come about 85% of the way to\\"Utopia\\" in about 15% of the 632years he alloted.The final 15% (3 chapters) of Brave New World is where the \\"meat\\" of the book is; ie, the choice of Heaven OnEarth vs. the possibility of Heaven after death.One of my strongest doubts about Christianity is the depiction of Heaven as some kind of etheral bliss thatseems, almost, sufficatingly boring. We aren't all alike. One man's pleasure is another woman's poison.

Individuals who question technological pursuits, reject pleasure-seeking, and fight against the sociopolitical system quickly find themselves in dangerous circumstances. While the true protagonist (\\"The Savage\\") is not even introduced until halfway through the book, which I consider an overall weakness of the story, the painstakingly detailed description of the setting and the intriguing cast of other characters we meet in the beginning creates substantial momentum to keep the reader quite enthralled. The themes are sobering, especially when compared to the realities of our day, and force you to think deeply about human nature, the interplay between science and ethics, and how to find true fulfillment in life."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Extremely boring in many stretches. Really, it's more an exposition of a future possible state, with archetypes instead of characters, and long, highly technical descriptions of factories and flying machines.

Also, I feel like even though the book was written a long time ago, it still relates to the world today. I can see the world that the author was envisioning.About the audiobook format... I LOVED IT! I think this book lends itself VERY well to audiobook. The reader's creation of character voices was REALLY great. For example \\"John\\" was weird, cause he really isn't from civilization.

Of course, \\"ideal\\" is subject to caution. Huxley presents to us a universe in which everything is designed to avoid problems, pain, discomfort, and any such thing. Isn't that great? Yes, no, and maybe.There are many, many good things about this novel, especially if the subject matter interests you (and if it didn't, why would you be reading that book, actually...). The book begins with a presentation of the human factory, where people are made, because, in this world, nobody is born anymore, apart from the humans in reserves, the savages. The world is now divided between castes, each made to enjoy what it has been created for, which is the key to happiness in this brave new world. Thus, we listen along with the Alpha students, as they learn about the process of creating humans designed for their future purpose: Alphas get the best deal, are made to be intelligent, designed to fulfill intelligent tasks; Epsilons are made to be semi-morons barely capable of thought, designed to clean, operate elevators, and other such menial tasks.Our main character is someone named Bernard Marx - everyone's family name comes from someone famous in history - and he is a bit of an oddball. While being an Alpha, he doesn't look like an Alpha, and his behaviour doesn't fit this world. He is not as promiscuous as society would want him, and he enjoys being alone.Another main character is John \\"the savage\\", a white young man who grew up in a natural reserve of savages. He becomes a kind of Pocahontas to the brave new world, and offers contrast with it, as his savage ways resemble ours.Without getting too deep into the plot, let's say that this new world is well presented and offers constant stimulation of ideas. It does make you wonder whether this is a good or a bad world, and that's part of the great interest of this novel. Although at times you'll obviously think this is a bad world - why would it be called a dystopian novel otherwise - it still maintains subtleties and will make you wonder about the necessity, or not, of pain, problems, and all those things the brave new world represses. It makes you think along Nietzsche's line: knowing no misery is the worst misery.[Minor spoilers ahead.]Bernard Marx is a character you will come to despise, and I liked that about the novel: your main character isn't someone you'll want to root for the entire time. Secondary characters will appeal to you more, for various reasons.*Brave New World* is a sort of thought experiment shaped as a novel, and as such, it as good a novel as it is a thought experiment. The novel doesn't appear as an excuse to expose some thoughts, and the thoughts don't cancel out the novel. In this regard, *Brave New World* is a success.My only regret about the book is its ending. The final chapter is overly dramatic in my opinion, and far weaker than the chapter dealing with the final confrontation with the big boss, in which ideas are discussed, the savage asks questions, the director answers, the exchange is profoundly interesting and the savage and the civilised come to a meeting point. This should have been the ending, it was the strongest moment of the story, and it certainly was stronger than the dramatic final chapter.All in all, a great concept, a great execution, a great read. What we love might be more to fear than what we hate."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"It's so weird that this novel was published in the 1930s because of the issues it brings up. It talks about issues like sex, reproduction, and religion in such a way that I was shocked that this book actually came out in the 1930s. The author was clearly thinking ahead of his time. It's both scary and funny at the same time because of how the rulers of this \\"brave new world\\" go about ordering their seemingly \\"perfect\\" society while at the same time praising all things \\"Ford\\". Definitely an interesting read."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book. I can't believe I never read it before! I love utopia/dystopia books and this is one of them. I'm not going to review the plot as I'm sure many other reviewers have done so. This book really got me thinking about happiness and what makes people happy and content. Also, about all the complaining about little things that people do on a daily basis. I recommend this book to anyone who has an open mind and is looking to think outside the box a little. I only gave it 4 stars because toward the end, Huxley was wrapping up all of the political sides and reasons behind things and I got lost and wanted to skip sections of it. It became confusing between which of the characters was saying which part and why. However, it all tied together nicely, tragically, in the end. An excellent read!"},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"\\"LOVEDD!! this book! i wish i had to read it in high school, but regardless, a must read for everybody! it definitely creeped me out because some of Huxley's predications have more or less come true.

I am absolutely stunned at how Huxley was able to look to the future and write about technological medical advances that are still worrisome.The dystopian society he creates is one where Fordism rules all. Obviously concerned about Ford's creation of mass production, Huxley created a society in which everything is mass produced - most especially children. An assembly line fertilizes and nurtures them, creating each child for a singular purpose, creating a caste system.Citizens are created to be happy in their caste with no desires other than what is expected of them. When a few are out of the ordinary, they begin to question if there is more to happiness than going along with the system.1984 by George Orwell is a good follow up to this book and should be read as a companion. Huxley actually taught Orwell at one point and I can see his influence."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"The thing I love about 'Brave New World' is how well it works both as a joke and as a serious futuristic novel.At its heart, 'Brave New World' is a straight parody of the World State and utopian dream worlds of H G Wells and the like. Huxley takes the Wellsian Utopia to its most ridiculous extremes: Perfect People living their Perfect Lives in their Perfect World. In doing so, Huxley reveals something that Wells was unable or unwilling to admit: such a world is incredibly boring. He pulls to pieces the fantasy of such a Utopia by noting that, no matter how attractively it is packaged, such a sterile and regulated world is stupefyingly dull, with no free will, imagination, or even thought. This is reinforced most strongly by the character of Lenina, who comes up with a vapid pre-conditioned clich&eacute; to fit any situation (\\"A gramme in time saves nine\\"....\\"was and will make me ill\\"). Even the more melodramatic elements are narrated with a sardonic eye, such as John's beating of Lenina dissolving into a drug-fuelled mass orgy. And although more subtle and oblique than in some of his other books, there are also stabs at typical Huxley targets of ridicule; the British class system, colonialism, Americanisation, and contemporary social values.Yet in other ways, the book makes some quite accurate predictions about the modern world. Although deliberately exaggerated, everything from test-tube babies to synthetic music was pretty close to the mark, and arrived much sooner than Huxley anticipated. He only had to wait thirty years for the Swinging Sixties to semi-legitimise his world of Free Love and recreational drug use, for example. He also had some distinctive and thoughtful takes on the utopian world. For example, Huxley does not pretend that all men are equal in his Perfect World, but instead hits upon the idea of a \\"benevolent\\" caste system, where people are unequal but conditioned to be perfectly satisfied with their lot.The story itself is also a twist on the usual dystopian plot of the One Good Man in a repressive system. Huxley's utopia is not totalitarian in the conventional sense, and the motivation of Bernard Marx is not to escape persecution but simply to lead a more interesting life. And in the second part of the book, even that is put aside when Bernard thinks he can elbow his way into Society and gain respect and praise from fellow Alphas. John's story is sadder, but even this is less about brutal repression than the fact he simply doesn't fit in. Even the characters' eventual fates aren't regarded as punishment or persecution but as a tolerant accommodation of their \\"eccentricities\\".From all this, it's clear that Huxley regards the biggest threat to society as not a repressive and evil regime, but a vapid and stupefying one, which in many ways gives \`Brave New World' a greater relevance than many dystopian books. After all, it's unlikely the democratic world will collapse under totalitarianism....but can we be as confident that it won't collapse under public apathy and disconnection?In summary, what may have started out as a satire has ended up becoming one of the greatest and most important works of its time, and is still essential reading today. Five stars."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Aldous Huxley's novel &quot;Brave New World&quot; is both one of the best science fiction books and one of the most brilliant pieces of satire ever written. BNW takes place on a future Earth where human beings are mass-produced and conditioned for lives in a rigid caste system. As the story progresses, we learn some of the disturbing secrets that lie underneath the bright, shiny facade of this highly-ordered world.Huxley opens the book by allowing the reader to eavesdrop on a tour of the Fertilizing Room of the Central London Hatchery and Conditioning Centre, where the high-tech reproduction takes place. Into this seemingly advanced civilization is introduced John, a &quot;savage&quot; from a reservation where old human culture still survives. Thus, BNW is also a tale of &quot;culture shock&quot; and conflict.Huxley creates a compelling blend of bizarre comedy, serious character study, futuristic extrapolation, and philosophical discussion. His writing style is crisp and witty, and cleverly incorporates references to canonical works of literature. Probably the scariest thing about BNW is the fact that, in many ways, humanity seems to be moving closer to Huxley's dystopian vision."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Brave New World is an excellent book and, what's more, one that seems to be becoming more relevant all the time in our fast paced world. And unlike many other books with a similar philosophical orientation, Brave New World is quite refreshing, as Huxley's prose is somehow manages to be clear, elegant and insightful without being overly obvious.As regards the actual plot, Brave New World is in essence a portrayal of a utopia (or dystopia, depending how you look at it) in which there is constant prosperity, people are always content, as they are well provided for and have been programmed to like their society in all respects. This programming is undertaken by workers in charge of breeding the future citizens of this idyllic world, which is united under one government, under Ford. As everybody has been programmed to like their class and job, everybody is constantly content and has no wish to do anything other than what is required of them. If they happen to become depressed, of course, there is always the mood altering drug Soma.Through presenting a few individuals who do not exactly fit into this molded world, however, Huxley presents us with a challenging and endlessly interesting question: What can possibly be wrong with a world in which everybody is happy, even if there is no real free will involved in actuality? If we can make ourselves superficially content and never have to suffer a moment of desperation or uncertainty, why not just do that? With the help of William Shakespeare and a young man from a \\"savage reservation,\\" Huxley explores the alternatives to his invented society's promotion of mindless satisfaction. Should true art and the deep thought and emotion that inspires it be sacrificed to perpetual happiness without thought or deeper feeling? Or is the attempt to find these deeper meanings just silly and self-defeating, as we will all meet the same fate in the end?In this era of quick entertainment, instant gratification and materialism unbounded, there are no better questions to be asking than these, the ones at the heart of Brave New World. Pick up a copy and start to read - in addition to being quite interesting as a science-fiction book or portrayal of a future world, Brave New World is a book that inspires a lot of thinking about our lives today."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"As critic and best-selling author Neil Postman points out so well in the introduction to his book &quot;Amusing Ourselves To Death&quot;, we have congratulated ourselves prematurely by figuring we made it past the totalitarian nightmare state depicted in George Orwell's gripping cautionary tale &quot;1984&quot;. Perhaps, Postman suggest, we should remember another visionary totalitarian nightmare scenario and use it to critically examine the contemporary state of social and psychological well-being. Of course he was referring to Aldous Huxley's &quot;Brave New World, written before Orwell's by 15 or so years, and even more frightening in its own way in the world it describes. More and more, that frightening vision looks like our contemporary world.Picture his ironic portrait of a populace doped into Nirvana on &quot;soma&quot; (read Prozac and Zoloft), isolated and diverted by petty preoccupations in mindless trivial pursuits (read video games and internet surfing to all the porno sites), oblivious to anything not directly pertaining to themselves and totally unaware of the degree to which they are being socially, economically, and politically co-opted. Beginning to sound more familiar? Remember, says Huxley, brute force is not the only method an oligarchy can use to influence, manage, and finally control our hard-won freedoms and liberties; it can be done with over-indulgence and the deliberate fertilization and promulgation of apathy through self-absorption, as well.Even Huxley says (circa 1960, almost 30 years after the original publication) in the preface of the revised version of the book that he is alarmed as to how quickly the sort of events he figured might take a hundred years such as the appearance of political internationalism and transnational corporate entities are already arising and beginning to control more and more of the substance of our social, economic, and political lives. Just how much do we know other than what we hear and see on television, for example? Yet the electronic media is owned and managed by transnational corporations. Ever wonder why we never heard much muckraking news coverage of the NAFTA or GATT deals even though many recogized the two bills would radically change the nature of international trade? Perhaps the transnationals didn't want too much hype or fuss. Starting to feel uncomfortable yet? Still, people keep insisting this was just a whimsical work of fiction, that it was a parable, that he really wasn't serious.Want to find out more? Read this book, but do so slowly, taking notes, recognizing how many contemporary parallels there are to each of the &quot;whimsical details&quot; he conjures up, and then figure out in your own mind how very close he was to prognosticating just how far we have come toward the &quot;Brave New World&quot; in which everyone's soul and awareness is for sale. The kids are wowed by the recent movie The Matrix\\", yet few appreciate just how much of a fabled existence we are already living in. No pain, no sorrow, no trouble of any kind. Instead, we have our individual and collective consciousness &quot;managed&quot; pharmaceutically; our psyches eased into blithering bliss with &quot;soma&quot;, our diminishing attention spans sidetracked and occupied by petty diversions and endless entertainments. Pass me the corndogs, honey!But, hey! Don't touch that dial; Regis is on! They may retry OJ! What did Bill Clinton really do with that cigar? Have you seen the latest news about the stock market? Did you get any of that new beer they're advertising? it's supposed to make me a real ladies man....What's the latest gadget? Can I buy one on-line? By the way, where are the kids? Hell, never mind, just turn up the volume; I think I know the answer to that question Regis just asked... Meanwhile, folks, our awareness of what is going on around us, our rights and our liberties are being power-washed away, obliterated, and we cannot even see it happening in front of us. We are diverted, distracted, content in our own little worlds. So welcome to our nightmare. Better beware; it just looks like Nirvana. It's really another &quot;Brave New World&quot;."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"I've put off reviewing Brave New World, as I thought I wouldn't be able to give an unbiased review. But, after re-reading the book for the tenth time (or so), I decided to give it a shot. Brave New World is the most important science fiction novel ever written. Not necessarily the best, not necessarily the best-written, but the most important. It is very good and very well written, but those are subjective points open to debate.Brave New World, published some ten years before Orwell's more popular, anti-Communist 1984, imagines a world where people are conditioned from the moment of their birth to be part of an economic and intelligence-based caste, where the media exists for the sole purpose of distracting people from the humdrum of their lives and news is created as sensationalist entertainment, where different thinking is treated with social ostracization or drugs or both, and where the rule of the entire society is maximizing consumption of material goods. In short, not unlike the world today, and America in particular.BNW (the society outlined in the book) is a Capitalist and Freudian Hell, where people are manipulated to buy things they don't need and conditioned to be perfect molds for that manipulation. The book follows three main characters: Helmholtz, a reporter who realizes the truth about BNW, Bernard Marx, a man who ultimately succumbs to the ostracizing criticism of his so-called \\"friends,\\" and John Savage, an outsider who grew up with books and without the benefit of BNW's conditioning. All three eventually come to the same conclusions about BNW: that it is a society based on dictatorship-like control for the sole purpose of increasing consumer-base for a large, unnamed corporation-government.As politicians are increasingly bought off with \\"campaign contributions\\" from corporations and special interests, news media is funneled into networks owned by five white men; physical and mental health is disregarded as the Randian, Capitalist mantra of \\"maximize profits no matter what\\" destroys basic human dignity; and everything from wars to game shows are turned into video-games for our amusement, it becomes very difficult not to make the prophetic connections between Huxley's vision and today's society. In BNW, there are no protests because people don't care. There are no dissenters because they are mocked into submission when they don't squeeze into the hole designed for them. Take a stroll through modern America, and things aren't much different.\\"Brave New World\\" is important because it, not 1984, is the vision of the future. In a world turning into a Capitalist \\"Utopia,\\" where maximization of profits is the norm and consumption of material goods supercedes all else, one cannot help but shudder at Huxley's words. The point is made even more evident when one realizes there is no Iceland or Falkland Islands to which we can escape: when Buddhists temples in Tibet have Coca-Cola machines, it's not difficult to see the tendrils of capitalism-gone-wrong everywhere, dark and inescapable. Good luck trying to figure out how to deal with it, besides \\"if you can't beat it, join it,\\" the biggest cop-out answer someone can offer - along with the Savage's solution at the end. It can be done, however, even though the answer might not be immediately obvious.This is a science-fiction classic and a book that everyone should read. Forget 1984: the Communists lost. Unfortunately, the Capitalists aren't doing much better - in BNW, most people are just blissfully ignorant of the Truth, rather than oppressed and numbed by it on a daily basis.Grade: The ultra-rare A+"},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"In &quot;Brave New World,&quot; Aldous Huxley illustrates his vision of the future in which rapid advances in science and technology lead to increasing public confusion, which causes governments to impose more and more control until they become entirely totalitarian. As society becomes more industrialized, products become more homogeneous and standardized, art and expression become less important, and personal individuality is gradually lost. In such a world, a government would attempt to keep its population as happy and content as possible by &quot;conditioning&quot; the people from birth to accept and love their assigned work and their respective places in society. Such people would need to be deprived of emotional stimulation so as not to get any subversive ideas, so artistic expression would have to be curtailed. (There is no need for art in a society of people who are always happy and content.) The perpetuation of civilization and society would have to be more important than the value of the individual.The novel's main action is in London in the year A.F. 632 (it doesn't take long to figure out what A.F. stands for). Human reproduction and gestation is handled in laboratories where bottled embryos are separated into caste systems, from Alpha (the highest) to Epsilon (the lowest). All embryos are conditioned for certain jobs; Alphas are conditioned to be the most intelligent and receive the most education, while Epsilons are reserved for the most menial jobs. The different castes are segregated and identified by the color of the clothes they wear. To keep everybody happy and ensure civil obedience, a depression-fighting drug called &quot;soma&quot; is officially distributed. There is no art for art's sake; the only music that exists is always synthetic and is purely functional, as are the &quot;feelies,&quot; movies with tactile and aromatic as well as visual and aural signals.A keen point of interest is the book's reference to Henry Ford. Ford, one of the great industrialists, is a symbol of the semination of the industrialized society of the Brave New World, a sort of patron saint of the assembly line and mass production. The fact that &quot;Ford&quot; rhymes with &quot;Lord&quot; provides the novel with its prevalent running joke. Huxley seems to have had the same kind of sarcastic or facetious respect for Ford that many people today have for Bill Gates.While the beginning of the novel serves to describe the Society and introduce a few main characters, the novel's conflict arises when a &quot;Savage&quot; named John, who was born and raised outside of the industrialized world in a New Mexico Indian reservation, is brought to London as a subject for study. From reading Shakespeare as a youth, John has acquired compassion, sensitivity, and artistic and religious aesthetic (Huxley almost seems to imply that Shakespeare is a sort of gateway to a higher consciousness), and is horrified by the lack of emotion and morality of the inhabitants of the Brave New World. John makes a conscious decision to foresake the synthetic happiness of the Brave New World and return to living freely and naturally, but he finds that he cannot escape public scrutiny so easily.Huxley's writing has an almost cinematic quality; he is like a cutting-edge film director who edits scenes and shifts focus between various characters quickly for maximum dramatic effect. Even his images of large mechanical systems are poetic and, from an engineering standpoint, accurately detailed. To me, that's the icing on the cake for this richly conceived treatise on a nightmarish utopia."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"About 70 years ago Aldous Huxley wrote Brave New World, in hopes of setting off a &quot;semi-serious alarm&quot; as to what will happen in the future. This book deals with the problems of religion, science, art, politics, sex, drugs, and mostly every aspect that can effect one's life. And needless to say most of his predictions came true. This really amazes me and should really amaze anybody who reads it. However, I don't recommend Brave New World to most people. For several reasons, one being that this book is written in a VERY whimsical style. For example, in the end of Chapter 3, snippets of conversations are taken and jumbled up (this may seem easy to tackle; but trust me, it isn't). Second, the book is very confusing at times, this isn't a book you can read with the radio is on, you need all you attention toward the book (or else deciphering it is impossible). Third, the book has MANY very deep meanings. Huxley some how placed all of the problems of society into a book 250 pages, and you could easily assume that it is chuck full of content. Personally this is one of my favorite books. Brave New World's style is very original, nothing like I have read before. Its message it bitingly powerful, and shows exactly what this world is headed for. But for everybody who says this is better than Orwell's 1984 (or vice versa) are mistaken. The books have very little in common. Orwell is taking about totalitarianism and its various faults, Huxley is talking about the effects of Social Utopianism. So for anybody who hasn't read either, don't be mistaken by the fools who think otherwise."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"It's useful to keep in mind that Brave New World was first published in 1932. This is not the most subtle novel that you'll have read, nor the most lyrical, but in my opinion much of what makes this novel a classic is it's originality. Orwell's 1984, to which Brave New World is often compared, was more than fifteen years from being published,. This was before Ray Bradbury, Phillip Dick, or Isaac Asimov. Some of these comparisons are more relevant than others, but the point is that the genre of futurism and science fiction had not yet been born.Brave New World can be read as a critique of the direction in which our civilization is headed, but on another level it can be interpreted as a critique of where we already are.During the tour of the Central London Hatchery and Conditioning Centre, the scene which opens the book, the Director Mr. Foster states that the secret of happiness and virtue is \\"liking what you've got to do...making people like their un-escapable social destiny.\\" Those of us who through luck of birth have grown up in Western free market economies have embraced the concept of creating our own destinies, but for the vast majority of the inhabitants of our planet life's reality is much different. The concept of an \\"un-escapable social destiny\\" is not a futuristic nightmare, but a reality of the present; workers don't have their growth stunted through alcohol in their decanting fluid, but through malnutrition and disease.Perhaps Huxley's clearest statement is in favor of being awake and aware of society's ills, rather than blinding ourselves. In Huxley's brave new world, individuals achieve Foster's goal of embracing their destiny largely by staying busy, avoiding any reflection, denying their mortality, and drowning themselves in the drug soma whenever a problem arises. Brave New World carries a heavy anti-drug message, which is ironic in that Huxley would later become heavily involved in the psychedelic drug culture and would be considered one of the godfathers of the hippie movement .Huxley is a bit heavy handed in suggesting that society much pick one of two extremes (either the madness of the savage or the sterile soul-less utopia of the controllers) but in the end he uses this device to show us that there are choices to be made. An interesting observation, and one that is rarely noted, is that in the closing debate between the World Controller Mustapha Mond and the Savage, it's Mond's argument Huxley makes more convincing - or at least that is articulated more clearly. In the end the reader accepts neither, in that both represent an unacceptable extreme, but Huxley makes the point that the emotions of passion, ambition, love, and glory come with the costs of jealousy, violence, and suffering.This is a clever novel, and at times unexpectedly funny, but in my opinion I'm not sure that Brave New World ranks as great literature. In the areas of character development, dialogue, and structure it's in many ways forgettable. What makes the novel interesting is its timelessness. We now face new threats, from terrorism to nuclear war, but the novel's core message is a relevant today as it was in 1932."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"This was one of those books that I know that I should have read, half convinced myself that I had read, told everybody that I had read, but in fact hadn't. I finally got around to it. Although Huxley's novel might not merit the label of \\"great literature,\\" it is a book that has exerted an amazing influence on the intellectual world of the twentieth century and in light of recent events, remains as relevant as ever. Huxley's world of science gone amuck - where traditional ideas of morality have been forgotten, where new birth is gestated in bottles on conveyor belts, where individuality has been annihilated, and where well being and hope are dispensed in a pill - has conveniently served the purposes of those who like to argue their own political, economic and moral stances. Thus, those fervent proponents of capitalism and the western traditions see Huxley's utopia as a perfect model for those \\"ungodly\\" communist and socialist states where the individual is sacrificed for the common good; those same socialist and communist proponents see this same utopia as a model for the greedy capitalist states where consumption and exploitation have become a religion; and those moralists among us, of course, see the Brave New World as an example of what happens when traditional values of family, sex, and marriage are cast to the winds.Huxley approaches his subject from the viewpoint of a scientist and the style of the novel is that of scientific exposition. Little concern is given to character development or to the use of descriptive prose to create atmosphere or emotion. The plot plods along just like one of the conveyor belts in the Central London Hatchery and Conditioning Centre, and just when the reader gets a little weary, the author astutely throws in a bit of titilation to re-gain the reader's flagging attention.Even this reader sees Huxley's utopia in a special way. After the events of 9/11 it appears that the American public, conditioned by the present administration, has made security paramount in their lives. Huxley's World State's motto is COMMUNITY, IDENTITY, STABILITY, all of which seems innocuous enough. These traits can be viewed as being admirable. But this motto is much more than just another motto; it was created as an aftermath to a cataclysmic war in which anthrax bombs were exploding with a sound \\"hardly louder than the popping of a paper bag.\\" The Resident Controller for Western Europe, musing on the war, states that \\"liberalism, of course, was dead of anthrax.\\" I just hope that this pre-occupation with security will not create a new motto for a new American society, one that sacrifices individual liberties for the notion that we must be secure above all else, a condition ephemeral at best. Huxley's world, as he was to remark some years after the book's initial apperance, is probably closer than anybody could have imagined."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Brave New World has attracted a wealth of praise and criticism since it was first published. Some of the criticism is justified, but the book's value is undiminished.Yes, Huxley is in love with his own vocabulary; if you have any doubts on that score, read the introduction he wrote sometime after Brave New World was published, which is so &quot;highfalutin&quot; as to be ridiculous. The book itself is better, but one of Huxley's fundamental rules seems to be, &quot;Never use a two syllable word if you can use a seven syllable word instead.&quot; However, you don't really have to know what &quot;viviparous&quot; or &quot;pavlovian&quot; mean to follow the plot; most of the vocabulary can be figured out well enough from context.Brave New World is often criticized as being &quot;dated&quot; - some of the technology seems absurd by today's standards, and Huxley's portrayal of Native Americans seems far from &quot;politically correct&quot;. My response to this is, yes, if you want to get stuck on details, those would seem to be defects in the book. The same criticisms about quaint technology could be made about just about anything written by Jules Verne or Isaac Asimov; and, I seriously doubt that anyone will ever use Huckleberry Finn or The Martian Chronicles as textbooks in a sensitivity training seminar. So what? Expecting Huxley, who was born in the late 19th century and wrote Brave New World in 1932, to have a 1990's (oops, 2000's) outlook and knowledge is silly, and misses the point of the book entirely.Taken in a broader context, though, Huxley's message is as fresh as ever. In Brave New World, the social order is maintained through, among other things, instant gratification and conditioning. Unfulfilled need produces passion, aspiration, creativity, motivation, growth, and a desire to change things - all dangerous in a society which prides itself on &quot;stability&quot;.Our modern society is, of course, nothing like this. Huxley describes &quot;feelies&quot; - high-tech sort of movies, complete with impressive special effects, designed to entertain the common herd, described by one character as &quot;written by an idiot.&quot; Hmmm - stories written by idiots, complete with the latest special effects...have you been to the movies lately? Likewise, &quot;soma&quot; may seem a strange idea to the reader - but consider the alarming tendency today to medicate any discontented adolescent with Prozac. Conditioning? Political correctness + an MTV view of life + idolization of celebrities + etc + etc = ... what?One last note - Huxley himself later said that if he were to rewrite Brave New World, he would give it a different (more hopeful) ending. I suppose if anyone has a right to rewrite a book, it's the author - but personally, I'm glad he never tried. The ending _is_ depressing; but Brave New World shows where today's culture will lead, if all the worst aspects are permitted to continue to thrive and flourish. And it is a depressing place."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Soma, feelies, scent organs...these are some of the wondrous inventions which litter the landscape of Huxley's ultra-happy dystopia. From the opening scene where we watch babies being farmed instead of born this book creates a world where science and logic have wiped out individual inspiration and such petty things as love, poetry and Shakespeare. This novel is a terrific read for it's ability to create a horrible world, and yet make it seem not so bad. This is the real power of the book. While the world of 1984 is obviously a nightmare, the world of Brave New World does not seem that bad for the most part. It draws you in and makes you wonder what a movie would be like where you can feel what the actors are feeling, or what work would be like if it was always perfectly challenging and stimulating. It creates a world that you know you are not supposed to like, but which is seductive none-the-less. And this sets up the final scene in which three men argue the fate of all our lives. In which art makes a stand against easy happiness, in which love makes a stand against ignorant bliss. The last twenty pages are a tour-de-force of philosophical inquiries which makes you realize that even though you could be happy in Huxley's Brave New World, you would never be yourself. And that is the only true happiness there is."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"This book isn't so much a story as it is an interesting essay on the future, morals, society, and humanity in general. I really loved this book, but I am afraid it had the oposite of Huxley's desired effect. I was not turned away from this Brave New World. It sounded rather appealing. Maybe living in a society where truth is rationed and ignorance is bliss would not really be that bad. Some things would be missed; reading excellent books, stimulating thought, progressing by means of ambition. But all in all, who needs these things? We could just take a gramme of soma..."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Brave New World is one of the more unique and surprising novels around. Surprising for the fact that although it was written about 70 years ago, so many aspects of the society in the novel that are reality today that Huxley could have no way known about. Without giving too much of the plot away, much of the technology in the book exists today, or vey close, in a way that the author couldnt have known about. Huxley also does a good job giving his characters true human feelings for the right situations, but does not explain why people feel this way, which would have made the book perfect. There are also parts where the story slows to almost a halt, and becomes tedious to read. Other than that, Brave New World is definately recommended reading."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Brave New World was a very enjoyable, fast and easy book to read. It portrayed a futuristic world with controlled communities of trained minds, and genetically engineered people: all belonging to one another and all working together. Happiness was the main goal in these communities, and many people have agreed that it would be nice to live in a simple world like Aldous Huxley created. But in reality, can we honestly say that anyone is always happy? It would be nice to be placed in a job that you've been trained since birth to enjoy, but where is the freedom? Where is the true happiness that is earned from also learning how to suffer? Brave New World is a book that can change the way you think and also teach you to appreciate life as it is (even though we're closer to this \\"New World\\" than we were 70 years ago)."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"After &quot;Point Counter Point&quot; &quot;Brave New World&quot; is the novel that really put Mr. Huxley on the &quot;map&quot;. Although he was criticized nonstop in his time by his peers, today this novel is seen as it was supposed to be seen back in 1932. To begin with, this novel is supposed to represent a Utopia, a perfect world if you will. Happiness is wide spread, and people are broken down into categories. Alpha-plus, Alpha-minus, Beta-plus, Beta-minus, so on and so on, Greek letter after Greek letter. But, because of severe, extra severe conditioning, they like the jobs they work in, and wouldn't be happy anywhere else. Sex, and public sexual experiences are as common as soma usage. No one really cares what anyone else does, sexually atleast. They have also soma. Soma is a hallucinagene times 20, and it effects the body very little, and soma is legal. Often in this novel people take &quot;Soma-holidays&quot;, which is a bit of eternity and bliss in 6 or 12 hours. The conditioning starts before the babies are even out of the test tube, and it works very good. Bernard Marx is the first main character that we run into, some other major players are Lenina, John (The Savage), and William Helmholtz. Unlike most books, this one has no main character, there is 3 main players in this novel, and it changes back to each regularly. Bernard Marx is a hypocrite pretty much, he says something and does another. It is said that alcohol was put into his blood-surrogate on accident, because of his stunted growth, and his surreal ideas.Well, there is a lot more that I could write, but then you would get no surprises. You will enjoy this book, and I know views on this book vary widely, and I'm sure one stars on this book have some good points just like 5 stars. It depends on your mindset, and what you believe in. This novel will make you think, and I know that I will reread it in the future. &quot;Brave New World&quot; was written by a very open minded author, and if you read his other novels you will see just how open minded. Amazon gives a good deal on the book, so, if you can then I suggest you buy it here. This edition of the novel contains a forward by the author a decade or more after he wrote it, saying what he thinks is missing from his novel, and also a small biography of Aldous Huxley in the back. Enjoy!Mark_Sigel"},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"I Decided to read this book because I had heard so much about it. Especially, since Dolly the sheep came into being. Now, I wonder how many of the people that referenced this book in the cloning debate actually read it or at least read it recently.The book was great ! The point of the book was against the social conditioning that we see all around us and the orthodoxy of the dominate \\"intellectuals\\". Clones are used to show us that by allowing ourselves to be conditioned rather than thinking about ourselves and our society we lack any sort of individuality or freedom.I found the appeal to morality and God to be especially refreshing. The idea that the view of God as not being required being a folly of youth is something not heard often enough.Using this book as a reference against scientific research (cloning or any other) is particularly ironic given the following passage :\\"But once you began admitting explanations in terms of purpose - well, you didn't know what the result might be. It was the sort of idea that might easily decondition the more unsettled minds among the higher castes-make they loose their faith in happiness as the Sovereign Good and take to believing, instead, that the goal was somewhere outside the present human sphere; that the purpose of life was not the maintenance of well-being, but some enlargement of knowledge. Which was, the Controller reflected, quite possibly true. But not, in the present circumstance, admissible. He picked up his pen again, and under the words \\"Not to be Published\\" drew a second line, thicker and blacker than the first; then sighed, \\"What fun it would be, \\" he thought, \\"if one didn't have to think about happiness!\\"Personally, I think the message of the book warns against political correctness or blind faith in any orthodoxy (religious or otherwise) not cloning. What is bleak and frightening in this book is not that the faces of the characters look alike but that their minds work the same. Mental homogeneity is as frightening a prospect if it comes from TV, movies or other sources of propaganda as if it comes from a test tube."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Well if you are doubting about buying this book. Do not hesitate, buy it. It is not the best written book ever but its contents are today more present than ever. The story is supposed to happen in the future, a future that has become close to the present. But yet again, there is hope. The book can help us to wake up and think seriously about what our world has become and what we can do to avoid falling down further in Huxley's society of loveless and meaningless existences."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Mr Huxley's vision of a strange futuristic world where people are cast into different orders: Alpha being the highest &amp; Epsilon the lowest, &amp; utopian life is like the company that is publishing it now, a perennial classic. I read it for high school &amp; was impressed &amp; enjoyed it. I was reminded of it when a ferryman enthused about it which I found surprising &amp; maybe I was being as judgemental as the people who set up the system described in the book. Apparently in the early 60s a young Don Van Vliet was selling vacuum cleaners door-to-door [he is seen holding one on the covers of Hot Rats &amp; Grow Fins] &amp; knocked on the door of Aldous Huxley &amp; proceeded to tell him &quot;I assure you sir, these things really do suck&quot; [although that may seem a bit too Wayne's World-y to be true] &amp; they went for a walk in the park. Digressions aside Brave New World is a very important book, intelligent &amp; thought-provoking. I am yet to read other Huxley material, maybe I should trek off to the library &amp; see what they have."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Read this book if you want to be inspired to think about where we are now, and where we are going. You'll be surprised at many of the things in this classic!"},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"After buying this book in an airport bookshop (at the advice of my English Lit teacher) I expected it to be worth flicking through for the duration of the flight - I actually had no idea of the lasting imprint it would leave on my thoughts and thinking patterns of the way I view the social structure in which we live. In the &quot;utpoic&quot; society of the future, humans are genetically engineered to ensure their function in a pre-destined social role. Huxley carefully examines the place the individual has in a society, reviewing how self-analysis, questioning and individualistic thinking patterns can disrupt the equilibrium which keeps our community at a balance. Questions raised include - should we sacrifice individual pleasure and &quot;want&quot; to ensure the creation of a society where everyone has enough to eat, where no mass violence or brutality takes place and every-one has adequate sanitation? Or should we rebel from this lack of conrol of our pre-destined social role, and have the free mind and morals to construct our own social niche, one which we aren't conditioned against deciding? Huxley carefully creates a fully balanced, well constructed argument which relays to the reader the full, horrific consequences of what can happen if the fibre of society is dissrupted. Read this book if you want if to be presented with a convincing and stimulating examination of the exact social structure in which we function."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Huxley's Brave New World is a novel written in the thirties about genetic engineering used to create a utopian society, and shows the dangers of &quot;playing god.&quot; This book is very prophetic because our society is facing many of circumstances now in the 21st century that Huxley presented in his writing almost 70 years ago. It stands as a warning for our society as we seem to be striving for the society Huxley created even though that society was obviously not as perfect as its rulers felt it to be. Destroying hunger, disease, and old age may seem like a wonderful idea but with such things can come a great struggle for power and further control over individuals' lives. The novel really makes you think especially about our current society and how close we may be to achieving Huxley's &quot;Utopia.&quot;"},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"brave new world happens to be my favorite book of all time. an unprecedented look at society which can be applied to anytime there after, brave new world should be read by all. it could be used as a wonderful educational tool, and it should be used as one. it could easily change your views on life as you know it. words can not describe the impact this book will have on you for the rest of your life."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"This novel is a masterpiece of a Utopian novel. Aldous Huxley skill as a social commentator shines out in this terrific novel. Huxley is one of few authors that ha the ability to make the improbable seem probable. Huxley expresses the negative effects of the advancements in science. It is the idea that knowledge is power and for those who control and use knowledge holds the power. I highly reccomend this book for all to read."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"This novel looks into the future and creates a disturbing vision of social and genetic engineering creating a &quot;utopia.&quot; The subtlty of this vision, however, is that people are conditioned to be happy with the empty lives they live. Any unhapiness is remedied by &quot;soma.&quot; a drug which takes away all worries. A caste system is engineered and in the lower castes, all individuals are alike, indeed, through genetic engineering, dozens of identical siblings are routinely created. Stripped of all individuality, they are conditioned to be happy as cogs in the wheel. Romance is gone but, open sexuality is rampant and considered the norm. To abstain from promiscuous sex defies convention.Through a character named John, who is known as the savage and who comes from a separate civilization, we compare whether a life of individuality and purpose, but also with pain and unpleasant experiences, is better than the controlled life of hapiness. The &quot;brave new world&quot; is a society in which humankind is enslaved but, is happy with its servitude. Unlike Orwell's chilling &quot;1984&quot; in which the totalitarian state is held together by the frightening concept of Big Brother watching, this society needs little coercive controls. People are conditioned to to be happy with their roles in society. With some exceptions hinted at in the novel, most people are indeed happy through conditioning, open sex and &quot;soma holidays.&quot;This novel is thought provoking, and as we see paternalistic (as opposed to coercive) big government assert it's role in our lives, parallels to the &quot;brave new world&quot; are certain to be drawn."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"This book was very enjoyable, and well written too. It shows an alternate futre in which society has finally reached a utopian state. The book dramatically portays the struggles one would have to give up if they would want to live in this utopia. For example, you are predetermined from birth what you will be doing for the rest of your life. All free choice has been given up for the stability of society. One of the lacking things in this book i would have to say is the lack of details. There is no mention of how people get their individuals jobs, only on what roles they will play in society. I would have liked a bit more explanation about some of the things that were not mentioned in the book. I think that it would round out the book a little more and perhaps make the world that Huxley created seem just that much more real. One of the best parts about the book is the content, which should never be changed. It is still relavent today, perhaps even more now than when he wrote it back in '32. I think the book is actually scary in a wa since some of the things that he mentions are starting to happen. More and more the attention of our government and media is focused towards safety and happiness. This book gives a nice proposition of how we can achieve it. Personally, i am happy with how our world is today, and the only thing that i would change is to remove hate from the hearts of people. That in my opinion is a perfect society."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"First of all, a disclaimer: though this review is intended to display some of the ways I think Christianity illuminates this book, I certainly do not claim to be speaking for all Christians. These are just my thoughts...That being said, I think the most important feature of \\"Brave New World\\" is that it illustrates what happens to humanity when it, en masse, begins to depart from the classical Christian worldview. By classical Christian worldview I mean that which was best described by St. Augustine inCity of God (Penguin Classics). Without going into too much detail, the basic notion Augustine suggests is that salvation (in terms of deliverance from a fallen world) comes only in transcendent reality, and therefore people should stop expecting that a transcendently perfect reality can exist in this world.I bring up Augustine because he was relied on to a large extent by Eric Voegelin. Voegelin's writing concerning modernity and gnosticism provides a philosophical framework for understanding how the central tenets of \\"Brave New World\\" are also the central tenets of our modern world (see especiallyModernity Without Restraint: The Political Religions, The New Science of Politics, and Science, Politics, and Gnosticism (Collected Works of Eric Voegelin, Volume 5)) The connection between Augustine, Voegelin, and \\"Brave New World\\" seem to me to be this: when humanity rejects the lessons of classical Christianity and begins attempting to \\"fix\\" this world by way of various projects, disaster inevitable follows. Of course, Huxley is not espousing a Christian critique of the world. Nevertheless, I think \\"Brave New World\\" is an important book for Christians because the book illustrates the realities of humanity and the sad results that stem from those realities.Christianity aside, I think this book presents an adult version of another great book,The Giver, by Lois Lowry. If you read \\"The Giver\\" when you were young and loved it then I think you will really enjoy \\"Brave New World\\". The central tenets of the books are roughly the same. Perhaps the most significant difference is that \\"Brave New World\\" is written in a voice that is inherently sarcastic and pessimistic concerning the principle characters whereas \\"The Giver\\" does not seem to pass as much judgment on the masses as much as it is concerned with society's leaders.I've attempted to bring a couple of fresh perspectives to \\"Brave New World\\" that I haven't seen in the other 687 reviews out there. This is a great book that is an important read for our times. I would recommend this book especially for high school and college students because it is that generation who will be confronted with the challenges inherent in this book. To obtain a proper perspective a humanity's potentially damaging power is all too important for our future. I give this book four stars instead of five not because there's anything wrong with it, but simply because I reserve five-star ratings for the best. \\"Brave New World\\" is not one of the best books out there, but it is certainly a worthy read nonetheless.Another book that I'd highly recommend that is short and presents the philosophical foundation of \\"Brave New World\\" without the accompanying storyline isThe Abolition of Man, by C.S. Lewis."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Brave New World, the title taken from the famous Shakespearian play, The Tempest, succeeds on a grand scale what so many other similar books have failed to do. 1984 was not as believable; Fahrenheit 451 was not as bold or daring. Brave New World stands on its own plateau as the greatest, most imaginative and believable book ever written about mind control and the future.It begins with a detailed and often confusing description of the world Huxley has created in the future. People are divided into a caste system. Identities are eroded away. Life is made simple and easy. People are free of pressure and pain, and left to themselves to indulge in pleasure. Sex and drugs run rampant, but they are \\"controlled.\\" Everyone belongs to everyone else. Emotions exist to a limit, love does not develop. Stability and happiness are the substitutes for freedom and individuality. Children are conditioned young to think and behave in the way society would want them to, according to the caste they were born into. There is little crime, all seems perfect.....right?The second part of the novel takes us to a world called the \\"Reservation.\\" This world exists outside of the civilized world. This is our world as we know it. John, a \\"savage\\" from the outside world is brought into the \\"Brave New World\\" by two people taking a vacation. One of them is Bernard. Bernard is an outcast and teeters on the edge of rebellion, but lacks the courage to take a strong stand. He is on vacation with Lenina. She is a typical beautiful woman from the \\"civilized\\" world. She is sexually active, like all the people in the \\"civilized\\" world, and feels a strong attraction to this new outsider.Bernard and Lenina take John back to their civilized world where John is given the dubious title of \\"savage\\" and invokes curiosity and fame from the people living there. The rest of the novel is an attempt for John to adapt to the new philosophy and ideas of this new world. He never does. He reverts back to his individual self and plummets tragically towards despair and pain. He cannot cope with the \\"happiness and stability\\" of this new world of the future. He longs for the \\"freedom and pain\\" he had in his old world (which is a direct parallel to our world, and the \\"new world\\" is a parallel to the world Huxley envisioned for the future)The single most brilliant aspect of Brave New World is how deeply it grasps us in its philosophy and vision. Finally a book you can think on, think with, and think long after you are done reading it. There are two contrasting views presented here. It is difficult to decide which view we support. Is it the safe, happy, \\"new world\\" views of no individuality, but safety and pleasure galore? Or do we sympathize more with the \\"old world\\" views of freedom, pain, and individuality. Before reading this book, I would have definitely leaned towards freedom and individuality, of course, but Huxley does one hell of a job describing the benefits of the other side as well.The real choice, as Huxley intended, was for the reading to choose somewhere in the middle of the road. There are positives and negatives to each societal view presented here. The real truth is for us to decide. The story is not preached at us, but rather is told is such a marvel of a way, it actually opens doors to for our mind to expand into the depths of our own selves and how we really view the world. This is stuff we don't think about enough, but we should.Another wonderful element Huxley uses is that of his main character, John. He is not an outright hero by rebelling against this \\"new society.\\" He is an anti-hero, if you will. He struggles with his own self doubt and inclination towards violent behavior. It is all he knows, it is how he was raised. In the end, he is overtaken with temptation, and abandons the morals he had previously fought so hard to protect. Huxley exposes that we all have weakness and that no one is really a true hero. John is one of the most complex characters in the history of fiction. All the characters are beautiful and unique, and quite ironically, those who you would think to be the most ugly end up being the most likeable, and vice versa.I loved this book. It doesn't settle for easy answers or easy solutions. Huxley bravely attacks his material and does not let up the entire novel. He has created a world like no other, a world that might not possibly be so unrealistic in the future if we don't watch ourselves. This is a radiant and dazzling novel. An intelligent and heartbreaking journey. It is a Brave New World indeed.Grade: A"},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Shakespeare was able to capture little kernels of man's existence in a few words -that is why his writing is so powerful even today. Huxley's protagonist, John Savage, maintains his grasp on his own humanity through reading Shakespeare's works. And like modern American country music, Shakespeare has a stanza for any emotion you could possible be feeling. Huxley's existential nightmare is a world void of emotion-ergo void of happiness. The dictator at the time, an interestingly open-minded and progressive character, Mustapha Mond, recognizes that his conditioning has murdered the only chance of legitimate internal happiness in his bioengineered \\"perfect\\" society. The dictator seems to be the only one who empathetically understands Savage and his two confidants: Helmholtz Watson and Bernard Marx. In fact, he associates with them as equals, and does not punish them for rebelling against the brave new world-he rewards them by banishing them to a society filled with rejects. In reality, the \\"rejects\\" are people who somehow independently learn to think for themselves and search to fill a void that they do not understand.Huxley's novel is a call for morality, despite what some critics have written. He didactically exposes what infidelity and promiscuity will do to an individual's emotional sensitivity: rapidly dull it. In the novel the society's program conditions the children to fornicate without prejudice, which eventually destroys the institution of the family, demeaning the title of \\"mother\\" to a profanity. He compares motherhood to a beastly canine giving birth in the gutter to her dirty pups. But Huxley's warning should not go unheeded: an existential synthetic utopia is close at hand. We must avoid the kind of behavior today that will trap us into the void of love and emotion that he writes of in Brave New World. His other heralds include outcries against substance abuse and scientific, religious and literary censorship.John Savage was \\"rescued\\" from a reservation of savages-uncivilized and beastly people who live separated from the masses. John was the child of two civilized and dignified personages whose unfortunate circumstances caused him to be raised on the reservation. Later he is brought to the civilized world as an elementary social experiment: to see his reactions and interactions. He ends up hating civilized world, and no one can understand why. He chooses a life of solitude and eventually commits suicide to escape it.Brave New World is fantastically written, and although predictable and repetitive, it remains both simply focused on only a few main themes and deep in content, penetrating the sore spots and deficiencies of most people."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"A modern nihilistic classic. Fodder for Western consumerism mentality.This book is a horrific vision of a world devoid of free will, love, beauty, truth, and hope. Each of these vital elements of life is replaced by a counterfeit feeling: free will for social comfort; love for sexual satisfaction; beauty for socially-conditioned physical attraction; truth for convenience; hope for the mind-altering soma. It is so far from reality though, for who would want to convince us that recreational sex and mind-numbing drugs are the answers to all of our problems? Er, never mind.Originally written in 1932, this book is a warning about the dangers of progress without ethical boundaries; but I kept thinking throughout the course of this book, \\"How far off from this BNW are we today?\\" This is exactly Huxley's point--look how scientific progress keeps leading the world into his vision: genetic engineering, a growing dependency on mood-altering drugs, a softening of our sensitivities towards truth and beauty, the panacea of consumerism. The BNW sacrifices beauty, truth, and love at the altar of convenience and frolic.A beautiful thread of irony weaves throughout this utopian mosaic--and Huxley plays on our sensitivities as we realize that BNW is not paradise, but Hell. C.S. Lewis stated that Hell is a place where one gets everything one desires. Because the socially- and genetically-conditioned decanted humans have no capacity to desire more out of life, they live out their days in quiet oblivion, believing that life amounts to nothing more than obtaining a string of happy moments bridged by the mind-numbing psychological pacifier, soma. Eeeeccch.I think readers should experience the creepiness found within these pages, and then question why such feelings surround this work. What is missing from this life? Who wins the debate between Savage and Mond? For this reason, I afford this classic four stars."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Why post yet another review of a book that already has 300+ Amazon reviews available? Because too many readers come to *Brave New World* indoctrinated with the idea that it describes a &quot;horrifying&quot; future along the lines of Orwell's *1984.* But what makes *Brave New World* so memorable is that the future Huxley describes is (when viewed objectively) quite nice. People live in peace, society is prosperous, everyone is born loving his or her job and status, etc. Unfortunately, most readers today have already heard so much about the book that they automatically reject the society it depicts. This knee-jerk reaction never forces you to admit the many good aspects of Huxley's creation and to articulate why such a future is bad (if indeed you conclude that it is bad). Coming to the book with an open mind will also enable you to see it as a work of art rather than a propaganda piece."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"To my knowledge, I went through 19 years of education without ever reading what is viewed by many as a literary classic. Stuck out of town without reading material, I picked up my high school son's volume and read it in about 3 hours.Now, I know that it is considered a classic and it would be easy to just give it five stars and rave about the timelessness of Huxley's vision, but to be honest, if I'd picked it up at the bookstore unaware of its reputation, I'd give it three stars, so I did. Perhaps that says more about me than about the work, but I'm not going to pretend to like a bottle of wine just because it sells for $100+. Same theory.The book is by no means bad. It is very short. It is moderately entertaining, though despite its brevity, it actually drags at times (such as when The Savage contemplates Shakespeare for a couple of pages). There is irony in the fact that the most literate character in the book is \\"The Savage\\". The conversation between Mons and The Savage was the high point of the book in my opinion.Certainly, published in the 1930s, the book was timely in the face of the burgeoning eugenics movement and the assembly line techniques being perfected by Henry Ford (who was a eugenics supporter unless I'm mistaken). However, I've got to disagree with many that label Huxley as somehow prescient, and claim that many of his dystopian visions are somehow close to fruition. It has been 75 years, and while we have enjoyed many technological advances, I don't see us moving any closer to the type of society painted in the novel. Certainly, the kind of authoritarian regimes that make such a society possible have utterly failed.Perhaps it is the presence of works such as Brave New World and 1984 that serve to warn against a slide in that direction, but whatever the reason, I have every confidence that the freedom loving people of the world will refuse to be pushed into the kind of servitude set out in the novel."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"I couldn't stand 1984, though I'm going to make myself read it again anyway just to see how much better Brave New World really is...but so far I'm saying its a must read book."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"A disturbing yet intriguing view of what the world could be. a must read for any alternate history or sci-fi fans and I would stongly reccomend it to anyone that simply enjoys a great book."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"The best part of this book is the frightening utopian world that Aldous Huxley creates. The horrifying outcome of the abuse of technology, particularly genetic and reproductive manipulation, is made clear. The beginning is very detailed in providing an elaborate explanation of the automated world without family in which the book takes place. However, the characters and plot seem flat and even ridiculous in their simplicity and cultural and social stereotyping.

Its timeless appeal lies in the shocking parallel between this fictional futuristic dystopia and our own society today! Yes, this novel is prophetic and if we are not careful we might easily and unconsciously become immersed in a society such as the one Huxley describes. In this world, humanity has lost its humanity. Natural pro-creation and the forming of families has been replaced by decanted babies (in a frightening similarity to cloning). Each person is assigned a station in life from the inferior Alphas to the lowly Zetas. Religion has been overthrown and it is the Ford production line (so valuable in the 20th century and its fast growing car industry) that is being worshipped in bizarre, sexual rituals. People are encouraged to have tons of meaningless sex and live a life of hedonistic pleasures. People are constantly drugged up by the powerful \\"feel-good\\" drug Soma, which Huxley took from the ancient Hindu drug/drink that the gods loved to consume. Huxley himself would experiment with drugs for a higher consciousness and he would later write about this in his novel \\"Doors of Perception\\". The characters, some of them stronger than others, are all victims of this deceptively Utopian society. Bernard Marx a lower-caste man is in love with Lenina, a beautiful upper-caste woman who rejects him. Bernard was given alcohol in his blood surrogate and is consequently shorter in stature than the men of his caste. Although originally Bernard hoped he could change the world and seek meaning through all the artifice and shallow existence. Lenina lives in a blissful stupor and conformity, constantly repeating, parrot-like, all the brainwashing ditties that the world society created. The character of the bastard son of the Decanting Room Director, a Native American named John the Savage, is the true hero in the novel, though he, too, meets with a tragic fate. Enamored of Shakespeare, he longs to suffer and feel passions and emotions like the characters in Shakespeare's tragedies. He gets it all right. He falls hopelessly in love with Lenina, but when Lenina begins to get physical with him, he rejects her. He is appalled at the morally crumbling society around him. Finally, he engages in a frenzied orgy and hangs himself in a lighthouse. The world Huxley paints is not pretty, even if outwardly it's a hedonist's dream. Music is always playing, there is pornographic films as mainstream movies and drugs and sex. But it's a world that has lost all its values."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"If you are looking for one of those books that really is one of the \\"foundations\\" of science fiction then Brave New World is for you. Brave New World is set in the future when humanity has attempted to create an utopian society. It is bizarre and somewhat chilling experience, especially if you look at society today. The foreward is excellent, because it really places the book into historical context...and yes (sadly)this is the book that Tom Cruise ranted about on the Today show. Overall, an impressive book. Would be a great college freshmen novel."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"It's pretty scary to see how many situations described in this book have come true already! My interest was piqued when the toddlers, born without parents and out of anything but love, were literally shocked when they crawled or toddled too close to knowledge or beauty, i.e., books or flowers. After all, that's the best way to maintain ignorance and lack of feelings. Seems that variations of this process happen every day in underprivileged areas around the world. It certainly makes one wonder whether there are countries which would like to maintain Delta and Epsilon mentalities to benefit Alpha countries.

Great summer read! -- rowera --"},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Don't read the reviews that say stuff about Huxly writing this book as telling us \\"What our world should be like\\" because that's obviously not what it's about, if you read it.It's controversial even by today's standards and upon it's release in the thirties, I can imagine it would have been considered extremely racy, given that it's probably racy even by today's standards. Some subject matter in this book might also offend people today, such as this future society where children are encouraged to \\"erotic play\\" and there is mass drug use that people partake in regularly.But this cloning stuff, this stuff is happening RIGHT NOW with all the stem-cell research embryos and whatnot. Huxly was either exagerating his vision of what may come in our future, or he expected it. It's frightening."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Brave New World Written by Aldous Huxley is a novel based around cloning and reproduction. The author, having written the book in 1932 was not an expert in this field , therefore, some of his theories in reproduction are a little far fetched, but yet creative! The story takes place in London in 2540 a.d.; referred to in the novel as 632 years \\"After Ford,\\" meaning 632 years after the production of the first Model T car.The novel exists in a strictly man made society. There is no existing thing in this society as sexual reproduction, all members are made only by the production of the scientists in the London Hatchery and Conditioning Center. Here where the \\"humans\\" are made they are also conditioned. Each human is made for a sole purpose wether it be to be a scientist or a janitor. The idea of this Utopian society is just another way to display how these societies fail.This novel is filled with symbolism and allegories. It's scientifical ideas will give you a chuckle because of the scary similarity we are to cloning itself when this book was thought of as mere imagination when it was written. It is not that of a lengthy book although some may get frustrated with the made up terminology. I would recommend this book to someone with a taste in imagination, creativity a knack for science and a person who can enjoy a good fiction story."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"A lot has been written about the drug-controlled society versus the natural or \\"savage\\" man in Huxley's book, and while that's a significant theme, a more interesting one to me is the isolation of individualism, which I think is often overlooked here. Many books have had this theme, but few have shown such a sharp divide between society and the individual as Brave New World.A story about a society that has moved as far away as possible from the unpleasant aspects of being human, the question it raises is whether the easy elimination of these \\"disorders\\" has actually improved life, or taken something important away, no matter how unpleasant. The growth of the individual- the wisdom that comes from having been both up and down- is clearly missing; these people live half-lives. Yet, despite all efforts to sweeten life by removing all traces of the bitter, there remains a repulsive fascination with the savage, now considered unnatural in just one of many ironies to be found in the book. (Even the \\"Brave\\" in the title is ironic, since so few people strive to be any kind of courageous in this New World.) What's been created is a world where to be an individual means to ostracize yourself, to reject the instant gratification and quick fixes for what ails you. Anyone who does that is considered odd, since who wouldn't want a pain-free, always-happy life? The ultimate accomplishment of that indoctrination is to make individualism nearly impossible. That's Huxley's nightmare of the future, his dire warning of where we're headed in a hurry. The rebel or the loner is not only undesirable, it's not even comprehended by this bland society, which twists the \\"pursuit of happiness\\" into a kind of singular goal for all mankind. It's a sad world despite all the \\"happy\\" people in it, a world devoid of all real human aspirations, a stagnant world. If there's a braveness here at all, it's the unwitting willingness to forgo growth- since that often requires setbacks and pain- for the sake of total comfort.We haven't yet reached that kind of comfort level in our own society, but the rise of political correctness and how easily people claim to be offended by anything that makes them uncomfortable says that Huxley was (unfortunately) correct about the direction we tend to drift, towards a personal comfort zone that blocks out anything we deem unpleasant, even if there are valuable lessons to be learned in things that conflict with our own beliefs and desires. Perhaps more than anything, that's the real warning behind Huxley's nightmare of his Brave New World.-Mark Wakely, author of An Audience for Einstein"},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Imagine a world of hedonistic automatons conditioned, predestined, and narcotized from conception insensate to morality, religiosity and individuality.A world where material consumption grinning sardonically imprisons intellectual and spiritual enlightenment.Aldous Huxley gives one a glimpse into a future oligarchic society ruling by indifference rather than fear.How can you fight lifelong genetic and social conditioning?The parallels with \\"modern\\" societies are eerie haunting us at every corner reminding us how much we share with Romero's zombie hordes.Anesthetized by salvos of the latest celebrity gossip and fed the \\"party line\\" in the self-congratulatory unregulated cult of mainstream journalism we rarely question.

Because as the late, great philosopher Bertrand Russell said, \\"It is all likely to come true.\\"Huxley through one of his characters early on makes this startling statement: \\"[T]he secret of happiness and virtue [is] liking what you've got to do. [Techniques have to be developed so] people like [or love] their non-escapable social destiny [of servitude].\\"In this novel, this \\"love of servitude\\" has been accomplished through suitable scientific techniques. The result is an antiseptic new world where \\"[t]he world's [socially] stable...People are [artificially] happy; they get what they want, and never want what they can't get. They're well off; they're safe; they're never ill; they're not afraid of death; they're blissfully ignorant of passion and old age; they're plagued with no mothers or fathers; they've got no wives, or children, or lovers to feel strongly about; they're so conditioned that they...can't help behaving as they ought to behave. And if anything goes wrong, there's the [universal, pleasurable drug] soma [as well as recreational sex].\\"Conditioning is the technique for establishing desirable behavior patterns. \\"Soma\\" in this novel is a powerful calming and hallucinogenic drug without any serious side effects.There's \\"no mothers and fathers\\" because a foolproof system of eugenics (the movement for improving the human species through control of hereditary factors) has been mechanically designed to standardize humans in places called \\"hatcheries.\\" This mechanical standardization of humans has been pushed to fantastic though, I feel not impossible, extremes. The system of mechanical eugenics in this novel enables humans to be \\"processed\\" into classes based on intelligence.This novel is filled with numerous interesting concepts and ideas. For example, the time this novel takes place in is 632 \\"A.F.\\" A.F. stands for After the Death of Ford. This refers to Henry Ford (1863 to 1947) who was a US auto manufacturer and developer of the assembly line. (This means this novel takes place in the late twenty-sixth century.)There are basically two storylines in this novel. The first is about a person who was \\"born\\" in a hatchery but rebels against this new world's social order. The second is about a person who was actually born to a woman and thus now has trouble fitting into this new world.Generally, the entire novel is about how the advancement of science affects human individuals.This novel is excellently written. I have to admit I had difficulty at first because Huxley plunges right into his futuristic society (thus younger readers and impatient readers may have difficulty with this novel). However, I kept on reading and discovered that everything comes together by the end of the novel.Finally, after reading this novel, I recommend the thought-provoking science-fiction movie \\"Gattaca\\" (1997). I also recommend the non-fiction book authored by Huxley entitled \\"Brave New World Revisited\\" (1958).In conclusion, this is a fantastic, futuristic novel whose ideas will stay with you long after you have finished reading it. It is also a prophetic novel because many of the ideas presented may now be starting to come true!!!(first published 1932; forward by the author; 18 chapters; main narrative of 275 pages)+++++"},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Imagine our society in the future, in which people take part in casual sex with multiple partners and take drugs openly to reduce the pain associated with daily life. You may think that such a world would be Utopia, an ideal place to live. It definitely is not! This is a world where parents are unnecessary. After all, babies are created through a process of repeated splitting of a fertilized egg, producing thousands of the same individual. Each embryo is then placed on an assembly line, altered by some chemical process for the advantage or disadvantage of the new being. You're probably wondering why anyone would engineer a baby to be defective! So they can perform menial functions in society and not question their more intelligent masters. These lowly individuals are called Epsilons, while the most superior in the hierarchy are termed Alpha Pluses.In the dystopic drama novel, \\"Brave New World\\" by Aldous Huxley, a young man, known as the Savage John is torn from his home on a rural reservation in America and taken to England to experience the so-called civilized world. After being read books and taught the value of literature by his mother, an outcast from the civilized world, he is thrown into a world that has rejected free thought in favor of conformity. The tornado of emotions and arguments that are the result of this change in environments is what we as readers are exposed.On most occasions, Huxley's style is easy and quick to read. In one extended passage, he takes artistic license by skipping back and forth between scenes in paragraphs, which seems awkward at first but really lends itself to heightening the reading experience. In fact, this method allows the reader to compare character responses and actions between two very different scenes.Overall, I would highly recommend this novel. Not only are we able to read interesting fiction by a talented author, but we are also exposed to a very talented writer from the previous century. Doing this enables us to understand the perspective of people at that time. Their concerns can be digested by comparing our society to the one portrayed in the book. In fact, some scary parallels can be made between \\"Brave New World\\" and our world, especially relating to division of labor and the ability to ascend the class system. Also, the significance of morality and dedication to personal relationships are highlighted.259 pagesAldous HuxleyBrave New World1932, Perennial Classics"},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"\\"Brave New World\\" is not a straightforward dystopia like George Orwell's \\"1984\\" or Margaret Atwood's \\"The Handmaid's Tale\\". Huxley is deeply ambivalent, cynically portraying a Utopia, which may indeed be flawed, but is seemingly the only alternative to the political turbulence that existed at the time Huxley wrote the book.\\"Brave New World\\" is extremely well written, and Huxley's wicked sense of humour makes the book tonally varied. It is a disturbing, funny and challenging book that set the precedent for other futuristic dystopias like \\"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\\" by Philip K. Dick, as well the aforementioned Orwell and Atwood books. \\"Brave New World\\" is unique because it's equivocal - the reader can never be sure what side Huxley is on.Political content aside - Brave New World is a highly enjoyable book and is a good introduction to Huxley's style. I've read it a few times now, and it keeps revealing itself with repeated reads. It is densely layered, chock-full of information to make you think, and question whether you too have been conditioned. Huxley interrogates your prejudices and attitudes about sex with the compulsory child erotic play, the Feelies, and the promiscuity of the World State's citizens. Whether or not the Brave New World is preferable to our own, is up to the reader. Either way it is a must-read."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book, originally for an english class. This seems much more likely than George Orwell's 1984. I actually see many of the things in this book happening now; the disposable clothes, more sex, more birth control, test tube babies, reliance on drugs. It's all very interesting considering the time when he wrote it. I think he wrote it very well, many of the things he was writing about had not come into existence. I seem to relate quite well to Bernard in the story, being American and Latin in a Latin country at the moment. It's a combination of fitting in and not wanting to I think. I like the way Huxley Has the social classes and personal thoughts mixed in the reading. It seems to me that some day very soon many of the things in the book are very possible to occur. I'm planning on re-reading this book a couple of times to get every detail out of it that I can. Sadly this book is not for eveyone, I'm afraid you probably won't like it if you don't enjoy technology as much as I do. then again, you just may like it. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Curiously enough, \\"Brave New World\\" is about happiness. Huxley describes an anti-utopian society where everyone is happy, everyone is \\"programmed\\" to be happy while leading the life they are \\"programmed\\" to lead. And then, all of a sudden, we're facing John the Savage, who comes from a reservation, and what he asks for is the right to get cancer and syphilis, the right to become old and ugly, the right to be unhappy.\\"Brave New World\\" deals with a lot of issues that are important today, for example: do we have the right to make people \\"happy\\"? If there was a drug available that had no side effects, but made everyone content, would it be ok to take it on regular basis?The world Huxley describes is too close to reality for comfort. The world we live in hasn't become like that (yet), but then there are things like cloning, genetic engineering and other scientific \\"achievements\\" that allow changing nature - and they are accepted as normal. Man is becoming a product whose properties can be chosen as seen fit; who is bothered by the ethic problems that come along when it comes to accepting giving birth to a third female child, not a male one, really?A frequently overlooked detail of the book is that, although the human society located in the reservations is \\"better\\" than the \\"civilized\\" world and the relationships between people there are more alike those of our society, that society doesn't accept John - just because he's different and partly because of his mother's \\"sins\\".

This book changed all that (of course). It's easy to read because the language is descriptive without being wordy or archaic and VERY hard to put down because something is always happening. I planned to read a chapter a night but I usually wound up reading three or four. One caveat: read the prologue after you read the book because 1)it gives away the ending, and 2)you'll get more out of it that way."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Aldous Huxley's prediction of future societies in his science-fiction classic Brave New World is formidable, yet enlightening. This novel portrays a futuristic society in which people are literally grown in bottles and, once they leave them, only continue to live dull, regulated lives, depending on drugs, such as soma, to alienate themselves from any problem that could ever face them. It is amazing to see how our society is slowly conforming to one man's perception of the future, especially since he wrote these predictions over seventy years ago. People will soon be able to be \\"bottled,\\" or cloned, and many in today's society have already taken drugs to \\"escape\\" from this world.The only downside of this singular depiction is my complete revulsion for this future society. I believe how Huxley has portrayed this society is beautiful and allows readers to fully involve themselves in it, but the society itself is sickening. The people within the society don't actually feel, allowing them only shallow, egocentric personalities. By taking the drug soma, the characters rarely have an actual problem to dampen their conveyor belt- like lives, contributing to an unconventional trait of this novel. This novel deliberately relies on stagnant characters, instead of character development, like other novels, to achieve its effect.Unconventional or not, this book keeps a reader interested with its vivid imagery of what has become our reality. For this, it has become one of the most influential books for many people, especially for a high school student such as myself, attempting to further her reading. I feel all people should make an attempt to read this book just to experience a unique, new view of the world and to expand the scope of one's future reading choices."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"I still remember when my friend recommended this book to me almost 5 years ago. He told me that at first he thought it was a mere science fiction adventure, however after reading it, he was surprised at the depth of the novel, expecially in its critique of society. This was back when i was first beginning to question my reality and i knew at once that i would need to read it. That was probably one of the best &quot;decisions&quot; i've made in my life. This novel has now become a staple of my library, and i never get tired of taking it out to read every few months of so. The story is about a civilization void of passion, yet a person almost engulfed by passion is forced to face this harsh world. In the end, no compromise can be made between the two opposing worlds, and passion is once again sterilized from this bleek world. The gorgeousness of this book comes from its insightful handling of the conflicts that occur when the two worlds meet. Sometimes I think that Huxley must have been able to travel into the future as some of his narractive are so vividly relevant to the hot issues of today. It is hard to believe that this book was written nearly 70 years ago when it is so easy to picture our society evolving/de-evolving into the society depicted in this novel. I can easily see people hundreds of years in the future picking up this book and nodding their heads in agreement with Huxley's epiphanies. Yes, the characters may be forgetable, the style mundane at times, yet the insight of this book is so colossal, it easily overcomes these minor flaws. This is a book that is timeless because it challenges the very fabrics of humanity, the eternal struggle of man vs. his passions."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Like most other reviewers, I was required as a student to read this book (probably in high school) but could only recall one or two minor episodes and decided to give it another go as an adult. BNW is far from horrible--a few scenes are even charming--but I don't quite agree with most of the five-star reviewers here and don't think this book would endure much longer if it were dropped from public school curricula.First of all, let's admit that all the books selected for students to read in our schools are chosen mainly for brevity. Many of our \\"great books\\" are simply novella-length works that have no dirty words. In this case, what we're looking at is a short novel--Brave New World--in which all the characters are very shallow--each of them (okay, we can argue about the savage, but I'd suggest he's only a supporting player) does only one thing and has only one single, character-defining mood. This makes BNW more of a pantomime or fable than it is a genuine novel. Further, none of these characters undergoes any changes. Granted, the external circumstances will change for a few of them, as soon as the novel is over (in fact I'd really like to know what happens next)--but none of the characters undergoes a realization or awakening. Do they? They all just get moved from one societal pigeonhole to another. And the climax of the novel is a philosophical discussion, but that discussion might just as well have been presented in chapter one, since all that's needed to generate it is to get a certain pair of these characters together in the same room at the same time. The plot of BNW is just a conveyer belt to brings these two characters together. And again, neither one of them is changed by their confrontation (even if one leaves it better informed). Within these sorts of limitations, BNW probably is still a book \\"that everyone should read.\\" Just don't expect any flesh-and-blood human beings in these pages or expect more than pantomime emotions. This is a parable.I also want to point out a couple of things that the other reviewers here seem to have overlooked (no, I didn't read all of these reviews, but I did read most). For one thing, the utopia or dystopia in BNW is a Communist state. (That's probably the other reason why we all read this book in school--it was supposed to bolster our fear of the Commies and what they would do to us if they ever got the chance. Anyone who doubts that this \\"new world\\" society is communistic should notice that the two main characters are named n honor of Marx and Lenin.) True, this new society also worships Henry Ford--but they do so because of Ford's pioneering role in mass production, not for his contributions to capitalism. Since these people also worship Freud (and even consider Freud a dimension or alter-ego of Ford), it's clear that their love of Ford stems from his efforts to make our society more like an ant farm, which of course is the very same reason they value psychology. In short then, reviewers who comment that our own society is becoming \\"more and more like\\" this brave new world must have overlooked a critical dimension. If we are becoming \\"more and more like\\" these fictional characters, it's not because of Communism or the top-down governmental coercion seen in the novel, but rather it's because we have free will and a free market system that targets the pleasure principle. In other words, the reader ought not just to consider the commonalities between \\"us\\" and \\"them,\\" but also to bear in the mind the DISTINCTIONS. We are like them--but not for the reasons that Huxley predicted. We are like them because, in effect, a consumer economy which consistently targets the lowest common denominator is, equally, a kind of psychic tyranny. Or so at least this novel might suggest.Another thing I didn't read in the reviews here is mention of the fact that NONE of the characters in BNW are truly happy--and this in a society which claims individual happiness to be the paramount good. Every single character here whom Huxley considers as a distinct individual turns out to feel unfulfilled in the new brave world and--despite all the heavy conditioning they've each endured--each one secretly feels out of place somehow. Several reviewers here have concluded that all these characters are \\"exceptions\\" to the rule of a generally blissful society--but a more logical conclusion would be that they each represent the societal norm and that no one in the dystopia is as comfy--even after all their extensive conditioning--as their programmers would have you believe. In other words, don't believe all that hype in chapter one. I suggest Huxley is saying that the brave new world fails everybody--not that it works for most, but a couple of unfortunate souls might get lost along the way. If a society truly works for most, then it ought to be morally acceptable, at least under the \\"greatest good for the greatest number\\" theory. But in this book, there's a \\"new world order\\" that brings authentic happiness to virtually no one. Their whole ideology is nothing but an advertising campaign, and every citizen whose private thoughts we're allowed to peep into lives that same old life of quiet desperation we all know so well.I can't decide if I'm done with this review or not. Maybe if I get a few comments, I'll add to it later."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"One of my favorite books to read, I recommend every single person in America to read this fantastic novel.Crazy how we have been heading in this direction for a while :/I want to read more by Huxley"},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"I read this after reading 1984. It took a while to get into it and I wasn't as gripped as I was when I read 1984. It seemed to advance at a slow pace up until the death of Linda, and then following that it ended rather quickly. The best part of the book is the dialogue between the Savage and Mustapha Mond. A lot of things came sharply into focus at that point.While 1984 showed us a picture of Totalitarian control through force, and intimidation, Brave New World shows us Totalitarian control by making it's citizens so happy and well entertained that they willingly forgo their personal freedom. But the great cost is that they lose their dignity, morality, personal connections, and emotions. In other words they lose their humanity. People will do anything to be happy and will even give up the truth, that's where Soma comes in. Huxley's world is one where the primary good is happiness and stability. Truth and happiness are incompatible, as are freedom and happiness. Yet I kept thinking that it was a false choice. But that does depend on how you define truth. Huxley's book is in some ways more of a satire than a dystopian society. It carries a liberal consumer society and powerful state to it's logical conclusion. Like 1984 it reminds us to be wary of giving governments too much control and power, especially over new technologies. Those who wield power seldom relinquish it and most frequently use it further their own ends, even at the expense of others.I enjoyed the book and it was a lot less gloomy than 1984 - even with the terrible ending!

His writing- though with beautiful, high vocabulary and complex sentences- is easy to understand. The novel is simply beautiful in the way that it makes you look inside your society and yourself and showers a variety of different views on you without making it seem overwhelming.

Huxley's portrayal of a society in which rampant sexuality, class segregation, and indulgence abound is a perfect mirror of the human nature. In writing, the universe of Brave New World sounds like a utopia: people are encouraged to have sexual relations with as many people as possible, drug use and indulgence in fun are encouraged, and everybody is assigned their rightful place in society; nobody is lost. For those who want to forget, Brave New World is a perfect world. Huxley portrays the majority of society as wanting to forget, with the exception of Bernard Marx and Helmholtz Watson, both of whom seem destined to remember. The introduction of John \\"The Savage\\" into the story ensures that both characters remember the integrity, intelligence, and true emotion that the human spirit is capable of.Huxley's creation of a mocking utopia is a stark warning to today's society. Playing off of today's degrading morals and emerging genetic technology, the world that Huxley portrays in Brave New World may not be too far off if society does not return to the aspects of humans that Huxley champions in the work: true emotion, integrity, and intelligence.

Aldous Huxley definitely got aquainted with mescaline or \\"mescal\\" while he was writing this book. The setting for this story is in a way even scarier than that of Orwell's 1984. In BNW's society there is no war,poverty,or sadness, the entire population is basically sedated by wonderdrug \\"soma\\".I don't want to say much because this book is definitely worth reading and figuring out for yourself, although it may be very difficult at times.This is a great book, it is the first of Huxley's works that I have read, but I am planning on reading \\"Island\\" real soon.

Each citizen, from a physically and mentally advanced Alpha-Plus, down to an infantile Epsilon, lives by the motto of \\"Community, Identity, Stability.\\" Life is full of mindless labor, enjoyable diversions and polygamous relationships. \\"Soma\\" is the cure to all physical and emotional ailments that happen to arise.In a place where so much is predetermined and planned, the novel unsurprisingly focuses on characters that are not the norm. Bernard is an Alpha male with physical defects. Helmholtz is the epitome of an Alpha-Plus, but does not enjoy his free reign. John, the Savage, is a man who was brought up by Indians, outside of \\"civilized\\" society. Lenina is an attractive woman who tends to stray outside the normal social attitudes and actions. Because there are four major characters, the pace of the novel is very quick and never boring. Each character brings a different aspect to the fight between happiness and freedom, and in the end, each decides a victor for him or herself.What starts out as a confusing and somewhat implausible book concludes as a thought provoking must read, again and again. Through encounters in both \\"civilized\\" society and the \\"savage\\" world, Huxley successfully points out the benefits and flaws of each, leaving the reader to decide which is better.

A world where sex, and drugs are an important part of society. Shakespeare, is unknown.

He has an attachment to an alpha female, which is unorthodox because relationships do not exist and only promiscuity.He takes her on a trip to a savage reservation, where he discovers an unattractive large female whom he discovers to be the Director of Hatchery's girlfriend whom he got pregnant and left her on the reservation. Her son John, fascinates Bernard and Lenina, and they take him and his mother back to Oceania where they confront the Director, whom is terribly embarrassed and resigns. John and Bernard become instant celebrities, and the whole society focuses on them. When John realizes that society is not what he thought it was, he goes crazy, and tries to cause unrest and invoke change. Both John and Bernard soon fall out of the popular light, and the famous line John exclaims \\"Oh what a world, with such people in it!\\" before taking his own life.This book is amazing as it shows the dangers that our world is in. Keep in mind this book was written decades back and it shows what we are or could be turning into. Drugs and sex are becoming acceptable to young people, people are getting divorced, the world, the Brave New World seems it may be coming to be less fiction and more truth. In the book, they condition the people from he moment they are embryos, to not have emotions, to not think, to be promiscuous, and not to fear death, but to see it as joyful. Everyday we are conditioned to think in certain ways just like the book. Advertisement, which is all around us, is also propaganda, which influences the way people think and feel. Is Aldous Huxley a prophet or a fiction writer? It is hard to tell. This book, although typically read as a mandatory reading for high school, is a very well written science fiction that provokes thought and discussion. I enjoyed this book very much and saw it as a necessity for all people to read. Awareness, is a key to prevention."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"This book is quite simply on of the better sci-fi books that I have ever read. Aldous Huxley, has done a wonderful job predicting (back in 1932) what he thought might become of our world.The story starts of in Central London's Hatchery & Conditioning Centre. In this world, which takes place in approximately 2500 A.D. (or in the book 632 A.F.) people are 'made' in tubes, and conditioned in the way that they should go. Similar to 1984, the totalitarian government is based on a simple motto, \\"Community, Identity, Stability\\". Nonetheless, this government does not rule its people by force as in 1984 or Fahrenheit 451. Instead, the government provides it people with constant \\"happiness\\", thus ensuring social stability. There are five distinct groups that make up the \\"Brave New World\\" and each group has an intricate part in the social system. There are Alphas, Betas, Deltas, Gammas and Epsilons that make up the entire caste system. Basically the Alphas are bred in a way that suits them (they hold the most important positions) while the lower caste members are bred to be laborers. From their manufacture (or birth) these toddlers are conditioned in a number of ways in order to fit into their part of society. They are taught nearly everything that would condition them into having a happy life. From the early ages children are encouraged to partake in heavy sexual activity and drug use (and other vices that will keep them happy). The major aim of the government is to make the people happy, thus ensuring social stability.The story follows a few different characters, as they live in this world. In the beginning, the reader is introduced to Bernard Marx and Lenina, a man and woman living in this dystopia. The story follows their experiences in the world as they know it, and then it follows them into a trip to visit the Savages. Without giving too much of the story away, a new character emerges, John, who is a savage. The latter half of the book deals with his experience in the \\"other world\\"All in all, this book was a great read. I believe that Aldous Huxley did a wonderful job in predicting what the world would become. Although Orwell's 1984 gets more attention, Brave New World is a better vision of what our world has become. It is difficult to read the story without seeing allusions to our modern day government. For example, sexual promiscuity was used by the world state in order to distract people from the real problem. Arguably this is the same thing that is happening today. In the foreword (written in the early sixties) Huxley joked about \\"marriage licenses being sold like dog licenses, good for a period of twelve moths, with no law against changing dogs.\\" Huxley speculated that as political and economic freedom diminishes sexual freedom usually increases. Similarly, people are encouraged to become involved in mindless activities in Huxley's world that includes drugs and music (similar to what goes on today). The point is, the happier that people are, the more unlike they are to care about what goes on around them. Huxley did a wonderful job of explaining this compared to our current state. This book should definitely be on every high school students reading list. It provides a fascinating account of religion, philosophy, and social stability wrapped into a great story. Read it!"},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Brave New World is one of the landmark books of the twentieth century, now widely regarded as a classic. Like many, I first read this book at school many years ago; it is a tribute to the power to the book that even after that experience I still hold it in high regard.Brave New World is Aldous Huxley's dystopian (not utopian) vision of the future (the far future when he originally wrote the book, although it seems much closer now). As such it blends together science fiction and social commentary.Huxley's future is one of universal happiness although it is a facile, passionless happiness. Children are created on a production line with their social status (denoted by Greek letters) predetermined; this social status is then reinforced through chemicals and conditioning (in their sleep). Happiness is maintained chemically (mainly through a drug called soma) and by allowing the people to lead largely responsibility free lives devoted to pleasure, principally sex. Physical perfection is the norm, nobody reads (or thinks), religion has disappeared (God manifests himself by his absence), and there is no conflict: it is a global society of peace, harmony and happiness for all.Into this world Huxley introduces his principle protagonist - John the Savage - a young man raised outside of this society. John is self-educated, largely through reading the works of Shakespeare. The book examines John's impact on this society (minimal) and its impact on him (huge and inevitably tragic).Huxley writes well and creates a compelling book describing a society that fascinates and repels. However, the book is not without problems - the characters have no depth (because they really do have no depth). John is an unrealistic, unconvincing character, he is only there to generate conflict. I suspect the passage of time has been unkind in this respect - we struggle to empathise with John, as his attitudes no longer reflect those of the reader. Huxley is not interested in people; he is interested in exploring the society. He does this effectively and entertainingly but this is not a character led story.Brave New World is often bracketed with 1984. This is a difficult comparison for Brave New World as Orwell is a better writer and 1984 is a much better book with a more complete and better-realised vision of the future. For much of the twentieth century 1984 also seemed to be a more accurate & realistic vision of the future but in my opinion that has changed. Today, the scenario envisaged by Brave New World seems quite prescient and much more likely - at least in the sense that happiness will be used to control society (at the expense of freedom).A great book and well worth reading - highly recommended"},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"This famous novel appeared in 1931, in the uneasy period between the two World Wars, and has become a Twentieth Century Classic. The story is a fable set far in the future of the dangers of materialism, an uncritical faith in science, and totalitarianism. At its most basic level, \\"Brave New World\\" is a satire on the possible course of communism (note the names of some of the main characters: Lenina and Marx) and a defense of classical liberalism. In the early 1930's, in the midst of world-wide Depression, communism had considerable appeal to many writers.The people in Huxley's \\"Brave New World\\" are raised in test-tubes rather than \\"vivaparously\\" and sorted before birth into various classes of differing capabilities. An overriding feature of the society is sexual promiscuity and the absense of love and close emotional relationships. Feelings of depression, anxiety, or loneliness are handled by a drug, soma. Classical works from mankind's \\"primitive age\\" including Shakespeare and the Bible are banned. In their quiet but firm way, the leaders of the sociey enforce conformity and consumption. The society's heroes are Ford -- whose name is used in many oaths -- and Marx.Huxley describes his society with a great deal of detail which makes his dystopia (a term for a negative utopia) seem convincing. The writing is sharply-drawn and satirical with passages of real eloquence near the end of the book when Huxley discusses his vision, at that time of his career, of human possiblilty and freedom. The plot of the book centers upon a character called the Savage who is brought to England from a primitive Indian reservation in New Mexico where, somehow, he has read Shakespeare and practiced a combination of ancient Indian ritual and Christianity. He falls in love with a woman named Lenina. One of Lenina's sexual companions is Bernard Marx, who has developed doubts about the totalitarian society in which he finds himself and ultimately is banished.This novel is subject to a multitude of interpretations. Huxley's dystopia differs greatly from the forms of totalitarianism that have plagued the world in the Twentieth Century. In some respects, Huxley's dystopia seems mild compared to them. Furthermore, I don't think it useful to take Huxley as a critique or as a description of, say, current society in the United States or in England. There are many differences between our world and Huxley's dystopia, and it is not clear to me that we are headed in the direction \\"Brave New World\\" feared.I think \\"Brave New World\\" shows that even with a smiling face and taken at its best, a totalitarian society is a horrible affair in its denial of individuality, love, and spirituality. The dystopia is a paradigm to be avoided more than a prophecy of the way some cultures may be headed or a description and condemnation of a current state of things.I found Huxley's forward to \\"Brave New World\\" written twenty years after the book highly enlightening and a perceptive review of the famous work he wrote as a young man. Huxley critiques his novel for presenting an \\"either-or\\" situation which did not fully consider options either to the Savage's reservation life, with its attachment to superstition, or to the \\"Brave New World.\\" In particular, Huxley argues in his forward that a life or religious reflection and contemplation is the best way to avoid the horns of the dilema set forth in his novel. Huxley came to believe in natural (non-revealed) religion and in the possiblity of approaching the transcendent through individual experience. Thus, in his forward, Huxley writes with respect to going around the horns of the dilemma of \\"Brave New World\\": \\"Religion would be the conscious and intelligent pursuit of man's Final End, the unitive knowledge of the immanent Tao or Logos, the transcendent Godhead or Brahman.\\" Huxley also supported economic decentalization and was highly critical of the passions of nationalism.I found it revealing to consider how Huxley's thinking developed over the years from \\"Brave New World\\" as suggested in his forward. Huxley went on to explore human consciousness through the use of the drug mescaline -- ironically given his treatment of the drug,soma, in \\"Bave New World\\" and wrote about it in his book \\"The Doors of Perception.\\" But I think Huxley's ultimate thoughts were expressed in his anthology \\"The Perennial Philosophy\\" -- a collection of mystical writings from many traditions. Huxley saw in the path of contemplation a way open to all people regardless of creed to experience the divine and to come to an understanding of themselves. This was his ultimate path to wisdom and to avoiding the perils set out in the \\"Brave New World\\"."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"This novel centers around outsiders: sane men in insane societies where art, beauty, and all the profound things in life are replaced with the sensual pleasures. Wacky hijinx ensue. Huxley envisioned this as the ultimate totalitarian state: one where everyone is happy and content with their stations in life, but no one is as free as they think. People are born into the system, live their lives in it, and die in it without ever realizing it exists. To Huxley, this was the way the world was inevitably heading. Both satire and prophecy, some of his predictions have played out as inevitable concequences of where the world was heading when he wrote this. Obviously, others have not. I recommend you read and then decide for yourself how much creedence his ideas deserve."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"This work was great for the period it was written and should be seen and appreciated as that- it made it's impact and helped steer our society away from such a repressed future - we've learned to be more open, casual and physical play has become more validated for men and women- If you want to stimulate your brain towards a likely future (or perhaps one we will just miss by a hairline) from our present standings, I'd read Utopian Reality- it is our times version of Brave New World or 1984 but with a new warning of what we have to steer away from-"},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Many books, such as Aldous Huxley's classic \\"Brave New World\\" go beyond the scope of science fiction: they are also meant to be used as a cautionary tale, to warn the reader of future possibilities in daily life.By showing what the future may be like, Huxley manages to do this in a very frightening way. In Brave New World, nobody is born through natural means, rather, they are all born through test tubes. The people that create you also decide how you will turn out in the future: by giving you doses of alchohol, as well as harmful electric stimulation in your infant years. This decides if you are as smart as an Alpha, or grouped with the slow Epsilons. Alphas generally get good, high paying jobs, while Epsilons are often the janitors, the elevator operators, and the garbage collectors.However, you are made to like what you are. Whether you are an Alpha, a Beta, a Delta, or an Epsilon (all groupings of your intelligence) you are happy with your placement. You are trained to like what you are, and wish never to be at a higher or lower level.All in all, society is a utopia: everyone is happy. Enter one man, however, and you wind up with a dystopia, where not all persons and individuals are happy. Bernard Marx, a disaffected sleep specialist, begins to feel unhappiness, and dislikes the benovent totalitarian dictatorship ruling over the world.Although there are no wars, no poverty, and no crime, Marx is still unhappy. Everyone around him is almost always high off of soma, a drug that is meant to keep the citizens calm. Promiscuous sex is also encouraged, although birth is not.However, Marx and his new cohort, John the Savage, feel the need to change the ills of this dystopic society. The society they live in is a society of constant consumerism, and the time is 632 AF (after Ford). They dislike the way of life, and eventually, Mustapha Mond, one of the powerful rulers, begin to interfere in their thoughts.This excellent novel provides a cautionary tale of dystopia, as well as the destruction of the individual.The only problem is, that in this world of madness, it may take a few readings to truly understand the comical satire that Huxley is preaching.One last remark: I say this is satire because people and citizens are born into their roles in society. Alphas are born to be doctors and lawyers, while Epsilons are born to be laborious workers. This reminds the reader of the monarchial system in Britain, where the rulers are born in their positions. Thus, the satire is strongly evident in perhaps one of the greatest cautionary tales in American history. Much along same lines, I'd like to recommend a second book, much less known, entitled WILL@epicqwest.com (a medicated memoir) by Tom Grimes, a strikingly hilarious satire of a world gone mad with consumerism, where prozac has replaced soma as the calming drug and our innundation in relentless, mind-numbing corporate marketing disguised as quasi-information threatens to kill us all. WILL@epicqwest.com and Brave New World are two books that will alter the way you think. Check them out!"},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Brave New WorldOur future may be closer then we think. This book offers a glance into the future that shines some light on our present. Aldous Huxley book, Brave New World, has earned its four star rating, because it gives a good description of what our future could possibly be like. The main goal of Huxley \\"system\\" is to keep people happy and to motivate them to consume as much information as possible. The main character is a naturally born and bred person who comes into this world and urns to be a scientist. Huxley does a good job of detailing the factory state and reasons for its development. Many may think we should strive for a perfect race; however, until we realize that we will never be perfect race, we will never achieve perfection. I believe Huxley was trying to say that a superior race may be the way of the future; there would not be any deformities and every one would be equal unlike us; but never the less our individuality makes life worth wile. This book may help others understand how things to come may be, it may keep people open minded about our future.The first part of the book is mainly about a young man named Bernard. He was made as one of the more intelligent humans. Everyone in this society is manufactured to do a certain job, and people are taught to serve the production. They are programmed from the beginning to work toward certain mottos and sayings, community, Identity, and stability. Ernard is treated sometimes as a outcast because something went wrong during his conception, and he turned out small and weak. He is often alone and criticized. Bernard has his own ideas and visions of life. He wants to know what it might be like to have a wife and a child. Bernard knows a pretty girl named Lenina, but she does not possess Bernard's new age ideas and visions. Bernard and Lenina decided to go to New Mexico to visit a savage reservation. When they got there, Lenina complains about all the horror and the smell. She forgets her soma at the hotel and has to suffer without it. Soma is a drug invented for people when they go on holidays and outings.The story line concentrates on the savage's experiences in this brave new world. Only to find that it does not live up to his expectations and dreams. In the beginning Bernard Marx (the person who brought him to the civilized world) and his quest for happiness and a love-live, also finds problems with society, but still craves what it has to offer him. For a while the savage is the key but it does not last.The book has been written decades ago and the fascinating thing is that the described civilization actually comes pretty close to today's industrialized nations.I do not like science fiction books that use monsters or extremely unrealistic technological inventions. Aldous Huxley tried to predict the future in a very realistic way, based on certain trends that started developing during his time. He did a great job and it is not too unlikely that the future that's still to come will actually be very, very close to the future he writes about.I have read the book three times now and I keep finding interesting details that I had not noticed before.This is much more than science fiction. It often has more connection with psychology. It's not just a vision of the future but an accurate a look of the mindset in today's world. It is no imaginary vision, just the world of Huxley. I remember when my friend told me to reed this book. When I first opened it I did not understanding much of it, but somehow it always said that this was a book I should read. Well now I am done and my feeling wasn't Wright.This is a great book, but not easy to read. If you like your fiction nice, fluffy and happy, then this won't be your cup of tea at all. If you like books that not only have a strong plot but are also thought provoking, you not only should read this but you need to."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"if youre a George Orwell fan or has already read the Russian &#34;We&#34;, you must read this classic.

This, and books such as Lord of the Flies, were really my introduction to thinking and caring about the way people and societies work.I still give it 4 stars but for slightly different reasons. Yes, the technologies are outdated and the reader has to get past that. The 'savage' character is rather over the top but is therefore useful to look in from the outside at the other characters who could be everyday members of our community. The current trends of society are the same as governments, religions, and industry attempt to stabilize, control and profit from the public. There is a willingness by at least some of the public to accept these trends but I don't believe any readers will identify themselves as Gammas or Epsilons. Huxley was able to draw a picture that is extreme but is naggingly familiar.I will dig out my old paperback with its notes and read it yet again. Yes, it is old and a bit tattered, but I refuse to throw it away and buy new."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Good book. It was a book for my son's English class. He enjoyed the book. The book was in great condition."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"CAUTION: The cover shown is NOT the cover of the book you receive. I was a little disappointed because I wanted this cover but I still got the book I wanted."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Huxley's Brave New World is a choppy, disjointed, not so harmonious account of a future in which everyone is genetically engineered and conditioned to be happy. Should anything unhappy occur, there is always soma, a plant derived drug on which the entire society is dependent. In this 'Brave New World' the terms 'mom' and 'dad' and 'parents' have become such curse words. Every member of society was conceived in a lab, the less important members conceived in multitudes, creating up to 96 identical people who are destined to perform the same mundane task their entire life, and be happy about it. Everything seems to be going very smoothly, until an 'Alpha' (member of the highest caste of society) by name of Bernard takes a vacation to a 'savage' reservation. When he returns, he brings with him John, a savage from the reservation. John, raised in a world of vastly different morals, struggles to assimilate into a society in which monogamy is shameful, babies are developed in bottles, and no one has ever read Shakespeare or the Bible. Huxley's book feels like a commentary on communism and socialism, but it is hard to care about the message he is sending, when none of the characters are engaging enough to identify with. It almost seems as though Huxley had a great idea, but couldn't quite make a story out of it. Overall, an interesting idea, poorly developed."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Despite its existence since the early 20th Century, this novel remarkably continues to unravel a future that contains progressively disturbing similarities to that of ours. Such conflicts as science and religion, beauty and flaws, society and solidarity, love and lust, indulgence and morality, life and death... are all questioned in this quest for happiness and meaning of life. I found this book thought-provoking by the end.The book introduces several characters, the first one being Bernard Marx who didn't quite fit into this perfected and almost mechanical civilised society; later on he visits a 'Savage' camp that is part of the 'old' world, which hadn't been modernised and still remained cultural, uncivilised and 'flawed'. Throughout these journeys, comparisons between the two worlds are evident, and the book explores the conflicts as well as the connections between the individuals that struggle to live in them.You would need to read the book through to the end in order to really appreciate its entirety; I personally found it a little bit of a struggle to get through sections sometimes because of the elements and concepts that you had to grasp, but once you've accustomed to it and reach the end of the book, it really is worth the read."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"What an ominous, yet prophetic, beginning to this masterpiece of the dystopian genre. Huxley, ostensibly before his massive procurement of hallucinogenic mind-altering drugs, delivered one of the most profoundly provocative, albeit disturbing, works of the 20th Century. Although the beginning is somewhat prolix and a bit detail-oriented, Brave New World shines brilliantly the rest of the way through this ingeniously written magnum opus.I must admit that Huxley's class distinctions are readily apparent even in today's society - even without genetic cloning. Every time I encounter some icompetent ingrate, I can't help but consider him an Epsilon semi-moron - how apropos. Although many of the foreboding elements Huxley delineates throughout Brave New World are somewhat outrageous, I must admit that the ubiquity of the Feelies, soma, sexual promiscuity, declining societal moral values, as well as the pervasive obsession with maintaining one's youthful appearance, emanate, as much, if not more, abundantly, in today's society, as they do in his timeless classic.Perhaps Huxley became somewhat deranged and deluded later in his career, nonetheless, he still had his wits when he penned what is undeniably one of my top 10 books of all-time.Brave New World proves to be a most uniquely novel idea of a novel(pardon the pun). It comes highly recommended as it is pure unadulterated brain candy."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"I first read this book about 30 years ago and it is just as fresh and relevent today as it was back then. It involves a \\"perfect\\" society where people are conditioned at birth to accept the station they are assigned in life. Sexual inhabitions do not exist. As a result all people are happy and crime is virtually unheard of. This \\"perfect\\" society is threatened by a group of \\"savages\\" who want to overturn society and bring things back to the way they were before. Compelling reading. This was probably the inspiration for the film \\"Demolition Man.\\""},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"I got Brave New World off my moms bookshelf almost 9 months ago not knowing anything about it but having heard the name before and being intrigued by the title. Last week I finally got around to reading it during a very long car ride and I was transfixed by it. Having read other reviews by people on here the main trend seems to be along the predictions by Huxley about genetic engineering and other technological advances. While the book does have very accurate descriptions of genetic manipulation for being written during the Great Depression, my attention was on the replacement of religion with consumarism.Being written just after the roaring 20s and the emergence of the consumption society, the world in Brave New World is the logical final step in the society Western Civilization has developed into. Not only are people programmed from conception to enjoy whatever job they've been pre-destined for, but they're also conditioned to perpetuate the machine they're being grown to keep up. The concept of fixing things is abhorrant and the entire culture is bulit on maintaining conformity and buying products.What's shocking is that in my opinion this is going on now with media. Its no secret that commercials try to alter your subconcious in an effort to develop a need for a product, but advertising is everywhere, not in the direct selling manner of TV commercials, but in the slow altering of what you feel you need. Ask a teen why they need a shirt from Abercrombie that costs $50 when they could get something that looks the same without the free advertising, for $10. If you ask the right questions, it always coming back to conforming to their friends expectations. Even the goth culture is commercialized now.My point is that in this day and age the media(owned by multi-armed corporations) are constantly berating every person in western society with \\"buy, buy, BUY\\" until they do. Compulsive shopping is a problem for more than a few people. Fight Club attacks the culture this phenomenon has produced and Brave New World shows what would be the ideal scenario for General Electric and Viacom and Disney and any other corporation that depends on people buying things they don't need.The people of Brave New World are ingraned with the inate need for purchase like some psychologists claim people nowadays need religion to feel whole. Consumerism replacing religion creates a new alien society that John the Savage is incapable of dealing with just as his mom was never fully capable of adapting to life outside her civilization.As a whole, Brave New World is as thought provoking of a novel as I've ever read. I will admit I havent worked on 1984 yet even though I've had it for years but I do plan on getting to it soon. There are many facets in the novel like the island for free thinkers, the fact that Huxley uses the last names of prominant Socialist thinkers for many of his main characters, the stigmas on sexual modesty, ect., ect., there are too many to mention and it was only a 220 page book."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"I had to read this book for English class in eleventh grade. I didn't want to like it, especially since I hadn't liked any of the other dreary books we'd read that year. But this is a brilliant book, and I have to admit I liked it. This is no pleasant dream of the future. Like 1984 and Animal Farm, and even Lord of the Flies, this book takes a look at the darker side of humankind. What happens when capitalism becomes a religion and human beings are created in a lab? Where sex and drugs are the cultural rule and reading Shakespeare is taboo? It's a chilling picture, despite the outdated technology and references. It gives us a look at the dark side of capitalism as well as the power of words and symbols over the human mind. It's brilliant, provoking, frightening and unforgettable."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"In a soulless future world, genetic engineering programmes people from birth for their status in society, and removes all aggressive or unproductive instincts. Individuality, creativity and personality are sacrificed in the causes of material prosperity, good health and freedom from anxiety. Only a small group of &quot;savages&quot; - people like us - survives, in a community in New Mexico, and one of them escapes and is brought into the &quot;real world&quot;, with tragic results. As in all his novels, Huxley tells his tale soberly and without comment: the flatness of his prose brilliantly intensifies the horror of what he is saying. Nothing truly terrible happens - and that is the most terrifying thing of all."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"In my opinion, this is quite the book. It is a bit scary, though; because of how plausible it all sounds. The basic premise is this: it's a perfect future society where people are made into who they're supposed to be, common grunt worker, or intellect. Also, people are conditioned by listening to the same thing every night, to believe that it doesn't matter if someone dies, because society lives on. If something does threaten this perfect society, there is always soma, the perfect drug with no side effects. Well, Bernard Marx and Lelina Crowne go to a &quot;savage&quot; reservation, to see how people who aren't in &quot;culture&quot; exist. They stop there, and meet a young man named John. It turns out that he is actually a civilized person who grew up with the savages. They learn that his father was a man Bernard knows and dislikes intensely. So they bring John back to civilization, partly to ruin Bernard's enemy's life (you have to understand, &quot;mother&quot; and &quot;father&quot; are considered swear words.) They also do it partly to do experiments on him, to see if he has any conditioning, since both his parents did, but he hasn't. When he first gets to civilization he thinks it's great. Then he starts to realize that everyone is basically a zombie high on soma or civilization, and that no one really thinks on their own. The price for the perfection of society is art, literature, religion, and God. When he sees twins being conditioned not to care about his mother's death, he sort of snaps, and to see what happens, you'll have to read the book. I give this book a very high review, and part of the reason is it seems like it could happen. Right now, obviously, we don't make ninety-four twins from a single fetus, or put alcohol into the fetuses of the babies we want to be dumber. People can already pick if they want their kid to be a boy or girl, though, so it's not that big of a step to make their kid smart or stupid. I really liked most of this entire book. The only problem! , and it was very slight, was that parts of it were pretty hard to understand. Maybe that was part of the &quot;atmosphere&quot; or something. Another thing I liked was the ending. It was not a happy ending. I'll just leave it at that for those of you who haven't read it. If you're into science fiction, future doomsday stuff, or good literature, this book is for you."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"This book is excellent and i highly recommend that everyone read this classic but this version is missing pages.

This world wants nothing that cannot be proved scientifically (much like our present). They are cold and love nothing but their leader, their free sex, themselves. They are also cosmopolitanistic, everyone being members of the world rather than regions. They wish for a government-rationed drug to ameliorate the problems of the people, actually allowing for the ignorance of their own problems. Life, human dignity, family, love, hate; all of these concepts can no longer be defined in all seriousness without laughing out of nervousness.What if your essence came from a test tube? What if ten last names existed for two billion people? What if promiscuity were normal and expected? What if you slept as a child with morals drilled into you as you slept? What if your life began on a conveyor belt (possibly never really leaving)? What if your existence in the socio-economic status was determined before you were even born? As you read this book you will see that this is our world in a rudimentary sense. And as you read this book you will find that many of what Huxley writes about is hauntingly true. For instance, the laws of our multi-dimensional world break down into a mere height-breadth world over the Internet, as there are no regions of neither space beyond this nor time, as anything including visions and plans for the future can be accessed with the greatest of ease. People in the poorest conditions delve into television to forget their problems. Others allow themselves into the interenet to do it.Mr. Huxley also pokes the ribs of the newly-formed U.S.S.R. with names such as Lenina and Bernard Marx (keep your eye on this one; he proves quite interesting). The entire time he also makes fun of religion and reverence in the world, with Ford as the central figure.This novel takes place in the future, known as 632 A.F., our equivalent of 2349 A.D., in what was once Great Britain, and in many different places at once, often flipping from one scene to another without much warning, so keep at it. The caledar doesn't tend to make for too many difficulties, but the Great Britain influence is a presence that may trip you up. I believe you will thoroughly enjoy the book, or you will be so frightened of what it says that you will wake up at night in cold sweats. Either way, it is entirely enlightening, and you can definitely say that it will &quot;flip you out&quot; or &quot;messed you up,&quot; whichever coloquialism you prefer. Trust a disembodied Internet &quot;voice&quot; and purchase it. If you honestly don't like it, I'll buy it from you; I wouldn't mind reading it a third time. (I would love to hear personally what you have to say or ask [if need be] on this or any other book."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"This story comes across as overly philosophical and preachy - particularly at the end - which I found somewhat of a letdown. Whatever happened to Bernard Marx and Lenina?The scenic factor is good during the first half of the book. We get a sense of Huxley's foretelling of escapist Club Med style vacations and internet porn. We do currently live in a society where many people are afraid to face themselves and worship trivialities from sports to cars to senseless movies.The latter half of the story becomes more of a culture clash between the \\"Savage\\" and the \\"New World\\" and at this stage dwindles. The dialogue between Mustapha Mond and the \\"Savage\\" becomes like a college lecture. The abundant Shakespeare quotes certainly added to the collegial and contrived feeling.The death of the \\"Savages'\\" mother was compelling and emphasizes the New World obsession with hiding unpleasant emotions and facts.Lenina is somewhat of a dopey character and ironically gives a prudish attitude to the story. There is a repressed sexuality throughout which gives it an affected Victorianism."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"this book came in great condition and the standard shipping was very quick!

I've read some of his other work, studied his life a bit, and found him to be a pretty cool dude; he was intelligent, curious, and fearless.He was also pretty dark.This book is a wonderful examination of the present (back then) projected into the future, where subtle issues of the day are allowed more time, and through technology, more ability to express themselves.As interesting as the topics of industrialization, government control, and &quot;what happiness is&quot; are, I was dissapointed that (as creative as the man was) he couldn't render a better alternative to a world that had become a very scary and dark place. For instance, in a society as techologically advanced as the one he describes, why would they abandon efforts to reach immortality? Take away that spector and it would materially change the relationship between man and happiness, and his use of drugs to augment it.But alas, it's easy for me to be a critic. Bottom line, this is a wonderful and worthwhile read.Enjoy..."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Although this book was written over seventy years ago in the midst of mass production, the message is timeless. With the industrial revolution to look back on and the onset of the idea of mass production at the time this book was written, technology becomes the antagonist. Huxley paints a picture of a future where capitalism makes humankind into just another commodity. People in this society are manufactured and graded within the hierarchy like chickens in a hatchery. This book will bring forth ideas of what we as individuals want from a society and what aspects of it are important. The message is timeless because it applies to how we live today. This book touches other aspects like sexual attitudes, social importance based on birth as opposed to merit, tolerance towards violence, the use of drugs for recreational purposes (which proved to be prescient considering when it was written) and the important of high art to provoke thought. This book is pretty small and yet is full of ideas. The book is terse and the characters in the story are flat to establish the conflicts and move the plot along. If you've read it in high school as I have you'll still enjoy it many years later."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"I read this book for English class last year and was blown away. This book is amazing! It cleary shows what destruction human beings are capable of, and what the world might evolve into. If you read closely and think about the world today, you will notice that we have some things in common with Huxley's vison of the future world. I think this is a must read."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"This book is not intended to be a vision of the future, though that is it's fictional setting. Instead it is a story about freedom, or lack of it, about society and our role in it and about conflict between different belief systems. In that regard Huxley does a remarkable job - he uses an interesting story and landscape to provide insight into the human condition in the 20th century and beyond.It is set in a fictional world where people measure time since Ford (as in the motor company's founder) - 360 AF. Ford has become a deity, the founder of modern society through his ideas about manufacturing. Of course the society presented has little or no bearing on Ford's ideas but then hypocrisy looms high in this world. The society is highly structured, it has a caste system dividing people into groups from the Alphas (the thinkers, more individual, highly revered) to the Epsilons (conditioned for no more than menial labor having deliberately stunted development).The conditioning of society is key. Babies are bred, not born. Conditioning starts in the testtube and continues through sleep hypnosis and role play through life. Huxley takes the idea of conditioning too far, in my opinion - I think our genes provide too powerful counterweights to this conditioning but it's easy to accept the idea. Society is controlled by a readily available mood enhancing drug called Soma, by the uniformity of it's people (a process has been developed to cause the development of many many identical children from a single fertilized egg), by mindless pornographic entertainment and freely available sex and by the conditioning allowed.It's here that we find the most interesting parallels - are we using mood enhancing drugs too much? Is entertainment just a pap to the masses? We certainly feel a sense of discomfort from the extreme forms presented in the \\"Feelies\\" but are we really that distant?Set against this are characters who rebel, who feel they are repressed, who feel the need to be alone, who want to pair with a single other person instead of being promiscuous, who feel individual ford-dammit! In the extreme this is represented by \\"The Savage\\" - a boy born of a mother who came from the world Huxley portrays but is accidentally left in a reservation where the backwards old-world (e.g. our world) ideas persist. The savage does not fit in in either world - rejected by the other members of the tribe for being the wrong color and for the promiscuity of his mother, found to be too weird in the conditioned \\"modern\\" world where his ideas are too weird.It can easily be argued that Huxley has created too extreme characters - particularly in the savage who is into self-mutilation and extreme sacrafice. However, it is by the use of these characters that some of the subtleties come out and so long as we see them as simple foils I don't think we need to get too caught up in them.It's too easy to view this book as some kind of vision of the future and laugh. In one very early episode they are showing new employees around the bottling plant (the bottling of fetuses of course!). There is all this technology to manufacturer babies according to precise specifications and then the proud guide indicates the massive *card* index needed to record it all! However, as I started, this isn't a vision of the future, it's a fictional world which acts as a bedrock for the presentation of ideas and it's the ideas which are the beauty of the book."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"I listened to this book on audiocassette, and as I listened, I kept asking myself - what is Huxley getting at? What is he preaching with this book? It was obvious he had a point. But I don't think the point is as obvious as we (the people of 2003 - living in a type of Brave New World) assume it to be. It is not condemnation of utopia. That is too blatently obvious throughout the book.I think Huxley was hinting at something more subtle. Perhaps he himself did not understand the answers to the questions he was exploring.Personally, I think that the most interesting issue in Brave New World is the way that Huxley deals with the existence of God and mankind's basic need for a supreme being. Yes, Huxley painted a clearer portrait of the future than even he could have guessed. Yes, Huxley was a master at pointing out the tragic trend of people to distract and amuse themselves without thought, for the purpose of avoiding truth. But - I think that his real emphasis was on that very \\"Truth.\\" Utopias are created because man does not want to acknowledge the need for God. And Huxley's theme alternates between a denial of the need for God(clearly, the God of Christianity) and an acknowledgment that, for every person, some god is essential.An example of Huxley's real emphasis is found in John the Savage and his coming face to face with sacrifice. He wants to redeem himself, give himself up for a greater being - and, in the end, he offers his \\"supreme sacrifice.\\" But John's sacrifice is tainted. He strove to be pure, but he was hindered by an orgy, by soma, by sin that only he knew to be sin. Is Huxley essentially saying, \\"There can be no perfect sacrifice\\"? Is he saying that we beat ourselves up for a nonexistent God only because(like John) we have been conditioned to believe in God? John himself rejected the latter argument in his conversation with the Controller. But at the end of the book, it seems that the Controller turned out right.It is interesting to note that John, in a sense, was a Christ-like figure. Perhaps Huxley intentionally created that similarity.What about John's plea that he must lose himself in something greater...more pure than himself? John tried to make an atonement for himself and he tried to redeem the people around him. He failed to do either.In the end, the \\"civilized\\" people found greater fulfillment losing themselves in an \\"ogie-pogie\\" orgy to Ford(their man-made deity)than any fulfillment John ever found in sacrifice and \\"trying to be good\\" on his own (John's man-made deity was himself).Throughout the book, Huxley seemingly points out the necessity of sacrifice, and of losing oneself in something greater. There are many other references to Christianity in this book. I'm still not exactly sure what Huxley is getting at. Obviously, he is saying there is no real happiness in fulfilling your every lust. But he also seems to be suggesting that neither is there any satisfaction in denying those lusts or giving them up for a greater good.This book made me think. However, I don't think I can swallow Huxley's theory of religion like a blind fish.Huxley asks the question: Where is true fulfillment and happiness found?But he offers no answers.Perhaps the question ought to be: Can we ever find fulfillment of desire and true happiness without knowing God? Or rather, can we know God except through Christ? (John the Savage understood sacrifice and giving himself up for what he thought was god, but he didn't come to God through Christ. He came through Himself and he was a failure.) This core truth of Christianity (Christ's sacrifice for mankind) is the axis upon which spins a world of pleasure-seekers who love to avoid the truth. I think that people can only understand and apply the message of Brave New World when they read it with minds that understand the truth. Huxley (and John the Savage) is right: there is no real fulfillment or satisfaction or pleasure without sacrifice. Neither is there true joy in sacrificing ourselves, with nothing returned to us but pain. But Huxley failed to take it a step further. So did John the Savage. Because the truth is that there is perfect peace in accepting someone else's (Christ's) perfect sacrifice for us. And deep down, we all know that is the truth."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"I remember being forced to read this back in my senior year of high school and hating every single word of it. Now, after a few years, and at a few urgings from friends, I find this to be frighteningly insightful and enjoyable read.The syposis is about a near perfect world where everyone bioengineered and predestined into a caste system mere moments after the egg is fertilized. But that's okay because conditioning, sex and feel-good drugs make every one in this brave new world happy with what they are doing and who they are.For high school seniors about to read this book, I suggest the best way to read BNW is to approach it as a thinking-man's sci-fi novel. No doubt your teacher will go on and on about symbolism, themes and messages, making the book more pretentious than it actually needs to be. But there is some great stuff to think about. For example, what I found highly enjoyable was the fact that this was written fifty years before the first test tube baby and close to seventy years before Dolly the cloned sheep was conceived. The narrative is contemporary and save for a few trips to the dictionary, no more difficult to get through than reading Sagan, Herbert, Clark or even Crichton. When it does get to the philosophic debate towards the end, it's too late and you are hooked. The verbal battle between John Savage and Moustafa Mond is fast, scathing and radical and presented in a dialogue that is accessible. I enjoyed this part much more the second time around.I leave it to the reader to find thier own interpretation of Huxley's \\"message\\". There is one and it's very obvious.

He is interested with the savages and the way people used to live. When he brought the savage back from the reservation the real problems started. Marx didn't think it was right to have multiply partners and when he would speak up about his thoughts he would be given drugs or laughed at by other.I would recommend this book to high school age students. I really enjoyed reading this book, it was very thought provoking and I think teens need books like this to learn to question things and not just go along with everyone.The book is filled with drama, I couldn't believe some of the things I was reading and the way they lived their lives. The characters in the book were what made it so good because they truly believed that the way they were living was right. I can't say that I connected with any of the characters but you could see them develop and really got to know them through out the book.

The main characters are one of 96 clones just like themselves, and the novel guides the reader through their everyday lives. Huxley introduces some interesting concepts and ideas, but the text lacks flavor.The tiresome novel slowly drags on discussing the differences between their culture and that of today. There is no distinct storyline to engulf the reader's desire turn the pages, and it has a dry personality. Huxley declines to develop his characters and they lack a certain realistic dimension.There isn't an identifiable incline, climax or decline of the novel. Turning the pages is like drudging through a marshy swamp. Its dull continuation of information isn't intriguing, however the thought that this type of society may someday consume our world does open up the reader's mind to a shocking truth.The novel is well written, but isn't recommended for people under the age of fifteen due to many adult topics and concepts within. It is directed toward people interested in expanding their imagination about possible future societies, but doesn't have the action and suspense to keep the pages turning, so don't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"The writer created a new style.

It portrays the male characters poorly. Not recommended for scientists and writers."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"In Brave New World, freedom is curtailed not merely on account of a totalitarian government, but by large because of human nature. The story follows Bernard Max, an Alpha-caste member possessing great intelligence but the looks of someone from Beta or lower caste, and John the Savage, who, having grown up in a remote reservation, was finally rescued but came to despise the civilization he's found. Following an apocalyptic \\"Nine Years War,\\" mankind decided to forego competition in order to foster an environment, namely the World State, in which suffering is minimized. Its citizens are biologically or otherwise altered to actually enjoy belonging to whichever caste/occupation group that they are members of. Moreover, as a result of advanced technologies, guilt, reflection, and other inquiries have become irrelevant and are frowned upon. This insiduous yet coercive abolition of pain suits many, but John and Bernard, as well as their confidant Helmholtz Watson, were keenly aware of the cost--a general ignorance of freedom and the inability to choose pain or pleasure for yourself. They ran into conflict not only with other members of the insulated society, such as Lenina who was John's love interest, but also with their own desires, weaknesses, and, in John's case, upbringings. In the end, Bernard was exiled to an island, where a small group of free-thinkers like him lived. John, however, of great experimental interest to the \\"Controllers\\" of the World State, was forced to stay; he eventually killed himself, unable to reconcile the difference between himself and the new world.Intentionaly or not, Huxley raises the question of whether nature--including human nature--is itself a dictator. In other words, maybe only a small amount of freedom is able to exist in this universe, the rest of which must be made of qualities resistant to change. Such appears to be the case in many societies people have built."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Most writers like Orwell got their entire motivation from this man: Aldous Huxley.

What's more true is that no one born on top can reach the bottom. Prime example: George W.

Excellent book! It was written in 1932, but is set a few hundred years into the future. Don't let its futuristic setting fool you, for it isn't a sci-fi novel. Instead, Brave New World explores the consequences of our consumer society, and the government's ability to distract the masses by keeping them happy and drugged.

In addition to serving as a warning against the dangers of submitting to authority, the book contains many interesting and thought-provoking ideas about freedom and the nature of the individual.

The fact that at the time there was much uncertainty of the coming dangers the future would face fostered Huxley's inspiring assessment. The western world sat on the brink of chaos that the aggressors of WWII would soon bring. As we live in a time of similar uncertainty and the world returns to entropy, Brave New World is no less poignant in the lessons it seeks to explain.Brave New World is an excellent book, particularly considering its age. The storyline delves into the bizarre and outright absurd, but when you consider how absurd our world would seem to societies 100 years ago, perhaps its not that far off.There is no doubt Huxley hit the nail on the head with some of his analysis and who can say what the distant future still holds in store for us. Modern authors, like Benjamin Barber, use examples from works like Brave New World to demonstrate the downfall of modern society.Huxely was prescient in his ideas about social sedation and that is revealed in the fact that drugs, one even called Soma, are so prevalent in keeping people happy today.Uniquely brilliant and an overall great story that inspires though, and there's no harm in that.REVIEW EVERY BOOK YOU READ, AUTHORS DESERVE YOUR OPINIONS.\\""},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"This early Twentieth Century classic is my favorite among Huxley's works; It is set in a near future when families and parents are a thing of the past; all human reproduction is done by cloning and 'decanting', and children are taught by 'hypnopaedia', sleep-teaching. They're not only physically molded before birth via various and sundry means - like reducing the air-supply of a foetus to insure a smaller person who will fit among the lower classes -, but their careers are chosen in advance too, and they are given the proper number of hours of in-sleep suggestion for each profession and social status they are to live with. Since families and parenthood are dirty words in Huxley's future world, people are encouraged to have flitting and frequent encounters with the other sex, and kids are taught to do it from a very early age. 'Everyone belongs to everyone', they are conditioned to repeat. To hammer the point of conformity home, everybody is given their daily dose of soma, the perfect drug, created to keep them all happy and socially integrated. Among this sea of conformity, there is one man called Bernard Max who seems to be different, and we are taken with him in a journey of self-discovery.

Some parts are almost silly.I find Brave New World thought provoking, but not quite prophetic. There are many parallels to the world today, and where it may be headed. Perhaps this book will cause people to reevaluate what it is to be human, and how large a role they want the government to play in their lives."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Amazingly creative story that brings up huge questions about the meaning of life, happiness, and God. Bernard Marx lives in the &quot;perfect&quot; new world and visits New Mexico and ends up bringing back a savage. The savage poses many of the questions that the reader must ultimately wrestle with.The story is based off of Aldous Huxley's theory that drugs are the solution for mankind; give healthy, normal people drugs and they will derive the true meaning of life. In short, drugs can help people have a great experience anytime they wish. The drug in Brave New World is called &quot;soma,&quot; which in ancient East Hindu myths was the drug used to keep the gods content. It is interesting to note that Huxley was a firm believer in the concept presented in Brave New World -- he made his wife promise to give him LSD when he was dying so that he could reach a truth in his own head. Ironically, it is Huxley's view of life that tells me that there must be a higher purpose, and this point is truly driven home through the Savage in the story. The Savage sees the fleeting and meaningless moments in the &quot;brave new world,&quot; and this really makes the reader think about what truly matters in life."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"This book reminded me of the novel &quot;1984&quot; by George Orwell. George Orwell and Aldous Huxley seems to contain some similarity; George Orwell focuses more deeply into totalitarinism, whereas Huxley tries to imply the effects of despotic policies. The book's plot is the prediction of the future. Huxley like Orwell takes place as an oracle...he predicts that in the future humans would no longer evolve from a natural state, instead human production would become a manufacturing process. They would &quot;hatch&quot; from labotorial embryos and from birth would be brainwashed to accept the criterias the ruler (in this case a form of totalitarinism) had as rules. Such predictions strike me in awe because Huxely wrote this novel in the early 1900's, but his depictions are of certain relavance to the technological capablities we can acheive today. Even today, the technology available in &quot;Brave New World&quot; is not considered impossible. Through this book one considers the effects and the consequences of such a world. A world dominated by one despotic ruler and through him society evolves. Humans are no longer different or original...we are all of the trite spiecies. This book makes us consider this as possible and not the impossible. This is why I think this book is a book definitely worth to read."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Brave New World was an interesting book that I definitely think was worth reading. I enjoyed reading every minute of it, yet sometimes it was confusing. At the beginning I didn't always understand what was going on. This book really makes you think about the future, and what it might be like in the years to come. It's so weird to hear the characters talking about how horrible our era is. They found the old people at the indian reservation disgusting because they never age. How strange in this day and age. I find the book very odd, but I'm very glad I read it for English class."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"It was one of the most fascinating and intriguing books Ive ever read. There are two depths to this story and I dont mean intellectual, but rather you can decide to coast it and bounce from place to place accepting or you can pick the people you like and the ones you dont. Either way is perfectly fine, but it gives one different perspectives I beleive. I did both, choosing to side with some and dislike others but ultimately to tag along with the story and watch it. It is probably the weirdest yet most accurate thing I have ever read. The reality of it is frightening, and truthfully I hope the human society never reaches such a level. A human race laced with cold emotionless joy, nothing to fear (which is a defining factor in each of us) life carries itself it out with no point. Only a few who are considered essentially odd and one who has not been brought up in this terrifying surrounding but rather in the &quot;inferrior&quot; native culture can recognize any fault with society (which incidentally is the only reason this system works - every one is happy with it because there isnt any other way). It is almost to weird to read but its not really and if followed, it proves both margianally disatsifying but utterly rewarding."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Well, I got into this book through an Advanced Placement English class in high school. I read George Orwell's 1984, and I absolutely loved it. So for our final project, I thought I'd read BNW. To tell you the truth, it was disappointing. It was not nearly as long as 1984(I'm a good long book lover), and I didn't think it was quite as well....shall we say.....mapped out. Certainly, a lot of thought went into it, but it is just simply too short. However, it's a good book with some good points, and I would recommend it to anyone. But if you want to read something even better, check out 1984. It will really set your wheels turning, if you like to stay up late at night and just think."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"I started reading this book at 8:30 p.m. last night and found that I could not put it down or go to sleep until I finished. If you decide to read this book the one thing that you must do is prepare to be open minded, because if you are not you will not enjoy it at all and will probably find it preverse and sickening. As an English student we have discussed the novel in class and many of my classmates have also found it to be a very insightful novel, but there are a few people who read it with the typical closed mind set and did not learn a thing. When Huxley wrote this novel he was only postulating at what the world could become, and based on some aspects of society today we may be working towards this end. The novel will send chills down your spine if you are able to link the deified aspects of the new World Society to some of the things which our society deifies today. When reading consider this: what really is hapiness and how does society push us to achieve it today? Good luck and happy reading."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"This amazing book about what may very well be our near future is one of my favorites. It is a sad look into a future of a &quot;perfect&quot; society, where most people look beautiful, and no one ever has to worry about feeling depressed, or feeling anything for that matter. Sex is a constant theme in this book. And although it was tiresome after a while, I think that part had to be included in this book, because that is what our society focuses on most of the time. The reader, however, begins to believe there is hope for this world yet, because there are two particular characters who seem to realize what a horrible mess the world is in. The main character, though, Bernard, I do not believe is one of these characters who truly cares. He only wants things to be different because he is different, not as attractive as everyone else, too short, not &quot;normal.&quot; He doesn't truly care about how horrible mankind has become, never feeling anything. He only wants to be &quot;normal.&quot; His friend, however, and The Savage, whom the reader meets later in the book, truly do care, and don't like the way mankind has become. Over all, this is a wonderfully sad yet hopeful book, and everyone should read it."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"In the future world, social stability is the first priority. People are &quot;produced&quot; with genetic engineerings, and there are no mothers. Different chastes are produced, with different missions and status. In fact, people are enslaved, but thanks to hypnopedia and induction, they are all happy. Everybody uses &quot;soma&quot;, a happiness drug. Sexual liberty is complete, with no prejudice or inhibitions, and the superior chastes are really beautiful. There is much variety of entertainment for the free time, but no opportunity for independent thought. Loneliness is forbidden. Bernard Marx is a strange guy who goes to a reservation for indians in New Mexico. There, they find a woman from the &quot;normal&quot; world and her son, both of them had got lost and become savages. The child turns out to be the son of the Director of Incubation and Conditioning, who loses his job for the crime of having a son. Marx takes the savage and his mother to London and then...In 1932, when this book first appeared, it must have sounded like science fiction. Today, it is not. It is simply our society taken to extremes. For good and for bad, we are closer and closer to Huxley's vision. Although my view of the future is not that pessimistic, I think our present society resembles Huxley's in more than one feature: 1) we still can't &quot;produce&quot; people, but genetic engineerings is taking us closer; 2) many people are born in &quot;chastes&quot;, where social mobility is practically impossible (if you're born an aborigin in Mozambique, your chances of dying in your suburban hometown are almost zero, and viceversa); 3) many people are enslaved and happy to be so (including people in nice offices); 4)sexual liberty is complete in many places; 5)never in history had there been so many time and choices for entertainment, and it can hardly be argued that they stimulate independent thought; 6)the &quot;indians&quot; of the world are confined in reservations (possibly their own countries) while the borders of the developed world are almost closed for them; 7)and, instead of &quot;soma&quot;, we have ecstasy and prozac.This is not an opinion; just a comparison, and a worrying one. I am pro free markets and pro technology, but I am also convinced that these have their problems, and we should acknowledge them and think and act about them. Read this book and you'll think of suburban United States. I promise."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Considered a classic in apocalyptic literature, Brave New World was received to negative reviews when it was published in 1932. This book examines a 2540 utopian society who accepts promiscuous sex and drug use. The forward thinking author creates a carefree, technologically advanced society, produced by genetically bred humans who obey the ruling order passively. The drug \\"soma\\" is designed to keep one perpetually calm and happy. In other words, ignorance is bliss. The frightening premise suggests that the individuality and human ambition will be sacrificed for harmony in society.Incidentally, the use of \\"For the love of Ford\\" injected some humor into the dialogue.Reviewed by Holly Weiss, author of Crestmont"},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"The book is thrilling and very interesting! If you are into futuristic novels - such as 1984 - then this is definitely the book for you!"},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"This was one of those books that I enjoyed the more I thought about it. I have to admit that upon completion of the book I was a little confused on what I thought about it.The only thing that held this book back was the fact that the characters werent appealing in the slightest. Luckily, the story and the world created by Huxley kept my insterest and made the book worth while."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"I picked this book up at a rummage sale to add to my little library of books. I didn't plan on reading it for quite awhile... until I learned that this book was banned when it was first published in 1932. This is scifi at it's best. There is a lot of scientific information, but not so much that the reader has to re-read every single paragraph to figure things out. There is a very easy to follow story with some great turns, interesting characters, and a picture that is built for the mind to see. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone under 17 due to the sexual nature of the book, but I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a really interesting read."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"There are so many themes in this book Man vs. Society and conformity vs. individualism the scary thing is I found myself agreing with many of the philosophy's of the book."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"I'm convinced that there are some books that scholars decree are great pieces of literature and the rest of us agree simply to not be thought as foolish or ignorant. Henry Miller's grotesque, misogynistic \\"Tropic of Cancer\\" falls into that category for me. It's also applicable to the first half of \\"Brave New World.\\" If you're willing to slog through his description of futuristic London, things improve once John the Savage enters the picture. Mr. Huxley's book is rightly compared to 1984, but instead of a harsh world of destitution, you get dumb-as-dirt junkies entertaining themselves to death in Utopia. There is some sharp satire. The deification and numerous homages to Henry \\"History-is-bunk\\" Ford was quite funny. Also, the lengthy argument between John the Savage's Shakespearean defense of individuality and the Controller's, Mustapha Mond, commitment to an orderly Utopia was worth enduring the more mundane passages in the book. Part of the fun was seeing how a piece from 1932 saw the future unfolding. Some of Mr. Huxley's predictions were surprisingly accurate and other aspects were way off base. It's not a long, difficult read and worth your time."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Cherish your emotions. Discontent and sadness can be healthy and welcomed.

As prophesy and social commentary, this book easily earns five stars. As a novel, the plot is interesting but not up there with the top works of entertainment. Please don't let that stop you from reading this remarkable book. By the way, I recommend buying a version that includes Huxley's \\"sequel\\" Brave New World Revisited, published 29 years later. Brave New World Revisited is not a conventional sequel in that it is not a novel. It is commentary, by Huxley, on the 1931 work, on World War II, and on how the world had changed since the original novel was written. Well worth the read."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"I just finished reading Brave New World for my English class and I must say the premise itself was intriguing. A society were the words mother and father are viewed a smut, and drugs are taken as an excuse to avoid feelings drew me in. But what I found really didn't interest me. The book felt a little too rushed and needed to be drawn out more. The last few pages were good, but they didn't conclude the book enough for me. The conversation between Mustapha Mond and John was wonderfully insightful, explaining the reasons behind the brave new world, but the relationship ended there. Overall a great idea in a decent book."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Aldou huxley was a remarkable writer. And perhaps this book, was his great novel.

The artificial kids, the regulation of the birth. And us who we gonna become the wilds. The conversation between the General of the world and the wild, with the explanation of the reasons why the start to control birth, it's for me one of the greatest lines in modern literature.

I learn or notice or glean something new from it every single time I read it, and at this point I've read it maybe a dozen times. I also connect things in it to other literature, and the way it connects with Fathers and Sons, a tedious Russian novel, really helped me survive the reading of F &amp; S. (For those of you who have read both and want to know what the connection is, get this: the society in Brave New World, as material and self-serving as it may be, is nihilist, just like Bazarov.

Readable and frightening."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"YESTERDAY afternoon I opened the door of this 'Brave New World' to take a look around. I never left the book until very early this morning, and even then I could not sleep. Why? This book opened a new realm of possibilities and issues that I could not let rest. They occupied my mind, and even now, a day since I read this book, are lurking still.When presented with a book about the future one tends to believe that the book will dissect the technology that would be available then. This formula makes for unexciting reading. However Huxley, in this book, does not dissect the future in this way, but rather in the little ways. The little relationships between 'normal' people, just like us.All in all the book is mostly about the effects of the pasts choices on the future. The past chose machinery over god, chose Hollywood style films over Shakespeare, chose drugs over thinking with full control of mind, and chose relationships which don't deserve the title and progress over a loving family. &lt;b&gt;The frightening things are that it seems that the present can be found in this book in between the two, leaning more and more towards the ironical new world.I shall try not to ruin this book for you. This book exposes the journey we have to take, the choices we have to make. The miracle of the matter is that this book relates to use today more then Huxly's time. How could he know?&lt;b&gt;I'm not sure I understand yet. I'll let you try to figure it out for yourself."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"truly a classic. if you havnt read it, go now you still have tim"},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"When I read Brave New World, I was a fifteen year old teen in my 10th grade English honors high school class. I read that book in two days. Now almost seventeen, I still am intrigued by the book. I've recommended the book to all my friends. Not to say that having very promiscuous sex is good but I believe there are two types of sex in a human's soul. Lust and Love.Aldous Huxley is simply incredible for writing Brave New World at the time he did. There are so many things about Brave New World that can be analyzed and criticized. The Brave New World is a world of pure ecstasy and euphoria, someplace where some of us wish we could be.It's like a heaven but still a sin. I recommend this book to everyone, from school teachers to preachers to government officials to your average American mom. People need to learn how to expand their minds. Whether it be with drugs, or to the acceptance of homosexuality. Strive to take in knowledge."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Huxley's masterpiece &quot; Brave New World&quot; warns us of a scaring future: the State in complete control of mankind, from birth to death. Huxley shows how easily this can be done, mostly by providing the people with their desires (sex, safety, health, etc). Another very important method is not to allow people to have children (in fact, the word &quot;mother&quot; is most obscene) or even longlasting relationships, thus preventing the existence of any strong afections. This is also basic in George Orwell's 1984. Both authors clearly perceive that, in its effort to be heartly accepted and obbeyed by the everyone, the State must destroy all feelings which might be stronger than people's love of the Government. In both books, people prefer happiness (or security) at the expense of freedom - of action as well as of thought. Both societies explicitly condition themselves not to question the State, but to accept it as a need. When will we begin to question information as it gets to us? When will we choose freedom? When will we begin to deny Brave New World"},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Reading this book rendered me incapacitated and winded at the thought that all the effort I've put into my life will be for nought. In the future everyone will be nurtured and conditioned to fit into a certain group that will dictate their behaviour for the rest of their lives. This truly is a horrific portrayal of the future. Just because of the sheer banality and inanity of it all. Let me be a savage in the world of the alpha-minus' and epsilon semi-morons and they would not know what hit them.Huxley's vision remains fresh now as the day he wrote it.

People are conditioned from birth to act certain ways and think certain ways, even the jobs they will have are decided for them.

I think the message of the story goes back to what Freud said (from what I understand by reading Civilization and its Discontents, although I'm no expert): humans are the enemy of society and civilization. The fututristic government portrayed in the book recognizes this and seeks to end this threat by killing all instict and individuality. It's pretty interesting and I liked it a lot. The end is really sad because it shows that there will always be certain people who cannot fit in to society and will always be different, and therefore ostracized."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Brave new world is a work of genious that launches us into a futuristic world run by psychological conditioning (behaviorism) which was one of hte most common schools of psychology at the time this was written.

Great mind food!"},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"A Brave New World, by Aldous Huxley, is truly a classic. This science fiction story of a Utopian society is a must read. This story was set in the future when it was written. It begins in \\"civilization\\" where everyone is always happy. You are \\"conditioned\\" or taught since you were little to be this way. You have no choice in what to do with your life, or what your social status will be. That is all decided before you are \\"decanted\\" or born.

There were still some things that I was unsure of when I finished, and it seemed to just end abruptly, but over all, it was a good read. I would highly recommend it.

I've read it when I was 15, again when I was 20, and now that I'm 33, it's got the same bite of parody, pointing to our society and government. Control gone wild, I guess. In the future. Love it!"},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"In his Foreword to Brave New World (written in 1946 for a reprinting of the novel originally released in 1931), Huxley admonishes himself for not having incorporated ideas associated with nuclear fission into the technologies of his imagined future society. Despite this omission, Brave New World undoubtedly remains an uncomfortably accurate depiction of tomorrow's world. One could argue -- and argue convincingly -- that Huxley's descriptions are more relevant now than at any time in the past.Certainly, the unswerving emphasis on individual happiness, satiety, and immediate fulfillment of human desires described in the book more closely fits with current Western societal norms than it must have at the time of Huxley's writing. And while the notion of subconscious behavioural programming as a state-sanctioned institution may not have reached the explicit form characteristic of Huxley's world (there is as yet no formal College of Emotional Engineering, to my knowledge at least), it seems fair to say that corporations and governments exert all manner of subtle appeals for us to continue our patterns of conspicuous consumption and to content ourselves with the cultural, legal, and moral status quo. Like the inhabitants of the Brave New World, we are increasingly taught to despise yesterday's ideas and products, to self-medicate with all manner of mood-enhancing drugs (of the legal type only, of course), and to accept, however tactfully, established divisions between social classes.Added to these general themes, the especially riveting aspects of Brave New World revolve around the adaptation - or lack thereof - of the Savage to the \`civilized' society of the future. In the lengthy conversation between the Savage and Mustapha Mond, Huxley manages to deftly address principles of spirituality, art, and truth in ways that challenge us to surface and examine our own assumptions regarding the existing social order.I found the treatment of religion and its place in future society to be of particular interest. The marginalization of Christian traditions and beliefs in this new world echoes the similar banishing of pagan systems by European settlers in early American history. What is more, by finding a place for the co-existence of these two religions in the \`uncivilized' outpost of the Reservation, Huxley touches on the historical links between mysticism and mainstream Christianity, a theme he returns to in his excellent collection \\"The Human Situation\\".Apart from all this, though, Brave New World is also an engaging, well-crafted work in its own right, and can be enjoyed as a provocative novel without the need for excessive philosophizing of the type of which I'm guilty here. Well worth a read."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"This book is my second favorite fiction book next to 1984. I also read this a few years ago in school.Huxley has done a great job in making you feel like you are part of the story. I couldn't but help feel sad for the mother who kept taking soma until death. I couldn't but help feel frustrated at how everyone else in this society were practically zombies.Sadly, we are in a similar time, when depression is treated with powerful drugs, sex is used as a distraction, and the system continues to keep people ignorant of the truth."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"There were these characters in the book who felt the world was becoming spiritually empty with progressive degradation of moral values. He did not understand why he made both wrong and right choices in his personal life in the past but these experiences strenthened his belief that something needed to change. However his conscience was clear that even the wrong choices that he made in life were never to cross the limits outside his personal life and noted that a lot of the stories floating around were untrue. Outside his personal life he strived to inculcate positive values and supress negative emotions and never realized that his personal life would be a book open to judgement. And his conscience was always very hard on himself and sometimes on others too when he saw that things could be better - which a lot of people took personally and started despising him. He did realize that being hard on ones own and other peoples negative emotions and beliefs was to be separated from negativity against the identity as a whole. What he did not realize (despite ironically never wanting to be in the limelight or be attracted to power) was that a strange twist of circumstances would bring him in the middle of the storm. Hopefully good will come out of all this and we can avoid becoming this dystopian world which Aldous Huxley envisioned."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"If you liked 1984 you'll love this novel. It is graphic and scary and the end takes you by surprise."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Aldous Huxley's Brave New World deals with a future world where humans come from their test tubes, not from their parents and everything is 'in its right place', in neat order and operates properly. However, there lurks some kind of abnormally normal way of life, way of thinking in people living in that world of \\"community, identity, stability\\". This book uncovers that aspect of future with vivid details and its original sarcasm.The whole events comes into reader's vision in almost real settings, which renders the author's explanation plausibility. Furthermore, the interesting way he uses his words, doubled with the plausible explanation mentioned above, acts as a gravity that pulls the reader closer to that world.The protagonist's death -John Savage's suicide- definitely lacks the power to be called 'closure', though. What's worse, there is no surprise at all: no accident, sudden change, or unexpected event, and that might bore many readers.Huxley's Brave New World depicts the future society of abnormal mormalcy and certainly will intrigue many readers but who hates SF, or not ready to plunge themselves into the deep ocean of suprising strangeness and fearful similarity to our present society."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"I first read this book while I was a freshman in high school and it was the first book I read that really made me question society.

After reading lots of really good literature, I found Brave New World to be a little less well-written than I had once thought. However, I now appreciate the storyline much better and I can now see how society is moving toward this type of society. If you enjoy dystopian literature I recommend this one."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"I am a reader of non-fiction, and I guess I never really learned to appreciate works of fiction. I have a hard time applying their relevance to the real world. Every now and then, I attempt to read an &quot;acclaimed&quot; piece of fiction, and the results are usually the same: I feel like I've missed something. I prefer to learn about and ponder the &quot;horrors&quot; of today's reality by reading history and current events. I find there is more history that I don't know but need to. Reality is far more bizarre than anything that Huxley or Orwell can dream up. By the way, I prefer Orwell's work to Huxley's. I found this work to be very light reading and somewhat entertaining."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Although this book was written in 1932, it is amazing how much of it is happening now. In the book, people worship the Ford god. Of course, Ford was one of the biggest, if not THE biggest and most important company back then. Cars were beginning to replace the horse-and-buggy way of traveling. Huxley obviously took note of this fact while writing this book, and it's AMAZING how it seamlessly fits in. The Year of Our Lord is The Year of Our Ford in Brave New World. Scary, huh? Babies are mass-produced and predestined as to what field they will work in--batch A will be doctors, batch B will be engineers, etc. There is a drug called Soma that reminds me a lot of the melange in Frank Herbert's Dune. As in most if not all utopian novels, people fornicate with whoever they want and think nothing of it. The writing style is certainly different from the norm. Not exactly Hemingway, but not exactly like those older authors who would spend ten pages describing a mountain range. In between but leaning towards Hemingway. One of the major characters of the story is a man known as the Savage. The first half of the book goes into detail about the society, while the second half focusing primarily on the Savage who is dragged out of his reservation and forced to cope with this Brave New World. The last line of this book was most shocking, but understandable, and is certainly one of the most memorable ending-lines in literature. Before reading it, my expectations weren't so high for this book, because I was under the impressions that any book written before 1980 would be boring. I was wrong. This is one of the very few books that EVERYBODY should read.

Perhaps I should read it again to better understand the plot, but overall, I thought 1984 was a better read."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Important read. Be sure to get a context to the novel prior to reading, some can be found in editions with a good introduction"},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"A sensation in 1932, course-related reading at some colleges in the late 1960s, introduced (at least as a concept) in high-school curriculum in the 1980s, Brave New World may be on its way to literary entombment with Samuel Butler's Way of All Flesh and Sir Thomas More's Utopia, relegated to perpetual life as a category - something that everybody knows as a word or simple concept, but too desiccated to be enjoyed any more as a work of art. But having revisited it after 40-some years, pulling it off the dusty shelves (so to speak) with Kindle, I find that it can be highly recommended to the \\"Y Generation\\" and many generations to come.I recommend it, with certain cautions adn reservations. The first thing that on has to do is strip away the \\"science\\" - the descriptions of biochemical techniques of incubation used in cloning. It may have been cutting edge science back in 1932, but it was just an attempt at scientific speculation based on Huxley's contacts with biochemists back then. Just skim over it and don't believe a word of it. Ditto with the \\"psychology\\" - the sleep learning. As a working scientist and scientific generalist, I can assure you that that stuff didn't pan out. And of course the helicopter and rocket plane stuff didn't work out, either. Just try to ignore the details and, instead, look for Huxley's intent. Sleep learning does not work but we do learn a lot of things (much of it untrue) from television, which can be argued to be a daily, three-hour form of voluntary self-hypnosis and indoctrination. And since modern psychological studies have shown that much of our learning is by observation and imitation, it can be argued that television is helping to shape many of us into \\"gammas\\" as effectively as the hormone soups and nursery-rhyme indoctrination did in the novel. And despite today's greater accessibility of educational opportunity, the fraction of our population for reading Shakespeare (or decipherments thereof) is probably not greater than the percentage of \\"alphas\\" in the Brave New World.I recommend Huxley's novel for his application of intellect to social and philosophical questions. The question of production vs consumption, the question pleasure vs pain, and the greater question of \\"what's it all about\\" (Alfie). Like most of the great philosophic novels, the characters are not completely three-dimensional and the sociological background is not sufficiently well \\"imagined in.\\" This is, so to speak, left as an exercise for the student to perform after class. What I find priceless in this novel is the dialogue between Mustapha Mond and The Savage in Chapter 16, beginning with the words, \\"Because our world is not the same as Othello's world. You can't make flivvers ....\\" The next dozen pages supply a generation's worth of food for thought."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"If this book was just released in January 2010, whey are all the reviews dating from 1999-2008 before its release?

The world of today can be more frightening than fiction.No wars, no starvation, no pestilence.No need for deep thought, for we are pre-programmed for each purpose in which society now demands. Of course there is a wonderful feel good pill to keep the mind in perpetual happiness.There is still a civilization that is allowed to dwell outside of the 'perfect world', who are a mix of savage and God fearing people.Read how these civilizations then clash, with hostility?, no, just the opposite.Huxley is known for his humanist thinking.

With that Mr. Foster explains all about the \\"Hatchery\\" and what it does, and how they raise the embryos. He tells the students what are the roles of these so-called \\"humans\\", for when they grow up they will be only living for one and only one purpose...The types of these \\"humans\\" are Alpha, Beta, Gammas, Deltas, and Epsilons. Alpha people wear gray, they're most likely the smartest out of all the types, and they also work very hard too! Unlike Beta because they dislike working and are the medium class, well for education... Gammas you can say are just like us! Ordinary, well yet the only thing is they're kind of like Leprechauns because they always wear green! I don't really know anything about the Deltas... Last one is the Epsilons! They are the stupidest of the five types (It's kind of funny).Well I think the message is like that you should always stick to your goal! Never let anything come between you and your destiny. As you see the \\"humans\\" keep themselves always busy! They have no time for the social crisis of normal life like, they don't care for alcohol, drugs, family, friends, anything!Myself, I think anyone that can read this novel really should!

The real frightening prospect is the fact that some of the core elements defined within this dystopian society do not seem that farfetched from modern culture.If you like philosophically betraying reads centered in the possibilities of tomorrow I highly recommend this outstanding book.

The images provided are imaginative and in my humble opinion, beautiful and terrifying at the same time."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Brave New WorldBy: Quinn, Greg, Terrance, and Tatiauna (12th grade)Brave New World by Aldous Huxley is a dystopian novel that points out some important flaws in society. The setting of the book is in a future society in London, England where the Central London Hatchery and Conditioning Centre. This is an important part of the book because it sets up how society functions and there point of views. Even though the beginning is important, it is also boring and confusing, but once characters start to develop, the plot and action picks up.At the London Hatchery they are creating human beings in an assembly line format. Basically, they are mass producing humans and creating man made responses by using shock therapy on small children. An example of this is when a child reaches for a flower they shock the child so that whenever it sees a flower it acknowledges it as dangerous and painful. They also put certain children through tough conditions to optimize their performance in certain areas such as making the temperature of the embryo colder to make them more efficient in colder climates. It is also made clear in the first couple of chapters that the people of this society worship Henry Ford as if he were Jesus Christ. This helps explain Huxley's point that we should be careful about how we use mass production or the government will start mass producing humans.As the story continues it is evident that the government is distracting people with simple sinful luxuries of life. They use drugs, sex, and mind-control techniques to create a euphoric society in which everyone believes that they are happy. The government is striving for a perfect utopia but it is obvious that it shall never happen. This is because perfection is impossible to reach when every human makes mistakes and every human does not think exactly alike even if they are mind-controlled. Evidence is shown in this book as we follow the main character Bernard Marx. Bernard is supposed to be an elite member of society but someone put alcohol in his surrogate when he was younger. This stunted his growth which might not seem like an overwhelming burden, but in a society where elite members are taller than everyone else it made him self-conscious. Since he was so self-conscious he enjoyed being away from people which made him seem more of an outcast than he already was. This is a society full of people becoming \\"one\\" and obviously they viewed Bernard as weird because he wanted to seem more individual. A result of this individuality is his banishment from society.This novel distinguishes between the good of technology and how it could become bad if people start abusing their power with it. It creates a character that everyone can relate to and feel and think like he would in his life and time. Most of all Huxley creates a dystopian novel about how government control should be somewhat limited otherwise all individuality will be lost."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"One of a few masterpieces oft cited to illustrate the definition of \\"dystopia,\\" written as a satirical warning against a frightening future, much of the utopia that \\"Brave New World\\" describes is (scarily) already here, or soon to be.

Perhaps I think highly of this book because I was young and hadn't read anything like it before (I still must read 1984!). When I read Margaret Atwood's dystopian lit., I often think of pictures Huxley painted with his words. This should be on all high school require reading lists; it was on mine.

I could not see renting the books when I could purchase them and keep them for future use."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Aldous Huxley's Brave New World challenges the current image of future success and details consequences of following status quo. Set in London in A.F. 632 (After Ford), this novel portrays the danger of the idealism of a future utopian society. At first readers are met with the extremes of this world: mass reproductive breeding occurs on an assembly line instead of natural human reproduction, the idealism of open sex without the present security of monogamous relationship even so that children are having sex, discrimination through brainwashing of young minds. Huxley successful describes each of these characteristics as he takes readers into the Central London Hatchery and Conditioning Center.Huxley's writing style remains descriptive throughout the book and it is easy for readers to imagine what life is like in this futuristic world. Although sometimes disturbing, these descriptions are necessary for readers to grasp the significance of actions in this particular setting. Without details of the setting, readers will not understand the danger of going against the norm.Even so, Huxley challenges the effectiveness of the norm he presents through a character known as John the Savage. John came to London after living in New Mexico with the traditional ways of today. Upon arriving, he notices that citizens aren't genuinely happy; they have just believed what they've been told. He sees the injustice of drugging individuals with \\"soma\\" a drug providing euphoria and suppressing reality.Although a bit extreme at times, Huxley's presentation challenges society's desire for instant gratification, unending happiness and superficiality. The novel is certainly worth a read. Beyond its literary merit it provides a window into the fate of the population of these desires don't curb and allows for some soul searching on the reader's part."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"(Spoilers are labeled; read at your own risk.)\\"...In the past you could only accomplish these things by making a great effort and after years of hard moral training. Now you swallow two or three half-gramme tablets, and there you are. Anybody can be virtuous now. You can carry at least half your mortality about in a bottle. Christianity without tears--that's what soma is...\\" \\"...But I don't want comfort. I want God, I want poetry, I want real danger, I want freedom, I want goodness. I want sin...\\"This dialogue between the Controller and the Savage sums up \\"Brave New World.\\" It is a fantastical place where there is complete societal order, where there is no disease, no famine, and no war. But there is also no freedom. This is the third time I've read this book, and, quite honestly, there are still sections where I have no idea what is going on. This is not the kind of book you can read once (ala Hunger Games) and have it all down. It's the kind of book where you need to read it as you progress in your life, because it will have different meanings for you at different moments, and at various times. For instance, I read this at the end of High School and thought it was the worst book ever. I skimmed much of it as it didn't seem to make any sense. At the advice of a friend, I re-read it in College, and low and behold, it started to make some sense. Now this third time, I can say even more of it clicked.There are unforgettable sequences, particularly the opening one (i.e. with the babies), the \\"orgy,\\" and the shock and awe inspired by a \\"Savage.\\" (MAJOR SPOILER) The character arc for the main protagonist, Bernard Marx, is most interesting, as he turns into what he hates most, then, for whatever reason, doesn't want to leave the Brave New World he at once hated.I've heard from a lot of people the US is becoming more and more the Brave New World, where we worship consumerism, and are moving away from God.(MINOR SPOILERS) I would say that while we've certainly had our freedom chipped away from within (i.e. the Patriot Act), we remain one of the more free societies on earth. We aren't yet hatched and forced into castes. I hear you protesting: but, Americans do make the sign of the A, while some 50 million (give or take) pop Zoloft daily, and contraception is being thrown at our teenagers. (In BNW the sign of the T, as in Model-T Ford, is placed instead of the sign of the cross, and today's equivalent would undoubtedly be Apple; soma is used to placate the masses and I'm assuming would be equivalent to a Zoloft, though at times, particularly during the orgy or during the \\"holidays,\\" it sounds more like Ecstacy or Special K.) Alas, this is another reason BNW is a 5-star classic; it has in a lot of ways held true for the structure of our society today. (END SPOILERS)My recommendation is to read this book. There will be sections where you say to yourself, \\"I have no idea what's happening, or who's talking,\\" but stick with it. It all comes together, and the unforgettable parts make it worth it, particularly the middle and the very end.-Raeden Zen \\"Literary Rebel\\""},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"i didnt really care to much for the book it self, it was only for an english class i was taking at the time."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"This book is entirely too wordy.

Then an outsider comes into this society, rocks the boat and becomes a celebrity of sorts. But your interpretation may be different.

This is where we get the term, \\"Alpha Male\\". Alpha males are the highest class of men, intelligent, successful, and desired by women. Marriage is forbidden and children are created artificially. People are encouraged to have as many sexual partners as possible. They take a drug that numbs the mind, so that they do not question authority. The people are continuously happy. Our protagonist rebels against the system and discovers a natural world outside the guarded cities where there are no rules, and people marry and have children naturally.

I don't think it should be part of standard curriculum, just as I don't think Fahrenheit 451 should be. Huxley and Bradbury's bursting desire to make the world aware of the disorienting menace of media and information control is wasted on adolescents.The book IS thought-provoking, though I wish it had been a short story. As such it would never as been as popular: the characters ARE interesting, but Huxley relies upon THEM to explain everything.

If the story had been true fiction, it would at least have entertained, but being what it is we'd do better by standing as a watch-tower does, than by hiding our heads in the ground like an ostrich.This kind of story makes a genre by itself. In the line of Orwell's \\"1984\\", a picture of the future society totally dehumanized. People are conditioned, even genetically selected to fit into the master plan of the world leaders. The individual has been abolished in the interest of the society. A book for people who don't vote, because they are busy working to pay taxes; or who are gullible enough to believe the demagoguery of the left, or who are too cynic to expect anything good from side, all of these ostriches could do well reading it. It's not what I call good literature, but ostriches wouldn't like it if it were so.On the other hand, this kind of stories are way outdated. Reality has caught up with it. Look around folks. What's the need of reading about it when our world is imbued in it?It reminds me of the joke about the preacher (I heard from Peter Kreeft). The preacher is preaching about Heaven so fervently, when he is offered the chance to go to Heaven right away or keep preaching. He chooses to keep preaching. Not that the Brave New World is Heaven, on the contrary, but it serves to illustrate what I mean.A good story doesn't mean good literature. But a poor story can sure be good literature if it has the right story-teller. I believe this book had the impact it had for its political message, its implications. Personally, it bored me.

So, that's where I'm coming from.BRAVE NEW WORLD is worth it. Not in the straight narrative 'fun fiction' way, but, if you're an English buff searching through Classics, it's better than like, SILAS MARINER, or TALE OF TWO CITIES. If you're a girl, it's not as good as the Brontes. If you're a guy, it's not as good as say... COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO, but, you can kinda only read MONTE CRISTO once. B.N.W. you can go back to (or, you can go to BNW REVISITED).Anyway, the modern movie parallels would be GATTICA and THE ISLAND. It's better and brighter (and, oddly, sexier) than both those films. It's not as savvy as 1984 by Orwell, but, then again, Orwell had Aldous to read first anyway.Huxley has the best scene though of the books. As Huxley's recreating how emotionally numb everyone's become, he has this scene where Mond's talking to some of his peeps, explaining Utopia, and peep-1's telling Mond how this one girl rejected his sexual advances once, and Mond asks him how it made him feel:\\"It was horrible!\\" he says.So... it's kinda funnish. But, in that British sort of wry sort of way. You really have to give yourself over to the conext in this one and, the only drawback is, the context is this glum, drab, middling world. The novel kinda falls victim to its own ability to paint a picture, because, the picture is painted to be like the first line attests:A squat grey building of only thirty-four stories...I'll catch heck for this, but the best 'evil Utopia' to date is the WATCHMEN graphic novel.

Huxley described a world where people are &quot;born&quot; in a science lab and predestined for a specific purpose; now, we can clone animals and allow parents to (with some accuracy) choose the sex of their child. Huxley accurately predicts the increase of recreational sex and drug use and the way society no longer &quot;needs&quot; God.Like Orwell's 1984, the prophetic vision of Brave New World transforms it from a good story to a great classic. It shows how a world overly devoted to stability can become a living hell. Like the savage in the story, we can learn to say, &quot;But I don't want comfort. I want God, I want poetry, I want real danger, I want freedom...&quot;"},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Brave New World is one of the most insidious works of literature ever written.

I always get something new out of it. I had to read it the first time for my freshman english class, and I have read it every year since. I have found that the secret to understanding it is not to read it as a prediction of the future nor as the fictional novel, but somewhere in between. There are countless messages and warnings to society that Huxley conveys through the story. You just have to be open minded and ready for a different type of novel. For all of you who had to read it once and hated it, try reading it again sometime when you are ready to understand where the author is coming from, what he is trying to say, and where you can apply it to your own life."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Thinking the world could ever be like the vision of Huxley makes me a bit nervous.

His foreknowledge of modern society appears prophetic, and between the shockingly horrifying depictations of this Socialist commmunity, humor is detectable. Additionally, the element of confusion added rather than detracted from the book. If one pushes through the first 15 pages, it is impossible to set down."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"I thought Brave New World was a very well written book. Huxely gives us a view of the world in the distant future, this world is corrupt and without values. I think that Huxely makes a good point about society and technology. We see a world where technology has made people emotionles and unable to think for themselves. This is a very relevant topic. Although the book was written in the 1930's is is acurate to the trouble we as a society face in this day and age. We are often hurt by the technological and scientific advances that are, simultaneoulsy making us happier and healthier."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Huxley's Brave New World offers an unequivocal view of the horror of a Utopian Paradise. With the depiction of a civilized society as one without free will, Huxley shows the reader that any paradise is by definition void of free will. If one does not allow themselves the freedom of truth and knowledge, there cannot be a true paradise.With the use of a 'savage' to illustrate the difference between civilization and freedom, Huxley shows the reader that progress and civilization are not necessarily the goals of a good society. Huxley's use of scientific terminology and a bureacratic government very reminiscent of our own, lends credence to the story as well as to his vision of a dangerous Utopia taking our society and our will."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Having heard mostly good things about the book - I gave it a shot. The story line was confusing, none of the characters were terribly interesting and the whole plot was rather random, if I do say.To be honest I read the book about a year and I remember little - it was that forgettable. I do remember at the time wondering if it would ever just end - I did finish the book (I never just put down a book because I always tend to get invested just enough to wonder if the good part is coming soon). I do remember the letdown of nothing interesting or insightful ever coming.While I've certainly read worse, unfortunately, I cannot recommend the book to others. I'm not saying it's a bad book -certainly many other readers and reviewers have enjoyed this book much more than I have. It just goes to show the varying degrees of human interest."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"While this book is supposed to be \\"fiction\\", it seems to be turning out as a prophecy!

Buy it while it is still on the market!"},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"The beginning is like swimming up current; the reader has to kind of force his/her way into the story, which is made hard by the boring torrents of Huxley's writing style and I often found myself wishing I'd be lodged under a rock to drown in the river that is this book, to just die there and be free from the thoughts that spill into these pages. But, I make it a point to always finish a book, and surprisingly, at times I found myself captivated in the story. The first few chapters make this book hard to get into, but, on the bright side, it picks up a little and there are some beautifully written descriptions that erase my regret for ever picking up this book. However, if you are impatient or easily bored, you won't make it far. If you want a story that'll captivate you from the first page, don't even bother with this book. Try \\"The Alchemist.\\""},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"The 'Foreword' explains why this novel was not rewritten to get rid of its faults: it could lose its merits! Aldous Huxley used the class-based society of England and projected it far into the future with modern references. Huxley imagined a sort of \\"scientific breeding\\" that seems to mock science. Dumping children to the care of lower class servants had a long history there, it is divorced from maternal care. [Does it work? Reports say this has a bad influence on children's development.] The name of Pavlov is strangely missing from this novel. Huxley says the problem for totalitarian states is to make their subjects love their servitude. Too bad he didn't live to see today's conditioning by advertising and other behavior modifications (like cell phones which let Big Government hear and locate you). Huxley claimed a diminished political and economic freedom leads to sexual freedom, but offered no proof. Orwell's \\"1984\\" handled this much better.Most of the book shows Huxley's skill at an imagined future, a parody of the world of the 1920s (whose faults created the Great Depression). \\"Tracking\\" of students has been around for decades (their future is decided in kindergarten). Advertising sells everything from ordinary objects to candidates and political beliefs. Advertising creates \\"peer pressure\\", people who believe and think as they are told. Many people are no longer skeptical of corporate advertising; this might be the result of their schooling. Whoever controls the media influences the thinking of most people.There are many echoes of real history in this clever story. Such as the surprise played on that Director by a long-lost relative (echoes of 19th century novels?). The office politics reflect unchanging human nature. But the ending chapters don't ring true to me. Certainly notoriety affects people's lives. The gawking of the ignorant and uninformed is always a problem for anyone in the news. Even if they are only show business performers! Huxley was correct in having an opiate that tranquilized people but damaged their health. Who will heed this warning? The use of chemical food was another subtle satire; they knew then of those dangers. One thing missing is the Secret Police to force people into desired behavior patterns by constant surveillance. Orwell was more realistic about England and the world of 1948."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Imagine what the world would be without diseases or wars, a real Utopia. Imagine a world where the very thought of criticising others would not occur to someone's mind. That is exactly what \`Brave New World', written by Aldous Huxley, is about.People aren't born anymore but they are bred in laboratories and raised using a certain method called hypnopaedia. Every day and night certain sentences are being repeated over and over. This way they get brainwashed, resulting in everyone being happy while doing their job. Personal view does not exist anymore. People are divided in classes alpha to epsilon with alpha as highest class.Everyone is happy besides one person. He doesn't fit into this society, having his own opinion. This gives him terrible problems and costs him his life in the end.The book really gives you the creeps and it makes you think about whether or not this future is so perfect after all. Especially the fact that everyone gives the same standard, brainwashed answer to a question gives the dreadful image of a world with only robots, programmed to do only their job. A very good book."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Well yes, no doubt one of the few books able to travel through time. What Ford was then....Gates is now. The problems nonetheless are the same.I gave it 4 stars only because the ending was not a great one, so my advise to you \\"Enjoy the trip more than the destination\\"..."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"The book was written for people of Mr. Huxley's time (mostly Christians of the Western world), but intended as a contribution to lasting literature. The book's concept is its strength, simplistic characterizations and inconsistent plot lines are its weaknesses. Huxley does a good job of detailing the factory state and reasons for its development. The characters are sketches that do not behave according to the internal logic Huxley ascribed to them. Most striking is \\"the Savage's\\" ability to speak and interact with Londoners in the Brave New World immediately upon release from his accidental upbringing in an uncivilized reservation, though he rejects their values. Significantly weakening the story were \\"the Savage's\\" arguments that it is natural for humans to believe in God and that that belief gives life meaning. The problem with this argument is subtle, but reveals Huxley's religious chauvinism when faced with social history that Huxley was well aware of: many long-lasting societies had beliefs in many gods, rather than just one, that often the gods were personification of forces who were not the source of meaning so much as arbiters of human fate. In the 70 years since its writing, the factory state Huxley saw developing has evolved in complex ways, while societies make stronger and conflicting religious and moral assertions."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"We are all told that Utopia is supposed to be a perfect place full of harmony and love. We belive that anything in a Utopian world is correct and powerfull, but Utopia's soon crumble in there own self creation.In Brave New World by Aldous Huxley, Huxley introduces a world far greater than our own today. The year is 632 A.F. (after Ford) and the world had just stopped a \\"nine year war\\" with devistating effects with nuclear warfare. Anthrax bombs had left civilization almost non-existing. Then a Utopia was formed in London where everything was perfect, you grew up programed how to live your life and be a perfect artificial life form. Humans were no longer given birth to, they are grown by multiplying embreyos, thus, having a lot of clones doing the same thing. This Utopia soon crumbles after John, the savage, questions everything in it and soon is exiled by the D.H.C. (Director of Hatcheries and Conditioning). John was not programed and did not come from that Utopia, he actually met with Henry Foster and Lenina Crowne in New Mexico, while Lenina Crowne was overcome with the site of filthiness and disease and non- perfection, then taking a large dose of soma. John goes to the Utopia and is facinated by the life there, he sees everything non real and fake so he becomes very independant in his own mind and questions the Utopia, causing Mustopha Mond (one of the ten world leaders) to exhile him along with D.H.C. John decides to leave on his own will and start a new life. While parting ways with his friend Bernard Marx, John retreats to an abandoned lighthouse in Surrey. His hiding place is accidently discovered by motorists. Soon after that the press appears and want statements from John. Then Lenina arrives and John feels threatned by her but she is trying to tell him something but her voice is muffled by the reportes. John beats her. The reporters from Utopia are baffled and excited by this so they start an orgy. John is soon drwn into the orgy and partakes in Soma and sex. When he awakes he realizes his endurance wont last forever, knowing this, he commits suicide. Thats pretty much the book and how everyone fallowed John at the end and when he died so did Utopia. Huxley wanted to introduce a sort of flip flop to our world. Our world has sex, drugs, and pain. His world has programed feelings, Soma pills for emotional pain and suffering, and Programed set lives. Huxley shows us what will happen if we do not limit our dangerous rate of growth voluntarily, the police state must do it for us and scinece is irresponsible and must be legally controlled. Brave New World shows us how abstract the world can turn out to be, and lothe in its own self creation causing it to end miserably."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Why add one more?Aldous Huxley overworked an important and thought-provoking concept. At many points, he preferred shock value to realism or even decent allegory. Once you've uncovered his thesis, somewhere in the first paragraph, the rest of the novel is a foregone conclusion. The plot itself is predictable and has become cliched, if it was not already at the time it was written.The concept of an ultra-mechanized totalitarian state is not an uncommon one, and it is executed extremely poorly here. The characters represent such extremes that it's very difficult to emotionally connect with, and therefore care about, any of them. This isn't always crucial to a story, but here, Huxley defends his thesis purely on the merit of his characters. Neither society is designed to be appealing.If you don't like to be challenged or surprised by your reading, this is the book for you. If you have read these reviews and know that the novel is an attack on the continuing advance of technology and its use by various governments to track and control their citizens, then the rest of the book is merely elaboration."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Brave New World by Aldous Huxley is a Utopian society in the year a.f \\"after ford\\" 632 universal human happiness has been achieved. No one is sad and the happiness is shared equally. No matter what the person does for a living, their happy. Here everyone takes daily grams of soma, to fight depression, babies are born in laboratories, and the most popular form of entertainment is a \\"Feelie,\\" a movie that stimulates the senses of sight, hearing, and touch. Soma is basically Prozac, but people take it very often to stay happy. There is no violence and everyone is provided for in this Utopian society. When people are born or cloned they are immediately given their future. They have no family, and marriage does not exist. The future depends on what they look like, if they are normal or not. Ranging from the super-intelligent Alpha Pluses down to the dwarfed semi-moron Epsilons. Each class is conditioned to love its type of work and its place in society; for example, Epsilons are happy running elevators. Outside of their work, people spend their lives in pleasure like playing in sports, and ...Love, marriage, and parenthood are viewed as obscene. The main characters are John who is the son of the Director (who runs Central London Hatchery and Conditioning Centre) and Linda his wife. The story mainly concerns Bernard Marx, a man who doesn't quite fit into a strictly controlled world. He is an Alpha, but he is still not content He takes Lenina (a woman who is a vaccination worker at the Central London Hatchery and Conditioning Centre) for a vacation in New Mexico, where they meet the Savage. Bernard brings back the Savage into the society for his own reasons, and the last half of the book deals with the Savage entering the new world.Although this novel is Huxley's most popular novel I'd have to say the novel was a hard read and was a scientific novel, dealing with make-believe drugs and the society. For me, scientific novels aren't the types of books I like to read. I thought this book was hard to understand and follow.I would recommend this book to people who like to read scientific-fiction. It's a hard read with difficult English. I don't rate this book very high- I rate it; two stars out of five. This may or may not be the book for you!"},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Brave New World by Aldous Huxley is a story about a futuristic society where people's every move is ultimately controlled through brainwashing as infants and children. People are grown in tubes and conditioned to live life a certain way and by a strict hierarchy. This hierarchy is made up of five classes, the highest being Alpha, followed by Betas, Deltas, Gammas, and finally Epsilons. This conditioning makes people live the \\"happiest\\" they can by using the least amount of reason possible, other than to perform the necessary tasks involved with sustaining the world, but when any sort of mood penetrates this veneer of euphoria, the drug soma is available to wash away the uneasiness. However, there are people who are not able to conform into the neat little automatons that the society wants everyone to be-these radicals make up the main characters. Bernard Marx, mocked and ridiculed for his small stature because everyone who is an Alpha is grown to be big, strong, and good looking, is the first of the main characters we meet. Because of his being an outcast, Bernard starts to think differently than the people around him, something looked down upon by the standards of the \\"brave new world.\\" The next main character that is introduced to the reader is Bernard's best friend Helmholtz Watson, the physical antithesis of Bernard, and everything their society wants in someone, except he wants to be a writer, and write about his feelings and emotions, things people are not allowed to express, or even feel. This makes Helmholtz ultimately unhappy, because he can't find a way to express himself through the writing content allowed by the society. Finally, there is John, \\"The Savage,\\" who Bernard finds on a reservation for Indians in New Mexico. John is the son of a Beta woman who was lost and forgotten about on the reservation years ago. Now, child birth is something that disgusts most \\"civilized\\" people in this future world, as most are grown, and not birthed. So, a person born to a civilized woman is of great interest and John is allowed to go back to London with Bernard to become immersed in the \\"brave new world.\\" John quickly becomes disgusted with this civilized world, and rebels by taking soma rations away from a group of Gamma workers and throwing them out of a window, demanding they strive for liberty, rather than servitude. The Gamma workers become appalled by John's actions and begin to fight him for the rations. Helmholtz dives into the fray to help John, and along with Bernard, they are arrested. All three are brought before the resident Controller, the person who basically controls the life of the citizens, Mustapha Mond. A discussion erupts between the prisoners and the controller. Huxley uses the individually intelligent dialogue that these rebels have as compared to the other citizens in the novel to show the extremes on both sides of the argument. They discuss art, and why it cannot exist, religion, and how it has changed, and philosophy, and why it is only true to the individual, something the new world has tried to eradicate. In the end neither side persuades the reader because the arguments on both sides are too extreme.I found a lot to connect with this novel about, as it shines light onto today's faults by showing the opposite, the world's foil. We accept our upbringing and continue with it through our children because that's the way we've been taught; why shouldn't they be? Present day art, poetry, and literature are all ultimately controlled, not to the extent as in Brave New World, but that is the point of the book: to show us what we look like in the extreme. The character I felt I could most relate to was John. He is someone who can somehow see the world through a different set of eyes than others do. His choices were \\"insanity or lunacy,\\" wrote Huxley in the Foreword. This seems to be the only choice the world gives a lot of people. We can either work a job we hate or live on the street.I really loved the book, and thought it was a great example of the effect society has on an individual. So much emphasis is put on preserving the social order we forget what it is like to have the right to be truly free. Though, the book poses interesting questions like, we strive to live without society, but is it really possible? And, do we all want order on some level? This book provides many questions, but none of the answers, which to me makes the book great because it allows the reader to think independently, and not be influenced by the writer. Brave New World lets a person really question his or her place in life without being antagonistic, making it easier to understand Huxley's point of view.My recommendation would be to read the book as many times as you would like, because it may offer insight you may not have seen the first, or second time you read it. Anyone who enjoys questioning life, and questioning society, should read this novel. Brave New World should be an important part of everyone's library."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"This book was riveting in its depiction of a future society that hatches babies, conditions them to become consumers, and programs their lives to be uniform. The New World uses conditioning rather than brute force (like 1984) to achieve the utopian society where individuality is the ultimate crime. Through the use of this conditioning, newly hatched humans are placed into a caste and bred to be happy within this caste.At the beginning of the book, I was not sure why some government would go to all of the effort of hatching babies and spending endless hours conditioning them, both while they are awake and while they are asleep, but the goal became clearer as the book went on. This future government prioritizes stability above all else, and wants nothing to do with dissension, rioting, or wars.To avoid any possibility of this sort of unrest, government conditions everyone to be the same and to be doped into happiness. The quest for \\"higher\\" learning as we know it is conditioned to be wrong and worthless. So art and religion are replaced with senseless movies and a drug called Soma. The notion of love and monogamy is frowned upon and sleeping with many partners is conditioned to be a service to society. Basically, the broad, easy path to quick happiness is encouraged and the narrow, costly path is discouraged. \\"No pain, no gain\\" would not make any sense to these people.I thought that this story was an incredible attempt at predicting the direction of our society from a Depression-era perspective, and was very convicting in some of the ways we have made Huxley's predictions come true. We, as a society, do favor the quick and easy route to happiness (blockbuster movies, drugs, etc) rather than striving for something more costly. I love this book because it makes you think. Yes, it is weak on character development and the narrative is quite annoying in some parts, but I appreciate anything that causes me to examine my society and myself in the humbling way that Brave New World has done."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Individuality, an aspect of one's development, is thoroughly explored in Aldous Huxley's Brave New World, a piece of futuristic writing that speaks many truths. By examining a society based on conformity, readers are able to distinguish between the downfalls of conformity and the advantages of individuality.The control of the government reinforces the theme of conformity within a society. One example would be that embryos are programmed into a certain caste. They can be designated to Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, or Epsilon. Each caste represents a different level of intellect. If an embryo is fortunate enough to be conditioned into an Alpha, it is the most intellectual thinker and leader of the society. Each caste has less intelligence and less strength than the previous caste. Since the Epsilon is considered to be the weakest, they must perform the tedious tasks that no one else desires. Huxley's incorporation of this example of conformity enlightens the most narrow-minded readers.Another intriguing feature of this novel that pertains to the theme of conformity is Huxley's creative ability to integrate the symbol of the drug, Soma. This drug takes away all forms of human emotion such as love, happiness, hatred, and desire to name just a few. Therefore, all individuality is vanished by a simple, yet complex, pill. The idea behind Soma is that it provides for instant gratification. This enhances the idea of conformity because there are no human urges. Everyone feels the same way.Huxley's development of the character John Savage adds an interesting twist to the rebellion against conformity. Through this character, Huxley exhibits a strong and free- willed individual. He speaks of the importance of the arts, science, and religion to gain a life of fulfillment. Unfortunately, his opinions were overpowered by the government's opinions because in the end, John succumbs to the powerful society, though he is appalled of the notion.Aldous Huxley portrays a futuristic society that in a frightening way could come true. This dystopian, disturbed, society opens the minds of all who engage in this futuristic journey."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"I finally read this book, and must say, it is utterly terrifying. It was a great read, but is it as good as everyone says it is?Huxley's outlook on the future is a little too negative for me. Yes, I get all that he is trying to say. And yes, the book does make you think and it is the kind of book you can discuss forever. However, he does not convince me at all that the future is bleak.I will not turn this into a discussion on the positives and negatives of progress, etc. This is a book review. The bottom line here is it is a great read. It will definitely open your mind, and is a great conversation topic. It just falls a little bit short of all time great, and may be just slightly overrated."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"This is one of my all-time favorite books (in part to chapter 3), I would still like to caution readers: A, don't read while depressed, this book'll not really help.

It really freaked me out, but I couldn't stop reading because I liked it so much. I'd say, wait until high school.

I say this because it seems more likely to me that our society will become like Huxley's \\"World State\\" than Orwell's \\"Oceania.\\" The reason is that the \\"World State\\" is a (distorted) view of progress in which birth is determined by an elaborate eugenics system and people get all their happiness from state-sactioned ... and ...., whereas \\"Oceania\\" is a nightmarish halt of progress.

Starting to have second thoughts?The \\"Brave New World\\" dystopia isn't quite as bad as the one in \\"1984.\\" No one is going to throw you in room 101 and torture you. They'll just keep you so doped up on soma and free love so that you forget everything that isn't superficial. It's a world that promises security, contentment, pleasure, but lacks purpose.In my opinion, the book falls short of it's classic stature, though just barely. The religion of Henry Ford is never fully elaborated, the word \\"Ford\\" is simply substituted for \\"God\\" throughout the book. What's more, you have to get halfway through the book before you meet a character that is interesting, though this is in part to show the constrast to the other \\"characters\\" who are a product of a superficial world.Critics of this book say that it is a hack job on scientific progress.

Having read it a second time, I have even more respect for the work and marvel at the predictions that Huxley made. While he certainly was poking fun at society with most of his predictions, the more fearful ones certainly leave one somewhat unsettled. One must ask how close we have come to his Utopian society in our modern age. The intrusions of the press as it strives to give us the real story might be the most frightening parallel between the book and our society. For all the moments when the book scares us, makes us laugh or forces us to ponder our fate, it is a real masterpiece. Even more so when one considers it was written seventy years ago. Many thanks to my highschool English teacher who assigned it to me twenty years ago. Here's hoping today's highschools will still allow such a book to be available to today's students."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"I wonder what it was like for people to read and talk to Huxley before time and technology revealed how ahead of his time he was? In the year 2002 we've come to believe just about anything is possible as technology steamrolls through our lives and pretty much over us.\\"Brave New World\\" is as relevant today as it was when it was written. Pershaps more so. Why? Because we now know its more fact than fiction.Thinking Man vs. the conventional mind has and will always be the great divide. As technology offers more entertainment and caresses (the ability to keep us contented and happy) the more we give up as thinking, feeling beings. The more alien we become to our nature.\\"Brave New World\\" offers a glimpse into where we might be headed. I, however, still believe the social/econimic divide will make this a much more unstable and dangerous world than \\"Brave New World\\" allows for.Books like \\"Brave New World\\" will be eliminated (as much as possible) in this world, and the need for such books, though much greater, will become pornographic and subversive excursions shunned by a proper and polite society that does not read such rude and disgusting smut.\\"Brave New World\\" is a fast read that leaves you in a state of limbo when you turn the final page. So much happened so fast that you now need to let it churn in your mind. You need to ask yourself some important questions on how this affects you and the future of humankind.Read it, reread it, then think, then do something! Otherwise...."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"The book offers so much to the reader as a true 20th century classic; wonderful writing, true thought on account of the writer, great insight into the lives of the world that Huxley fantasizes, but sadly this world Huxley has created in his book is quite far from pure fantasy, it is becoming more and more relevant to our world here in the United States atleast. Only by reading this book one can understand the true similarities between Huxleys Brave World and our own. I definitely suggest the reading of this novel not only to those that love pouring into a book on a sunday afternoon, but especially to those who already look at our world and realize that we are doomed for a terrible decline in our morality in the next millenium."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"I read \\"Brave New World\\" in high school, and the raging debate in our classroom was \\"Which view of the future is more probably, the one in \\"1984\\" or Huxley's mad scientist view?\\"We decided it was more likely \\"1984.\\" After all, the Cold War was with us, nuclear destruction was on our minds and the Viet Nam War looked suspiciously like the war with Eastasia. We had World War II's Stalin as a model of Big Brother, complete with moustache.Yet, now that it is 2003 and way past 1984, it's apparent that author Huxley was incredibly prescient. He set a tragedy modeled on Shakespeare (Othello mixed with elements of The Tempest--hence the title \\"Brave New World\\". ) It's set in a futuristic state where babies are cloned and grown extra-utero in glass jars. A happy state of drugged complacence (Prozac?) is the norm. Sex is free of emotional ties, in fact, promiscuity and gratuitous sex are required by law! Entertainment is mindless (Disco? Survivor? Joe Millionaire?) and real literature and art are subversive.This book is a must-read and it will change how you view our cultural. For me, re-reading this book was like reading it for the first time. Our cultural environment has changed so much since the time I first read this book in the Sixties that it was as if I had read another book entirely.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"While I do love Orwell's 1984, I've always liked Brave New World a little bit better for a few reasons. Admittedly, I enjoy Orwell's writing in terms of style more than Huxley's and I think Orwell spun a more superficially (not meant in a derogative sense) enjoyable story in 1984 than Huxley did in Brave New World. But I've always liked Brave New World a little bit better because I find it a good deal more thought provoking. This is for several reasons.One, is that unlike the society in 1984, the world of the Brave New World is a real and legitimate attempt at a utopia. In fact all of the people are happy. The brilliance of Huxley is that in describing this perfect society of ever-present happiness, we realize what a nightmare this society actually turns out to be. Science, art, and religion have all been cast aside in favor of the stability brought a superficial in-the-moment happiness, brought by conformity, consumption, and pablum and where love is impossible because it's been eliminated by conditioning and any negative feelings are immediately drugged away. Further there has been something more indescribably human that has been lost by this society, and that is a kind of liberty. They've lost something important in their inability to overcome any negative emotions. They've lost the right to chose whether to have these emotions at all.Another reason, I find Brave New World more thought-provoking than 1984 is that I find that it provokes thoughts about the society we live in. The world of 1984 is a kind of hyper-fascism, ruled by fear and punishment and the outright crushing of liberty. One can compare this to the Nazi's and the Soviet's, and one can worry about it creeping into an increasingly powerful domestic government, but in the west, particularly America, where one doesn't feel like this 1984 style-totalitarianism is around the corner, Brave New World seems like it speaks about things which we perhaps we should be concerned about. Things like consumerism and conformity, our disdain for intellectual pursuits (so-called \\"book-learning\\"), a pursuit of momentary, and fleeting, sensuality and happiness of the immediate moment, and our laziness. While reading Huxley, one feels like Huxley is indeed describing things that already exist in our society, and one feels like Brave New World may in fact be the culmination of the natural evolution of things that already exist in our society.One thing I find particularly interesting, as well, is Huxley's approach to religion. He seems to believe that religion is essential to society maintaining its \\"humanness,\\" for lack of a better word, and this future Nitzchean society is a bleak one indeed. But at the same time, Religion, as practiced by the protagonist John the Savage, is a ridiculous thing. The self-flagellation, the guilt, and the subjugation of one's own esteem are ridiculous and unhealthy things. I think this speaks to a sort of conundrum, Huxley believes man faces, that whichever choice one makes, between savagery and civilization, the consequences are dreadful.Nevertheless, both Brave New World and 1984 are incredibly important books that everyone should read. They are also both pretty enjoyable in my opinion. Huxley's writing can be somewhat dense at times while describing some of the technological advances, but he can also be surprisingly funny, describing absurd situations such as the Shakespeare spouting Savage trying to avoid the seduction of a futuristic harlot. Very Highly Recommended."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"This is a depressing book. I hate it when smarmy cynics are proven right. Huxley is the smarmiest of the lot, and in Brave New World, he is so right, it hurts.Don't get me wrong; this is a brilliant book. Of the various works of dystopian fiction written over the years, Huxley's strikes closest to reality. This is what makes it depressing.I first read this book decades ago, and it was the first work I ever read that portrayed the future as a hopeless mess. I remember hating it because it didn't fulfill my expectations for happy endings. When you are twelve years old, you expect stories about the future to have happy endings. I didn't understand much of it at the time, but even then, I realized that it was an intelligent work of great power, meant to do more than entertain. This may have been the first book I ever read that truly challenged me. For that alone, I owe Huxley a great deal.This work is invariably compared to Orwell's 1984. And while some critics say that they address two different themes, I beg to differ. 1984 may be about totalitarianism, and Brave New World may be about social utopianism, but they both share something more fundamental: they are cautionary tales about our innermost natures. They dissect our slavish need for order and our desire for a social framework to cling to, no matter how dysfunctional such a framework may be. The differences between the two works are in their conclusions, and here, Brave New World strikes closer to the truth.1984 asserts that we will accept the yoke of oppression before we surrender to anarchy. Brave New World asserts that oppression is unnecessary: that humans will re-engineer society if we have to, in order to suppress the desire for challenge that leads to unhappiness. If we look around us at the mass soporific of popular entertainment, the titillation of \\"Reality TV\\", the sensory overload of music videos, the casual attitudes to sex and drugs, the superficiality of relationships, and most of all, our increasing intolerance for even the slightest risk, it is the Brave New World that is coming into being before our eyes, and not 1984. Made to order babies, \\"feelies\\", sex purely for physical gratification, mass tranquilization, broadcasted voyeurism, \\"curing\\" of malcontents, bland political correctness, all may have seemed distant and surreal in Huxley's day, but they precisely describe our present society.This book asks us to consider whether \\"happiness\\" is truly a goal for which humans should strive. Or, more accurately, it asks us whether happiness, in and of itself, is a sufficient goal. Behind this question is a larger and more abstract one. What makes life worth living? We don't get much of an answer from Huxley, except his literary equivalent of a shrug. \\"Dunno,\\" he says, \\"but it sure ain't this.\\"The book suffers from artifice. Huxley dabbles in the stream-of-consciousness experimentation that was the literary rage of his day. It is jerky and inconsistent. As a writer, he doesn't believe in self-discipline. But to criticize this book for such failings is to read it for the wrong reasons. He is not writing classical literature, but speculative fiction. In fact, he is one of science fiction's pioneers. Read as a cautionary tale, this book has few peers."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"In my experience, when people talk of dystopian novels, inevitably two titles are mentioned: 1984, and A CLOCKWORK ORANGE. And then, almost as an afterthought, &quot;Oh, yes, and BRAVE NEW WORLD&quot;. While the first two remain astonishing and relevant works of art in today's world, Aldous Huxley's contribution (which pre-dates the others) always remains a distant third. Why?BRAVE NEW WORLD, while incredibly sophisticated considering when it was first published (1932), does not hold up as well in the world of 2000. Its ideas are still potent, and it does remain a fascinating read. Nevertheless, as an enduring masterpiece, it is deeply flawed.BRAVE NEW WORLD centres, more or less, around Bernard Marx, a sub-average Alpha. Techniques in reproduction and eugenics have progressed to the point where 'mothers' (an incredibly filthy word) are no longer necessary; babies are born in jars, and carefully cultivated and conditioned to accept their predetermined roles in life. Alphas are the highest level; intelligent, arrogant, strong and beautiful. Lower down are Epsilons and Betas, lower caste persons who perform the more menial yet necessary functions of the society. Bernard is an abnormality; a rather weak and small Alpha speciman, who has deep yearnings to break free of the conformity of society. This is as close to heresy as it can get.Bernard gets permission to visit a Reservation, a place where progress has been disallowed. There he meets John the Savage, a white male who has been raised among the Indian culture. He decided to bring John back to civilization, where, predictably, culture shock sets in.BRAVE NEW WORLD has been hailed as a cautionary tale against rigid conformity and science, where the individual now exists to serve the advances of science, not the other way around. This is indeed so, and Huxley's take on the theme is years ahead of its time. His new world can be remarkably complex and exciting, and almost inviting in its ultimate ideals.But much of BRAVE NEW WORLD does not inspire the reader in the same manner of 1984 and CLOCKWORK ORANGE. In those novels, the worlds of tommorow, while equally vivid, also function as deep social satire. BRAVE NEW WORLD, by contrast, reads like parody. We do not enter the world of the novel, and see ourselves. Rather, we laugh at it, seeing the folly of others.BRAVE NEW WORLD also lacks convincing narrative and characterizations. Huxley's characters are mere props, used to fuel his ideas. Never once do we empathize with anyone. Characters come and go to illustrate points of view, but never to engage the reader. Contrast this with 1984, where the reader connects so completely to Winston Smith that his eventual downfall breaks the heart. Or CLORKWORK ORANGE, where Alex's murderous rampages are presented in such a form that the reader completely understands why he is the way he is. In BRAVE NEW WORLD, the reader dispassionately views the actions of the characters, never once gaining any understanding. Orwell and Burgess allow us to live in their worlds; Huxley presents the world, but doesn't let us enter it.BRAVE NEW WORLD is still a thought-provoking experience. It is fast-paced and thought-provoking. But Huxley's world only exists as an idea. It is smart, lucid, and entertaining. It is a classic, in the sense of its lasting appeal and relevant subject matter. It fails to be a literary classic, but not for lack of trying."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"In many ways, Brave New World describes present-day America and Western Europe. Huxley's world, like ours, was full of people concerned with little more than physical pleasure, be it sexual or pharmacological. The Brave New World was high tech and anti-religious or, at least, areligious. If you want to know just how close Huxley got to describing certain aspects of western culture and lifestyle today, present-day humans can be created (though not yet birthed) in labs, are considerably less knowledgeable about history, tradition than earlier generations, and tend to elevate sexual pleasure over emotional, spiritual and familial bonding. Also consider that there is now a drug on the market called \\"Soma,\\" a muscle relaxer.While Huxley wrote Brave New World as if he had glimpsed in a crystal ball, the book's not terribly enjoyable. It's clear why the book is a classic and it should be read by everyone. As social comment, it's brilliant. As a novel, it's somewhat dull. In my view, 1984, which is inevitably a point of comparison to this book, was much more interesting and better written.I expected to be swept away by it. I was not. Much better works were forced on me in high school literature and English courses. That said, I'm glad I read Brave New World.While everyone should read it, many might wish they hadn't."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"A lot of people like to read this book as a doomsday chronicle, gloomily noting how close the present resembles the future Huxley describes. In their voices is a superiority, a sense of \\"I'm the only one who can see what's going on while the rest of you are duped.\\" Rather a silly notion, since this is such a well-read book and so many other folks are saying the same thing. Furthermore, I am not yet convinced the world is going to hell; in fact, I'm not all that convinced it's any worse than it was a thousand years ago. Naturally I'm crippled in this judgement by the fact that I wasn't around a thousand years ago. Yet much of what Shakespeare wrote is hardly less vulgar, shocking, sensational than what's in the theaters today (especially in the context of his culture) and the same can be said of Greek literature (ever read Lysistrata?)And so I find the accuracy of his future predictions entertaining, amusing, but not exactly haunting or frightening. It's fun when he's right, it's even more fun to join him and proclaim our society \\"hurtling towards\\" the predictions that have time yet to come true. But the greatest effect the similarity between his Fordian future and our own society has is to help us relate to the universal, timeless issues that make this book interesting and almost a classic. Stability versus passion (remember Achilles choice?) Happiness vs knowledge (Adam and Eve...at least in literature), society vs individual, nobility vs indulgence. It's a little heavy-handed as it deals with these things, it lacks subtlety and complexity and eloquence, but that's probably why so many of us have read it in high school english classes. You have to start somewhere, and if you try to start with Homer, good luck.Some nice tidbits I particularly like:\\"For particulars, as everyone knows, make for virtue and happiness; generalities are intellectually necessary evils. Not philosophers but fret-sawyers and stamp collectors compose the backbone of society.\\" (2) Philosophers, along with poets and prophets and anyone else trying to see a thing wholly, belong on the margins of society.A fit description of the television:\\"Not so much like drops of water, though water, it is true, can wear holes in the hardest granite; rather, drops of liquid sealing-wax, drops that adhere, incrust, incorporate themselves with what they fall on, till finally the rock is all one scarlet blob.\\" (32)\\"But everyone belongs to everyone else...\\" (46) Sexual communism!Maybe the best quote in the book:Impulse arrested spills over, and the flood is feeling, the flood is passion, the flood is even madness: it depends on the force of the current, the height and strength of the barrier...Feeling lurks in that interval of time between desire and its consummation. Shorten that interval, break down all those old unnecessary barriers.\\" (51)\\"Progress is lovely, isn't it?\\" (118)\\"Yes, and civilization is sterilization.\\" (128)Another quote that is bigger than the book:\\"One of the principal functions of a friend is to suffer (in a milder and symbolic form) the punishments that we should like, but are unable, to inflict upon our enemies.\\" (214)\\"But I don't want comfort. I want God, I want poetry, I want real danger, I want freedom, I want goodness. I want sin.\\"\\"In fact,\\" said Mustapha Mond, \\"you're claiming the right to be unhappy.\\"\\"All right then,\\" said the Savage defiantly, \\"I'm claiming the right to be unhappy.\\" (288)"},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"One of the most extraordinary books of the last century. Originally published in 1932, Brave New World introduces concepts such as cloning, virtual reality and computers. It is rather frightening to consider how many of Aldous Huxleys ideas have become reality in our world, was he foreseeing the future and if so is our world heading for disaster as his Brave New World. Something to think about definitely. The book also features an excellent foreword by Christopher Hitchins."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"With chilling detail, Huxley ushers us into his brave new world with descriptions of assembly-line human production. It's a safe world, sterilized, and its subjects imagine themselves in a state of perpetual happiness--so long as they are taking their soma, a sleep-inducing prescription. It's a world in which morals have been turned upside down, and in which \\"free love\\" is a means of keeping slaves numbed to their own reality.Mankind, it has been decided, will be most successful and content if each individual has a predetermined role in the mass production of goods and services. Some will play the role of Alphas, some Epsilons, and others Semi-morons. No one is discontent--in theory, anyway--because they have been conditioned for their lot in life. All are young, beautiful, somewhat generic, but in no need of individuality even in matters of romance, since all physical intimacy is shared freely and without strings attached.This is Huxley's reaction to the times in which he lived, and it still rings true in many ways today, eighty years later. He deals with the mass-production idea that was making true craftsmen and artists irrelevant. He even dates his futuristic world using A.F., or Anno Ford. His Fordship is a clear reference to Henry Ford and his assembly line standards that changed the way companies ran. Huxley also takes shots at eugenics, which were a popular subject of that day--and which led to some of Hitler's ideas--and at rising Communism, with its goals of making everyone unimportant except to serve the greater organism. In turning the tables on moral thought and religious precedents, Huxley paints a world in which all true joy and personality has given way to a sleepy, technology-induced enchantment. He paints these masses in literary metaphors as worms, maggots, and locusts, and gives us only a few glimpses of humans before this time.It's a disjointed story in many ways. This is a book more concerned with concepts and ideas than with strong characterization or smooth narrative. It jumps around. It seems to care less for its subjects than for its subject matter. Perhaps this was intentional, with Huxley giving us a detached view of a detached society, but it does make for a less engaging tale in some ways.Nevertheless, this is a fearless gaze into the future and a bold warning to a western culture obsessed with perfection, production, and beauty. Huxley says at one point that \\"words can be used like X-rays,\\" and he proves that in startling fashion with this timeless and disturbing classic."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"I can't help but compare Brave New World to Nineteen Eighty Four as I read it immediately prior, and by comparison, BNW is a superior book. I realize that they were written in different historical contexts (BNW after WWI and 1984 during Stalin's reign), but I still find BNW's dystopian vision much more compelling.The fundamental difference between the two is that Huxley envisions a world in which people are controlled by their desires whereas Orwell sees people being controlled by fear. Historically, control by fear has not lasted - such control leads people to feel oppressed in an escapable way and thus leads to revolution. The velvet fist of control by desire, however, seems to be happening even now. When people are pacified in ways they find enjoyable, few will be aware they are being oppressed, and even fewer would consider revolution."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"The most chillingly accurate futuristic satire with incredible insight on religion, philosophy, the sciences, society, and happiness; how these relate to humanity, and always will relate to humanity. Buy this book, read this book."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Production of identical beings, neo-Pavlovian conditioning, surrogate parenting, ranking from birth, mass production in biology, Fordism--these are factors in the new age the novelist describes. Sleep teaching is practiced. The caste system is followed in the new world. There are soma bottles and sex hormone chewing gum used to satisfy the desires of the populace. There is a Bureau of Propaganda, (and a College of Emotional Engineering), to assist in the running of society.Names of the character are clever and significant--Lenina, Hoover, Bernard Marx, Herbert Bakunin, Morgana Rothschild, George Edzel. Sometimes people go to New Mexico to look at the savages. Travel is nearly instantaneous in rockets. The best quality is Fordliness. There are two kinds of existence, one of which takes place at the Reservation of Savages. In the other kind of existence clothes are discarded, not mended, people look healthier, and Bloomsbury is the centre of industry. There is a Social Predestination Room filled with embryos.Bernard Marx, an Alpha-Plus, is to be sent to Iceland by way of punishment until a trick is played on the Director. The Director of Hatcheries and Conditioning, Bernard's overlord, is confronted by Linda, a savage, an apparition in the nature of the first Mrs. Rochester in JANE EYRE. The man becomes an ex-Director. Upper caste London is agog.Linda obtains soma and remains in Bernard's apartment. While touring Eton, Linda's son John is told that the students don't read Shakespeare. Hemholtz Watson is Bernards friend. He has also come into conflict with authority. Ultimately John gags on civilization.Reading the book leaves the reader as puzzled as before the experience takes place. It is a solid work, sustaining a place among the top literary titles. The book is a rebuttal to the formation of mass society and resultant standardization. The challenges to liberty are suggested. Ideas such as history is bunk, end not mend, (forced obsolescence), the loss of individuality are chilling."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"This is a great book. A must read for today.

After reading this book, which was excellent, I was surprised to find out that Huxley was indeed a supporter of eugenics and was an avid drug user.A BNW seemed to have a very pessimistic outlook on all forms of genetic engineering, eugenics and also on drugs to achieve an \\"ignorance is bliss\\" state of mind. Perhaps his intent was to show the dark side of what can arise, but I don't think, as apparently he didn't either, that GE or drug use is an inherently evil thing. I plan on reading The Island and Doors of Perception by him next, perhaps this will expose some more understanding of his views on this topic."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"We are treated to a glimpse of a possible future world where friendship can still exist.

The would in the 1930s was continuing its mechanization. In much of Europe and beyond, men were becoming robotic in military, industry, and commerce. Life was changing to fit technology and less the other way around.Second, it talks about the timeless. Freedom of indulgence but silence of criticism? Look at our news and you'll find it. Childish pursuit of pleasure but denigration of soulful happiness? Sex plentiful but meaningless, a game?There are fart jokes on TV but menstruation is gross. People want to smoke in public but breast-feeding should be kept private. Sexuality has been neutered and sanitized. It's a joke. It's playful and not powerful. Life's extremes have been eliminated and replaced with comforting blandness, meaningless, immaturity.And the pundits who champion such immaturity smile at us, smug at what they call progress. The past, they assure us, was barbarism.But this is not why I love the book. I love the book because Huxley, in his cynicism, shows us this scene.Marx is told that he can go to live with the outcasts and he refuses. He can't imagine leaving the world he hates. He wants the world to cater to him but the notion of leaving that world is terrifying. And that is what makes the book so realistic. Those who would reform our world are still so tied to it that progress could quite possibly be doomed. It's one thing to demand a change, but to suffer the consequences? Look at all the revolutionary elements of Western society and you'll see the same interest in change but refusal to pay.I say this as a radical. This book makes clear the threat of dictatorship but at the same time criticizes those who would attack the system. This book challenges us all. Right, left, rationalist, religious... We're all part of the dark Brave New World.

Others are deliberately made to be born crippled, ugly and retarded to different extends will eventually become manual-labor workers. However, through hypnosis the society makes sure that its every single member will absolutely love his life, no matter what he or she is doing. People's lives are essentially reduced to pre-programmed existence, but people don't mind, since they don't realize that things can be different.Nevertheless, in this society there are no wars, no decease, no violence. Everybody is happy, lives are simple but good. What could be possibly missing?In Brave New World Huxley is trying to find out what makes one's life worth living. Beneath the sci-fi exterior of the Brave New World lie profound philosophical issues - the value of freedom of choice, and the ability to determine your own destiny.I find BNW to be an excellent thought-provoking material. The quality of the novel is somewhat marred by the too-detailed description of this futuristic society. I think Huxley could have spent less time on that, and more time on attending to the really important issues in this novel. Nonetheless, Brave New World is a terrific novel, definitely a must for someone who enjoys thought-provoking literature."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Although the number of reviews here show that Brave New World still has a sizeable readership, this book has to some extent been unfairly overshadowed by Orwell's &quot;1984&quot;. Whereas Orwell's vision of the future has proven to be wrong in almost every respect, Huxley's could be rewritten almost word for word today and still be an accurate portrayal of the direction we're moving in. For trivia buffs, there is a sad footnote to Huxley's comparative obscurity: Do you know when he died? November 22, 1963. Even in death, he was overshadowed by a more glamorous but vastly less talented person."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"To read this book, you have to unlock that other 90 percent of your brain that stands dormant for the better part of your life. It's one of those books that takes your whole attention, no TV blaring, no siblings running around, just reading. I tried my hardest to recognize all the subliminal messages and morals this book was trying to teach, and I still couldn't get them all.The whole plot of a futuristic &quot;utopian&quot; society is well documented in this work. Huxley was a genious, period. How a person could write a book in the 1920's, and predict such things as a &quot;happy drug&quot;, and a futuristic societies so advanced, is beyond me.If you like science fiction, or just like a good &quot;mind&quot; book, get this one.

It was an exciting look into Huxley's view of society in the future and the social problems linked with it. Well worth the read."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"After perusing the reviews of this book, good and bad, I was surprised to see little or no comment on one of its major themes: conditioning.In Huxley's vision the children of tomorrow are assembled (most with missing parts) in factories, then given subliminal treatment for the whole of their formative years. As adults they dutifully regurgitate catch phrases ('everybody belongs to everybody') and take the drug Soma to calm any inclination toward passionate activity.Is this not how we grow and learn? Observing out parents and peers in the early years, aping their fears and desires, then being routinly drilled through 12 to 20 years of schooling the 'rules' of society, from Red Light Green Light to DARE and onward? And when stress and discomfort inflict the masses, isn't alcohol, tobacco, TV and McDonalds there to soothe all the troubles away? A crude version of 'Brave New World', perhaps, but steadily evolving as the few bright minds of the world today work to make our lives a little easier.In the book every person is separated into a caste: Alpha, Beta, Gamma, ect., and are strictly taught to avoid contact outside these defined boundaries. This idea is contemporary: these 'castes' actually do exist, here and now, in terms of intellect and upbringing, and is a reason why pop culture in the U.S. is so varied and so much of it is invaribly crap. As the World Controller states: &quot;...eight-ninths below the water line, one ninth above.&quot;Enter into this sterile landscape of happy consistancy John, a 'savage' raised by Indians but never accepted, a tortured soul who reads Shakesphere and embraces isolation to the point that the tempting flesh of another drives him into a frenzy of guilt and rage, all deriving from and focused to his mother figure. As the book relates the experiences of his early years and winds up to its inevitable conclusion for this stranger in a strange land, we see that John is just as unable to escape his conditioning as the hypnopadia-trained clones of this miserably perfect furture.Some claim that Huxley is too obvious in his presentation, but I disagree: buried in the text are critisms of our society, sexual repression in particular, and truths about entertainment that none can deny--that all of it derives from suffering. 60+ years after its publishing, BRAVE NEW WORLD is far more contemporary and insightful than most the bestselling drivel thrown at us today. You may like it or hate it...but you cannot walk away without a change in your thought patterns."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Aldous Huxley may have a been an indulger of hallucinogenic drugs and had some morose thoughts but his novel, Brave New World, is amazing. Despite the fact he accurately predicted prozac and ridilin with &quot;soma&quot;, he knew quite a few pertinent traits of human nature. If we were given perpetual &quot;happy drugs&quot; wouldn't it be too tempting to toss it out to the intolerant masses? The conditioning of people is, while dehumanizing, a plausible possibility to satisfy lower classes' boredom and grief. Ignorance is most definitely bliss. Huxley asks us if happiness and proficiency are the only important questions in society. John the Savage arrives with beautiful ideas of art and lost culture, most notably his amiable obsession with Shakespeare. The beginning is slow but effectively disturbing; however, we are soon drawn in by the &quot;Woody Allen&quot; personality of the musing, negatively ruminating Bernard Marx. Lenina reveals the &quot;slacker&quot; in all of us who wishes not to think, not to know, and simply enjoy themself for granted. Some reviewers have complained about the lack of original characters or meaningful plot. This novel is supposed to be satirical, forewarning, and cathartic for thinkers. The discussion between Mustapha Mond and John is fantastic and thought-provoking; it is like nourishment for speculative minds. John's fatal suicide represents the essential tragic nature of man. To understand government manipulation and the reality of the human situation this novel is a must-read."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"After being stimulated to read this book while reading the notes to George Orwell's 1984 (which, incidentally, is completely different from BRAVE NEW WORLD), I found myself vastly let down. The intentionally flippant tone works for some people, but it detracts from the heavy/academic/philosophical themes, which, in this case, are actually quite good (which is why I even give it two stars).The criticism Huxley received from his contemporaries--that he is the typical Oxford playboy-gentleman who seems far removed from his ideas--are valid. While one reads the book, one gets the feeling that Huxley is playing a little game--immensely enjoying himself by playing around with these essentially lofty ideas. His metaphors are self-consciously pretentious. For example, the whole idea of the Savage picking up a book of Shakespeare and somehow intrinsically understanding it, only later to spout off passage after passage, is shamelessly implausible. Metaphors should be subtle and smooth in such a way that the reader &quot;forgets&quot; that he's actually reading a book, but so many of Huxley's are too blatant that they beome intrusive and insulting. The running &quot;ford&quot; joke, I thought, seemed clever at first, but, like any joke, it wore out and became irratating after I read it on almost every page. For a man of such education and intelligence, it is surprising that he could write such a potentially good novel so poorly.In the final analysis, if someone is only mildly interested in serious social topics, this book is for that person; it is funny (at times) and well-written (at fewer times) and exhibits some intriguing ideas (again, at times). But this book is not the &quot;great work&quot; that so many who buy into any author who would attack the progression of Western civilization make it out to be."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"If you've seen &quot;The Matrix,&quot; you know how after seeing it for the first time, your mind reels, thinking about reality, perception and the true meaning of life and freedom. You will have the same haunting introspective thoughts after reading &quot;Brave New World.&quot; The novel is incredibly visionary, especially in light of the fact that it was written in 1932.Huxley foresaw not only a television in every home, but one in every room, communication and entertainment devices everywhere. Movies called &quot;Feelies&quot; in which the viewer sees, hears, smells and feels the action (can you say &quot;virtual reality?&quot;). A society in which everything is turned upside down... the important things in life; loyalty, family, faith, monogamy, individuality are thought to be &quot;anti-social&quot; and perverse and even obscene... while promiscuity, drug use and wanton spending are considered virtues.A society bent on economic stabilty so much, that it sacrifices the very need for economics - citizenry. Children are not born, they are &quot;decanted&quot; in hatcheries and conditioned like Pavlov's dogs to like or dislike the things that will make them &quot;content&quot; in their pre-destined station in life.I saw the made for TV movie based on this book a couple of years ago and wanted to read this book ever since. This book will make you think. It will make you look around and see how the media and government continues to spin around us as we're usually oblivious to the things that matter.As a society, we are so consumed with &quot;self&quot; and temporary pleasures, that we don't treasure the things that really matter until they are taken away from us. The society and government in this story take advantage of this societal weakness and feed it and nurture it until people willingly give up their freedoms because they're getting everything they think they want, when they want it. When things temporarily seem bleak, they just take Soma, the perfect drug that has no side-effects and just makes you &quot;take a Soma holiday.&quot; Each person silently ignores the void that their life has begun and they drown their lonliness and emptiness with drugs.Huxley's writing style is very interesting, sometimes a narrative, then suddenly text that reads like a screenplay - yet sometimes you're not sure who's say what and when, yet it is still an easy read... scenes are constantly changing and you get so caught up in the story, you often don't realize you're turning pages.Previous to reading this novel, my favorite piece of fiction was &quot;1984&quot; by George Orwell, but I think this book has just bumped it to the #2 slot. This is an intriguing, and thought-provoking story that you will never forget."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"This is an excellent book and taught me much about why America is where it is today.

If you had a God, you'd have a reason for self-denial.\\"\\"But industrial civilization is only possible when there's no self-denial. Self-indulgence up to the very limits imposed by hygiene and economics. Otherwise the wheels stop turning.\\"...\\"But God's the reason for everything noble and fine and heroic. If you had a God ...\\"\\"My dear young friend,\\" said Mustapha Mond, \\"civilization has absolutely no need of nobility or heroism. These things are symptoms of political inefficiency. In a properly organized society like ours, nobody has any opportunities for being noble or heroic. Conditions have got to be thoroughly unstable before the occasion can arise. Where there are wars, where there are divided allegiances, where there are temptations to be resisted, objects of love to be fought for or defended-there, obviously, nobility and heroism have some sense. But there aren't any wars nowadays. The greatest care is taken to prevent you from loving any one too much. There's no such thing as a divided allegiance; you're so conditioned that you can't help doing what you ought to do. And what you ought to do is on the whole so pleasant, so many of the natural impulses are allowed free play, that there really aren't any temptations to resist. And if ever, by some unlucky chance, anything unpleasant should somehow happen, why, there's always soma to give you a holiday from the facts. And there's always soma to calm your anger, to reconcile you to your enemies, to make you patient and long-suffering. In the past you could only accomplish these things by making a great effort and after years of hard moral training. Now, you swallow two or three half-gramme tablets, and there you are. Anybody can be virtuous now. You can carry at least half your mortality about in a bottle. Christianity without tears-that's what soma is.\\"You can replace 'soma' with 'television', 'bars', 'video games' or any other of the distractions that keep us from real contemplation and the concept that God might be real.Huxley's only draw back is his underestimation of America to distract itself.

These are exaggerations. While this is no Jurassic Park or other thrilling novel, this cautionary tale is still fascinating.However, you must try to understand it. It's not an extremely highbrow novel, but it's still a moral story that must be viewed in depth.This book is the polar opposite of 1984, and so, it is just as important to have on your shelf. While Orwell's later rendition of a dark society showed utter peril and the crushing weight of a socialism gone wrong, Huxley displayed amazing creativity(Not to speak ill of Orwell's skill, of course) and chose the reverse--not the classic totalitarianism, which all know is a threat, but the world of enticement and temptation, into which victims come of their own free will as opposed to being brutalized.This is always a possibility.

Originally published in the 1930s, &quot;Brave New World&quot; can only be more relevant today. However, one does get tired of the &quot;1984&quot;/&quot;Brave New World&quot; faith in an all-wise authority able to crush so thoroughly human freedom. At the end of a 20th century which has seen much real life totalitarian government, we can witness that no man-made institution has proved as skillful as in Orwell's or Huxley's dysutopias. It is more like the totalitarian governments have been more sluggishly brutal and mindlessly inept! And even as one will find plenty of people in &quot;consumer societies&quot; ready to drug themselves senseless and to live only for pleasure, so you find plenty of people who still live for the beauty of the poets and according to the wisdom of the sages. I also suspect most people were not so much wiser or appreciative of beauty and philosophy in the 19th century and earlier. Huxley lady protests too much, methinks. Nevertheless, the part when John the Savage confronts the Controller is literature of the highest rank; and I look it as a powerful statement more to individuals than to societies. But all the test tubes and talcum powder and soma and banalities seemed to me artistically inferior to the stark brutality of Orwell's &quot;1984.&quot; It is interesting to see how much Koestler's &quot;Darkness at Noon&quot; and &quot;1984&quot; and &quot;Brave New World&quot; and Bradbury's &quot;Farenheit 451&quot; feed on each other!

I definitely think I enjoyed it better the second time because I took the time to analyze the story. I think Huxley paints a terrifying picture of a future without individual freedoms. The absence of disease, old age, sexual repression, etc. was certainly attractive. Although the society seems to have no problems or ills, none of the benefits outweigh the lack of individual freedom or free thought. Members of the society are conditioned to the point where their thoughts are not their own. These thoughts are responses that the Controllers have deemed to be appropriate for the entirity of society to learn. Also, members of this society are not allowed to choose their occupations. They are conditioned from their creation to unquestioningly enjoy their jobs with no possibility of change. This does not seem ideal to me. I would never give up my right to choose my fate for a seemingly easy existence. The world in the book is devoid of life because it eliminates the pain and loss that is an important part of our existence. I don't want the easy way out.

While Orwell thought that Big Brother would rule the day, Huxley wrote about a society that conditions itself by removing morality and replacing it with the pursuit of happiness...at all costs.While written in 1932 and set in the future, much of the book continues to be futuristic and fantastical. But, unfortunately, some of the book hits way to close to reality. The conditioning for death rings a familiar tune as we watch the debate over dying with dignity in the media. One of the most disturbing aspects is the lose of the identity of the family - the role of the mother and the father in maintaining a stable and vibrant society - with the debate over same-sex marriage and the scientific advancements in embryo fertilization, the idea of family teeters on the edge of extinction.Brave New World is between a 6 and a 7 on a scale of 1-10 for difficulty - the difficulty comes from Huxley's attention to detail in creating his futuristic society complete with unfamiliar words and concepts. I read the HarperPerennial edition of this literary classic which comes in one page shy of 200 and retails for $16.00 - and this edition includes Huxley's Brave New World Revisited section, which is also worth the read."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Some of those giving Huxley's work low ratings, I think, are missing some of Huxley's message, or are choosing to ignore it, which is especially evident by their comparisons of this book to Orwell's. I suppose it is inevitable that these two novels be compared, but I think while they have similarities, the two authors write about two very different forms of totalitarianism and social control that threaten free society.Orwell's 1984 has often been interpreted (or appropriated) as a case against a socialist form of totalitarianism. Orwell himself was a socialist (though of the Atlee/Labour, not the Stalin/Marxist-Leninist variety), though unfortunately many rightists have used this book and Orwell's other work, Animal Farm, to condemn not just Communism but anything except for the lasseiz-faire accepted today. Perhaps both Orwell and Huxley wished to speak of human nature and social behavior in broad terms, but I also believe a purely social and political critique in the form of fiction and satire can still be serious literature, considerations of the deeper questions of human nature aside.And this is why I like Brave New World, even more so than 1984. Whereas Orwell warns of a totalitaranism based on perpetual war causing the poverty of a ration economy at home, Huxley examines a social control built on plenty or an illusion of plenty. One might then say that the works of these two men are opposite sides of the same coin in that Orwell's work is a warning against communist totalitarianism and Huxley's work warns us of a capitalist variant that is just as dangerous and certainly more relevant, at least to our own society.It may be easy to take a book such as Huxley's and say we are becoming such a dystopian society as in his book, but I think it is even easier to praise a book such as Orwell's instead, reduce it to a &quot;communism&quot; or &quot;socialism&quot; = &quot;bad&quot; statement, and then say thank goodness we defeated the evil empire. What makes Brave New World so great is that it can't be so easily simplified. What sets Brave New World apart from other novels of the genre is that Huxley wrote a critique of his own times as well as of our own times and he shows that not only are Communism and 19th century Dickensian capitalism oppressive systems, but 20th century consumer capitalism, based on the legacies of Ford and Freud, is as well."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Its strange what aldous Huxley had imagined for our future but somewhat accurate.

However, I did not relate much to the characters and wished they were developed a little further. The book begins in the Central London Hatching and Conditioning Center where a scientific process that develops embryos, basically cloning, occurs--the Bokanovsky Process. The embryos, which produce twins, are put into different castes where they're conditioned to bring certain things to society until they're developed.

Not for the fainthearted!"},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Brave New World Book Review by Benjamin CastilloAldous Huxley's Brave New World is a depiction of how the future will be like from his view point. Even though the future may not be how he describes it to be, where everything is being controlled by the government, the book still has timeless themes. One main idea is that there is no such thing as perfect happiness or a utopian society. Another is the relationship between stability versus individuality. Through his use of interesting characters and creative solutions, Huxley is able to carry out and explain the themes well.One theme that personally stood out to me is stability versus individuality. The New World is a society based on technology, where Ford, representing their god, is worshipped. Ford symbolizes technology and the sense of everybody working together. The people are all created in labs and are conditioned to be in a certain class. The citizens only know about and want to be in the specific class that they were born into. This allows for stability among the people since they are happy with their lives. The people are conditioned to do the job they are assigned to and to never go against the government. Lenina, one of Huxely's well-developed characters, is a prime example of this. However, there are still some \\"bad eggs\\" in the \\"perfect society,\\" such as Bernard. He is a top Alpha. Alphas are supposed to be handsome, tall, and loved by everyone, but Bernard doesn't fit the Alpha mold. So he seeks the approval of others. Bernard's desire to fit into his society shows that individuality is not welcome in this society.Similar to Bernard, John is also seen as an outsider from the New World. His individuality comes from his past. He is from the Savage Reservation, where an ancient tribal group lives. They still believe in natural birth and believe in ancient religious and spiritual rituals. But John's mom is from the New World. Thus, John has parts from both worlds. He was introduced into the New World by Bernard and was used as an example of what not to be. He was seen by the New World society like a circus animal. John initially loved the New World, but then became disgusted by it. He came to the New World thinking that it's the best place ever. John thought that he would be accepted in the New World since everybody there loves each other and are happy. But once he got there, he saw that the people didn't have the same values or beliefs that he had gotten from the Savage Reservation, which were monogamy and morality. So he couldn't live the way he wanted to because it wouldn't have been accepted. So once again, individuality is disallowed in the New World for the purpose of stability.The New World society and government has to be uniformed in order for it to be stable and work well. Individuality loses against stability because it shows that if you try to show your individuality, you will be attacked for it. Thus, individuality does not work for the New World society. Our society also witnesses the same struggle between stability and individuality. Jails, retiring homes, and mental asylums are some ways we separate \\"abnormal\\" people. One can always try to who one's individuality, but society might not always approve of it.Huxley has great ideas and shows them well throughout the book. It is an overall good book, but I would recommend it more for the science fiction demographic. The book has a lot of specific terms that requires readers to have some background knowledge in science and technology in order for them to understand the story well. However, the book still has themes that our world deals with and therefore, it is worth the read."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Huxley's dystopian future really digs at our factory made lifestyles and the eventualities once industrial production gets to its runaway state end.

This fiction poses future or alternate societies where things have completely fallen apart. While there were predecessors, the two pioneering works in this field were George Orwell's 1984 and Aldous Huxley's Brave New World. Interestingly, for those who've read both, we are given two almost completely different dystopias, showing that there many way to develop these unpleasant worlds.A key difference between the two books, however, is that you'd never want to visit Oceania in 1984. On the other hand, the England of Brave New World seems superficially nice. It's only when you really look at it that you see the problems.The plot of Brave New World is rather minimal, as Huxley is more interested in describing the world than developing a story. Essentially, it is the tale of John, a \\"savage\\" who grew up outside \\"civilization\\" and enters it, only to find its comforts mask a subtle repression. For in this world, people are bred and trained from birth to belong to certain classes and do specific functions. In fact, birth itself is done by machine and to most people, the concept of parents are horrifically obscene.As with 1984, Brave New World - which was written in 1932 - seems to predict some things that are true today. Besides touching on \\"hard\\" science fiction ideas like cloning and designer babies, there's the softer science fiction dealing with social trends, in particular with the focus on entertainment to distract the masses. The citizens of Brave New World may think they're free, but they're incapable of true independent thought; actually, they don't even want to independently think, so long as they have their games and their drugs.Unlike 1984, Brave New World is actually funny; not jokey funny, but the subtler humor of satire. It is also very readable, if at times a little too talky (especially in the last parts of the book). Overall, it is an excellent book, even if you're not into science fiction."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"If one is willing to take a forest perspective and not take too much time looking at the individual trees, this book is uncannily accurate in its predictions. I have read much praise for this book and many criticisms of individuals for praising this book, and it is not difficult to see why it raises such strong emotions.I only recommend that when you read this book don't be focused on trying to figure out who the good guys and bad guys are. It is much too complex for that. Also, contrary to other reviews, Soma is NOTHING like Prozac or cannabis. It is its own fictional drug that could be analogous to television, the internet, or maybe Xanax if you must use another drug as an analogy. I only feel it necessary to point this out because these are such glaringly false analogies that I don't want people to have to waste time ridding their minds of these misconceptions as they read the book."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"This another one of those books you absolutely must read if you haven't done so.

The newly produced humans, then, are socially conditioned, predestinating them to be of the Alpha, Beta, Delta and Epsilon castes. This process, which involves cloning and genetic engineering, is aimed at serving the world state motto: \\"Community, Identity, Stability.\\" The novel's heroes, Bernard Marx, and a \\"savage\\" named John, begin to turn the plot, as both find the aspects of a controlled society disturbing.Huxley's \\"Brave New World\\" is written much in the same vein as Orwell's 1948 classic, \\"1984,\\" and concentrates upon loss of individual freedom. Huxley's work is remarkable in its research and detail, and, especially, in its prophetic exploration of things to come. Indeed, genetic engineering is now a reality (though only in its formative stages today in the twenty-first century) and en vitro fertilization is common practice. References to Ivan Pavlov, and the novels' ideas about \\"conditioning\\" that actually came to fruition in B.F. Skinner's Radical Behavioralism theories engender admiration for the thought Huxley put into creating this lasting work. \\"Brave New World\\" is good science fiction for adults and young adults, alike."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Although this book was written in 1932, the concepts are as real today as anytime in the past.

Published by MobileReference (mobi)The strength of the novel is in its focus on the basic characteristics of humanity, it offers to the reader a glimpse at the future but more than that, it offers a very intricate look at humanity and what it means to be human."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"PROS: A fascinating view of the future. The predictions are sometimes chillingly accurate. For example, soma, the drug of choice in the novel, is present today in the plethora of feel-good drugs (Prozac, Viagra, etc.) \\"A gram is better than a damn,\\" the futurists instruct. Similarly, the \\"feelies\\" are 4D movies (touch included) and are even more engrossing and numbing than today's TV. Just you wait. We're headed there.CONS: The novel's pacing is a bit slow at times.CONCLUSION: This century genetic engineering will finally make it mark on the planet. Read this book to get a feel of what could happen. I recommend it!"},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Brave New World was somewhat of a letdown. When I was half way through, I was hoping it would just be finished. Too many books have used this basic premise of injecting a person from the past into the future, although this may be the granddaddy.The book focused on the future, where emotions are eliminated by drugs and brainwashing. The main idea seems to be that if emotions could be eliminated, the world could be at peace.It is amazing that much of the technology of the novel (from the 1930s) is now old hat."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"This book is often cited as being 'like' and 'equal to' Orwell's Nighteen Eighty Four in terms of dystopian classic. While the book was undoubtedly earth-shattering for its time, I'm afraid compared to the timeless compelling masterpiece of Nighteen Eighty Four I found this one dated and irritating. I was just happy when the irritating main characters met their untimely ends and unlike the protagonist of 1984 I felt no compelling point had been made by the deaths."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"I am happy with my purchase; the books was shipped and delivered pretty soon.Thanks!"},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"If you loved 1984 or the Handmaid's Tale this is another to add to the collection.

It is not just for science fiction fans, but for lovers of good storytelling in general."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"I found that the idea behind a Brave New World was intresting, but the book itself was pretty boring. Brave New World is a lot like 1984. For example it dealt with society in the feature and described a totalatarian government. Except in Brave New Wold there is not much of a story line and you never get to know the characters. The whole book is pretty much just describing how their society is run. Another poroblem I found with this book is that there is never a climax and nothing exciting happens. I was pretty disappointed after reading because it had the potential to be so much better."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"All these positive reviews are good and nice and it seems as though at least half of you read the book, that's a good start. Some of you are even learning how to map patterns which is great, but please read into the book, wake up pleople. Any 5 year old can re-write the book in a long critique, Huxley already did that for us. Don't read the book look through the book. Connect the patterns, follow the back and forth tenis match of opinions that Huxley has set up, READ INTO IT. Believe me you will get way more out of it. I'll try not to repeat what everyone else has said (despite them doing it thierselves) but let me let everybody out their on a little secret. HUXLEY was a COMEDIAN. Sure he had ideas, like many other scientific writers to creat an alternate future but don't focus on that. That was at the bottom of Huxley's level of thinking. He enjoyed writting this book because it was a new level of radical rthinking. Why else would this be unavailable to buy in so many countries,... because there is more to it than the fact that test-tube babies exist today! Huxley was manking fun of humanity, he was making fun of you and me and everything we do and think about. He makes fun of our desires and tribulations, the fact that we can never be happy without sadness. Religion means nothing to Huxley but he understandes that it has also implanted itself in every society mankind has ever know since the beging of recorded time. He analyses Love in a way that Shakespeare never elaborated on (don't get me wrong the two can be compared, new ball-game. But please for the love of god (no pun itended for this Brocken down critisism of Christian faith) think fo your selves People.By the way I'm 14 years old"},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"This remarkable book is NOT, as certain misguided political pundits would have you believe, a warning about the inherant dangers of cloning or other future scientific advances. Instead it is a condemnation of the sacrifice of individual freedom and identity that had already begun in Huxley's time. The genetic manipulation angle merely serves as a framework for the much more insidious cultural indoctrination and consumerism prevelant in modern Western society."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"After reading &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; of Michael Crichton, the problem of genetics and future have in Aldous Huxley a great spectator. Written in the early years of 1930 it gives us the mentality of the modern world: a &quot;global village&quot; without individuals, only with faces and names. All equal, without opinions, without feelings, without the most human quality: sentiment. A great book, very actual and &quot;realistic&quot;. Last question: is Internet, nowadays, the pattern of all human beings? Is it the factory of new &quot;babies&quot;?"},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Aldous Huxley's Brave New World is an incredibly fascinating literary masterpeice. Each time I read it, I picked up something new and interesting to contemplate. Set in the future, it serves as an incredible warning of what the unmitigated and inconsiderate use of science might &quot;progress&quot; into. Huxley's fantastic use of detail and literary strategies such as juxtaposition allow the audience to become involved and a part of the book. I really enjoyed reading it and enthusiastically recommend it to any and everyone else."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"This is one of those books that starts off with a great idea, and just never really goes anywhere. I think the switch in protaganists was unnecessary and took away from the value of the book."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Brave New World should not be compared to 1984. Brave New World is an brilliant philosophy while 1984 is a boring novel. Thank you."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Having read BNW a few times, I can't help feeling that it might have been a more successful short story. The opening chapters are gripping and introduce some amazing concepts - such as the Alphas and Epsilons, the decanting, etc - but after this the pace seems to stall somewhat. On as slightly different topic, if you liked BNW you might also enjoy Isaac Asimov's Robot series, which also explores the use of different social classes, but replaces all the 'slave' classes with robots."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Brave New World is a favorite of mine and has been since my senior year in high school. Since then I have read it seven times and I find something new in it each time. The novel presents a view of the world as an anti-utopian society, where children are &quot;decanted&quot; instead of born and where the masses are intolerant of monogamy. They switch partners as frequently and as literally as they change underwear. Despite this, it also reveals a society in which the members are genetically prgramed to their social standing from the time of conception. No one is unhappy with his or her place (this is especially true for the lower classes) and those who object or promote chaos are simply sent away. As I said, very interesting..."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Since Im only in my early teens, I could NOT say this is my favorite book. Although this is true, it is one of my favorite books I have read in my life. This book's setting was way in the future. . Even though this is true, it could be closer than we realize. Huxley does a fantastic job of giving of the reader a description of this Brave New World. I couldn't put it down and recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good science fiction/classic/fiction/action/adventure/suspense/though provoking novel that will not let you down."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Huxley's Brave New World is one of those books that changes your outlook on the world, one of those books that makes you think for the rest of your life after you have read it. It questions the notion of utopia as a place of ubiquitous happiness, and suggests a higher meaning and purpose to life consisting of morals and beliefs rather than emotional and physical needs. This book is at once a little bit terrifying in its potential reality, pitting reason against belief and understanding of the true nature of things, but also hopeful in its indication that perhaps people are not totally incapable of reaching that higher state if they can only understand and accept that happiness is not necessarily all that it is made out to be. A thought-provoking book well worth reading."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"I enjoyed this book a lot. It was a good read. The idea of this world literary comes alive between the pages of this golden classic. The beggining is kind of mediocre but it just gets better and better. All the way till the end with a powerful ending leaving you quenching for more. It doesn't focus on one character but rather switches between the three of them. Aldous did a hell of a job writing this and I espesially love the describtion of all the processes.

Comparing today to the possible future, Huxley, lets you analize humanity. A Great Book!"},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Brave New World describes a utopian society with total conformity, where Ford is exalted to prophetic proportions, and the motto of Community, Identity, Stability reigns supreme. Is such a world possible?The proposition of total conformity is one of few impossibilities. The idea that a world could exist solely upon procreation and driven by primal urges and electromagnetic golf is simply unattainable, as this novel points out.Utopian society in itself contains inept thinking that it in the most simple of terms will never come into being. Improbability is the word of the century, as more things fall out of the perspective of impossibility, they too will fall vitcim to being shoved aside into the pile of discord.Although I find such a novel impossible of becoming a reality, it is written masterfully and should be recognized as a novel of worth. Huxley's dream of utopia(or does the word nightmare apply?) may never come into being, thoughts such as these have paved the road to infinity, which man has traversed time and time again."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Brave New World was assigned to my 10th grade English for summer reading. At first I was reluctant to read the book, because it looked really boring. But when I started to read it I really started to like it. I thought it was a scary thought to think of this as &quot;the future&quot;, and it made me think. Also I thought it was really wierd that Huxley wrote this story in the thirties. Sometimes this made the book of the 'future' humerous, but sometimes it was scary, because somethings are even starting to come true. Overall I thought it was a good book and I would recommend it to others."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Huxley provides a gloom view on utopia. Absolutely marvelous.

What he has failed to realize is that it is our world.In many aspects Huxley's masterpiece reminds me of Baudrillard; mainly apocalyptic culture, hyperreality, simulation, etc.The ending is fairly underrated in my mind.

Better than &quot;1984&quot; and &quot;Erewhon&quot; put together and served with &quot;soma&quot;. Peter Kreeft, an amazing writer and literary scholar, listed Brave New World as one of the six books of the 20th Century that he would make everyone read if he were God. And I would agree, because BNW is the most sobering (and clearest) fictional picture we have, of the end result of viewing mankind in strictly utilitarian terms. It could just as easily have been called &quot;Grave New World&quot;."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"brave new world is a fantastic book. it succeeds as a negative-utopian, pro-individualist book where 1984 and anthem fail. this is because it cries out in favor of emotion and reason at the same time. huxley puts on a pedestal not the solitary human, but humanity as a virtue, with all its weaknesses and inconsistencies making it truly perfect."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"I was coaxed by my father to read this book as a sophomore in high school. Now, six years later, I go back all of the time to reread this book. It is one of those books that forces you to step back and take a look at your own life, to see the insanity of your own existence. The scene where John finds his mother dying in the hospital and children are going through death desensitization is so disturbing and difficult that I find myself in tears by the end of the chapter. This book is a masterpiece, the best of its kind."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"I wouldn't call this book &quot;The best written book of all time,&quot; but as a reader who finds she reads through &quot;rock&quot; books until she strikes &quot;gold,&quot; I must say that this was a pretty good rock. Time and again I've read books that portray their vision of the future, but to no notable avail. This book however, stuck with me as POSSIBLE. Because the general setting and technology is within our grasp (if only scientifically, not morally) I found it intriguing. I label this book &quot;As realistic as anything possible is&quot; and rate it (1-10) a Seven."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"I'm 16 years old Uruguayan student that happened to come across Brave New World not long ago. I must admit I had to read it a couple of times with a dictionary at my side as it is confussing sometimes... but anyway I'm glad I decieded to read it.This interesting world, not very far from ours is ruled by &quot;soma-happiness&quot;, leaving feelings aside, playing to be God (or Ford as you wish) manipulating people's life before they are born, a life that Alpha, Beta, or whatever caste he/she results to be, should live happily. It gives us a glance of what a world like this might be. As far as I can tell this is a must read for everybody, specially if you like science-fiction."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"In \\"Brave New World,\\" first published in 1932, Huxley paints the picture of a world that is willing to surrender true joy for a bland happiness free of suffering, that is willing to abandon truth for comfort, that is willing to eschew heights in order to avoid depths, and that is quick to surrender human ambition and individual personality for the sake of societal harmony. It is a frightening presentation, precisely because it does not seem improbable.\\"Only a large-scale popular movement toward decentralization and self-help can arrest the present tendency toward statism,\\" writes Huxley in his foreword to \\"Brave New World.\\" No such movement has materialized or succeeded, and so this novel remains a poignant warning even today. A sense of entitlement and reliance on the government-as-saviour still reigns supreme in the Western democracies. \\"A really efficient totalitarian state,\\" warns Huxley, \\"would be one in which the all-powerful executive of political bosses and their army of managers control a population of slaves who do not have to be coerced, because they love their servitude.\\"Huxley's writing is not particularly impressive of itself; he has no special flowery gift when it comes to use of the English language, but he tells a mesmerizing story. \\"Brave New World\\" is a quick read, and it has a strong impact."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Though all books like this must be taken with a grain, or more liberal portions, of salt I found \\"Brave New World\\" to be an entertaining and thought-provoking read. Huxley reitertates many of the sentiments expressed by Thorough in \\"Walden\\". I found Huxley's choice of the name soma very interesting. A narcotic used by early Indian holy men to blend with the universal soul"},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Our Brave New World...what would Huxley say to see so much of his dystopia vision already realized in 2004? Already we focus much of our energy to find ways that ease the crazy sorrow that life brings, immersing ourselves in sitcoms, casual sex and even prozac - our modern day soma. Readers of Plato's Republic will see many ideas here alluded to as well, so many in fact that I think Huxley sourced The Republic as often as modern society itself.Brave New World presents a problem a little more slippery than that of 1984 by George Orwell. In 1984, people live under a dictatorship of fear and ignorance. The evil is plain and easy to see, as is the reader's certainty that he would 'rebel against it' were he in the same situation. It shouldn't be this way here. Imagine a place you could always be happy, you could have any sexual partner you choose and work was never more than a pleasant diversion. Probably that reflects your everyday dreams, and certainly Plato's. So, what's the problem?The problem comes from the idea that feeling good doesn't mean you are happy. That concept is so alien today that it boggles the mind at first. Certainly you won't see this played out on MTV. No, according to Huxley, happiness is being part of something bigger than oneself...a purpose, in other words. In earlier times that purpose was to perform God's work; in ancient Greece it was to perform heroic acts for your family's honor. Today's purpose is feeding your Id. Some have no problem with that, but others like John the Savage see that eventually, all highs and buzzes fade into a hangover and a wasted day."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"This is one of the few books that has only gotten better every time I've read it. Its themes have become more and more relevent as aspects of the fictional society in the book seem to be appearing, little by little, in some places around the world (especially America). While this book does not focus so much on the Big Brother all-knowing government facet to most negative utopias, as \\"1984\\" does, the books do share many central themes. Brave New World, however, diverges in one very important way: midway through the novel, the character of John the Savage is introduced to give the perspective of someone raised on a reservation (which sounds very similar to the Native American reservations set up in the US today) on the new society. John's initial impressions of their brave new world and his shocking final reaction to it leave the reader wondering how he/she would react in the same situation, and what that really says about the values propegated by the fictional society in the novel. For anyone interested in modern day politics, the future of our own society, or even just sincere \\"what if\\"s, this book is for you. It grips you right from the start with disorienting but enthralling imagery and keeps you right to the last page. I give it a solid five out of five stars."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"For anyone who is remotely interested in politics, reading Brave New World is a must. Published in 1932 when the world's most powerful rulers were often totalitarian in nature, Huxley examines the possibility of a society that is so controlled by the government that the very concept of choice is taken from the people. In an attempt to \\"save\\" him from a \\"meaningless\\" life, John the Savage is uprooted from his wilderness home on a 'Savage Reserve' and transplanted to London, where he is thrust into distopian society, and all that it entails. He soon finds himself in love with Lenina Crowe, a sexually-liberated woman who is so societally conditioned to \\"free-love\\" that she cannot understand the foreign, chaste mentality which with John thinks. John frequently quotes Romeo and Juliet in her presence in order to describe her beauty; however, she does not understand because such literature as Shakespeare has long been banned by the state. He desires marriage, which is a foreign concept to her society, and she desires free-love because this is all she knows. Ultimately, this lack of sexual consensus destroys their relationship. As a result of John's opposition to the way in which the government is run, John challenges the World Controller, Mustapha Mond, and claims that the current method of government cannot possibly be the answer to society's problems. Mond counters, \\"We prefer to do things comfortably.\\" To which John replies, \\"But I don't want comfort! I want God, I want poetry, I want real danger, I want freedom, I want goodness. I want sin\\" (240). When John attempts to flee from this oppression once and for all, he realizes that he has only one option which will allow him to truly escape his societal chains.Huxley paints a haunting portrait of a society in which the advancement of science negatively affects the lives of its individuals, as opposed to advanving them. He writes to discourage highly-centralized, totalitarian governments, for the nationalistic radicals he observed in his lifetime (the Bolsheviks, Fascism, Hitler, Stalin)all had devastating affects on the world. In Brave New World, the members of each caste are conditioned to love their given roles in life, for as Huxley states: \\"A really efficient totalitarian state would be one in which the all-powerful executive of political bosses...control a population of slaves who do not have to be coerced, because they love their servitude.\\" This plays into the idea of eugenics and \\"bottled babies,\\" because each caste must not only be societally conditioned, but genetically predisposed for the conditioning as well.The surprise ending of the novel is an interesting twist, and further reinforces the ideological clashes between John and the distopian society. Although some of Huxley's predicitions have not materialized, as you close the last page of the novel, you will find yourself wondering just how far off he really was in the majority of his predictions. For in terms of government, in the immortal words of Huxley himself, \\"You pays your money and you takes your choice.\\""},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"I never really considered myself a big sci-fi reader, but I have found myself leaning more and more towards them because of books like this one. I just finished reading it for school, and it was absolutely amazing.The writing itself is superb--Huxley writes in the way all writers should. He creates images, makes striking comparisons, and best of all, he keeps it going. It is very difficult to become bored with this novel.The first chapter is a little confusing if you don't understand exactly what is going on. In this new society the reader is introduced to, people are mass-produced. They are fashioned in one of five social classes identified by the first five letters of the Greek alphabet. Alphas are superior to the Epsilons. The first chapter discusses the breeding of the people, and the second and third deal mostly with how they then proceed to condition the people during infancy and throughout childhood.The reader is also introduced to Bernard, Lenina, and Helmholtz, all of whom are significant characters.Bernard is the intellectual, always wondering. This would be okay, except it is not in the best interest for social stability (what the new government strives for). Therefore, he is extremely atypical. Lenina is a shining example of conditioning and its intended results, and Helmholtz is an awkward character who could easily be happy but isn't for some reason. Other characters include Mustapha Mond, John the Savage, and Linda--all of them chief characters.The protagonist, John, is a complex character that does an outstanding job of carrying the action of the book from chapter seven until the very surprising and thought-provoking end.On a last note, \\"Brave New World\\" is an outstanding satire of modern society. It is one that I know is read often in high school, and in many colleges (my brother, a college Junior, just finished reading it again for a class, and he's a chemistry major). This book is absolutely fascinating, and I highly recommend it. It is a wonderful read that you will likely want to revisit again and again."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"When I first read this book I loved it for its content and social commentary. But in all honesty, this is not an outstanding literary work. Huxley's writing is very superficial. I don't mean that in any pejorative way either, it's simply that his novels are about written to be about what they're about. That may not make too much, let me elaborate. Essentially what Brave New World is, is Huxley's essays in novel form. Now these are tremendous essays with a lot of thought and applicability to reality. But when this work is compared to 1984, a work that is not only writtened to be about something but could exist on its own simply for the skill that Blair has with prose, Brave New World is lacking. The characters are probably the baest example of this. In 1984 Winston is a very complex character who has quite a hard time with himself because he is too weak fight Ingsoc and too ignorant to articulate his feelings. While somehow Bernard is quite articulate but only for the sake of his being a Freudean model. Winston's problem is something that people truly experience. Not being able to argue with a \\"superior\\" figure because the esoteric feelings they have are adequate to convince them of something but to languid to effect someone prepared for the arguments. That isn't the only problem I have with this novel but I haven't got the time to go on."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"I see that some reviewers are saying the threat of a world similar to that in this novel is farther away than ever. That would be nice. Increasingly, I'm interpreting sci-fi dystopian/utopian novels not as warnings of a dire future but condemnations of a nasty present. And though this book was written in 1932, as civilization increases its messages only become more pertinent. I just finished reading this book today, and it would probably be wise to wait longer before reviewing it, but what the hell. Huxley's \\"brave new world\\" can be read as a brilliant satire of consumer society and civilization itself, in which people avoid feelings, pain, and confusion through drugs, work, and a tunnel vision that is reinforced by societal \\"conditioning\\" (though I would argue it's part of human nature as well). I was troubled by the Savage's masochistic tendencies, and confused at times as to what Huxley really thought of the Savage's over the top behavior, in the pursuit of sensation and actual feeling. Because the Savage goes so far over the top by the end, I can only assume that Huxley feels he's gone too far in the opposite direction, pursuing pain and denial simply because they are values opposed to the society he hates. Though the book is a brilliant critique, not just of society but of the way the human mind strives to shut out anything unfamiliar and uncomfortable (this is where the book's true greatness lies, I think), I'd consider deducting a star simply because it's more of an essay told in novel form than a full-fledged story. Many pages are devoted to pure description of the society, albiet cloaked in the dialogue of characters rather than in the narration, and sometimes this overshadows the characterization and story development. But the opening chapter uses an interesting, almost \\"cinematic\\" technique of \\"crosscutting\\", which can be exasperating to read but is original at least. And the characters are actually quite convincing and recognizable, especially Bernard...it's as if George Costanza from Seinfeld wound up in a future society (see Woody Allen's Sleeper). It's brimming with fantastic ideas, but I don't think it's fantastic storytelling. Nonetheless, that's a minor quibble, because it's very readable and extremely insightful. Pick it up right away. 5/6"},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"The first dystopia I've read is Fahrenheit 451 for 7th grade english. Now, I can't stop reading dystopias! My dad told me Brave New World was a good book, so I started. I think this is the closest dystopia likely to happen. A sex-crazed world who thinks it's animal-like to have children naturally. I love the idea of a class system from the super-human double alpha plus to the grovelling Epsilon-Minus. And Soma, \\"a gramme is better than a damn.\\" The freaky part about that drug is that something very similar to that now. And it doesn't make you happy, but sort of clueless, like an infant curious about the world. My favourite quote is from Benard Marx, as he refers to the way men talk about women, \\"As if they were a piece of meat.\\" I use that quote all the time now when a man says something sexist. John the Savage is my favourite character, because although he is referred to as a savage from the savage reservations, he is actually the smartest person on the book. (Well, maybe Mustapha Mond is.) And just in case you don't know why it's called Brave New World, In Shakespeare's \\"The Tempest\\", The character Miranda says:O, wonder!How many goodly creatures are there here!How beauteous mankind is! O brave new world,That has such people in't!"},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"A Brave New World gives the reader a new perspective on humanity. What I think is a concurrent theme in this book is one of knowledge and stability. It seems that although freedom is much more desireable to people, it is also unstable and allows for no basic law to encompass all boudries within society. People in this book dont' want to think for themselves, they want to be told what to do, because they can never be sure what they do is what they should do. I like this book because of its challenging ideas."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"I often rate a book/movie/etc by what new ideas it offers to me as a reader, and this book gets the highest rating based on that criterion alone. Huxley's ideas on how a utopian state would function is thoroughly absorbing. Take, for example, how Huxley describes the &quot;conditioning&quot; of the kids so that they behave in a certain way. The scene in the beginning of the book in which the babies are conditioned to hate books and flowers is chilling and amazing. The nature of relationships in this world are also interesting, as people are encouraged to have as many partners as possible and are forbidden to actually &quot;love&quot; a person. That is definitely a teenage boy's wet dream. Huxley could have really dug deep and explored the nature of relationships in this world, but he doesn't do so. He is more interested in the institutions that keep the people in a permanent state of happiness, than in the people themselves. This could be a reason why, while ideas and processes are well-described in this book, character development often suffers.Comparisons with 1984 cannot be avoided. Brave New World is better at describing the workings of the state and how the different &quot;departments&quot; of the state function to control the people in the state. 1984, on the other hand, tells its tale more from the point of view of the people being controlled, which is why it gives the reader a better emotional connection with its well-developed characters and relationships. In conclusion, I would say both books are must-reads as they will offer different things to you as a reader."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Set in a dystopian futuristic society, this novel warns about the dangers of technology, standardization, and excessive government control. Huxley wrote during the Great Depression, when many people around the world worried about having basic necessities, yet he looked beyond the immediate problems and saw a hyper Fordist world, in which mass production and wealth eventually lead to a rigid and boring society--a society where no one has the right to be unhappy. Huxley's weakness as a writes is character development. His characters usually do not evoke much sympathy or interest. But this book paints such a vivid and unique picture of a dystopian life that may come that it easily deserves five stars. Also, Huxley anticipates the use of genetic engineering to shape the character of human beings. In its portrayal of a possible ominous tomorrow, the book is in the same league with Orwell's &quot;1984&quot; and Burgess' &quot;A Clockwork Orange.&quot; If you never read this book, you owe it to yourself to read it as soon as you have free time."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"This is certainly one of most characterful and dramatic readings in my experience of having heard over 200 audio books. BRAVO to Michael York! I wish more actors of such talent would record more important literature unabridged. Don't miss this phenomenal performance of a great novel!"},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Predicting the future is a risky business, often complicated by unpredictable discoveries and changes in the world. Aldous Huxley, with his book Brave New World, seems to have no trouble at all. Brave New World is an excellent book about a utopia set hundreds of years in the future, where Henry Ford is worshipped as a religious figure and everyone is at peace with one another. People are trained for their jobs from the embryo, babies are \\"decanted\\" from test tubes, and parenthood is looked on with disgust. But in the city of London, England, a man named Bernard Marx starts to question civilized life, beginning to want a long-term relationship, a family, knowledge- all forbidden things in the future.One reason that I recommend this book is the incredible way in which Huxley portrays the \\"future\\", as of the early 1930's. Things such as scent organs, portable music devices, and transatlantic flights definitely didn't exist back when Brave New World was written, yet he predicted them surprisingly well. He even got the time of the jet to America correct, around six-and-a-half hours. His accuracy with the future is one of the reasons why this book is still in print after around seventy years, as a matter of fact.A second reason to read this book is Huxley's character development. As Bernard begins to realize that civilization and the world he lives in is controlled, distorted, and altogether wrong, he begins to affect society with these different ideas. This causes others to start questioning the way that they were raised, all of their beliefs, and the world that they live in. What do they know for a fact, and what was hypnopedically taught to them while they slept? What's more important, happiness or knowledge? What is right?However, he did make one small error when guessing what the future would be like. Nuclear power can't be found anywhere in the book, even though it was a hot topic back in the thirties, when Brave New World was written. Huxley mentions this in an article he wrote around twenty years later, talking about how inexcusable that mistake was- but is it really? Fusion will probably be a huge source of power in the future, but who knows? Things change, a better source of power may be discovered, anything. And is that really a good reason not to read this book? It's certainly excellent in many other ways. I really think that this is a great book, and is definitely worth reading. It will introduce you to new ways of thinking, give you an enlightened view of the world, and maybe even change your life."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Everyone loves to complain about society, to articulate the tragedies that play out when our humanity is confronted by our need for order, control and progress. And it is our contemporary lives, our advancing technology, which always seems to be at the root of every problem. Of course we must not forget that this is no new concept. Brave New World was written 70 years ago, but still speaks the same truths that we see today. Life, trauma, and isolation within society are all real and inescapable elements of the human experience, and despite our desires to avoid pain, emotion and, at times reality itself, those elements will find a way through the barricade, hunt us down and show us, at great cost, how human we truly are.Aldous Huxley's bizarre future takes place in London, England the year of our Ford 632, a new calendar that marks the passage of time in years since the life of Henry Ford, who at the time the book was published was still the poster boy for a modern mechanized world. People are no longer born, but manufactured, not raised, but conditioned, and each one predetermined not only by genetic makeup, but also by the treatment of their fetus before they are \\"decanted\\", into the position they will hold in society. Physical ability, intelligence, and even height are determined to set apart each caste from the next. Each caste is suited for a different level of work and each caste is conditioned from birth to unquestioningly accept their lot in life.The modern world under this system is one of constant happiness and each member of society exists in a vacuum of emotional relationship. No mothers or fathers, brothers or sisters, etc., no need for marriage or family or home, no need for any kind of monogamous sexual partnership, because \\"everybody belongs to everybody\\", or so they recite like a mantra along with all the other catch phrases of forced wisdom that have been ingrained in their minds while they slept in their nursery beds. The conditioning, the separation of caste, and the routine distribution of a pacifying drug called soma (Huxley's magic narcotic), all work together to maintain order and a world that is completely void of conflict. And that is the great conflict itself, of course, for what is life without pain and misery to serve as a reference point for happiness to be compared to? What natural order can exist without chaos?One character, who appears early in the novel, Bernard Marx, throws a wrench into this clockwork of perfection. It is rumored that his fetus was mistakenly treated with alcohol, for he is short for his caste and is prone to withdraw from society. His search for himself leads Marx to a reservation in New Mexico where he meets a young English man, raised in a Native American settlement, whose mother was accidentally left behind and shortly after gave birth. John, who is commonly referred to as \\"the savage\\" or Mr. Savage (to those wishing to address him formally), returns with Marx to the civilization he has never known and quite appropriately finds it to be the most appalling and unnatural environment imaginable.The counterpoint between the three main forces (John, the savage, Bernard the maladjusted and disillusioned upperclassman, and the greater society of drug-induced contentment), accentuate the themes of loneliness, abandonment, and the struggle to find meaning in a life without conflict. This interplay culminates with a debate between John and the Resident World Controller for Western Europe that lasts for several chapters, after which the reader is left still begging the question...what is happiness if you are not allowed the freedom to be unhappy? And the few remaining chapters offer at least the possibility of resolving that conflict.It is hard to say what is more remarkable, that Huxley's forecasts of a Nazi-like utopian future are seemingly foreshadowed by our own advances in technology and science, or that the themes of humanity versus machines, nature versus control and order, are still so relevant, if not more so, in our modern lives. Brave New World is still a potent commentary. Life is an experience, one that is enriched by conflict, but hindered by it at the same time. We can feel isolated by society, but rarely from it. The timelessness of these truths will never escape us nor will the impact of what is commonly referred to Aldous Huxley's greatest work, which remains as surprisingly relevant today as it was 70 years ago."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"\\"Brave New World\\" is set in the Britain of the distant future, around 2500 AD or, as the people of that era would say, 632 AF (After Ford, the car manufacturer Henry Ford having been elevated to semi-divine status). The world is ruled by a single World State. Babies are no longer born, but are mass-produced in \\"hatcheries\\", or baby factories. One advantage of this method of reproduction is that it allows the State to create five main classes of people, each sub-divided into various sub-classes. At the top of the social pyramid are the physically and mentally superior \\"Alphas\\", who are the intellectuals and rulers of society; at the bottom are the \\"Epsilon semi-morons\\", the unskilled manual workers, with \\"Betas\\", \\"Gammas\\" and \\"Deltas\\" in between. Everyone, from their earliest childhood onward, is conditioned by \\"hynopaedia\\", or brainwashing, to accept their place in society and to obey its rules unquestioningly. The family has been abolished; people are conditioned not to fall in love, but are encouraged to have promiscuous recreational sex with as many partners as possible. (The idea of sex for reproductive purposes is regarded as disgusting; \\"mother\\" and \\"father\\" are obscene words). Christianity, culture and any form of science other than that officially approved by the State are all forbidden. The greatest good for the individual is \\"happiness\\"; negative emotions can be banished by the use of a psychoactive drug named \\"Soma\\".The State's \\"conditioning\\" of its citizens is, in most cases, a great success; nearly all spend their lives in the state of smug complacency which is what is meant by \\"happiness\\". Dissent and disaffection are the preserve of a few Alpha intellectuals who are generally dealt with by banishment to remote islands. One of these intellectuals, Bernard Marx, has started to questionthe values of his society. He enjoys solitude, loves nature and believes in exclusive love, all of which are officially forbidden or discouraged. He uses his position as a psychologist to travel to a \\"Savage Reservation\\" in New Mexico. \\"Savages\\" are those peoples who live according to values other than those of the World State; the New Mexico \\"savages\\" are mostly people of American Indian descent who follow a traditional, non-industrial lifestyle. They still live in family units and produce children by the time-honoured method. Their religion is a mixture of primitive Christianity and indigenous beliefs. Their culture places great emphasis on marital fidelity and on stoicism and courage. One of the \\"savages\\", John, travels back with Bernard to London, where he becomes an object of great curiosity to the members of the Alpha intellectual society. John, however, is not impressed by the \\"brave new world\\" he discovers, and the climax of the book arises out of the clash of two different sets of cultural values.\\"Brave New World\\" is often bracketed together with the other great British dystopian novel, George Orwell's \\"1984\\". During the days of the Cold War it was fashionable to say that, whereas \\"1984\\" was based upon the Communist East, \\"Brave New World\\" predicted the future of the capitalist West. There was some truth in this, but it was never more than a half-truth. There are two reasons for this. The first is that, whereas \\"1984\\" was written in the late forties, in the early days of the Cold War, and is indeed (among other things) a satire on Soviet or Nazi-style totalitarianism, \\"Brave New World\\" was written in 1932, a year before Hitler's accession to power, seven before the outbreak of World War II, and a decade and a half before it became fashionable to talk about a bipolar Communist/ capitalist world. The values of Huxley's imagined world are reflected in the names that he gives to his characters. Henry Ford is the most revered figure in this society, and the highest-ranking character that we meet, the World Controller Mustapha Mond, is named after another industrialist. (Sir Alfred Mond was the founder of the British industrial giant ICI). On the other hand, the most important female character in the book is called \\"Lenina\\", and one of the most important male ones has the surname Marx. Another character is called Benito; had the book been written a few years later there would doubtless have been an Adolf. The World State, in fact, represents a synthesis of Soviet-style Communism, Fascism and modern-day industrial capitalism. Just as Evelyn Waugh's Guy Crouchback saw the enemy in 1939 as \\"the Modern Age in arms\\", so Huxley's dystopia represents the Modern Age triumphant. His satire was aimed at all aspects of his society, not merely one particular political ideology.The other big difference between Orwell's vision and Huxley's is that Orwell's book is set only a few decades after the date of its publication; Huxley's is set several centuries in the future. Although it has some original features, such as the telescreens and the \\"Newspeak\\" language, Orwell's Oceania is largely a traditional dictatorship on the Nazi-Soviet model. Propaganda plays an important role, but in the last resort the power of the Party depends upon coercion by force of arms and fear of the secret police. The Party official O'Brien describes his chilling vision of the future as \\"a boot stamping on a human face forever\\", a vision with which he is quite happy because he knows that he will be one of those doing the stamping. Huxley's World State is a much more advanced and efficient tyranny. In his foreword to the novel (written in 1946) he states that his aim was to portray a society \\"in which the all-powerful executive of political bosses and their army of managers control a population of slaves who do not have to be coerced, because they love their servitude\\". Unlike the cynical O'Brien, Mustapha Mond believes in all sincerity that the control of the World State by himself and his fellow-members of the Alpha-plus elite will achieve the Utilitarian dream of \\"the greatest happiness of the greatest number\\".In many ways, \\"1984\\" is the better book when seen as a piece of literature. It has a better plot, the prose is more fluent and the characters are more credible. Huxley's characters are little more than mouthpieces for ideas; neither Bernard nor the Savage has the depth of Orwell's Winston Smith. For most of the second half of the twentieth century, \\"1984\\" also seemed more politically relevant. In the twenty-first, however, things may be changing. We may not yet have baby factories churning out groups of Gamma-pluses or Epsilon-minus semi-morons (although recent developments in cloning and genetic engineering suggest that that may be a distinct possibility), but many of Huxley's other predictions are coming true. The family has not yet been abolished, but its importance as an institution has declined since he wrote his novel Youth, beauty and sexual vigour are eulogised, improved contraception has led to a growth in promiscuous recreational sex dissociated from reproduction, psychoactive drugs (called Valium or Prozac rather than Soma) are increasingly used to control negative emotions, the increasing consumption of material goods is regarded as necessary for the economic good of society. Since the fall of the Berlin Wall, the rise of a Stalin-type Big Brother has not seemed to be the greatest threat facing the Western world. A ruling class of bosses controlling slaves who love their servitude may turn out to be a greater danger."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"I've been very \\"familiar\\" with this book for years, but somehow never got around to actually reading it for myself. (Until now that is!) In some ways this book was what I expected, but in other ways not what I expected at all. I was surprised at how racy and frank it is in regards to sexual activity - especially since the book was published in 1932! I'm surprised it wasn't more scandalous than it was upon its release in 1932.So many different aspects of this book could be commented on...I'll focus on one. In regards to ###, birth control and reproductive technology - this book was incredibly and amazingly prophetic!Remember that in 1932 birth control was just about non-existent (expect for natural methods and animal intestine condoms.) Sexual standards were much more conservative than today. (Compared to modern day statistics: Living together outside of marriage was almost unheard of, the divorce rate was very low, illegitimate births were rare, etc.) And ### still had much stronger ties to pro-creation than to pleasure. Abortion was not only illegal but a scandalous thought to most people. And, of course, reproductive technology was still many years in the future.Yet, in Brave New World, we see a world where women are either sterilized or on birth control. In the rare case it failed, they go to the \\"abortion center\\". ### is purely for pleasure and promiscuity the normal standard of behavior. (\\"Everyone belongs to everyone\\", and having only one ### partner is thought of as strange and bizarre.) And humans are created and raised in a laboratory.It is incredible how quickly our society has slid from 1932 to the present day! This is one reason some conservative people then (and today) are opposed to birth control. They see the pandora's box it can open... Birth control (and the back-up option of legal abortion) makes sexually loose standards a possibility, and reality! We are already living in the Brave New World. Aren't people in our society today - who believe in sexual abstinence before marriage, and ### being only for marriage - thought of as narrow minded, unrealistic, old-fashioned and even a bit strange?Aldous Huxley even commented on this in the new forward for the book that he wrote in 1947. (He comments how, in 1932, he saw the scenarios in Brave New World unfolding in 600 or 700 years in the future. But writing in 1947, he thought we might actually see these things by the end of the century.) In regards to ### and marriage: \\"Nor does the sexual promiscuity of Brave New World seem very distant. There are already certain American cities in which the number of divorces is equal to the number of marriages. In a few years, no doubt, marriage licenses will be sold like dog licences, good for a period of time, with no law against changing dogs or keeping more than one animal at a time...\\" (page xvi in forward)When one looks at the present statistics for co-habitation, marriage and divorce in this country, and the debate over what marriage even stands for....Whoa!! Brave New World was shockingly prophetic.Too prophetic for its own good. It was a book ahead of its time. Most of its reviews in the 1930's were negative...because it was just seen as crazy and too \\"out there\\". It's too bad more people didn't take it seriously. We have slid very quickly into a moral wasteland..."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Because Brave New World and 1984 both tread on similar ground, comparisons are inevitable. The novels are very different in tone though, reflecting the period in which they were written. Orwell's cold war era novel presents a world that is bleak and brutal and heavily influenced by events in Soviet Russia. Orwell wanted 1984 to be a realistic portrayal of what the world would be like under a totalitarian regime.Brave New World was written in 1931, before the world became aware of Stalin's atrocities, before the rise of Hitler, and before WW II, and as a result it is hopelessly naive compared to cold war era novels, like 1984.Some reviews would have you believe that Huxley has predicted the future with startling accuracy - but this is just ridiculous. Anyone can read any novel set in the future and find at least some part of it reminiscent of the way things are today. It's not much different than reading your horoscope and convincing yourself that it was written just for you. The world Huxley presents in Brave New World bares only a superficial resemblance to present day (or any likely future).But I don't actually think Huxley was trying to predict the future. He wanted to say something about Britain's rigid class structure, about the materialistic nature of society, and about what it means to be happy. He set his novel in the future so he could exaggerate aspects of society as a form of social commentary. Brave New World is satire. It was never meant to be realistic.Novels like Brave New World and 1984 spend a considerable amount of time explaining the way things are in the imagined future. This can be interesting, but it's no substitute for a story. Brave New World, unfortunately, lacks a strong narrative flow. Our protagonist isn't even introduced until half way through the novel.Brave New World isn't terrible but the lack of a clear voice and the absence of even one likeable character made it difficult for me to feel engaged. John, the savage rebel is so earnest and idealistic and has such a pathetically romanticized view of the world that I didn't find him particularly interesting. The ending of the novel was inevitable, given the character's obsession with the tragedies of William Shakespeare. I suppose we are meant to be moved by the events in the final few pages - but I wasn't. This is the biggest problem with the novel. Huxley may give us a vision of the future that is intriguing, but he doesn't deliver a story that engages us or give us a character we can care about.Brave New World is worth reading as a curiosity but despite its potential, Huxley's novel fails to deliver on its promise."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Would you like to see a perfect world? Can you even picture a perfect world? I have with the help of a book called \\"A brave new world\\" by Aldous Huxley. This is a science fiction that can take you on a trip hundreds of years in the future to a place where there is no suffering, depression, burdens, or poverty, depression is treated with grams of soma, violence and pain are left in the past and there is food and jobs for all. There is complete social stability. One cannot help but be happy in this perfect world. But a world that has no suffering, violence or pain is a bland world. This world really doesn't know happiness because it has never appreciated how bad sadness and pain are. Mr. Huxley knew that without the bad side of society the good side looses its flare. Maybe society is perfect being imperfect.A brave new world tells the story of Bernard Marx, a lower than average Alpha. Now babies are born in jars, and carefully cultivated and conditioned to accept their predetermined roles in life. Alphas are the highest level. They are intelligent, arrogant, strong and beautiful. Lower down are Epsilons, Betas, gammas, and deltas, lower level people who perform the more menial yet necessary functions of the society. Bernard is an abnormality, a rather weak and small Alpha, who has deep yearnings to break free of the society. Bernard gets permission to visit a Reservation, a place where progress has been banned. There he meets John the Savage, a white male who has been raised among the Indian's. He decided to bring John back to civilization.This book can open up your eyes but unlike the world it portrays it isn't perfect. This is a very complicated book with an incredible plot, theme and story line that have the potential for brilliance. Unfortunately the writing style does not compliment its brilliance. The characters weren't developed very well. You can never really get into their shoes and feel their emotions. This is also a very confusing book. It jumps to and from ideas and leaves gaps in its story line. In the beginning I was so lost that I almost put the book down but luckily I chose to read on and I am very glad I did so. If you are looking for an easy book to breeze through and just take up some spare time, this is not what you are looking for. If you are an advanced reader looking for something else to read, something that drifts from the sea of all the other bland books then I suggest that you read this book. You will not regret it."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Imagine a world with no pain, eternal youth and endless drugs and sex without consequences. Sounds great, right?Now imagine giving up dignity, love, art, adventure, religion and nobility in order to be part of this world. Starting to have second thoughts?The \\"Brave New World\\" dystopia isn't quite as bad as the one in \\"1984.\\" No one is going to throw you in room 101 and torture you. They'll just keep you so doped up on soma and free love so that you forget everything that isn't superficial. It's a world that promises security, contentment, pleasure, but lacks purpose.In my opinion, the book falls short of it's classic stature, though just barely. The religion of Henry Ford is never fully elaborated, the word \\"Ford\\" is simply substituted for \\"God\\" throughout the book. What's more, you have to get halfway through the book before you meet a character that is interesting, though this is in part to show the constrast to the other \\"characters\\" who are a product of a superficial world.Critics of this book say that it is a hack job on scientific progress. It's not. In fact science is not the great evil in this book, stability is.

I have a 40min. drive to work, so I started revisiting some classics on audio to listen to on the way to work. Michael York does a great job of reading this book. I'm a little confused at why most of the main characters have Scottish accents when they are from London, but maybe York's fantasy is that by the time the book takes place, the Scots have dominated the U.K. There is a part in the begining when Huxley jumps back and forth between characters and settings line by line. I don't remember having trouble following the logic when reading, but it was a little difficult to keep up while listening. Otherwise, the novel works well as an audio book."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Brave New World is a very interesting book that draws you in. This book makes you think about a different world other than the world we live in today and how people think differently as a result. The author uses different points of view and changes from character to character to make the reading interesting.I feel that the only weakness in this book is the level of explanation or depth. They throw you right into the story without much explanation or background. This gives the book an appealing aspect but also makes it confusing to read.If you are planning on reading this book you should know that there is some very challenging vocabulary. These words would make it very challenging to read this book at a young age.But overall I think this is an awesome book if you are in the mood for a dystopian adventure."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"I really admired reading Brave New World, Aldous Huxley brings life to each one of characters and brings the reader into a world where normal human desires such as, the human interaction, human abilities to reason or to argue, beliefs, human's intelligences. The human's physical longings such as the attraction to the opposite sex, and also the human communication doesn't longer matter in this new world that Huxley creates.The novel opens at Central London Hatching Conditioning Centre factory, where the director and Hatchery is giving a tour to a group of children who are learning about the society in which they live in and how it is the way it is. Within the tour the boys discover that this factory isn't a normal factory, this factory creates human embryos for the World State. This embryos are categorized in five different castes called Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, or Epsilon. Each castes are trained to obtain a certain role within the society, such as leadership or menial labor but one characteristic each castles posses, is the loss of real human emotions, attachments, intellectually, and the ability for self reasoning.This World State is located in London and its the new world, everything outside of it is considered savage reservations, one man named Bernard Marx who is seen as one of the leaders in this new World State questions his own beliefs about the society in which he lives in, which forces him to take a trip to one of the savage reservation in New Mexico, this is where he encounters the protagonist, john. John is considered to be normal within the world that we live in today, he has the ability to reason, choose beliefs, resist sexually desires and to be his own person, a real human being.Bernard Marx takes John out of the savage reservation and into this World State,once John arrives he starts to realize that this World State is utopia on earth, the World State civilization is controlled by soma (soma is a chemical spry that takes away the humanly emotions, such as fear, sadness, pain, hurt, everything that makes us human). The ability to be intelligent no longer exists in this civilization. \\"Christianity without tears--that's what soma\\" is.Within the world State John struggles to live and understand this new society and the means to be free, to be a human being, to long for real danger, goodness, and the ability to express real emotions such as tears and happiness.In my life the only thing that makes me human is the ability to be hurt, sad, afraid, excited, and weary; this are my emotions. Without emotions I would not be able to fall in love, enjoy books or movies, or anything that makes life wroth living. If I was john brought to this World State I too would struggle to finding where I belong and eventually would lead me to insanity. In a society where people are created without any personal freedoms and without the ability to have emotions, that society will never stand strong but instead collapse to the ground."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Here is a classic work which is an easy read that covers topics as relevant today as when he wrote it so many years ago."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"To say that \\"Brave New World\\" is revolutionary is a drastic understatement. Published in 1932, \\"Brave New World\\" manages to cast a deep look into the future and examines the downside of a production centered economy. The glance toward the future that \\"Brave New World\\" provides is so prolific that it stands relevant even today. Author, Aldous Huxley launches the reader into a future filled with promiscuous sex, chemical dependency, and State control. Huxley transcends science fiction and produces literary greatness.\\"Brave New World\\" introduces the reader to Huxley's vision of the future, a tightly regimented, well-oiled production machine that exists around a strange nexus of dismissing the concept of self-denial while maintaining a complex hierarchy of social order. Humans no longer submit to the whims of religion or the wisdom of history, but are instead raised as wards of the State within a caste system based on embryonic predestination. This world seems to operate efficiently and smoothly until an outsider, an anomaly is introduced into the system. The inhabitants and the outsider must learn to cope when the world and the philosophy of a Savage bring to question the morality of the established social order.Huxley weaves together both a vivid story and a stark social commentary, making the book impossible to put down. His brightly apocalyptic view of the future (in the sense that society as we know it will no longer exist) shows one possible outcome of a society geared toward consumption. Strangely the dark vision of the future is still relevant today. The lessons contained within \\"Brave New World\\" are timeless and the writing is among some of Huxley's best."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"It's hard to believe this book was written in 1931, Huxley is awfully accurate on some of his futuristic visions of how society could end up.This book basically describes a society that appears to be Utopian at first glance. Humans are made at certain genetic intelligence and caste; they are conditioned to be grateful for their place in life. Of course humans being humans there are occasionally those who divert from the norm. The story focuses mainly on Bernard Marx, an Alpha who is born too short, and as such ostracized and isolated in a society based on community and on Lenina a woman who is a fairly average society girl who agrees to travel with Bernard to Reservation. At the reservation they meet a Savage named John who travels back with them to \\"proper\\" society. What ensues is basically disaster.The kind of creepy thing is that Huxley is pretty spot on about some of the things in his Utopian society. There is a lot genetic engineering going on, subliminal messaging, regulated drug use to promote serenity, etc. The beginning of the book is the most shocking because they explain how they modify the chemical make up of the fetuses to make them smart or stupid, strong or weak. This is followed by a discussion of how they condition the infants to like or not like certain things based on what function they will have in society. It is a society where everyone is equal but no one gets to make any decisions.The people in the society are encouraged to be somewhat infantile in their decisions; time not working is spend playing games or engaging in sexual activity. Despite the society being depicted as somewhat British the members are encouraged to give into their baser natures whenever they want...emotion makes for unhappy people so it is best to not think about it too much.What happens when John, a Savage raised by a (gasp) mother, a man who loves and hurts is brought into this society is fascinating but predictable. He has a hard time making sense of a society where \\"mother\\" is an indecent word and love is a foreign concept.The book is very readable and well-written. The story is engaging. I am sure at the time this book was written it was ground-breaking. Unfortunately most of the factors of society that are discussed in this book I have read discussed in more current books. For me what set this book apart from other dystopians was the fact that it was written so long ago, also the fact that Huxley didn't pull any punches on the human conditioning...they are pretty ruthless, and lastly how reasonable he makes the set-up of such a society sound. There is a portion towards the end of the book where the Controller explains to John how their society evolved to what it is today; the Controller explains what they tried and what actually worked. The Controller's argument sounds disturbingly reasonable and almost makes you understand how a society set-up like the one in this book might work out well for a large amount of people.Overall I enjoyed the book and I am glad I read it. None of the ideas really blew me away and the story was engaging, but not absolutely incredible. It is a book that makes you think; especially when think of the time frame in which it was written. The topics discussed are something which will make you take pause but some of the ideas presented aren't that far away from where we are today (genetic engineering, etc.). Definitely something to read and something easy to relate to."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Brave New World is an incredibly though-provoking book...although, some of the thoughts that it provokes are incredibly disturbing. Huxley creates a dystopic society where peace and stability are maintained because humanity has used technology to do away with ideas and feelings like love, family, religion, and individuality. There are no books. All members of society are genetically engineered to be satisfied with whatever pre-ordained position they will hold in this society. If anyone starts to have a feeling other than complete satisfaction, they are encouraged to drug themselves with soma for few hours while the feeling passes. The story follows several characters and eventually ends up on a \\"reservation\\" where the savages live a more....natural life? John the Savage returns to society with a few societal members who had vacationed on his reservation. The consequences of this action require the reader to think about the importance of human emotion and the institutions we hold dear."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"I wholeheartedly agree that Brave New World is an important book -- I just can't stand it. The satire is thin, the extrapolations from the trends which Huxley observed in his time are too plain, and none of the characters are even remotely likable. The combination of childlike persons and the heavy emphasis of their sexual activities turned my stomach.The Soviet Union with its planned economy and society was clearly one of the big inspirations for Huxley, and if so, he completely misunderstood it. Of course, in hindsight it's much easier to see that communism is just another form or brutal dictatorship that never was meant to do anything else but maximize the power in the hands of a few and to enslave everyone else, yet I think that Huxley should have seen this also. I think that George Orwell was a much keener observer of this fact. Indeed my biggest problem with the novel is that I disagree with Huxley's vision of totalitarianism. I cannot imagine a dictatorship that 1) is not based on an aristocracy that (either openly or covertly) enslaves and brutalizes those beneath them and 2) does not deal swiftly and brutally with its dissenters. Huxley's world is run by World Controllers, who plan and command everything, yet who genuinely seem to be concerned about making people happy (even if this means they have to make sure that a large number of people are born as cretins, and if they have to drug everyone in society) even at the cost of sacrificing their own happiness. If some of the intelligent ones actually start questioning the system, this regime just ships them off to a remote island of their choice, to be with similar-minded people. At one point the all-powerful Mustapha Mond openly envies those who get to go to the island. This is where the book finally and completely lost me. It has been said that \\"power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely\\", and this is why I find Orwell's and Bradbury's dystopias far more believable than Huxley's."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Stunning! I have read the book, and now re-read it, and it only gets better. But the question always comes up: which is better, Brave New World or 1984? Well, first off, both are good, if not great works in themselves. But it seems that people always choose 1984, and just 'cause it's more \\"storyish.\\" Well, this may be true, but I wouldn't count out Huxley's little masterpiece too quickly. There are three main points to make about Brave New World in supporting its excellence, and possibly superiority to 1984 . . .1. Huxley writes with an unending intelligence, but his genius is relayed subtly to the reader. Just check out the names of his characters for instance - Marx, Bakunin, Engels, Pop&eacute;, LENINa (all names of socialist/communists and/or busts on religion) - and the list goes on and on. Huxley's satire is unique, if not all the more biting in the fashion it is presented. The best example of this lies in the Solidarity Service, a direct slam at the practice of Communion.2. Like any great writer, Huxley knew Shakespeare, and incorporates his works into the novel. Just read the book through once and see if you don't agree that John the Savage is the penultimate Shakespearean tragic hero.3. Huxley doesn't have to be as blunt as Orwell with his terrifying vision of the future. He doesn't force us to label this aspect or that aspect of his dystopia as \\"black\\" or \\"white,\\" \\"right\\" or \\"wrong,\\" but rather allows us to determine what is horrible and what is possible.All in all, it is only those without patience and those unwilling to stimulate their minds who label Brave New World as \\"bland\\" or \\"outdated.\\" For those who claim that it is \\"wrong\\" in its predictions, just think about the permeation of sex into everyday life or just how close we are to \\"test tube babies\\" right now . . ."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"I found out about this book from a friend who was interested in reading it, and after researching it and seeing it compared to George Orwell's 1984, I decided to read it. I think critic Neil Postman said it best with, \\"What Orwell feared were those who would ban books. What Huxley feared was that there would be no reason to ban a book, for there would be no one who wanted to read one. Orwell feared those who would deprive us of information. Huxley feared those who would give us so much that we would be reduced to passivity and egoism. Orwell feared that the truth would be concealed from us. Huxley feared the truth would be drowned in a sea of irrelevance. Orwell feared we would become a captive culture. Huxley feared we would become a trivial culture, preoccupied with some equivalent of the feelies, the orgy porgy, and the centrifugal bumblepuppy. As Huxley remarked in Brave New World Revisited, the civil libertarians and rationalists who are ever on the alert to oppose tyranny \\"failed to take into account man's almost infinite appetite for distractions.\\" In 1984, Orwell added, people are controlled by inflicting pain. In Brave New World, they are controlled by inflicting pleasure. In short, Orwell feared that what we fear will ruin us. Huxley feared that what we desire will ruin us.\\" After reading Brave New World, I can definitely see how it relates to our modern society and was quite surprised to learn that it was written in 1931"},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"I bought this vintage copy because I like to read classics generally as they originally appeared in order to distill the \\"atmosphere\\" that each famous classic modern novel presented in the era in which they were written.The generation for when the novel was published must have been truly shocked at the thoughts of a future society of free love, diminished education and purpose and lack of religious security.Now it is not so shocking, because most of these \\"predictions\\" have come to pass. You know now that Mr. Savage is going to have a big problem with the new society and you can predict his response. In consideration of the time this was written in, I am sure it was much more of a shock to them.I loved the story, the book and now I really appreciate it."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Brave New World takes place in a utopian London around the year 2540, which started with a good idea, but went way wrong. Humans are produced in large numbers in a high-tech factory without the filth of viviparous reproduction. The babies produced are organized into five castes and are conditioned specifically to do their part in maintaining their society. As the reader progresses farther into the story, they find out what is sacrificed for the stability of the utopian world they occupy, when the reader explores this world through the mind of a man named John, who has not been conditioned to accept this world that suppresses the emotions we value so much today. John comes from a \\"savage\\" reservation in New Mexico; where the humans remain that practice our modern day culture. With advances in science allover the world making our lifestyle obsolete, the \\"savage\\" lifestyle is repulsive in the eyes of the rest of the brave new world. See how our blind ignorance can lead to catastrophe.Although an attempt to sum up the novel in only a small amount of words would be in vain, I can offer that this book is a must read for anyone who is capable of thinking beyond ideas provided by way of the text.This was SUCH a great book. The story Brave New World entertained me more than any other book I have ever read before. It not only was an incredible plot, with amazing creativity, and imagination, but also has shocking conversation that challenge values accepted in our society today, and challenges the minds of all intellectuals willing to relate to the characters, and attempt to draw parallels between Huxley's story, and the story our culture continues to write, as we advance to where Huxley's world began.To me, a book is worth no more than the thoughts it provokes once I have set it down. By this standard, I am still not done calculating its genius, because I have not yet finished thinking, or talking about themes from the book."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"I think Brave New World speaks for itself well:\\"The world's stable now. People are happy; they get what they want, and they never want what they can't get. They're well off; they're safe; they're never ill; they're not afraid of death; they're blissfully ignorant of passion and old age; they're plagued with no mothers or fathers; they've got no wives, or children, or lovers to feel strongly about; they're so conditioned that they practically can't help behaving as they ought to behave. And if anything should go wrong, there's soma.\\" -Pg 220In a world where there are no more families, scientific curiosity, or independent thought, Brave New World shows us what a society that values social stability and base happiness above all else looks like. Babies are no longer born, they are manufactured in laboratories en masse. People only have casual sex, and love and monogamy are taboos. Whenever a person has any negative feeling, they take a drug called soma that lifts them out of reality into a blissful state isolated from the real world. Individuality is disdained and a punishable offense. Growing up, children are conditioned to accept death as equal to any other bodily function, like sneezing. Love no longer exists.Aldous Huxley shows us the consequences of such a world. The society of Brave New World will be very depressing to anyone who loves freedom and values the individual. With the increasing growth of nanny states in the world today, I believe that Brave New World paints an important picture of the negative relationship between social stability and personal freedom."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Aldous Huxley's classic book, \\"Brave New World,\\" is very interesting and such a profound read. This book should be strongly recommended.In a way, this book is prophetic. While it is considered a science fiction, it remarkably parallel to that of today's world. Projecting suggestions through our sleeps are one of modes of mind control.Today, we are all been subject constantly to 'suggestions' to one form or another, including a controlled media. And, we are ignoring the madness and believing in the lies brought forth by our so-called 'leaders' through the media. They can even seep the 'suggestions' through education, through televisions, through strobe lights, and through any media of sorts. And, we do not have a strong psychological resistance to these suggestions.There is very important quote from this book that speaks of mind control:\\"Till at last the child's mind is these suggestions and the sum of the suggestions is the child's mind. And not the child's mind only. The adult's mind too - all his life long. The mind that judges and desires and decides is made up of these suggestions.

What was merely creepy 25 years ago in high school now has the frightening force of reality behind it--Huxley's prophecy is coming true. Though most everyone is familiar with the basics of the story, there was a wealth of detail that had escaped my first reading. When the pain is taken away, society becomes a giant feedback loop--seeking nothing but sensation.Huxley's Brave New World portrays a society devoid of pain and purpose--he argues that his creation is the inevitable result of science untempered by morality. He hints that the exigency that led to the Brave New World was war and one cannot think of a more likely scenario. This is science-fiction that has utterly transcended its genre because of the clarity and accuracy of its vision that an uncontrolled science would lead to tampering with life itself. Birth control, the abandonment of \\"traditional\\" morality, recreational drugs without side effects, and genetic engineering were all foreseen by this book from 1932.It is interesting to note that genetic tampering is currently rather benign--we select for good looks, intelligence and hope to create a genome free from annoying defects like proclivity to cancer and other diseases. Yet through his character Mustapha Mond, Huxley argues that you can't make a civilization of alphas thereby affording a justification for the purposeful impairment of the majority of the population. Huxley's alphas have to buy into the system because they are smart enough to know otherwise. If they don't, society banishes them to an island--which, in reality, is a prize bestowed only on the true thinkers. The utter triumph of the society is manifested in the fact that there is no escape. Though well-aware of the sacrifices attendant to the world order, Mustapha Mond accepts his role based upon the idea that the highest goal of mankind is freedom from pain, obligation and choices.And, presciently, that is the promise of every politician. The world is losing an appreciation for the value of pain, the satisfaction of labor and the value of choices. Huxley saw it coming in 1932 and the conclusion that the world is heading down that path becomes inescapable with only the slightest reference to contemporary events.P.S. This \\"P.S.\\" edition provides several excellent documents after the text of the novel such as a letter from Huxley to Orwell and a contemporary analysis of the work. The editors chose for maximum effect those documents that highlight the importance of the work in our culture. I am going to seek out more of these editions."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"My son is in High School. This is a required reading book for honors English. He suffers from Dyslexia so he is allowed to listen to the books. Having classics like Brave New World available on CD help him to be able to complete assignments. This CD is read by Michael York. Having the familiar voice of an actor we know makes the listening easier. The story is brought to life."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"I read Brave New World by Aldous Huxley this weekend and was pretty impressed. I was expecting something a lot more dry since this book is a classic mostly due to the fact that it's pretty mainstream but I have to admit that it was an enjoyable book and a pretty fast read (took me about 2 hours). With that said let's get into the review.Brave New World takes place several hundred years in the future where all of mankind's basic needs have been met and now we are all genetically engineered and conditioned to not want more than we can ever get and to follow certain precepts such as never mending old clothes and participating in group activities rather than individual ones. The life of the collective is much more important than the life of the individual and the whole of society is structured around this purpose with certain \\"people\\" being created to perform manual labor or jobs than no person in their right mind would want to do.I feel the book takes place in three stages. The first is kind of the background and build up of the world and society of Brave New World. The second is Lenina and Bernard's trip to the Savage Reservation (a place in the US Southwest where \\"civilization\\" has not taken root) and the third section deals with the Savage's life in the civlized world.The story progresses well and despite the creation of new inventions and a few new words you never fail to understand what is going on. The characters are well developed and you really get a good understanding of this utopian world and how stale it really is. After reading this book I realized that the society fromt he Sly Stallone movie Demolition Man was mostly taken from this book with one of the characters, Sandra Bullock's, even called Lenina Huxley in tribute.For anyone that hasn't read this book I definitely have to say check it out. It's a quick read and a very good one."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Well written and frightening story of government control and human consumption. Amazing parallels to the US today. Softer read than 1984...leaves the same impact."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"This novel is amazingly interesting. It opens in the Central London Hatching and Conditioning Centre. Everything in the novel here out stems from the first chapter. The London Hatching Centre is where thousands of nearly identical human embryos are put to life. The embryos travel in bottles along a conveyor belt through the factory and are conditioned to belong to seperate social classes: Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, or Epsilon. The Alpha embryos are looked upon as the leaders and thinkers of the \\"World State.\\" Going down from Alpha, every person, Beta, Gamma, Delta...etc are either less physically or intellectually impressive. The Epsilons are stuned and stupified by lack of oxgen and some chemical treatments, they are destined to perform labor. Each embryo based on social class is conditioned to where they will be or what they are destined to do.Huxley's world has 10 world controllers, one we get to know very well is mustapha mond. We also have characters such as Bernard Marx who is absolutely strange and not very good looking. His \\"woman\\" is Lenina.In this crazy society, birth only happens through the bottle. Semen and egg are mixed to create babies. Religion is not existant, their \\"religion\\" is something called soma, soma is something used to control negative emotions and social harmony.Towards the end of the novel all of the main characters seem to start becoming upset with their society because of it's unperfectness. As The Savage says, \\"we want the right to be unhappy.\\" He says these things to one of the World Controllers, Mustapha Mond who later sends him away to an island on his lonesome.This book was extremely interesting, i would give it 5 stars but some parts were hard to understand so i give it the 4.5 stars. Thanks for listening to my review and VOTE FOR ME."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"I cannot even beleive how many people gave this book bad reviews based on the fact that it's a really bad vision of a Utopian Future. Even the good reviews were saying things like, \\"wow! i want to live in that society so i can have tons of sex and drugs!\\" Doesn't that very idea of this future society sound a little bit fishy?The one reviewer who wrote that this is a horrible vision of the future and no one should want to live in it, completely got it right but missed the point. Of COURSE no one is supposed to want to live in this society! I had the feeling that reviewer didn't even finish the book.Do you remember the part of the book where they are all waiting around in a room for some church-type cult meeting as they wait upon some random spirit? They all wait silently to hear the sound of the great spirit. The main character doesn't hear it, but once everyone in the room gets excited and claims they hear it, he jumps up and says he hears it as well.THis example, among numerous others in the book, are ones that illistrate what this book is REALLY trying to make a statement about. It's not trying to show what the world WILL be like, and it's definately not showing what the world SHOULD be like. This is a classic story about CONFORMITY and how we as humans will strive to be like the mass because it is considered wrong not to.And to all those that said this book illistrated a messed up and awful sexual society, remember the scene where \\"The Savage\\" was with the girl and he would not have sex with her? The Scene demonstrates a standing up, a moving against the crowd, despite how unaccepted, or even desireable it may be to follow.The Descriptions of the place where the savage came from are great. WHile others thought they were a disgusting display of racism and politically incorrectedness, in TRUTH, they represented the true value of life and things old and forgotten, in this new society where it is considered vulgar and obscene for a baby to be born, coming out from between a womans legs into the world (Everyone in this future is cloned and mass produced in labs).When The Savage comes to this \\"Utopian\\" England, he is the only character at this point that we are supposed to relate to. This is the perfect book for those who feel isolated in a conformist society, as the lead character feels he is the only one who has moral fiber in this entire future world. Everyone else is taking drugs and having sex.There's another aspect of the book in which another lead male character gets jets jelous about a girl he wants to \\"have\\" being with another male. They are taught that \\"desire\\" leads to negative emotions, so he should have what he wants, meanwhile this girl will not have him. So he starts to feel awful. THis just goes to show that no matter what factors you try to rule out of human fiber, it will never lead to a rise on whole, it will always lead to a downfall.Furthermore, this book goes a LOT deeper than what everyone made it out to be, and if you don't think so, read it again and pay more attention. It is OBviously not supposed to be a society we want (when you read those scenes in which the leaders describe erotic play among children, we are SUPPOSED to find it repugnant, not appealing). The bottom line is conformity, not utopia. The title \\"Brave New World\\" itself is almost like a parady or joke of this world. So look agian and think bigger picture.By the way, i thought the writing style was crazy. I love the part where the author just switches around between random characters saying random phrases for a whole chapter- it's very odd and unique. I've never seen another author try to grasp the feel of a book that way."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"While A Brave New World gives readers a brief glance into the complex reality of a technologically conditioned society, Huxley's main criticism centralizes around the notion of the absence of humanity and individuality as a result of \\"COMMUNITY, IDENTITY, and STABILITY.\\" Huxley's novel is not an attack on knowledge or the advancement of science, rather it is a commentary on the effects of applied science and the consequences of tampering with Mother Nature's natural course. Basically, it's a horrifying novel that makes your brain think in ways that experience has taught you to eliminate and neglect. Sci-Fi, Fantasy, Hard-core non-fiction--it is whatever you want to call it and so much more. A definite read."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"It might be easy to spot what aspects of our society Huxley is satirising, in his heavy-handed way, and take THEM seriously; but it's impossible to take Huxley's society seriously. He undercuts his own earnest world-building in order to get a cheap laugh. Worse, he leaves out crucial details which might give us some clue as to what's going on. That we aren't told whether or not Huxley's Brave New People are really happy, is fair enough. That we aren't even told enough to be able to deduce whether or not they are happy is inexcusable: it undercuts any possible moral Huxley may be trying to impart, and believe me, he's certainly trying to impart some moral or other. (He scarcely stops trying long enough to tell a story.) George Orwell was another left-wing British writer inspired by Yvgeny Zamyatin's \\"We\\", and his vision is vastly better - as is \\"We\\" itself."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"It's really scary to think Aldous Huxley wrote about a fictional world in the early-1930s that was considered really far out when this book was first published, but that is quickly becoming reality everyday. He expressed surprise in a later edition of this book at how quickly that fictional world was materializing during his own lifetime. If only he stuck around a while longer (although physically impossible), he would have seen that world fully materialize even quicker than he could have ever imagined.I was really freaked out the more I got into the book. Much emphasis is placed on the \\"Community, Identity, Stability\\" motto (that was mentioned less than a handful of times in the book), as well as the over-dependence on drugs (soma) to make everything all right, but not enough emphasis is placed on the sexual promiscuity that permeated the fictional, futuristic London (hey, I love sex just like the next person, but not with everyone I look at!). Also, not enough attention is paid to the fact that \\"feelies\\" (movies where the audience gets a first-hand experience into the \\"action\\" experienced by the characters), along with the soma, and everything else in this future society were all designed to take peoples' minds off the fact that they were being controlled. Is that not how it is nowadays?Instead of feelies, we have Internet porn, E! (a 24 hour cable channel devoted to celebrity gossip), completely mindless, brain-numbing \\"reality\\" shows, the idiot box in general, and an American philosophy of having to \\"keep up with the Joneses\\" (as the saying goes) - choosing to live a lifetime of debt in order to have the biggest and most current of everything. It leaves little time to worry about the more important things in life such as how your government is wasting your money everyday, the incompetence of your government as a whole, how your votes really don't count (unless you vote for the candidate the machine favors), etc. Then again, anything political has always been considered \\"boring\\" (just like in the \\"Brave New World\\").This is not to say this is everyone, but I find that too many people today regard books with disdain like the people in Huxley's fictional world (especially younger people, who actually proclaim that \\"reading sucks\\") - using the same reasoning Mustapha Mond did as to why books are useless. And let's see a show of hands (or, in this case, posts) as to how many people would rather buy a brand new shirt or pair of pants rather than try to repair that rip or sew a button? (And I have been guilty of that in the past).The thing that shocked me the most was the popular mindset (brainwashing) in the \\"Brave New World\\" that being alone is equal to being a weirdo. I'm seeing more and more of that \\"reasoning\\" in the mass media nowadays. If someone is a \\"loner,\\" something is automatically \\"wrong\\" with them (I went through the same thing during my school days in the 80s and 90s). If someone's shy they're \\"stuck up,\\" being aloof is always cause for alarm, and don't even think about wearing a trench coat!In the \\"Brave New World,\\" being together with people all the time takes your mind off of all potential problems. Any problems that do come up are to be avoided with a healthy dose of soma and, better yet, with a soma vacation. And, in the end, only certain people can perform certain tasks in life.I liked the way Huxley didn't tie things up in the end. It's a shame the \\"Savage\\" was continually tortured by the hip and happening populace of London up until the very end. The Savage could be anyone who doesn't subscribe to the popular mindset, someone who dares goes against the grain and doesn't back down.It can't be stressed enough that Huxley was a prophet. \\"Brave New World,\\" whether people like this or not, *is* the America of 2007. We have the power to reverse that trend, but people (except a few) just don't seem to want to.Along with George Orwell's \\"1984\\" and Ray Bradbury's \\"Fahrenheit 451,\\" this is an excellent trilogy of a blissfully ignorant future that is fast becoming reality. - Donna Di Giacomo"},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"I am a fan of 1984 but I find this scenario that Huxley paints to be more likely in today's world. We are a society that entertains ourselves to death and the idea of controlling society through hedonistic desires is frightening because it would work so well. As long as the individual is getting what he or she wants, there is no reason to fight for these vague ideas of liberty. That's what I found so compelling about the book. Sure, there is a drug that is used to keep people happy and not thinking deeply, but the main controlling agent is that everyone is being distracted through games, through sex, through social events, and no one ever stops to think, they are purposefully prevented from thinking. It is quite a revealing book and makes me reevaluate the entertainments I indulge in."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"This is Huxley's best book in my opinion. The novel is simply a masterpiece of art. Huxley is able to describe our modern society and also make predictions about where we could go if things keep heading in the direction they are going, but does so in a subtle yet captivating way. The amazing part is that Brave New World was written in 1932, but most aspects of it still applies to today's world, nearly a century later.The plot of this book is wildly interesting and keeps you entertain, while also leaving you thinking about today's world and how things could be different. Brave New World is a tale about a Utopian society in the future where babies are no longer born to parents but are instead created and raised in hatcheries where they are divided into different classes. The society is an unemotional, but always happy society due to the drug they take daily, soma.The plot dances around several different worlds where the societies are different ever so slightly and leaves the characters asking if they should go live in one of the different, more natural worlds, or stay in the Utopian society which is London in the 2500's.I highly recommend this book to anyone who is looking for an entertaining yet mentally stimulating book. Brave New World is one of the all time classics and is a must read for anyone looking to educated themselves."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"BRAVE NEW WORLD is Aldous Huxley's rather grim (though nowhere near as grim as Orwell's) picture of a far-off future, one where babies are decanted from a bottle and conditioned through sleep education and Pavlovian techniques to be completely satisfied with their class and occupation; where the rulers rule by granting every wish; and where every battle in the sexual revolution has been fought and won. But even in this idyllic world, there are occasional malcontents, and Bernard Marx is one. Either through an accident in the test tube, or some other twist of fate, he does not quite fit in with his Alpha plus brothers and sisters, and like so many others in a like frame of mind, his inferiority complex pushes him to grab for leverage in a society that treats him like an outcast.It's doubtful that a synopsis for BRAVE NEW WORLD is really necessary after all this time; besides, it isn't the particulars that are important so much as the ideas. Huxley's contribution to the dystopian pantheon isn't crammed full of dire warnings about secret police and an iron-fisted ruler governing by fear - on the contrary, the citizens of this world are herded and corralled with the cattle-prod of happiness. Drugs, sex, and hypnotic conditioning create a society that is completely satisfied with itself.I first read BRAVE NEW WORLD as a teen-ager, and I seem to remember liking it quite a bit, but at that time, I was probably pretty keen on the idea of a free love society such as the one Huxley built. Re-reading all these years later, I was surprised at how little of that admiration remained. My first thought was that while the novel may have been ground-breaking when it was first published, it hasn't aged well (or, perhaps, I haven't aged well. One or the other, I suppose.) But in the Harper Perennial Classic edition that I have, there is an uncredited afterward that describes the initial reaction from critics that BRAVE NEW WORLD provoked. It says that 'the majority of reviewers dismissed (it) as weak in plot and characterization, shallow, mechanical in structure, and monotonous in tone. In dismissing the book, it wasn't that many critics failed to understand what point Huxley was making, but rather that they did not find his point relevent, insightful, alarming, or particularly original.' That about sums up how I felt about it, all these years later."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Brave New World is a unique satire on contemporary society. It uses a futuristic utopia to critique modern (1932) issues of science, religion, and society in general.The problem with the novel is style. It's pedantic. There are a few gems in Brave New World. For example, in the beginning when Huxley goes between narratives 2-3 times per page. However, for the most part, Huxley bluntly reiterates the same ideas. The Savage's conversations on the virtue of Shakespearean morality is especially obtuse.Orwell's \\"1984\\" is a masterpiece. In comparison, \\"Brave New World\\" felt like a sophomoric attempt."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"This is another one of those \\"dystopian\\" novels that seemed popular in the first half of the 20th century. It fits in perfectly with novels like \\"1984\\" and \\"Fahrenheit 451\\". Of those three novels, I believe this came first. The funny thing about this book is that the future doesn't seem completely terrible, unlike the latter two novels, although I might compare the entire population of the earth (in \\"Brave New World\\") to the proletariats (in \\"1984\\").See, in this novel nobody seems to be unhappy at all. They are literally born to do the jobs they will perform for their entire adult lives, and love those jobs. Each person is born into a certain \\"caste\\" and they are happy to be in that caste, and envy no one in any other castes. The lowest of the low are referred to as epsilon - minus, semi-morons. This is interesting, as epsilon is a common mathematical number that defines how much error a function may allow. In this book, the epsilons (as a general class), represent the lowest possible mental and social state of humanity.Of course, their are more intelligent people as well. The castes are, from highest to lowest: Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, Epsilon. That's quite a bit like a typical grading system of A, B, C, D, F. As you can imagine, the Alphas are the smartest, and the list goes down from there. But the thing is, each caste member is truly satisfied by their caste membership. The novel makes a pretty logical reason why the caste members are happy with their lot in life.Sex is treated in a completely pragmatic fashion, and emotions are almost completely subdued.With the help of a super narcotic, the populace is able to enjoy life and extravagant recreation - devoid of all sadness and driven by a natural tendency to \\"consume\\". Everything is in place to allow a person to go through life almost without any spikes in emotion. Even death is a conditioned response.The missing element in this picture is humanity. Essentially, those in control have tried their best to keep any highs and lows within a certain amount of error (epsilon). The central question is the running of civilization vs. the individual spirit. It seems that, to keep a civilization going, we need to make certain sacrifices individually - and it's easy to make those sacrifices when we don't realize that we are making those sacrifices.However, there are about 5 major characters, and I think each one represents a different amount of humanity - or at least different levels of humanity. In this version of the future, it's possible to step outside the bounds of what is acceptable, but you are not doomed if you do so. Instead, you are offered a quite reasonable accommodation.Aldous Huxley offers extremely complex characters, but each is allowed to act within a certain epsilon of ranges - he wrote in very delicate shades of meaning. In fact, I'm pretty certain that I've never read an author who has presented me with more \\"gray areas\\" within the thinking of each character. Mr. Huxley is a very deep and complicated author who was ahead of his time. Those novels \\"1984\\" and \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" presented dystopias that were easily regarded as undesirable, whereas \\"Brave New World\\" presents a future that is not so obviously flawed. In fact, my wife asserts that this future was actually desirable - but she's a bleeding heart socialist, so that doesn't surprise me. \\"Brave New World\\" does, in my mind, present a more deviously dystopian future than the other two novels. I believe each of the major characters is meant to ask, in total, all of the questions we, the readers, might have.In the end, this novel was gripping and a serious page turner. Every night, it inspired a great debate between my wife and me, and its overall game plan is one of subtlety instead of shock.I'll bet that, after you read the novel, you will be able to spot this particular plot in many movies - particularly \\"The Matrix\\"."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"We are treated to a glimpse of a possible future world where friendship can still exist. This is a story of a hand full of individuals in a world that emphasizes \\"Community, Identity, Stability\\" that find each other and discus subjects that most of the people of that time cold not understand.

At what point do we put our desire to always be happy above our love for parents, children, wives, and husbands? Also, can a whole world lose their individuality? With a world and our nation particularly based on diversity of race, class, politics to such an extent, how can we believe that sometime in the future we will all be the same? It just seems very far fetched to me at this point. If I forget about those problems with the book then I did learn some good lessons about free will. It helped me to see that I do need to create my own opinions on subjects and not to let the media, religion, and political parties condition me into certain views. Sometimes I did think that it would be great to have a little soma, but our troubles in life are what make us who we are. If you take that away then you have not lived, not experienced, and not loved."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"When \\"Brave New World\\" was published in 1932, the West had just experienced its first taste of mass production (the assembly line), mass consumption (fueled by rampant use of credit), the first historical wave of female emancipation, the post-Victorian disintegration of some sexual taboos (The Roaring Twenties), promising new scientific research, the Bolshevik Revolution and World War I (\\"The War to End All Wars\\"). Deftly extrapolating from these and other economic and social developments, Aldous Huxley conjured a literary masterpiece that foretold: the genetic experimentation of the Nazis, the mapping of the human genome, artificial insemination, the God Is Dead Movement, 24/7 mass media that highlights celebrity and pop culture, creation of the European Union, the arrival of the global economy and its need for increased worker productivity, pure recreational sex (a recent USA poll of men and women listing the top ten reasons for engaging in it makes no mention of procreation), and - most ominously - mass acceptance of legal pharmaceuticals by millions of the Earth's inhabitants as an emotional crutch of first resort.\\"Brave New World\\", however, is much more than a parlor trick of successful prognostication; it is a cleverly constructed warning about the psychological softness that can envelop humankind with the onward march of \\"progress\\". It asks \\"What is Progress?\\" - a question that only recently, and happily, has come to the fore as a serious topic of discussion and has produced some degree of overlap in scientific and religious world views.Huxley's \\"Savage\\", plucked from an eco-tourist-like setting in the southwestern U.S. and transported to a civilization he has heard so much about, sets up a dynamic tension between a party of one who clings to the notion of Original Sin and literally retreats to a garden to atone for it, and a future Everyman (and woman) for whom artificial reality has been transformed into high art. Huxley adroitly explores how Soviet-style centralized planning, aided and abetted by mass hypnosis, technology and constant creature comforts, makes all but the most morally sturdy incapable of bucking the system - most especially the aptly-named Lenina, who deep down feels a twinge of real love but simply cannot de-program herself and act upon the one genuine morsel of humanity somehow ignited within her.Perhaps what is most striking of all about \\"Brave New World\\" is its constantly alternating humor and pathos. Huxley appears to have tapped the very best of European farce and the English Music Hall tradition for comic relief; some of his scenes approach blackout sketches. But he also employs some genuinely dark episodes to tell us that all this is no laughing matter. However, note: this dichotomy in tone takes some of the sting out of the author's message, resulting in a work that, although entirely satisfying, never reaches the nonstop intensity of \\"1984\\".Says Huxley: Those of us not living in A.F.

Although it was written decades ago, Brave New World is still relevant to today's society. A world where human beings are 'decanted' and then go on to live plasure-driven, drug-induced lives is not totally unfathomable. Particularly creepy ideas were the sleep-teaching and mass-conditioning at the Hatchery. The Bokanovsky groups (identical twins numbering in the dozens that man entire factories) were also unsettling. Come to think of it, almost everything Huxley invents in this book is creepy.My favorite part was the Alpha-Beta-Gamma-Delta-Epsilon social hiearchy. The continuous use of the word 'beastly' added a touch of humor. I did feel sorry for Bernard at times... in the beginning, that is."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"It seems that many people like to compare this with Orwell's 1984. True, they are both looks into the future and see problems that lie ahead, but I think the Huxley is more on the mark considering the way things are progressing.The basic point of the book is to examine the loss of individuality and personal expression in order to attain utopia. Huxley seems to want such a utopia, but clearly recognized that it would require the loss of personality.This book seems applicable still today. Some brief examples of how we are marching slowly towards Huxley's BNW: We in the information age have become more ignorant than ever. Critical thought is slipping away from us. The pharmaceutical industry is booming and the masses want the drugs to do even more, whether it be to calm a 6 year old boy so he'll sit in class or it be to make someone feel better. We accept drug use more and more with few, if any, questions. Soma might seem like a leap from where we are today, but we should heed the warning signs Huxley presents. And the abundant sex in the book isn't really that different from what Hollywood advertises every day. We are closer to a full free sex perspective like in Huxley's book than most people are willing to admit. In many ways, our society is very individualistic, but as we become more divided idealistically and politically, we can expect to see more of Huxley's utopian uniformity at the expense of individual thought and opinion.Overall, it is a good read. In some places, it may be slow in regards to action, but it is constantly thought evoking. Character development is good. You really associate with certain characters and share in their struggles.Let this book challenge your presumptions about our society. It will be a valuable exercise. Then go forth in life and every time someone disagrees with your perspective, smile and enjoy the non-utopia you've been so blessed to live within."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Brave New World is perhaps the most portentous novel ever written in predicting the future design of society. Written in 1932, this science fiction satire has become more realistic than many would hope to experience. Saturated with pharmaceutical commercials promising mind-numbing nirvana, automobile ads full of picturesque non-existing vistas, and porn laden pop-ups offering short lived euphoria, today's commercially explicite society has come to parallel much of what Huxley described in this novel.Comprised of a society of the Alpha's, Beta's, Gamma's, and Epsilon's, with the former achieving human perfection in beauty, emotional control, and happiness through bio-technically enhanced means, the Brave New World is increasingly visible with the massive divide between the haves and the have nots, between those seeking immediate, consistent, short-term gratification and those experiencing long-term castigation and alienation. With our private islands, botox treatments, and continuous obsession with celebrity and luxury, the Alpha's of today are promulgating the destructive divide that is resulting between the hegomonic power-brokers of today and those reviling against its rampant consumerism. This novel must be explored multiple times as its deep-seated fundamental message continues to be more prescient with each passing moment."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Your Wildest Fantasy or a Dystopic Nightmare?An unlimited supply of state-sanctioned hallucinogenic drugs with no ill effects. Free sex, free contraceptives, and no relationships or commitments to worry about. No illnesses or unsightly aging. Unlimited access to recreation and games. A government committed to maintaining everyone's happiness. And this is a bad thing?Actually, it is. For this is the Brave New World, set in A.F. 632 (approx 2544). While on its surface it may seem like some wild fantasy, the harsh reality of life in the World State is one where individualism has been extinguished long ago, along with religion, art, poetry, and philosophy. In its place is a materialistic, strictly controlled world where the New State (the totalitarian government) is in total control. Except for a few outposts of Savage settlements (such as the Native Americans), the new world is completely homogenized into one entity, whose citizens are divided into 5 distinct castes.The most disturbing aspect of this society is the idea of \\"playing God.\\" Humans are merely produced in an assembly line, set to mimic the uterine conditions of a fetus. Indeed, the assembly workers partake of various tasks, designed to condition the fetuses for their pre-destined castes. The lower castes are starved of oxygen and nutrition to make them inferior, while the Bokanovsky and Podsnap processes enable scores of human clones to be produced in rapid succession. Then, once they are decanted (born), they are \\"conditioned\\" (brainwashed) as children into accepting their status with happy abandonment.Another disturbing element is the severing of all ties to the family and motherhood. The words \\"mother\\" and \\"viviparous\\" are considered obscenities of the worst degree. The \\"Savages,\\" who still hold more traditional ideals of marriage and family are objects of ridicule and contempt.The first part of the novel deals with the technology involved in this new world, while the second part details the exploits of John, a boy born of a World State mother while she is trapped in an Indian reservation. The moral conflict that John shows and the utter bewilderment of the World State denizens is striking. The idea that John's ideas of piety and pureness, ideas he ascertained from Shakespeare's works, are foreign and queer to the inhabitants of this new world. In fact, John is treated as a human oddity, yet he is easily the most human of all their inhabitants.This book is a satire, so it lacks of the riveting suspense and tension of \\"1984.\\" In fact, from a worldly and pragmatic view, the World State isn't that terrible. Even when dissenters are found who threaten the stability of the World State, they are merely exiled to a remote island, a far cry from the fate that befalls dissenters in \\"1984.\\"However, Brave New World still merits a read. It is entertaining and does show how de-humanizing the pursuit of worldly pleasures can be. The World State members are happy, but they are shallow shells of human beings who cannot think for themselves, love each other, or believe in a higher being."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"I'm going to skip the part about how this book is prophetic and how society today is becoming like it was in Brave New World. You can read all that fun stuff in the various reviews around this one.In the end, what amazed me about this book was not how prophetic it was (though it was spectacular), but how the book affected me. A great book like this one changes the way you think about everything. By introducing various key concepts, Huxley makes the book incredibly shaking.An example of this would be the Cyprus Experiment. When asked why he doesn't make everyone an Alpha (intelligent, able human being), the controller (symbolizing God in many ways) tells of an experiment in Cyprus some time before. They evacuated the entire island and filled it with Alphas only. They gave some Beta, Gamma, Delta, and Epsilon work. The result - mass chaos, zero productivity, war, deaths, and eventually a second evacuation. Out of this specific example, I took in several important concepts:a) Groups cannot work if all members are extremely intelligentb) Extremely intelligent individuals cannot live with lower level workThe Cyprus Experiment was explained in two pages - imagine what an entire book of this kind of intellectual stimulation creates... the masterpiece \\"Brave New World\\"."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"To start out, I must say that this is perhaps the strangest book I have read in quite some time. That said, it was also a very good book, and well worth the read. I won't say much about, seeing as many people before me already have said more than enough. Perhaps the scariest part of the book was when I realized that we are not so far off now from what is happening in the book. No, we don't play tapes over and over while children sleep to condition them, but we do condition them nonetheless through the portrayel of society that the media presents to them. It makes me wonder, if the media constantly repeated some theme (for example say, sex with multiple partners is the norm), would society be conditioned to believe that? Oh wait..."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Irate due to his lofty disapproval of society in the 1930s, Aldous Huxley crafted the caricature of Brave New World as a message. Spotting trends that didn't fully manifest until long after Brave New World's publication, Huxley, outspoken and brazen in his beliefs, seemingly foretold various aspects of current society. With a vivid eye for detail, he chose everything, even the title \\"Brave New World,\\" as a mockery of the path he assumed the world would take, for Miranda from Shakespeare's Tempest speaks of a beautiful future.From a version of London far in the future- roughly 2540AD- where sanctity, individuality, and choice no longer exist and everyone knows nothing but happiness, Brave New World follows seeds of discontent in the forms of characters vastly different from one another. Between Lenina, Bernard, Mustapha, Helmholtz (all thought to be the epitome of civilized) and John (a Savage), Huxley causes send ripples through his dystopia as these men and woman start to think for themselves. None of them question life so much as John \\"Savage,\\" who grew up outside London and carries around a book of Shakespeare because it gives him the words he needs for survival.Imagine the words \\"mother\\" and \\"father\\" as dirty words, never spoken by someone civilized. No one is ever alone, but no one is permitted to make a single decision- not even that of their position in society- and everything you want simply appears. But what about the few that would rather moments of unhappiness over false reality? John left his home for London, hoping to find a \\"Brave New World\\" but instead faced exploitation because of his differences. This perfected world sickens him, driving him to action.For no one ever feeling extremes of emotion, Bernard and John clash together, each wanting to force their ideals on the other. Should the Savage not enjoy the very best technology, including a drug that allows the user to feel nothing but ecstatic bliss no matter what? Should the civilized man not know what religion is? Each becomes more and more desperate, because perfection always has its flaws, right down to test tubes manufacturing cookie-cutter humans. When they both finally snap, harsh truths, spoken by Mustapha, send them to a point of no return.A full travesty of the society Huxley saw coming, Brave New World challenges the mind to accept a heinous civilization not too unlike our own. Written with many scientific explanations meant to enhance story, this classic is not for someone in the mood for a light read. Overall, however, Brave New World is impossible to put down or stop thinking about due to the sheer possibility of its society coming about and how accurately Huxley envisioned our modern life. Aiming to shock, Brave New World is a masterful work of art that deserves its title of classic."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Aldous Huxley (1894-1963) was the scion of a family of brilliant scientists, doctors and intellectuals. His 1932 utopian novelBrave New World\\" is his most famous achievement in a prolific career as author, philosopher and visionary. Huxley would nod with a knowing wink if he would return to life toda and see how many of his projection of future society have already come true.The title of the work is taken from the character Miranda's line in Shakespeare's play \\"The Tempest.\\" Miranda says, \\"O brave new world that has such people in it\\"The Story: The time is set in the future in London. Instead of God the populace worships Henry Ford. The novel opens at theCentral London Hatchery Center in the year 632 After Ford. From fertilized embryos person are hatched to serve a set role in society from the intellectually elite Alphas to the drone like Epsilons. Piped music plays while children seep to program them. Everyone is to be happy and kept youthful. There are no families. Sex is only to provide enjoyment. The society has produced people who are bland souless cogs of the community. Individualism is seen as a crime against the state.Into this utopia we meet:Bernard Marx-A misfit who is banished to Iceland; Lenina Crowe-A worker in the London Hatchery Center who is basically mindless while courting men attracted by her \\"pneumatic\\" figure. Mustapha Mond is a suave and worldy man who is one of the World Controllers. He is a cynical former physicist. Linda and her son John (the Savage) live on the Indian reservation in New Mexico visited by Bernard Marx and Lenina Crowe (the names are an obvious bow to Marx and Lenin). She will die in a sterile setting back in London. Her son John reads Shakespeare and commits suicide rather than live in the utopian world of modern London.Huxley rejects the utopian world of sterility represented in modern London and also the primitivism on display on the New Mexican Indian Reservation.This book will get you thinking about our own lives in the 21st world of cyberspace and depersonalization. Huxley was a genius!"},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"I'd read this book in High School, and couldn't make sense of it. Several years later, with experience and critical thinking skils honed, I was able to actually understand this book. Yes, it's written with the quaint old English the authors of the period used. Once you compensate for that, it becomes a very good read. The comparison of what was going on in the book to events occurring today is very unnerving. Meant as a satire of politics in the early part of the 20th century, it doesn't seem a satire so much as it does a current documentary of today's society."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"It is quite scary to live in a society that is becoming more and more like the dystopia described in this novel. Authors like Huxley are like 20th century Nostradamuses, predicting the future with such great precision, it's almost unreal. It would be an exaggeration to say that the society in Brave New World is identical to ours, but it is unfortunately not too far off. We, too, are slowly losing our individuality. Just look at corporate America; how many people can honestly say \\"I made this and the credit is all mine\\"?There is nothing extra in this novel. The soma that everyone takes to escape on their vacation is analogous to our drugs of choice, whether it be cocaine or gambling. The World State is an excellent example of a world-wide power almost akin to the imperialistic United States. It matters little whether this novel was a forecast or fiction because it ultimately serves the same purpose. Brave New World warns us about what is to come if we don't mend our ways soon. At the same time, it is nice to see that people still read literature like this and become aware of the imminent dangers."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"This novel is in the class of Dystopia, but it is written from an objectively optimistic viewpoint. It is up to the reader to decipher the parts which Huxley silently deems as being part of the failed society of the future. There is a futuristic view of air travel, human conditioning, human caste system by categorization, and blind addiction to euphoric drugs.There is a lot of third person narrative, without much character development. In fact there is much left to the imagination about the \\"free\\" alpha class citizens of 2540 AD. There is much lauding in the book of Henry Ford as the inventor of the model T as well as an figure of importance in a new era. Most citizens are addicted to \\"soma\\" and parts of the \\"uncivilized\\" world population are thought of as \\"Savages.\\"Huxley is prophetic in some ways in a book that was written in 1931. His views on \\"what might happen\\" are still pertinent today as we struggle with societal class issues and development of the human race. I place this book in the A class of futuristic realistic fiction, but it falls short in some of ways that modern prose has become more engaging to the reader. It seems there is some senseless dialogue and a feeling the the citizens of the future are less aware than we in the present are. Is this due to digression of society? A question asked and answered in this novel. Well Done Huxley!"},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"This review isn't a book review (though I thoroughly enjoyed the book), but rather a comment about the Kindle's formatting:The formatting leaves a little to be desired: not always clear breaks, some typos, and a few random euro-language letter swaps for English letters; but overall very readable.

Here is a list of things he manages to predict will come true in the brave new world of ours:- Bell Bottoms! (this is true..he predicted bell bottom pants)- LSD. He calls it Soma.- Cloning- Anti-depressant drugs- Helicopter Taxis (well, we dont have these yet - although there is a helicopter taxi from Wall Street to JFK airport)- Contraception- Test Tube babies- Sexual Revolution- Unlimited consumption- Planned obsolesence- Instant gratification- Atheistic societies (maybe this was already there in Leninist Russia - can't say)- Social Engineering (think Great Society or the Great Leap Forward)- Botox and cosmetic surgery- Vaccination (this I dont know if it already existed then)- Super bugs- Brain washingThese are some things I just happen to remember off the top of my head. There are tons more like that.I found that while the style of the book is fiction, the heart of the book is non-fiction. I was a bit scared that this book might end up like an Ayn Rand dissertation of objectivism. My chief complaint with Ayn Rand is that she created cardboard characters that mouth her philosophy. Aldous Huxley thankfully escapes that fate (but barely!)His characters are still emotionally shallow and the interactions superficial. But there is just enough juice in the plot (although riddled with coincidences) that propels you through his vision.True to form, several years later he wrote a sequel called 'Brave New World Revisited', where he dispenses with the fiction and just wrote it as a series of essays.Some themes from the book:I. We look for mitigating strategies for every problem we face. Painmedication for pain. Anti-depressant medication for depression. Video games or TV for boredom. Botox for skin sag. And on and on and on.This feels like we want to escape life rather than live it. I am obviously not saying don't take Tylenol. But I suppose I am saying that the sum total of all our consumption is tending towards an escape from living life.II. Our best efforts to 'control' nature is futile for two reasons. One nature will overwhelm us. And two, we are not separate from nature - we ARE nature.III. We are creatures of conditioning. We should set aside hours in a day and days in a month to carefully consider our in-built assumptions about the world, about our society and fellow living beings and ourselves to figure out whether we are operating on platitudes or operating on what we arrive at for ourselves as the truth. i.e. leading the examined lifeIV. When cultures clash, it is of serious consequence. (It is happening today as we can see between religions and between societies). The clash is because of a radically different set of assumptions within each culture that views its own values as good and the other culture's values as not just different, but antithetical and inimcal.Overall, this is one of the most satifisfying books I have been through in a long time. Protienaceous and not bubble-gum! Having said that the fiction layer was mediocre at best, and the non-fiction layer was a tour de force."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"We are treated to a glimpse of a possible future world where friendship can still exist. This is a story of a hand full of individuals in a world that emphasizes \\"Community, Identity, Stability\\" that find each other and discus subjects that most of the people of that time cold not understand. However we do. Naturally the author Aldous Huxley builds his own scenarios and draws his own conclusions through the characters speeches and description of experimental history.Bernard Marx who is about to lose his job because he is different (vary different) form those around him, decides to take a vacation to visit the Zuni's. There he meets a misplaced person named John. Together with the help of Bernard's friend Henry they intend to change the world. So they find out the world is incapable of changing.We get an Ayn Rand type speech from Mustapha Mond one of the world controllers' that helps you realize that in this brave new world the three friends are the anomaly. How can this enigma be solved?Do not forget to watch the 1998 movie version with Leonard Nimoy as Mustapha Mond.Brave New World Starring: Peter Gallagher, Leonard Nimoy"},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"This remarkable book was written around 1931. As far as I know it is the earliest of the modern dystopia novels (\\"1984\\", \\"Fahrenheit 451\\"). Read carefully . . . .It is a story, centered in London, of a world where life is lived out in controlled, contented bliss. Genetic engineering contributes to a smoothly functioning caste system. Sexual promiscuity is the norm, even instilled in children. Birth control is the norm. Behavior altering drug use is the norm. Physical attractiveness is at a premium and youth is artificially preserved. Materialistic consumption is prized. Entertainment occupies non-work hours but does NOT include reading. Independent thinking is unacceptable. \\"God\\" has been replaced by \\"Ford\\", literally (science and industry!, not superstition).A couple of characters are introduced who behave counter to the culture. They are eventually banished. We get a glimpse into the true thoughts of the World Controller, who keeps a safe containing BOOKS. A central character (The Savage) is introduced, having been imported from the undeveloped American Southwest. Although a primitive, he was self-educated through study of an ancient volume of Shakespeare. He is rather pan-theistc, worshipping an assortment of gods that he has became aware of, including the Judeo-Christian God. (The Savage seems to be doing the best he can with the information he has). His love relationship with a beautiful but totally indoctrinated London girl destroys him (he is chaste - she is a cookie cutter product of the society and he is appalled by her ready sexual availability).In the end, The Savage cannot function in this society and takes his own life. The reader may assume that the society then absorbs the entertainment available from this event and moves on blissfully.So . . . who wins, who is happy, who is right? My conclusion: If there is no God, the pleasure seeking dystopians were in fact right on track. The Savage was a superstitious primitive who squandered his life and a multitude of opportunities for sensual and material fun and happiness.Conversely, if a Creator Deity does exist (whom The Savage clearly sought), then it would appear that The Savage, in death, moved on to a superior state, and indeed had lived out his whole life in a superior fashion of obedience. The dystopians, on the other hand, live out their reward in the present physical life, squandering eternity.The Bible (referenced in the novel, a copy hidden in the Controller's safe) asserts that The Creator is self-evident through his creation, and all who reject him are without excuse. Correspondingly, there are multiple allusions in the novel to fascination with nature, such as the night sky. Such interest is suppressed by the dystopian society of course. I think that is the endpoint in Huxley's, Brave New World -- Living for this world (serving self), or living for the greater, unseen one (trusting God). A great matter of faith, and the essence of all decision making."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"I use this audio cd set to help my 12th grade English class study the novel Brave New World. Michael York does a fantastic job reading the novel by providing a vast array of character voices. It is the new layout design of the CD that has changed which makes use in the classroom difficult. The CDs are no longer labeled to indicate which chapters are covered per cd. This would make it difficult for anyone who wants to switch between the audio and the book itself."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Would a future totalitarian society be all that bad if every single person - from the day they were born - was truly happy with their lot in life? That is the question Brave New World asks, and Aldous Huxley leaves it up to the reader to decide the answer.I've re-read this book several times and each time I'm glad I did. That is because it is an enjoyable story, first and foremost. The characters have sufficient depth, the locales are peculiar and attention-grabbing, and the underlying message is enough to make you stop and think.Brave New World revolves around three main characters. First, there's Bernard Marx, an elite \\"Alpha Plus\\" who is uncertain about how he fits into society. Then, there is Mustapha Mond, the World Controller for Western Europe, a man who reads The Holy Bible and Shakespeare, despite his society's ban on these \\"pornographic books\\". Finally, we have John (named John Savage when he visits Bernard's world), the son of two World State citizens raised in the remote hostility of a Savage Reservation. The interactions and thoughts of these three characters forms the skeleton of the book, and it is through their eyes that we view the World State of the future. The reader learns about how babies are \\"decanted\\" in the future, how they are bred and conditioned for their role in society, how entertainment plays a role in keeping them happy, and how unhappiness can be quickly whisked away by a gramme of Soma, a powerful drug that has no debilitating side-effects. Of course, it would be easy for the author to jab his finger at you from the pages and scream \\"SEE?!? SEE?!?! See what a society without freedom looks like? Isn't it horrible?\\", but he doesn't. In fact, the world of Year of Our Ford 632 doesn't seem so bad at all when you consider disease, war, and unhappiness have all been snuffed out of existence.But at what cost?Midway through the book, we meet John. Biologically, a son of the World State, but philosophically a student of the old religions and old literature of the old world. But don't misunderstand. John is not necessarily the book's \\"everyman\\". Many of his emotions and actions (like self-flagellation) are still foreign to a modern reader. Bernard - who has at this point accepted that he is \\"different\\" compared to his fellow World State-ers - brings John to his home to show him off to his peers. Naturally, many aspects of the World State are appalling to John, and this conflict continues all the way to the book's conclusion.Something I found remarkable is that the author, Huxley, gives us plenty of chances to sympathize with many of the various characters. Bernard Marx is not the \\"good guy\\" nor the \\"bad guy\\". In another story, the World Controller Mond might have been the evil villain trying to destroy any freedom, and John Savage might have been the passionate hero who wins the pretty girl and ultimately brings that freedom to society. But none of this occurs. The characters in Brave New World are just people, thrust into a world of perfect happiness and perfect harmony, and they each react in their own way. Sure, it's cute to see how the author envisioned the future, and perhaps a bit scary to see some of his \\"predictions\\" coming true, but that isn't what makes this book great. What makes it great is that it allows the reader to come to his/her own conclusions. To you, perhaps the World State seems terrifying, or maybe it seems like a nice place to live. To you, perhaps John Savage is the hero, or perhaps the logic and compassion in Mustapha Mond's final words and final actions resonate with you more. Maybe you can relate best to Bernard Marx's flawed personality. I suppose the choice is really yours, because Huxley doesn't make that choice for you.A lot of people say that the story is about entertainment media taking over our society, or about drugs, or about a controlling government, or about morality. I don't think Huxley intended the book to be exclusively about any one of those things, although of course the book makes a statement about them all. As stated above, Brave New World lets you draw your own conclusions about the World State instead of trying to grab you by the collar while screaming \\"SEE?!? SEE?!? See how horrible a world full of drugs and genetic manipulation would be?\\"Now, I rate this book a full 5 stars, but here is the \\"but...\\" of the review. For the majority of the book, we are treated to a fascinating romp through future science, future sociology, and future beliefs. However, toward the end of the book, John and Mustapha Mond engage in a very lengthy conversation about society and morals and God. To me, I really enjoyed this part. It was a great answer to my lingering question of \\"Why did society become this way?\\". To others, it might come off as a preachy, show-offy exposition from Huxley's own heart. Mustapha makes a point about human psychology, and John counters with Shakespeare. Mustapah points to the World State's \\"happiness\\", and John counters with God. Mustapha talks about bliss, and John talks about struggling for joy. I enjoyed it, but you might not, especially since it breaks away from the overall pace and feel of the rest of the book.Nevertheless, this book is well worth reading. It can be finished by a diligent reader in a weekend, and it contains a lot of thought-provoking ideas that will stick with you long after the final page."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Outstanding!

Incredibly detailed. Shows you what the future looks like, what it feels like, what it smells like, desires, technology, buildings, etc. Everything you want in an immersive novel.2. Hauntingly accurate. So many aspects of this future society ring true to an accurate extrapolation of our current lives.

When I come across a word I've never heard of, I smile and tell myself the author was trying to prove how smart he was. But don't be put off, it is an interesting read."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"This is a book about end of history and how to deal with it. End of history, what a nonsensical oxymoron, you might think. Well, let me explain.But before I do that, let me dissect our lives first. To me, all my action can be categorized as the following:1. Necessary actions for the physical existence: food, water, breath, sex etc. basically the lowest rung on Maslow's pyramid.2. Work: Most of us work in an economy, where we provide labour, be it intellectual, emotional, or physical in exchange for labour of others from that or other economies.3. Social Interaction: Most of us belong to some form of community: family, religion, hobbies, professional clubs etc.. Those are the glues, or invisible thread if you will that links us.4. Personal Pursuit: fetish, leisure, entertainment, intellectual curiosity, scientific inquiry etc.Brave new world tries to construct society where all 4 categories of actions merge seamlessly into an efficient system, where waste is minimized, if any at all. Scientific advancement has long rendered the description in the book an obsolete one.Should Mr. Aldous Huxley be a writer of 2012, what would be the premises of the book? It would be a world much more advanced than the one he envisioned in 1931. Robots will undoubtedly enter the scene and abolish the need for a caste and eventually work. No more quid pro quo. Everything you need will be readily available, awaits to be consumed. Bioengineering makes possible to make human out of any human cell, so long as they contain the necessary gene code. All the decanting can be done gracefully by neuro-engineering. In short: a society so ingeniously and exquisitely structured that will left all aliens in awe. Much like how we felt when bee societies are studies.In that world, the only actions needed from a human being are either necessary action for physical existence or social interaction. Personal Pursuit is prohibited as it will bring down the whole system. In addition, it should be a system with nothing left to be done, hence no more to be pursued.That's what I mean by end of history: the only things left for you to do are from category 1 or 3. The natural question arise from the end of history society is how do human species associate existence and self consciousness.Right, self consciousness, the ultimate question. Where does it come from? Does it require trial and error? Is chaos an inseparable part of full consciousness? I think Mr. Aldous Huxley offered his opinion: yes, chaos and possibly suffering are intrinsic elements of full consciousness.If you believe full consciousness is the only thing that separates us and animal, then, bad news: there's no end of history for you. By Mr. Huxley's definition, a society will need to be chaotic to be called human society. There will always be struggle, and in which we find conciousness."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"I still haven't finished the book as it's written very dry, but the content is so interesting and valid for this time in progression of our societies. Could this Brave New World be what we have to look forward to?"},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Brave New World is one of the most important dystopian novels of all time. It was written by British author Aldous Huxley in 1932. This book describes an awful future society controlled by a totalitarian one-world government.The novel is set in the far future in a society which is divided into five distinct castes - Alphas, Betas, Gammas, Deltas, and Epsilons. Alphas are at the top of society; Epsilons are at the bottom. The entire world is under control of a one-world government, similar to the United Nations today, called the World State. In this society, people are not born, but grown in bottles in a factory. Nobody has, or is allowed to have, a family. Everyone's lives are already set in stone from the very beginning. Everyone is constantly brainwashed to be content with their position on the hierarchy, and if they are not, they are given by the government for free a drug called soma, which is a hallucinogen. In addition, promiscuity is encouraged and practiced by all members of this society. With everyone given unlimited access to instant gratification, nobody wants to or even thinks about rebelling.In his novel, Huxley warns about the dangers of technology and population control. The world population in the story is kept steady at about two billion, with the government in complete control of reproduction. Amazingly for the time it was written, the book also warns of the dangers of genetic engineering, which is the way the castes are determined. Television and drugs, which are the primary ways the World State keeps control, are also warned about in the book. Huxley most likely wrote the story as a warning, not as entertainment.I strongly recommend Brave New World for all people age 14 and older to read. The message it makes about certain aspects of society are invaluable. Given that today's society and the one portrayed in the novel have many strong and disturbing similarities, I feel that this book is a wake-up call for today's increasingly sheeplike generation. Huxley's greatest novel is a great guide for what not to allow our society to become."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"This is one of my top ten favorite books. You must read it more than once. Each time I read it I find some new insight regarding the human psyche."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Brave New World, by Aldous Huxley, is an example of what a Utopian society could be like in the future. It deals with the issues of cloning and DNA manipulation and sacrificing freedom for happiness. Although it gets its point across, it does it so in a long, drawn-out fashion. The novel gives some minor and unimportant details, and perhaps the most important and influential character doesn't enter the story until halfway through the novel. Though it has its problems, the author does an excellent job of providing a scenario of a futuristic Utopian society.In the beginning of the book it almost has numerous scenarios occurring at once, making it somewhat confusing. I found myself trying to decide which of these was the most important and how and when they would all come together. Once again, the real story doesn't come until halfway through the novel. The first half is merely introducing you to the society and the characters' problems and worries, some of which are irrelevant to the plot.As the book begins, you believe that the story is about a man named Bernard Marx, however, as you continue reading, a new character is introduced, name John, and takes the story on a whole new path. Although this seems interesting, it makes the first half of the story appear unimportant and irrelevant to where the story is headed.I would recommend this novel to those who have interests in science, technology, and Utopian ideas. However, due to some of the content, I do not recommend it for younger children. It is also helpful if you have some background information in science and technical terms as they are used in the beginning descriptions. Not having this information, I found myself confused and somewhat lost in the first chapter or so. This novel is excellent in giving the pros and cons of a Utopian society, even if it takes a while to prove its point."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Brave New World, written by Aldous Huxley takes place in England as a futuristic utopian society. Ford, who is the ultimate leader and unlimited power, rules the world. In this new world there artificially made people, who are born into a caste system. There are five classes in the caste system, there are the alphas which are the intelligent, and then there are the Epsilons that are the workers of society. Everybody in society is content with their life because they are trained to be obedient members of society. Huxley brings out very deep and interesting questions to the reader through his novel. In the novel his characters help the reader formulate but never actually answer these questions. The basic plot of the novel is not too difficult to follow, however the deep questions and ideas that Huxley brings out in the novel are hard to spot by a young reader. This novel is for someone who can spot the deeper understanding of the novel rather than the actual storyline. Some of the themes and ideas that Huxley shows the reader are genetic engineering, happiness through the use of drugs or sex, the control of science, the stability of society, and many more.In Brave New World, the reader meets quite a few characters one of which is Lenina who is an obedient member of society. Lenina does everything that a person in society should do to make society stable. In Brave New World stability is everything because without stability there is change, risk, conflict, and problems. Lenina and Bernard go to a savage reservation in the United States only to uncover a surprising story of the past. Bernard is an Alpha like Lenina, but he is deformed. He does not like sports, sex, being alone, and he is unhappy all these are unusual traits from the rest of society.Brave New World introduces many things of the future that are different than things now days. One of which is somma. Somma is a drug that people take when they are feeling sad or unhappy and they take somma to become happy. Somma is used to make a person become happy and part of society. Another thing that is different in Brave New World is that children are grown genetically to fit society's needs. A person is grown to serve society. Children are taught in their sleep about being a good member of society. These are just a few of the ideas brought by Huxley in his novel.This novel is for a person who can understand the deeper meanings behind the book that Huxley is trying to show us. It is hard for younger people to understand these meanings, but a collage person or adult would. This novel brings up many perplexing questions through the characters of the novel. It is interesting to try and see what you think the answers are. I would recommend this book for an adult or collage person because they can understand the questions that Huxley brings out in his novel."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Shocking and odd, Aldous Huxley's Brave New World is a description of a futuristic utopian society.The story takes place in a near future, in London, where people live in an awful perfect world. A perfect world for the book characters only, because they live in a world without feelings, without freedom of choice and without the opportunity to think by themselves and lack of self identity. But people in this society do not complain about the absence of those things, because they don&#65533;t know about them. They live happily and any concerns because they are used to consume soma; a drug that makes them feel comfortable with their pathetic lives.Many things Aldous Huxley predicted in 1932 in this book for a society 600 years in the future are already real nowadays, something that makes the readers think about what kind of world they are living in.What makes this story good is that it is a profound one, because it makes you think about your reality, compare your reality to the one in the book. It makes you meditate. It is not shallow like most stories I&#65533;ve read. And also, how frightening, odd, and specific its descriptions are!"},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Briefly, this is one of the most accurate insights of modern scientific industrialised society. This is particularly impressive when you consider that is was written early in the 20th century. Indeed, for the sake of universal irony, Huxley had very poor eyesight but gave us this detailed literary vision.Thoughts.Soma: Ritalin and Prozac.Feelies: TV in general, but in particular, shows that endeavour to hijack emotions such as Friends, Big Brother, Survivor, and Temptation Island etc. Those that create more intimacy with fiction than with reality. To be provocative, why did we all say the WTC attack was like a movie?"},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"I enjoyed reading Brave New World by Aldous Huxley and watching the lives of the characters unfold from the beginning. The growth and dismantling of the characters brings you right into their world. This world Huxley created 60 years ago is very similar to today. I was able to make connections between my life and the lives of the characters, which really brought this book to life. This is a fast read and great for a Sunday afternoon."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Huxley's Brave New World is a classic sci-fi, which comes frighteningly close to reality. It is a marvelous psychological satire on humankind's social mores and behavior at its most extreme and corrupt. Sadly, preconditioned reflexes are also part of our modern society. Bombarded as we are by mind-bending advertising and fashion-influenced behavior, Huxley's Brave New World is closer than we think. If only we did think more about the world taking shape around us all, like Huxley must surely have intended when he wrote this powerful Sci-Fi critique. It sometimes seems we do not ponder enough. There are certainly very few such thought-provoking sci-fi books, which point a frank finger at our global society's thoughtless ways. However, I am glad to say that I did find such a new sci-fi. It is definitely for those of us who like to think a bit while reading an entertaining tale and are starved for such books. It is entitled, ACCUSED BY FACET-EYES (author C.B.Don) and it addresses our contemporary environmental challenges in a fantastic sci-fi format. Much like the enlightening Brave New World, this brand-new, 21st Century novel also left me with a lingering sense that a more thoughtful approach to our actions on this planet is badly needed!"},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Aldous Huxley is an intelligent person. He has a back-round in psychology. This becomes very apparent in a Brave New World. The use of psychological evidence and theories makes the story interesting and at another level. It pulls this novel away from the rest of your typical Sci-Fi writings. Psychology is seen in the opening scene, with Bernard's life, and with customs.In the opening scene in the novel, there is a tour that takes place. It is not only a tour for the students in the novel, but for the reader as well. This is a formal operations style of learning for the reader. He or she is learning as they read. During the tour, the reader is introduced to the learning process of the offspring. The people of the Central London Hatchery and Conditioning Centre use Ivan Pavlov's Classical Conditioning. The use of an unconditioned stimulus (flowers) lead to the kids to be happy. Than a conditioned stimulus (very loud and frightening bell) lead the children to a controlled reaction of being frightened of flowers. After time and time again, the children pick up the unconditioned reaction of being frightened of flowers and screaming. This shows that the offspring can be conditioned to serve just about any purpose.Bernard's life has many psychological principals involved. His life shows the cruelty of society as well. He is an outcast due to his physical stature. There is no acceptance for someone like this in this world. He turns to a cult. He still feels very much like an outcast. Bernard is struggling in an early stage of crisis. He is much to old for it. Bernard is struggling in Erik Erikson's Identity V.S. Role Confusion. He needed to make an identity for himself, but was unable to.The customs of Brave New World much different as those of today. They use a social approach of psychology to live there lives. Also, a behavioristic approach is taken.The social approach of cultural differences is different, but also the same. We have God, they have Ford. We both worship, but two very different things. The cultural differences have changed into the world found in the novel. Behaviorism gets involved with the surroundings. The environment that the children are brought up in, will make them who they are for the rest of their lives. It is a situation that could realistically occur.The opening scene of classical conditioning shapes the reader for the rest of the novel. It gives a sense of direction and knowledge for the life forms in the novel. Bernard's life of being an outsider makes him fit his role in the novel. The customs of the novel follow a psychological order to make the novel. Huxley has a very familiar back-round in psychology."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Huxley was a genius. I find it hard to believe that this Brave New World he invented was created in the 1930's and not the 1990's. This book ranks up there with Fahrenheit 451 and Lord of the Flies. It really will make you appreciate all of the freedom and liberty that we take for granted. The characters were very colorful, I found myself pulling hard for Bernard Marx. Some of the characters were static, but that was clearly by design. The plot moved well and Huxley did a wonderful job of staying consistent, always a difficult task when writing a Futuristic Novel. His understanding of Shakespeare was also outstanding and shined through the memorable dialouge given to The Savage character. You'll read this over one weekend easily, but if you are anything like me, this one will stick with you for a lifetime."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"I have to say right off the bat that this is one of the greatest books I ever read.

It is a very interesting foretelling of what or world could become. People genetically egineered into specific social classes and the ignorance and danger that stems from it. This is a book that everyone should be able to say they read."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"I was reading the other reviews and it just seemed to me that nobody really saw the point to the book. This could happen expesually in this time of year. Our world is moving towards asocitiy that we don't have a freedom of speech. They are working on to controling our minds its only a matter of time. I read the book for my senior english class and was a real eye opening expereince. its a dictarorship which is just like cuba. I think everybody should read the book because it really shows you how the world could be."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Picking up this book without ever reading it in highschool or 1984 I had no expectations. After reading it, I LOVED IT. I fell in lov right away with the characters and the whole idea of the world they live in. Its a reasonably short read, but there is soo much to take form it other than just the story.I really loved the ending of the book, it was soo fitting and right for the story. Most people I know perfer 1984 over BNW, but I say BNW is better. Dont take my word for it, read it for yourself, even if you think 1984 is the better book, at least you've read a literary classic!!!"},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Brave New World is fast paced and action packed. This book is a nonstop adventure thriller that centers around the story's main characters: Bernard Marx, Helmholtz Watson, the Savage, Lenina Crowne, and the world controller Mustapha Mond. BNW includes hedonistic promiscuity, soma induced dream states, embryo stores, neo-pavlovian discipline techniques, caste division, feelies, and games of centrifugal bumble-puppy. The action leads to a debate between the world controller Mustapha Mond and the Savage from the New Mexico reservation. They argue over conflicting values such as hedonism vs. liberty, happiness vs. truth, stability vs. progress. Mustapha and the Savage throw around excerpts from Shakespeare, the Bible, and some philosophical texts. These texts have been banned by the world state in the year of Our Ford because they are said to corrupt the happy, civilized population with old, primitive ideas. These primitive ideas expand human consciousness and enable one to come in touch with the spiritual and with the power of their emotions. In the time after the Nine Years War, society has become stable, highly industrialized and dependent on intense materialistic consumption. The leaders of this highly civilized world state believe that its stability cannot withstand the masses focusing on the spiritual and emotional aspects of human nature. The Savage argues for the benefits of reality, liberty, and old-fashioned religion. Mustapha, the great controller, agrees with the Savage but he strongly believes that a peaceful civilization is better without them. The Savage then escapes from his experimenters and settles in an abandoned lighthouse overlooking the English heather. He fails to escape the audacious and meddlesome media which by consequence attracts a swarm of onlookers. Extremely frustrated, the Savage doses up on soma and finally commits suicide out of regret."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Every teenager should read this book, and now more than ever it is important to understant its message, we talk about freedom and liberties, but are we really free?, are we really individuals?.The story is good, but what makes this book so great is the message and the questions that one must ask, it is a mind opener, I read it while in my fist college year, and it was a big influence on my believes and ideals."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"This is pure science fiction literature...nearly 99% of science fiction books on the shelfs are not actual literature. This book has stood the test of time and will continue to do so. It's not only a goof story but also has a lot of depth that will be discussed in nearly every high school or college class in the English speaking world. If you don't like the book, you have to appreciate it, like I do with Moby Dick (too long and too much whaling information)."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Good book! I could not get enough of it! I normally do not like science fiction type novels, but I really enjoyed this one. It was so different from society back when Huxley wrote Brave New World, and still different now. In a good way. This is one of the few futuristic novels I've read that didn't mention a year, and therefore, I believe that this book will always be futursitic. It is truly fascinating to see what Aldous Huxley's creation and view of what society could come to if it weren't for science, religion, and distinct social classes. I must admit that the ending was not as much of a treasure as the rest of the book, but still a good book all in all. Read it!"},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Many critics don't appreciate when they speak disparagingly of Huxley's predictions that he had written them in 1932. How different was the socio-cultural fabric of the \\"modern\\" world at that time! This rebellious icon undoubtedly overexaggerated - that was the point - but I doubt even HE suspected \\"Brave New World\\" would make him look this clairvoyant. None of his contemporaries would have guessed how close he came to modern genetic engineering, rampant SSRI and sedative use, sexual liberation, mass food fortification, and the direction public education is heading. Whether Huxley was a bitter intellectual who embraced counterculture only insofar as it got him attention is besides the point. Real 21st century life would be just as much \\"science fiction\\" to depression-era intellectuals, and he came a lot closer than Orwell or H. G. Wells.Huxley's writing is a little disconcerting at times, vacillating between different scenes of action without contextual or even speaker reference. At points it reads more like a screenplay, but these moments are not frequent and don't not interfere with clarity. His style is for the most part plain but sardonic, wholly suitable for satire. This was the darker (and first) counterpart to the \\"The Island,\\" which Huxley contended was an optimistic response to \\"Brave New World.\\""},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Aldous Huxley has concocted the most abstract, encompassing, and somewhat frightening novel about a possible and plausible future destination the world could arrive at if it decided to follow a certain course of action. In Huxley's novel, the events that are depicted here can be determined to take place about six hundred years from now. Extreme scientific progression in the field of genetic engineering and biochemistry coupled with an apparent social retrogression into a rigid, inflexible caste system have transformed the people of the earth into a totally bizarre society which contrasts radically to today's lifestyle. One of the novel's characters, John the Savage, finds out he's analogous to a square peg in a round hole once he is removed from his indian reservation environment and transplanted into the &quot;brave new world&quot; of the futuristic London. John's plight illustrates the inevitable obfuscation anyone can experience if obtrusively placed in surroundings of omnipresent unfamiliarity. In consideration of the year 1932 when this novel was published, the facts that the principles of heredity were discovered by a cloistered Austrian monk a relatively few years before, and that nucleic acids would not be determined to contain the genetic &quot;blueprints&quot; of organisms until many years later; it's easy to see Mr. Huxley was a very erudite, perspicacious, and artful writer well ahead of his time. I am still waiting to see if a feature motion picture based on this novel will ever be produced. A little bit of trivia here: Mr. Huxley's death on November 22, 1963 went relatively unnoticed by the general public only because someone else of more prominence was assassinated that same day."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"This book is a great classic written by an amazing author. it brings us almost 700 years into the future to a world where Ford is God and humans beings are manufactured and designated into different mental classes at birth. they range from the athletic and intelligent Alpha Plus to the slow and dim witted Eplison. This book follows the story of Bernard Marx, an out-of-place Alpha Plus who feels that he doesn't fit in the world. After visiting a &quot;savage&quot; reserve he begins to discover his true nature."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"This Utopian/dystopian future offers soma and other carnal pleasures, while manipulating the people into mind-numbing dependence. Huxley explores the evils of a seemingly satisfied and successful society, because that stability is only derived from the loss of freedom and personal responsibility. Part of what has made this book so controversial is the very thing that has made it so successful. We want to believe that technology has the power to save us, but Huxley shows the dangers as well.John claims the &quot;right to be unhappy.&quot; Mustapha says it's also &quot;the right to grow old and ugly and impotent; the right to have syphilis and cancer; the right to have too little to eat; the right to be lousy; the right to live in constant apprehension of what might happen tomorrow...&quot;By getting rid of all of the most unpleasant things, the society also rid itself of many of the true pleasures in life. There's no real passion. Remembering Shakespeare, John says:&quot;You got rid of them. Yes, that's just like you. Getting rid of everything unpleasant instead of learning to put up with it. Whether 'tis better in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, or to take arms against a sea of troubles and by opposing end them... But you don't do either.&quot;These men have realized that fear and intimidation have only limited power; after all, these tactics simply build up resentment in the minds of the oppressed. Subconscious persuasion and mind-altering drugs, on the other hand, appear to have no side effects. Add to this the method of genetic engineering, and soon almost all &quot;pre-Ford&quot; problems have been wiped out permanently.The caste system of this brave new world is equally ingenious. Free from the burdens and tensions of a capitalistic system which separates people into social classes by natural selection, this dictatorship government is only required to determine the correct number of Alphas, Betas, etc., all the way down the totem pole. There is no class warfare because greed, the basic ingredient of capitalism, has been eliminated. Even Deltas and Epsilons are content to do their manual labor. This contentment arises both from the genetic engineering and the extensive conditioning each individual goes through in childhood.Freedom (as well as art and religion which are results of freedom) in this society has been sacrificed for what Mustapha calls happiness. Indeed almost all of Huxley's characters, save Bernard and John, are content to take their soma ration, go to the feelies (the superficial substitute for actual life), and live their mindless, grey lives. The overwhelming color throughout Brave New World is grey. Everything and everyone seems dull to the reader, except perhaps the Savage, who is the only bright color in the novel. This grey happiness is the ultimate goal of the World Controllers like Mustapha.Yet Mustapha has incorrectly associated lack of pain with happiness. Only the Savage knows that true happiness comes from the knowledge that one has value. He alludes to this when he describes his childhood in the Reservation where the only time he was happy was after he had completed a project with his own two hands. This, not soma, gave him the self-confidence to find happiness. The Savage knows his own value is as an individual, not a member of a collective.Other characters in Brave New World, however, have no concept of self-worth. This results in their inability to find the happiness known to the Savage and the rest of the pre-Ford world which lives in the Reservation. True happiness is a consequence of freedom, not slavery. No slave can experience happiness until he is free. Yes, any slave can experience the contentment of a full belly and a full supply of instant gratification, but this doesn't lead to happiness.Bernard suffers throughout the book, being caught between both worlds. Although he has been conditioned to accept his servitude, he is constantly longing for freedom. He sees this freedom in the Savage, and envies him for possessing the inner happiness- genuine happiness- which Bernard's society outlaws. Huxley uses Bernard to exemplify this struggle between freedom and slavery. Huxley argues that a genuine, free life requires suffering and pain. Men without anguish are men without souls. Huxley's future describes a world without pain and a world without soul."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"I still have not received this book...i had to go buy a new one since i have not received it and need it for 01/15/2012 latest for school."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"I didn't have high expectations for the condition of this book, still I was a bit disapointed.

This book because its on this kind of subject also has some contreversial content, it deals widley with the subjects of sex, drugs, entertainment, and the concievment of children. I thought this book was good but it was kind of diturbing the emphasis of sex and &quot;soma&quot; which is the perfect drug in the book."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Huxley's Brave New World is a story about the future world and how bad things our in their 'civilization'. Everything deals with how to get as many clones as they can, sex, and artificial happiness.The beginning of the book was very slow, but then so was the whole book. I never could understand what Huxley was trying to portray with all the recreational sex and artificial happiness, which was achieved by taking a pill supplement. By writing about the future, as he characterizes it, he is telling us about how dark and disgusting the world might be in the future. Something must be wrong with him if he thinks this is how the world will turn out.I give this book 1.1 stars out of 5."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"I loved this book. It was hilarious. When people die in this utopia their corpses are taken to the crematorium for phosphorous recovery operations. I wouldn't mine living in this utopia. You get to have lots of recreational sex (orgy porgies) and take lots of the soma drug with no side effects. Children get to play erotic games with each other. One of these games they play is called Hunt the Zipper. Also there is security and stability in this Brave New World, nothing like the New World Order that are leaders are trying to establish. If there is crime, criminals get squirted with the soma drug instead of being shot with bullets. I would only like to live in this Brave New World only if I can be an Alpha and not an Epsilon-Semi moron. I believe that all americans would love this book. The utopia in this book promotes Consumerism and wasteful spending, the two driving forces of the US economy.

I still can't figure out why the school system would want teenagers to read that indiscriminate sex and taking drugs is the preferred state of existence. I certainly don't think that they would understand that subliminal message about not rebelling against authority or you will die.Take it off the list.

It leaves you longing for a few grams of Soma. There is not one character that has any level of depth, that you can become attached to. It is horribly written, the play on words with the ford and the god annoyed me the first few times but by the 6Th and 7Th it became nauseating. That whole part about the top of the crosses being cut off and becoming T's because of Henry ford, really ?? what is the point ?? And is this really the worst you can do with a novel about a futuristic Utopian society controlled by a single person called the Director. A society where you have movie theaters whose movies are so immersing that you actually feel what is going on. everything is in order no one is sad and there is no despair no violence, You can have any woman you want! I wish i lived in Huxley's appalling world, how much grief i could have been saved if all the beautiful women that have turned me down in my life would have said yes by just inviting them to a round of space golf. And who can forget the climax of the book when John and the director finally meet and they have their big showdown discourse. John crys out why did we lose Shakespeare and God and the director answers because it is not stable and it is old does not apply to society now. The whole discourse is laughable so you mean to tell me in order for to me to be eternally happy, never grow old or sick all, and have all the women I want all I have to do is give up Shakespeare and a being that i have never met and only know from books and no one has seen..

What I didn't like about the book was the use of drugs and how drug use was considered normal and how children was encouraged to play sexual games. My only complaint with the writing of this book is with the character of Bernard. I thought that he would be the character to rebel against the system but he seemed to sell out at the end.I guess science fiction isn't my genre and I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone who felt the same."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Brave New World / 0-06-092987-1While \\"Brave New World\\" may lack the narrative punch of other dystopias such as \\"1984\\", I cannot help but feel that for sheer prophetic rightness, Huxley hits the nail on the head where others fail. Where Orwell sees an oppressive government that frightens and tortures its populace into submission, Huxley envisions a world where government control is total and yet unnoticed, simply because the population does not care.Why care about your government when there is so much more fun stuff to be doing? There's soma - a happy-pill that counters all sadness, doubt, and anxiety - to take, romances to conduct, entertainment to consume, and so many other more interesting things to think about. And don't we see that today, in the news media (I second the reviewer who mentioned Postman's wonderful \\"Amusing Ourselves to Death\\"), with reports that are more focused on entertainment than on the dissemination of information.Huxley's insightful book is an individual wake-up call to us all - a reminder never to become so complacent that we simply stop caring about the greater world around us.~ Ana Mardoll"},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"I purchased Brave New World after reading 1984, and while I must confess that I enjoyed Orwell's book just a little bit more, Huxley's work was still an immediately compelling read. I think what I liked best was just how \\"british\\" this future was, by which I mean, everything seemed so very posh and hip and how we Americans would tend to see the British, as opposed to (sorry to keep drawing comparisons) 1984, whose depictions of England were much more how they might be viewed by say, South Africa.Another thing I liked about the story was that I didn't particularly care for any of the characters that much. I actually enjoyed the disappointment of having each character let me down just when I thought their basic goodness would shine through. Initial protagonist Bernard Marx is far from the jaded idealist that one wants to believe he is, instead vying for vapid acceptance in the shallow society that he is ostracized from; Lenina Crowne does not become enlightened to Marx or the Savage's ways of living and remains blissfully baffled by each of them, and wistfully goes on enjoying the meaningless sex and soma holidays; even John the Savage becomes unrelatable, turning into something of a zealous monk who becomes so averse to any feelings of personal satisfaction that he... well, read the book.I thoroughly enjoyed Brave New World and will in all likelihood pick up Brave New World Revisited in the near future."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"An excellent book with an excellent plot and perfect examples of external and internal conflicts among the characters and the society in which the characters live in."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Brave New World by Aldous Huxley ****The precursor to George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty Four, and the opposite theory. This was and still is one of the most important novels in the history of novels. Huxleys thoughts on a world obsessed with sex, and personal pleasures is so relevant today.The premise of the book is that the previous world the one we knew in the 1920's was replaced by one obsessed with personal fulfillment with reckless abandon for others and yet we still 'all belong to one another.' It is a hard concept to rap your head around which makes this a challenging and fulfilling read. Though sometimes the book lags in places it makes up for it in others.Though it was written so long ago the book shows a chilling truth to today's world much like Nineteen Eighty Four does but on a different plain. It is worth the read if you are really interested with an open mind and have patience but if not, then don't even try."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"I read this book for the first time only recently, and couldn't help but notice the parallel with the movie Gattaca. If you liked that movie, you'll no doubt like this book as well. I appreciate this way this book forces you to examine your relationship with pleasure and mindless entertainment. Do we really, after all, just want to turn our brains off and experience a constant stream of pleasure? Too frequently I find myself not wanting to pick up a certain movie or book because I know I will have to think. And after, all I could always just pop in, say, a Spiderman movie and enjoy not being challenged at all. Ultimately, this book makes me think (Matrix style) if I had a pill that would numb away everything bad about life and give me pleasure, would I take it. Would you?"},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"The difference between the society in \\"Brave New World\\" and 1984's society is that \\"Brave New World's\\" might actually work. The society in \\"Brave New World\\" is based on the assumption that humans-as a whole will do everything possible to avoid discomfort, pain and sadness. They will even give up their freedom and individualism in the name of happiness.I think this is true. Look at the drug use in this country. Although drugs are important tools, they are both legally (anti-depressants, anti-anxiety) and illegally abused.It is socially acceptable in this country to be addicted to TV and pharmaceuticals---as long as it doesn't affect your productivity at work it's not a problem.Excellent book-probably more relevant today in the age of anti-depressants than it was 80 years ago."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Aldous Huxley's Brave New World is in many ways a paradoxical world: comically tragic, organized chaos, perfectly imperfect, a living and breathing oxymoron. There are several key players within the story--John (The Savage), Bernard Marx, Linda (John's mother), Lenina Crowe, Mustapha Mond, and Hermholz Watson. Much of the story is told from the point of view of Bernard, an Alpha male who is displeased with the structure of society and eventually talks Lenina into going to visit the \\"savage\\" society. While there, Bernard winds up meeting John, a \\"savage\\" who has many characteristics that make him a deep thinker and philosophical about man's existence. Bernard eventually talks John into making the trip to \\"civilized\\" London, an upside down utopia where babies and humans are \\"created\\", emotion is suppressed or avoided altogether, the collective is favored over the individual, and progress is stressed.Huxley has an imaginative method of illustrating this new world. The topsy-turvy dystopia establishes that words such as \\"mother\\", \\"father\\" and \\"love\\" have no real use. Passion is ignored in favor of progression. Huxley comically and intentionally depicts \\"norms\\" of this shocking society. Without the basic idea of family or relationships between couples, people seem more like organisms than flesh and blood. Huxley perhaps was making a point about the times, maybe his society, maybe ours.One of the more disturbing aspects to the world is the ideology of illusion serving to be the method for fixing one's problems or difficulties. Nearly all the characters escape from the world they live in by taking the hallucinogenic drug soma, designed to make them forget a troubling encounter or experience by travelling far away from the present. John, considered to be the \\"savage\\", is the only one willing to break from this practice while also actively trying to convince others of its wrongs. While others escape with soma, he escapes into reading Shakespeare, a form of therapy from this mad existence. Towards the end of the novel, John, while debating with Mustapha Mond (a Controller, vehemently tries to protest this \\"Brave New World\\" thinking: \\"Whether \`tis better in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, or to take arms against a sea of troubles and by opposing them...But you don't do either. Neither suffer nor oppose. You just abolish the slings and arrows. It's too easy.\\" Soma seems to be a symbolic surrender, a post-modern easy button to life in the Brave New World. John's frustration with many of the people in this circle is that they are so brainwashed that they cannot even grasp his protests; he cannot convince them that there is another way to think. This is what eventually is John's undoing: he tries to seek refuge from this existence, this way of life, but there is no changing, no escaping, and no going back. Created in Huxley's work is an ironic confederation of idleness, the societal emptiness described eloquently by Mustapha Mond: \\"In a properly organized society like ours, nobody has any opportunities for being noble or heroic. Conditions have to be thoroughly unstable before the occasion can arise.\\"If there was one element I didn't care for, it was the first part. While the first fifty pages or so set the scene for the new civilization, where the five castes of society are introduced and the background is set for the futuristic society, I found them to be a bit tedious. The novel really takes off when Part two begins, and we meet some of the aforementioned main characters. I only reveal this fact because some may lose patience in the beginning of their reading; if you stick with it, I think you'll be much more interested once the plot gets going.This is a scary, original, and ironic ride into the future. Which future? That's for you to decide."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"For very long did I desire to read Huxley's classic, Brave New World, given as I am to the dystopias which were written in the first half of the twentieth century. I can only say that I am disappointed that I waited as long as I did to take up the text.The first tier of the text which remains startling to almost all who read it is the base objectification of mankind through scientific and social \\"programming\\" and \\"planning.\\" Indeed, this is usually the first thing which comes to mind when one recollects the first time that he or she read the text. In many ways, it does remain an excellent vantage point from which one can jump into the full meaning of the text, for who can but shudder at the words of Mr. Foster, \\"Nothing like oxygen-shortage for keeping an embryo below par\\" and realize that there is some deeper malaise of the human soul being investigated in this text.Indeed, the powerful core of the text which truly makes it relevant regardless of whatever technical progress may occur in the world is the fact that Huxley shows the reader the end result of hyper-objectification of the self and the world. This objectification is manifested in the scientific and social structures which undergird the society in the text but also breaks forth in several other major ways. The use of soma for escape from pain and trouble is an attempt to run away from that subjectivity which raises the objective experiences of life to a more fully human level, allowing the individual to more rationally (and emotively) know where his/her place is in the whole of the world. The lack of delay in gratification once again is a destruction of the subjectivism which allows all pleasure to be such because the individual pines for the object.The mark of a great work is not necessarily that it is so unique that it is unlike anything else. Myth is all the greater, as Chesterton would say, because it is not the story of a particular man but of mankind. In many ways, Brave New World fits this mark well. Alexis de Tocqueville once said that a society would be more likely to fight to keep the comforts which it may accrue that to fight for freedom. Huxley, in his later reflections entitled \\"Brave New World Revisited\\" says that man may for a while be more likely to say \\"Give me hamburgers and television\\" over \\"Give me liberty.\\" One can hardly forget the world of Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 where pleasure and escape are the choice of all society. However, Huxley also adds the corrective that as these objects rationed the subject will once again cry, \\"Give me liberty or give me death.\\" Characters like Bernard Marx, Helmhold Watson, and John the Savage stand out as those who, through the pains of realizing their subjectivity, glimpse at the glories (and dangers) of humanity. This corrective remains a hope, although Huxley also reminds us, like Plato and Christ, that the truly holy and jus man will be killed, forced into exile, or left to twist in the wind.Brave New World is a timeless dystopia because it deals with these sempiternal and ubiquitous questions of humanity. It is oracular today in a world which, in its more cosmopolitan and even suburban settings, will look to the television and listen to the radio but will not be silent under the stars. We share in the malaise of the day and are not impervious to its pernicious tendencies. Therefore, we should take heed an hear the words of Mr. Aldous Huxley."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"A very interesting book to think about. An amazing view of the future, despite the fact that Huxley couldn't have known about the impact of computers."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"At first glance, the novel may appear as only a fast read. While Brave New World is a quick read, it is certainly not void of keen insights on society and past civilizations' progressions.Huxley creates a world of imitation, a world of perfection. One mistake, one abnormality, and you're considered a deformity. In this Utopia, babies are not naturally born, children are not given chances to bloom, and adults are not given privacy; everything is arranged. There is no real love, and even if the inhabitants feel passionate feelings for another in this world, they must follow orders and take pills called \\"soma\\" to assuage their emotions. The people are categorized by titles of Beta, Beta-Minuses, Gamma, Alpha, Alpha Double Plus, etc, to show rankings, and the higher their titles shows that they are closer to perfection than others. By building this civilization of stability, Huxley allows readers to see what a \\"perfect world\\" would be, with everything controlled by a dictator: Mustapha Mond.Letting multiple characters have the spotlight to share their thoughts, Huxley smoothly integrates parts of a \\"savage\\" world into his Utopian world. However, the \\"savage\\" world is not as uncivilized as its title makes it sound; Huxley actually brings his characters Bernard Marx and Lenina Crowne into the Indian society, where they meet John and Linda, Indians living on a reservation. He highlights the great differences between two entirely dissimilar worlds by having his Utopian creations meet real people. His descriptions of the reservation bring the serene atmosphere to life in the readers' minds, with the imagined waterfalls, tribal dances, and warm fire pits.While Huxley brings in historical proponents such as the tribal lifestyle and past perceptions of an ideal society, he also alludes to literature such as Othello and Romeo and Juliet. Replacing an all-too familiar idealistic world as his own fantasy world, Huxley elicits the changes people assume they want and make them second guess their presumptions. As humans, we have the tendency to not think of the past and just live to satisfy the future; but with Huxley's Brave new World, we can imagine just how brilliant his fantasy world is, yet also how controlled and restricted a possible future life could be."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Brave New World: Huxley's Reasons for SuccessBrave New World, written by Aldous Huxley in 1932, remains a prevalent, thought-provoking novel more than seven decades after its initial publication. Huxley's vision of a futuristic society and the themes repeated throughout the book keep Brave New World a popular and enduring story.One of the themes in the novel is that of control. Huxley tries to give the reader a better sense of the control and organization of the future he's envisioned by creating several slogans and continually repeating them throughout the story. These slogans are repeated to every child in the future during their sleep, so that when they are fully grown, the slogans will not just be guidelines enforced on everyone, they will be seen by all as truths that should never be questioned.One of the slogans present in the story is \\"everybody belongs to everyone else\\" (Huxley 121). This slogan was designed to make sure that no one was ever lonely. \\"But,\\" as the Controller of Western Europe says, \\"people never are alone now, we make them hate solitude; and we arrange their lives so that it's almost impossible for them to ever have it\\" (Huxley 235). Loneliness was found to lead to deep thought. Deep thought led to questions about religion and death. Thinking about religion and death was found to make society as a whole unhappy. To keep people of the future from being unhappy, it was decided that everyone should be distracted from their loneliness by friendly and sexual interactions with everyone else. Since everyone wasprogrammed with the slogan \\"everybody belongs to everyone else,\\" no one saw their relations asbeing morally wrong and therefore they had been conditioned to never be lonely.\\"A gramme is better than a damn\\" and \\"A gramme in time saves nine\\" are two related slogans spoken within the book (Huxley 116, 89). They are meant to remind people that when they are scared, angry, or unhappy, they should take a gramme of soma to forget their troubles. Soma is a \`drug' of the future that people use to erase their worry and pain, almost like some people use alcohol and drugs today but without most of the dangerous side affects. \\"Why you don't take soma when you have these dreadful ideas of yours,\\" said Lenina to Bernard, \\"you'd forget all about them. And instead of feeling miserable, you'd be jolly. So jolly\\" (Huxley 92).Certain slogans repeated to children during their sleep don't have to do with happiness or soma. Instead, these slogans are written with the purpose of separating society into different classes and making sure that each class knows and enjoys the benefits of their social position. Beta children are taught separate lessons than Alpha, Gamma, or Delta children. For example: \\"Alpha children wear grey. They work much harder than we do, because they're so frightfully clever. I'm really awfully glad I'm a Beta, because I don't work so hard. And then we are much better than the Gammas and Deltas. Gammas are stupid. They all wear green, and Delta Children wear khaki. Oh no, I don't want to play with Delta children. And Epsilons are still worse. They're too stupid to be able to read or write. Besides they wear black, which is such a beastly colour. I'm so glad I'm a Beta\\" (Huxley 27). Through their conditioning, Betas will always express these views about the social classes of their peers.Yet another slogan in the story is \\"when an individual feels, the community reels\\"(Huxley 94). This slogan was designed to remind people to suppress their emotions. Whenstrong emotions are felt, such as love, passion, hate, and jealousy, it gives people something torally behind. It makes people feel that they have something to protect, something that is worth fighting for. Feelings like this would not keep society whole. People with different feelings anddifferent needs would split off into different factions. Eventually these factions would face off against each other and the world would be exactly as it is today, torn apart by constant war. As the Controller of Western Europe explains to the Savage, \\"But chastity means passion, chastity means neurasthenia. And passion and neurasthenia mean instability. And instability means the end of civilization. You can't have a lasting civilization without plenty of pleasant vices\\" (Huxley 237). This slogan was put into place to protect society and discourage people from having such non-conformist feelings.The slogans, activities, and attitudes of the people in the future all come to a culmination during the conversation between the Controller of Western Europe, Mustapha Mond, and the Savage from Malpais, John. During this conversation, Huxley writes about God, religion, and love. Huxley reveals through banter between the Savage and the Controller his many concerns.One of his concerns is that God and religion has been replaced by drugs and youth. Instead of concentrating on religion and death, the people of Huxley's future are blinded by their soma and their \`immortality'. If no one in the future ever really ages until the day that they die, then what is to make them think about what happens after death? If no one physically ages, then there's no reason for anyone to worry about where they're going after they die because they're all still so young and alive. If by some off chance someone did start to think of such things, they would only have to take their daily dose of soma to forget their worries about death and God. \\"Christianity without tears- that's what soma is\\" (Huxley 238).Without a God in the world to inspire ideas such as courage, patience, and dignity, would nature and love have a purpose? If in the future, someone could have anyone else they wantedwithout any effort, would there be a reason for love to exist? In Huxley's mind, probably not. As the Controller of Western Europe explains, \\"In civilized countries, you can have girls withouthoeing for them; and there aren't any flies or mosquitoes to sting you. We got rid of everythingunpleasant centuries ago\\" (Huxley 238).Huxley's society of the future is very different from today's society. Although science and technology continue to improve in the real world just as they did in Huxley's envisioned future, everything else in the story is very far from becoming a reality. Love, religion, and God are still as alive today as they have ever been. Nature is far from being forgotten. In fact, today the preservation of nature is a global concern and is paid for in part by individual corporations as well as national governments. Most people today still have their emotions intact and while there are depressants such as alcohol and certain drugs in today's society, the government does not sponsor or support them as the government of Huxley's future supports soma.Huxley's novel has withstood the test of time most admirably for over seven decades. His challenging themes that stretch the mind, his brilliantly designed world of the future, and his views on society, its dangers, and what it could possibly become are what has kept Brave New World continually popular for several generations of readers.Work CitedHuxley, Aldous. Brave New World. New York: HarperCollins, 1932."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"In the present, human-kind is generally living in a world of freedom. People have every right to think, feel, and express themselves in whichever way they find suitable. One individual is no different from the one sitting across from them. To each his own, as they say. However, in Aldous Huxley's novel Brave New World, society is presented in an entirely different way; a cleverly disguised and manipulated dystopia. Each individual, conceived and born out of a test tube, is subject to a sort of \\"caste conditioning\\". There are no mothers, no fathers, and the citizens begin practicing promiscuity while only toddlers. Separated and conditioned specifically according to social-status, this society functions solely on the work of the people and soma-induced \\"holidays\\". Bernard Marx, a high-class Alpha Plus, lives with confliction in this world. Bernard, who is unlike most Alpha Pluses due to a mistake during his test-tube infancy, is one of the few who dare to question the society in which he lives. Pained by unhappiness and societal neglect, he functions with depression. Lacking the promiscuous behavior his fellow Londoners practice, he has concentrated his focus on a woman named Lenina Crowne. Fortunately for Bernard, Lenina accepts his offer for a date to a \\"Savage Reservation\\" where native Americans still function as they would today, without conditioning by an outside source. While they are appalled and disgusted by the inhabitants and culture of the reservation, they come across are rather unique fellow who differs greatly from the people of the reservation. Deciding for mostly selfish reasons, Bernard brings John the Savage and his mother back to London. Eventually, the drastic change in atmosphere and overwhelming disgust towards human nature leads to John's untimely demise.Still torn between my feelings about this book, I will say that Huxley elegantly portrays his vision of the future with such sophisticated language and gripping narrative. He has the ability to create in the reader the tension, sensuality, or anxiety that is occurring in the each part of the book. The words he chooses and the style of which he writes can unknowingly cause a build up of emotion that you do not realize your face is only inches away from the pages, eager with anticipation of the moment. However, at times it can seem slightly chaotic and leave one emotionally drained at the end of a chapter. The ties to Shakespeare throughout the text and even to the root of the title itself (The Tempest), is a compelling aspect. Initially published in 1932, the eerie prediction of fascism and the idea dangerously resembling Hitler's Third Reich is something that, if the reader looks close enough, leaves one thinking. I suggest reading this book with an open mind. Many ideas can seem somewhat shocking and slightly sordid, but it only adds to the intensity of the novel. Anyone with a fondness for these dystopian novels, such as George Orwell's 1984 or Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 would find this book most intriguing."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"At first one laughs at this \\"utopia\\" how absurd their lives are how blindly they accept it. And yet people today readily believe what the media and those who are in control tell them to believe. Even though this maybe classified as a Sci-Fi... it has striking similarities with today's society. The book itself is well written and the plot interesting enough. I was a little disappointed in the ending ( I am a stickler for happy endings )but all in all it's a book that is worth reading."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"I found this book quite astonishing, especially considering it was written in 1936. The author presents a possible utopia in which people are spared all types of mental and physical pain throughout thier lives, all desires are met with instant gratification, and the consumption of mind altering drugs with no side effects is encouraged by the state. People are brainwashed from an early age to be simple and childlike, thus alleviating any of the pressures and angst that comes with being a free thinking individual. There are no families or relationships to burden people with the want or loss of love. Huxley makes it apparent that pain and prolonged desire are unique and valuable human qualities, for without pain, one can never know true happiness or passion for life. The book is very relevant to today's society in which being intelligent is considered unpopular, questioning the status quo merely a form of trouble making, and believing in love rather than promiscuous meaningless sex, blasphemy. It makes you appreciate the imperfections of humanity, and taking the bad with the good a little bit easier after considering the alternative."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Wow.... I'm a freshman in IB and our enlgish teacher had us read this book for in depth analysis. All i can say is this book has so much packed into such a tiny volume of pages. Huxley is a brilliant writer. The ethical questionings, philosophical debates, the satire, and all the other stuff in between the lines will blow your mind. Espesially the way he presents it all. My advice: read the book and then decide if I'm just simple and don't know what im talking about. As well be advised, this book is extremely deep, and I recommend reading it only if you are matured enough mentally and appreciate deep books requiring crazy analysis. I'd say this book is more for sophmore or junior level and above - unless you are crazy advanced in English. I'm talking IB level....."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Much praise is heaped upon Huxley for this Novel. In fact it is considered by many to be a classic. For me it was the ideas, which may have been ahead of their time, rather than the actual style of writing itself which deserves to be commended.The future is filled with robotic humanbeings who have been conditioned by 'early childhood training', constant reinforcement, subliminal messages and a breeding program that would eclipse any envisioned by those in the third reich. These humans, if you can call them that, are devoid of any individuality, embracing their oneness with the rest of humankind rather than glorying in their diversity.Their drug-induced happiness, and total submission to authority and the order of things is any freedom loving human-being's nightmare. Amidst all these drones, there is miraculously one man who does not accept the status quo. One who questions, and it is his questioning of the system that leads to his discovery of John Savage, a 'free-born' human being. John Savage's introduction to this brave new world disgusts him. Instead of being overawed by their 'progress' he reels back in horror when he realizes that they have killed the human soul; the only part of them that made them truly human.An interesting sidenote, Huxley quotes Shakespeare extensively through John Savage's character. It could be an interesting exercise trying to work out which Shakespearean works the quotations come from.Read Huxley's book to get a glimpse of a possible future. Even though our future may not be as extreme as Huxley imagines it, there are some similarities between both worlds even today."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"After I had read \\"1984\\" in grade 11, I figured that I had read THE greatest dystopian novel of all time-- I was wrong. While \\"1984\\" attacks totalitarianism in general, \\"BNW\\" satirizes a variety of corrupt systems SOVIET COMMUNISM, CAPITALISM, CONSUMERISM, ORGANIZED RELIGION (brilliantly through the concept of the drug \\"soma\\"). It compares and contrasts two opposite societies, arriving at some interesting conclusions and a compelling ending. Throughout, the story raises deep questions about what progress means for society while showcasing a world where science and technology have not only increased the standard of living, but also enslaved the masses. After reading \\"BNW\\" in grade 13, I developed a deep interest in the genre of dystopian fiction. There has been much debate amongst my peers over whether the progressive \\"Brave New World\\" is an example of HEAVEN or HELL or perhaps the \\"savage reserve\\" is heaven or hell...you read and decide."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"I never read this book in high school like I should have. So I thought I would get the audio cassette version. Well I can tell you that I thoroughly enjoyed it. Michael York does an excellent reading although his girly voices will make you laugh at first.I guess if I had read this when I was in high school I would have never realized what an anti-communist book it was. I would have thought that it was a sci-fi book with all the cool helicopters and other transportation devices. The impersonal part about baby factory made me feel cold. I couldn't imagine growing up with no relatives or not knowing who your family was. The morality with all the people having sex all the time was different except for the fact that you were not allowed to have the choice not to have sex if you didn't want it.The savage's lives were a little too moralistic for me but I guess it was written in the 1930s. He just over emphasized his feelings of love and was too appalled by people having sex all the time.The overall message was insightful still showing how it is always better to have freedom of choice then to be bound to the collective.This is a good book or tape for high school age people to listen to."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"this is a great book. (i hate capitalization so i will not be using any). this book shows us the means mankind can and inevitably will go through to reach utopia, which in and of itself is erroneous. no plan devised by man can produce utopia in that he is corrupted by his own humanity. when we hear the word utopia we automatically think oh yeah, thats peace and harmony. well, i shouldnt say we, cuz i dont. utopia, in my opinion, is not necessarily peace. it is simply the state of society in which every person is free to be him- or herself. pure individuality if you will. as i have been quoted several times, &quot;Utopia is the feeble attempt of man to grasp true intellectual freedom.&quot; even if man somehow manages to create a way of controlling society and programming its citizens utopia will still not have been reached. obviously it isnt reached going by my definition in that the people are told what to think and are nothing more than drones carrying out their meaningless lives. but even throught the accepted meaning of utopia it is still not attained in that even though everyone exists in peace with everyone else there are still the ones doing the controlling that are left uncontrolled. thus they are free to think whatever they want. inevitably they will disagree and the utopia--even though it is false--will be shattered. we may dream of a utopian society but that can never happen on this earth."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"I had to read this book for a general psychology class.

First published in 1932, this Huxley favorite describes a world 700 years from now in which children are genetically engineered, sexual freedom is the universal rule and &quot;happiness&quot; is ensured both by subliminal mind programming and a well-circulated feel-good drug. For anyone who thinks seriously about the human race (where we are and where we're going) this book will spark a lot of good thoughts.The foreword, written 15 years after publication, contains Huxley's self-critique of the novel, and Brave New World Revisited is an excellent companion book."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"This is a superb book, and it provides the most insightful, compelling justification around for rejecting our consumer society. Huxley doesn't cop out by making this Brave New World any less attractive than it could be, what with all the advanced technology, free sex, and designer drugs. This honest acknowledgement of how the sacrifice of individual freedom might realistically be compensated in a carefully-engineered society makes Huxley's point all the more powerful.Of course, the foresight Huxley shows is remarkable on many levels, but for me the most relevant prediction is the degeneration of society into materialism. In other writings Huxley has argued how individual spiritual experience can be hindered by organized religion, and the recent mega-church phenomenon hasn't so far produced a Thomas Aquinas.But even if you accept the underlying critique of a society that perpetuates itself though highly sophisticated psychological manipulation (and who wouldn't - even Captain Kirk had to bust one of these up on a Star Trek episode as I recall), it doesn't mean 1) that you are then logically compelled to reject any society that resembles the one here, nor 2) that you wouldn't choose to live in the Brave New World if given a choice.The real world doesn't present us with such black-and-white decisions, but most societies do reward conformity. Some have to tempt us more than others, and those are the ones to be careful of."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"This book was required reading for a philosophy class and I was suprised to find that I enjoyed it. However, I feel that a reread would do this story more justice. Although this book is considered sci-fi, and is disturbingly creepy at times, there are a lot of ideas to think about, such as social stability versus happiness. Though I thought I understood the book at the first read, our teachers questions made me think that I actually missed quite a bit. This is easy to do, the book is well written and fast paced, I read it in a day and a half. I would recommend slowing down, even taking notes and looking up words (even if its not for school) to completely grasp all the Huxley is writing about."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"This had the potential to be a good book and Huxley certainly wasn't a bad writer for his day, but his main purpose in this book seems to be to get a message out, and I'm not sure I can buy that message. Basically the thesis is that it's good to be unhappy. The main characters are sick that this world has no unhappiness and they want the right to be unhappy. I cannot understand this since I would rather be happy than not. If this was just a satire about an immoral modern society, then I could understand. His predictions certainly are not too far off the map. If you are curious, try this book, but personally I did not find it enlightening."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"A perfect world? That is only an illusion. This book has soo many references to the modern world as it exists today, it makes you think twice before starting a new day. This book is set in a society which maintains the ILLUSION of utopia by using human emotions and traits as a form of controll. As I have said, when i finished reading, I was in tears. I cried for about three hours, just comparing the events in the story to modern life. A DEFINATE READ!"},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"I am both very disappointed and glad that it took me so long to read this book. Disappointed because I am absolutely in love with it, and though I just finished it yesterday, want to read it again. Glad because I read it when I was old enough to really understand and value it.Huxley was writing dystopian novels before there was a WORD for dystopia. He was writing about a birth control pill BEFORE there was birth control. He was writing about how controlling governments will destroy society BEFORE the 2012 Republican candidates pretty much decided they wanted to take rights away from everyone, all the time. This man is so far ahead of his time, and so many people draw from his work, but no one really gives him the attention that they should.Besides its awesome story line, the book is written in such a fascinating way. The writing itself sounds mechanical, like the people living in his world. It's repetitive and monotonous but always enthralling. How he manages to accomplish both is completely beyond my scope of understanding. And yet in the middle of that he creates several characters that you are both attached to, and also disgusted by in some way. But you feel bad being disgusted by them, because they can't fight their conditioning.It's terrifying in its accuracy of what will become of the world, and brilliant in its use of science to show that nothing is more dangerous than our own ambition. If I reread this book today I am certain I see even more things that I missed before. I anticipate this being one of the most-read books in my life."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"A technologically advanced London is the primary setting of the novel. In this kind of futuristic, but kind of \\"now\\" society, science has become the tyrant of human behavior. Those in control in the New World abuse technology that was once intended to make human life easier, in order to force others to become their slaves. Aldous Huxley ridicules how technology, over time, can serve as a replacement for everything. In the story religion, art, and even the mother's womb are easily replaced by the novel's brand of science. Huxley points out, as our world continues to grow and develop, we too can easily fall into the abusive mannerisms as described in the novel. The secondary setting is a Reservation of savages in New Mexico, which is rather primitive, compared to the New World. The change in setting is significant because it emphasizes the contrast between the two opposite sides of the man and machine spectrum, one side being extremely primitive and the other side extremely technologically advanced. Huxley writes the novel in a third person omnipresent, and places a few oddball characters just to stir up the plot. This allows the reader to experience and share many different character's experiences as well as view and criticize all their different view points on the society they live. This is an amazing book, a definite read for anyone that has some spare time on their hands."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"In the high school I attended, seniors wound up reading one of two novels: 1984 or Brave New World. I was in one of the classes which read 1984. Ten years later, I chose to read Aldous Huxley's take on futuristic dystopia, just for the sake of broadening my knowledge. And while Huxley's vision is disturbing in its accuracy, its execution leaves a whole lot to be desired.I cannot fault Huxley either for his ability to foresee the future based on contemporary trends, or for his ability to embed twisted values into a fictional civilization and make the entire thing thought-provoking. He scored well on both counts. Many parallels to the essential elements of Brave New World (antidepressants, sexual debauchery, godlessness) do in fact exist today and enjoy widespread popularity.Yet I cannot forgive Huxley for some of his word choices. Occasionally he can put together strings of words that never should exist when spoken, let alone on a printed page in countless schoolrooms. He'll routinely drop a leaden hunk of verbal excrement like \\"civilizedly\\" for the reader to ingest. Why? WHY!?! How is it that such an obviously intelligent man, with all kinds of brilliant insights about where we're going and the handbasket we're in, how is it that he can choose such horrific excuses for words to convey his ideas? Did no one dare to point out that maybe there was a better way to get across these revolutionary ideas?It may just be that Aldous Huxley was never meant to be a writer of fiction. I have read essays of his, including one on women and the beauty industry, and been fascinated with his ability to see the disconcerting flaws in his own society. I think the message of Brave New World would have been best conveyed not through a story (if Huxley were to write it, anyhow), but through incisive, unquestionable, invaluable exposition. That is how Huxley wrote best. This slim, grim, unreadable excuse for a novel is NOT how Huxley wrote best. When you find yourself not aching for more of the story, but instead dreading the moment when you will pick the book up again as if it were some gigantic horsepill that you know will be good for you and is just \\"the right thing to do\\" -- that is when you know you have a bad novelist on your hands.There can be no question that the ideas within this novel are important. They are far too accurate to dismiss. But do not be surprised if you find reading it a chore, not because it is offensive or unimaginable, but simply because of its horrendously clumsy use of the English language."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"I personally liked 1984 better because it was more realistic, but Brave New World is far more twisted. Instead of pleasure outlawed, sex in general is outlawed. Babies are made in test tubes. They come out in an assembly line. People are educated to hate things. Each class is educated to look down on the others. Children are encouraged to have erotic play. The whole society is educated to take soma, a depressant. One man from the still-normal world of New Mexico, which is called The Savage Reservation by those of the other world because sex i how babies are formed, rebels and throws soma out the window in the face of kids. This evil story of a world I hope never becomes true is nonetheless thrilling."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"i concur completely with the review further up that says it was a bit disappointing. i also found a bit more to be desired, because i had had it suggested to me because i had enjoyed 1984 so much. it does have lots of relevance, and it does make you think, but there is still much to be desired in the story and the characters. i was particularly upset by one thing, they introduced a character at the beginning, i dont recall his name, he was pretty much the antithesis of the main character, very strong and handsome, but he too was not content with the world they lived in. i thought that he would come up later in the book, perhaps become a prominent character, but there was no mention of him from then on."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"I'm not particularly interested in the question of this book's place as a work of literary genius. It may be an indispensable part of the Western canon. It may be predictable and its characters flat. I think both arguments can be made convincingly.Both positions miss the point of the book, though. Huxley wasn't unskilled as an author, but he never wrote expressly to produce a great piece of literature. His writing was purposeful and prophetic, intended to communicate a warning. Huxley would likely prefer a reader who denigrates his literary skill while grasping his point than one who blindly lauds him.What, then, is the point? Huxley paints a portrait of a not too distant world where the life has gained in comfort but lost all of its flavor. There remains no passion, no true excitement (only its physiological equivalent), no opportunities for sacrifice and love. All of these have been sacrificed on the altar of stability and contentment.All goes well until a few outsiders (Bernard, Helholtz, and John)who don't quite fit the mold of this society are introduced. The tension gradually builds to the climactic confrontation between John's worldview as an outsider and the ideology of the World State. Huxley leaves this final debate open, requiring that we examine our own assumptions.The clear implication of Brave New World is that our society contains the seeds of a future world like the one Huxley describes. The dangerous trends that he identified in the 1920s continue to dominate the societies of the world's industrialized nations: overconsumption, hypersexuality, self-medication, the pursuit of ever greater creature comforts, the decline of ethics and of poetry, the promotion of leisure for its own sake, and the possibility of genetic engineering controlled by a narrow elite.The greatest testament to Aldous Huxley would be if we each left his book determined to reevaluate our culture's often dangerous values. Brave New World demands a change in the way we think of ourselves and in the way we live our lives. Anything short of that response shows our failure to get the point."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"I really enjoyed this futuristic story about the advance (was it really an advance?) of the human race. The book shows what life looks life when humankind's sole purpose is hapiness. Meaningful relationships are non-existent, families are an anathema, discrimination is encouraged and most of the human population is doped up on drugs. Today, about seventy years after the writing of the book, it is scary how much our culture has gravitated toward Huxley's picture of 'A Brave New World'. At the end of the book, the contoller who is in control of the 'new world' basically says this about religion, &quot;I think there is a God, but it is best to cover him up and keep people from being involved with Him.&quot; I think this is an underlying faulty assumption of our culture that leads to many of society's problems today.On a lighter note, in the beginning of the book Huxley describes an advanced, super-civilized world and they are so advanced that they have huge cabinets of file cards keeping track of all their information (sarcasm on my part). I found it very amusing that in the thirties, our culture had not even dreamed of computers yet. It makes me wonder what is going to be in the future that we cannot even dream of?The book is a great, interesting, sobering story. There is a ton of philosophy (especially toward the end), but the storyline is easy to follow and fascinating. I wish someone would make a movie."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"&quot;The Wanting Seed&quot; is equal to Eugene Zamiatin's 1925 work titled &quot;We.&quot; It outdistances Orwell's &quot;1984&quot; and Huxley's &quot;Brave New Worlds&quot; in originality and is easy to understand and your mind's eye gets a picture that is believed. It keeps pace with today's changing attitudes in different life-styles and public acceptance of infidivual differences. It is not Utopia, but it is not such a horrible dis-Utopia either, but something one might accept with reservation. If only it were turned into a motion picture like the film titled &quot;A Clockwork Orange.&quot;"},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Brave New World, by Aldous Huxley, was a fantastic book. I would recommend this book for all teenagers that want a conceptual and captivating novel. Brave New World is well thought out from beginning to end, and provokes thought on important issues. However, Huxley takes quite a long time to eventually get his book started. I did not fully understand the book until after the first few chapters. After finishing the book, I look back at the first chapters and I understand it completely. To gain the full grasp of this novel, one might have to re-read some parts that get a little complex. For example, in the beginning chapters Huxley mentions the Caste System, which was not clear to me until I understood all of the members in it and their duties. Although there are some drawbacks, the pros definitely outweigh the cons.Bernard Marx, a member of the Caste System who feels rejected because he is different than the others, wishes to isolate himself from the rest of society, and also wishes to explore the concept of freedom. He later meets a savage, people who are actually born, on a reservation named John, and takes him back home with him. Trouble arises, and they both are sent to meet with Mustapha Mond, one of the ten \\"world controllers,\\" to discuss their conduct. Bernard is banished to Iceland, while John and Mustapha Mond have a long discussion about freedom and happiness. John mentions that he has true happiness and freedom, while others in the utopian society are subject to slavery and do not have the opportunity to achieve it. Mustapha Mond responds saying that John was alone and interdependent, while everyone in the utopian society is in dependence of others, therefore in constant universal freedom and happiness. John, becoming frustrated with the argument, leaves to find solitude. In the end he kills himself realizing that it is pointless to live in a world where others will never know true freedom and happiness.Huxley portrays a utopian society far into the future where humans are fertilized, rather than born. These humans are conditioned to have a certain destiny. Because of their conditioning, everyone is content with their jobs and status. Therefore, they lack freedom to control their own lives. It is explained that freedom is sacrificed for happiness. Because of this, each character in this utopian society is like a robot that is controlled by a totalitarian government headed by ten \\"world controllers.\\" This reveals Huxley's opinion of human cloning and the true meaning behind his novel."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"Brave New World, by Aldous Huxely, was a fantastic book.

The book was ment as a warning to the people of the world not to become to rapped up in creating the perfect world. Many predictions for the future that Huxley had came true. We can now clone animals, and it is only a matter of time before a human is cloned. We have holograms and interactive 3-D suits that can put a person vertualy inside of a computer program. Some of the predictions in this book have become reality, but others I hope never do. The enginering of Human beings to do certin tasks and mind control are two areas I hope Technology will stay away from. This is an excellent book, and I think it would be a good book for anyone who wonders what the future may hold."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"I acknowledge that Huxley had vision,creativity,and a very deep intuition on a philosophical and the sociological thought process. Yet the book never truly says more than what you are already expecting. Before I even picked this book up to read it, I had a good idea of what he was steering towards. And I must say I hit the nail on the head. A Utopian state where everyone is engeneered, the Christian views of the world or in the brave new world are non-existent and erudition is perverse. The real depth and deep thought never truly surfaces. Even Huxley himself expressed litary error and dissapointment after it was published. Brave New World is not a horrible book, it does bring out some good points, but it is not what people say it is. This book is clearly overated and interestingly enough it holds a lot of qualities which advocate christendom. So in closing, if you want philosophy then read philosophy, not a peice of supposed fiction which on telling someone you have read it will mean you are well read."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"To really understand this brilliant book,the essential thing is to grasp that it is a caricature of life in the U.S, especially Southern California, where Huxely spent the last forty or so years of his own life.The material plenty of Brave New World; the social duty to consume and spend money; the preference for synthetic products over natural ones; the emphasis on people's physical appearance, including their &quot;lustrous&quot; smiles; the obligation to be happy as well as bland; the tendency to think in short, pithy epithets that are manufactured by experts in emotional engineering; the equality of women, which makes them shameless; the instability of social relations and the family (which has been eradicated); the fear of being alone or inactive; the &quot;resort&quot; as a way of spending one's leisure; the everlasting hunt for sensation; names such as &quot;Morgana Rothschild&quot;, &quot;Benito Hoover&quot; and, of course, &quot;Lenina Crowne&quot;, all of which point to a society without roots; these, and many other things in the book, are simply facets of the United States magnified, distorted, and made fun of.Had Huxely's American readers understood the mirror he is holding up to their face, no doubt they would have crucified him as, at various times, they did other &quot;Un-American&quot; writers. Fortunately, like the heroes of Brave new World, they are not capable of introspection. So much the better for him, and for the rest of us who are not American."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"After reading this book the one thing i felt was fear. What i was afraid of im afraid i cannot totally say without spoiling the book. What i can say is this, Huxley was a literary prophet his work in Brave new world was so prophetic it scares me.

Please to better yourself and society, read this book."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"It has a great and seemingly accurate vision of the future. The books message seems to apply to our times a lot more each and every day. But the story telling is slow and boring. It isn't paced at a very good speed and the whole deal about &quot;savage reservations&quot; was so unrealistic it was annoying. I liked the book but i definately don't think it was GREAT. It should be in the library of people who like to read but for people who just read for fun: BORROW THIS BOOK FROM YOUR LIBRARY."},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"The novel's opening scene introduces the Central London Hatchery and Conditioning Centre, where the World State director explains how babies are being \\"decanted\\" instead of born. Here, human beings are mass-produced through the \\"Bokanovsky Process,\\" which \\"in exceptional cases, can make one ovary yield over fifteen thousand adult individuals.\\"Huxley's \\"squib about the future is a thin little joke,\\" wrote a British reviewer, who scoffed at the author's prophecy in Brave New World when it was first published in 1932.Sixty-nine years since the publication of this chilling little masterpiece, Brave New World has been reread and reinterpreted by generations of readers (and made into a movie starring John Malkovich.)Events in the recent years have proven Huxley's prescience. The artificial civilization, which he had projected 600 years into the future seems to be actually approaching far sooner.In Brave New World, farmed embryos produce an emotionless civilization, a future Utopia, where human beings are socially engineered for the sake of social stability. To imagine that the idea of social predestination will actually take place eventually may sound too far-fetched to be taken seriously. But come to think of it, the idea of human cloning was considered unthinkable during Huxley's time.

Estoy de acuerdo con el autor en que un verdadero cambio de la sociedad radica en un cambio interno de cada ser humano.

As i heard him describe this book, i wanted to read it, and i borrowed it and read it in one night. its that good. it makes u think about how we raise our own children, and how we treat the native americans. although the end is kinda strange, it fits the book. i would like to rewrite it, cause i like books to work out how I want them to work out. I really liked this book. the story is good, even if you don't get all the satire and symbolism. :) which i didn't get the time i read it for fun. in this book, the story and history that the characters have lived through is amazing. i recommend this book to anyone with an open mind. try to find someone around u to read it too, its fun to discuss. :) happy reading!"},{"Title":"Brave New World","review":"I really enjoyed this book.

What can be better? I've read somewhere that without experiencing the negative side of life you lose the positive one too. This book just goes to prove this point: most of these people's lives are empty and meaningless, and nothing new is created or invented... The opposite of that appears in the Indian village - filth, insufficient food clothes or medical attention, and so on, but these people can still FEEL - the romance and tragedy of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;...

This is the eighth volume in the &quot;Alphabet Friends&quot; series by Cynthia Klingle and Robert B. Noyed, where each 24-page volume is devoted to a single letter of the alphabet. The primary goal is to help beginning readers with mastering letter recognition by providing them with a fun approach to the matter. &quot;Helen at Home and the Letter H&quot; tells of a young girl named Helen who has the house to herself and spends her day keeping busy with things that usually begin with the letter &quot;h.&quot; Each page of text, which is opposite a color photograph, usually finds the words beginning with the letter &quot;h&quot; such as &quot;Helen&quot; and &quot;house&quot; highlighted and with rebus drawings above the text. However, not all of the examples of words beginning with the letter &quot;h&quot; are highlighted so eager young readers can have fun finding each and every example on their own with the help of parents or older siblings.The ultimate goal is for young readers to be able to read these books for themselves, so at the start of the book Klingel and Noyed show the difference between a capital &quot;H&quot; and a lowercase &quot;h.&quot; They also show how the letter can come at the beginning of words like &quot;hand,&quot; in the middle of words like &quot;feather,&quot; or at the end of words like &quot;fish.&quot; You will find three columns of such words in the back of the book along with Fun Facts about hair, hamsters, and horns and suggested books for this age level where young kids can go To Read More. This book is well suited to its task, even if you name is something other than Helen or even begins with a letter other than &quot;h.&quot;"},{"Title":"Information Architecture for the World Wide Web","review":"This is one of the most complete and thorough resources on the topic of Information Architecture.

Most O'Reilly books have info that you can reference when your actually working on a project - this book doesn't even prepare you for discussing the task intellegently. Granted, if this were not an O'Reilly book I would have given it 2 stars, but I have higher expectations from O'Reilly.An example of what I found incredibly frustrating about the book follows. I expected the section called &quot;Designing Elegant Navigation Systems&quot; (the last section in the chapter &quot;Designing Navigation Systems&quot;) to contain advice about what to include in the navigation system and suggestions for designing navigation systems. I got one page of babeling that included sentances like &quot;Based on the hierarchy, you will be able to select key pages (or types of pages) that shoudl be accessible from every other page on the web site.&quot; At no point to they suggest what sorts of pages should be accessible. They don't mention the ones that should be obvious: feedback, home, and search; nor do they discuss if or when it's desirable to have one link from each major subsection in the global navigation.The whole book was disapointing to me, I don't really feel that I learned much of anything on the subject. I knew nothing of the field to start with, so I feel I should have come away from any well written book on the subject with some comprehension of the field."},{"Title":"Information Architecture for the World Wide Web","review":"The book gives very detail explanation how a good web page is and presents all material in systemtic ways without include a lot of jargon.

No new information is presented and no attempt is made to systematize the knowledge. The book is best characterized as a monologue, with lots of repetitions and banalities, and no adequate final summary.It is, perhaps, of some value for the complete novice on web design, to show that web design can be dealt with rationally, but then again, the chances that novice designers have to deal with large websites is extremely low.There is therefore no reason to buy this book.I give it two stars because it is well written and not incoherent. But why it was written, I don't know."},{"Title":"Information Architecture for the World Wide Web","review":"This book was a bit too abstract for me -- a software developer -- but it may appeal to professional information architects and librarians.

The book is college textbook size and written in that dry O'Reilly-book style that makes it something you just have to slog through. So maybe I have too high of expectations or too short of an attention span, but it was a big challenge for me to make it through this whole thing. Again, I'm glad I have it on my shelf for reference though.The third edition keeps the book pretty up-to-date.

It would put an explanation (for example about labeling and navigation) then introduce a site and analyze it from that particular perspective.For someone who wants to know how information architecture works, this is a great book. But be careful.

That is why I am giving it 4 stars. However, otherwise I would have given it 3 stars for reasons mentioned before. The authors seem to drop some pearls of wisdom but do not show us the treasure trove. I suppose that is their right as professionals in the field facing potential competition from the readers. And some things in this area cannot be learned by using examples. But still, it seems like a lost chance to be a definitive popular treatment and possibly open up a long set of editions at the university level etc.I would have liked to see a longer book with more illustrations, particularly sample site structures and page designs.

Most books on web site design are really about user interface design. This book offers a top-down planning approach to getting from the recognition of a need for a web site through to the final working design. It plugs up a lot of the gaping holes that topic-specific design texts leave open.The over-riding concern and emphasis in the first section of the book is on how to organize the information on the web site in such a way that the target audience can readily get at it. To this end, the authors focus on three 'systems' that need to be developed, implemented and coordinated on a web site: a navigation system, a labeling system and a searching system. Once these systems are thought through and designed then the rest of the work becomes a matter of filling in the information content, functionalities and the bells and whistles.Clear, concise and even a bit humorous, this book will definitely give you a peace of mind if you find yourself a bit overwhelmed at times when deciding on just how you will approach building a web site."},{"Title":"Information Architecture for the World Wide Web","review":"What this book does is show you how librarians fit into 21st century. The book does very good promotion of IA itself, and shows why it's important.The first half of the book is somewhat theoretical and hard to read. However, it's really worth reading. It will explain some concepts (thesaurus, categorization,...) librarians have used for a very long time, and how to easily used them while designing web sites.The second part is where the book gets more practical and actually shows how to use IA in practice, which was, at least for me, the more interesting part. If you are in any way connected to web development, you should read this book.The entire book is exactly what it says it is - \\"Designing large-scale web sites\\". Although some concepts can be applied to smaller sites, you will hardly find resources to make use of some of the things authors talk about.There are many books on usability out there, but this one is dedicated to findability. If these terms are new to you, I recommend you read Steve Krug's \\"Don't Make Me Think\\" and Jakob Nielsen's \\"Prioritizing Web Usability\\" before reading this book.

Skeptical? So was I. But darned if they don't hit the ol' web design nail right on the ol' head. (Okay, they're not really librarians - but both authors come from a Library Science background.) When I started on my Interaction Design masters degree, there wasn't anything written sepcifically about it. So my education was based on other fields - architecture, rhetoric, psychology, graphic design. Now we're starting to see some good Interaction Design books coming from experts in those other fields.The strength of this book is its emphasis on defining a navigable structure for a site. It covers structure, navigation, searching/browsing, and this is the first book I've seen that spends a whole chapter on button and link labelling systems. It's added labelling to my ID vocabulary.I do agree with another reviewer who wanted more in-depth examples, but with enough web experience it's easy to come up with examples on our own. So I gave the book the fifth star.This and Jennifer Fleming's Web Navigation (both O'Reilly books) are must-haves for web designers."},{"Title":"Information Architecture for the World Wide Web","review":"This book can easily be divided into 2 sections. The first is an overview of how and why information is organized. The second is how to apply that information when planning and designing a large website. To the author's credit, they took a potentially dull topic and actually made it interesting. I would have appreciated less background and theory and more practical advise on how to plan a website though. There are some gems in this book, but you really have to dig to find them. Since there is really no &quot;hands on&quot; advise this is a good book to read while traveling. If your designing a large enterprise website you would be wise to read at least the second half of this book...especially if you are in management."},{"Title":"Information Architecture for the World Wide Web","review":"The basics of information architecture must be understood by anyone designing a web site. Granted, some people intuitively know these basics, but for the rest of the world, this book will introduce you. Coming to IA from the highly organized world of library science, the authors know the ins and outs of making information available in an easy to use organizational system. Obviously, anyone going into IA should read this book; it's considered a standard. It's not a bad idea to loan it to your content developers and coders, too, though. If they know a little better where you're coming from when you suggest ways to organize information and pages, they may be more receptive to your suggestions. The only drawback is that the sites used for examples are a bit dated now, and there are some innovative things being done currently with navigation that aren't covered here as a result. Get this book now, and if they come out in a year or two with a revised edition, take a look at the new examples."},{"Title":"Information Architecture for the World Wide Web","review":"What is information architecture? Actually that is a question that I never really knew until I came across this book. Information architecture (as defined by the author) is the structural design of shared information environments. It is the combination of organization, labeling, search and navigation systems within web sites and intranets. IT is also the art and science of shaping information products and experiences to support usability and findability.Does that definition make it any clearer? Maybe a little, but basically it means how to properly design the architecture of medium to large websites (kind of).Unless you're a senior developer of a large company that has a large website, or are in the process of doing so, you probably never had the first hand experience of how to set the foundation of properly displaying large amounts of data to customers.The beginning of the book the author explains the importance of Information Architects and how one can gain the experience to be one since there is really no degree or certification at this point in time. The author explains the backgrounds one may need to have to gain the necessary knowledge: journalism, library science, product management, technical writing, etc. To be an \\"AI\\", does not mean you have a computer background, it means that you have an understanding of how to use information to convey the meaning they are trying to get across to the customer. Indexing data, organizing data, structuring data are some of the tasks that are needed. It seems to me that it is one of the \\"unknown solders\\" disciplines in web development, but it is necessary for a successful site design.The book also discusses the niches of AI that are popping up recently such as:Metadata SpecialistContent ManagerDirector, User ExperienceSearch Schema Content EditorThe first part of the book focuses on the anatomy of information architecture. The author goes through many web page examples of showing how to visual information architecture. Showing each sites home page and going through categories such as navigation systems, search systems and labeling systems shows you how important small bits of information can convey a particular question to the user.The questions could be:How do I get around the site?What's important and unique about this organization?What's available on this site?How can I contact a human?What's there address?Later in the book the author describes different browser aids, search aids, content and tasks and invisible components that an AI can use to help the user get the information they need.Examples would be:Browser aids:Sitemaps, site guides, site wizards, contextual navigation systems, local navigationSearch aids:Search interface, query language, query builders, search zones, search resultsContent and tasks:Headings, embedded links, lists, sequential aids, identifiers\\"Invisible\\" components:Retrieval algorithms, categorizing data, specific vocabulariesAll of these are discussed throughout the book in an easy-to-read manner so that when you design or re-design a site you can keep these in mind if you can't afford to hire an AI yourself.A really interesting book that makes you re-think the design of your site!"},{"Title":"Information Architecture for the World Wide Web","review":"Today many Website design technologies and rigid content requirements have made Web development a more demanding task. Although there are many fine Website design books around to assist Webmasters, a return to the basics of design layout is in serious order.Information Architecture for the World Wide Web offers readers the guidance they need to design Websites that are easy to manage, navigate, and expand as mission requirements change. Rather than discussing strict HTML and Web graphics design, the authors focus upon the actual mapping out of Websites to insure that they are properly structured and will deliver content in an efficient and orderly manner.Rosenfeld and Morville outline the main job tasks of the information architect and the disciplinary background they should possess or cultivate. They cite backgrounds in library science, journalism, engineering, marketing, graphics design, and computer science as essential disciplines to be embraced. When brought together and put into practice they will perform important roles in developing an eye and mindset for successful Web development.The authors discuss important Website design considerations such as the productive use of screen real estate, navigational bars, frames, pull-down menus, and other features that can be employed to effectively deliver Website content. Although this line of instruction is not the main emphasis of the book, the brief addressing of these features assist readers to gain added perspective of the overall strategy of delivering, you guessed it, Web content!Readers are instructed to perform thorough research to determine answers to questions such as: What are the goals? What can your clients afford? Who are the intended audiences? Why will people visit a site? What types of content should and should not be part of the site? Answers to these and other questions should be determining factors throughout the entire Web development process.Readers will find the discussions involving brainstorming extremely helpful. This activity should be of major concern during the Web development process. The use of boards, flipcharts, mockups, design sketches, developing prototypes, metaphor exploration, creating scenarios, and structured blueprints can greatly enhance the entire development process.Reading this book will be for many a refreshing and stimulating experience. Readers will gain valuable behind-the-scenes insight necessary to successfully design Websites that not only look good but perform well to achieve intended goals. Good HTML, programming language scripts, and flashy Web graphics are not enough. Pick up some solid visionary thinking skills. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Information Architecture for the World Wide Web","review":"This is another example of a book I wished I'd known about a year or so ago. I'm an amateur web designer and up until just recently maintained web sites for three different volunteer groups. Now one of them has decided to get another person to run the site. If I'd known about the concepts presented in this book, I might still be running it! The book discusses how to organize the content on a wbe site and covers a lot of areas the average site designer might not consider on first glance. There's nothing more frustrating than being in the &quot;middle&quot; of a site and &quot;getting lost&quot; with no way out other than to start over. While this is an extreme example, too many sites suffer from navigational problems.This book offers choices on how to organize the information on your site, various ways to design it, the types of systems you can use to search for specific data on the site, researching and planning it (with a great outline on what you should include in your research), and the business of creating and maintaining your design. The book's authors stress the importance of keeping everyone in the process involved in it at all times, as well as pointing out that just because you finally finished it does not mean your job is over! There's always the job of keeping the site as current as possible.Anyone responsible for maintaining a site (even if it's just your own) should take a look through this book."},{"Title":"Information Architecture for the World Wide Web","review":"Overall, this book is good beginning read in the field of information architecture. For anyone interested in the topic, my recommendation would be to do additional reading. The authors provide an excellent bibliography at the end of the book which could serve as an excellent point of departure for the student of IA.As far as the readibility of the book is concerned, it is easy to read although the authors bear responsibility for poor grammar and sentence structure in certain parts of the book. It is my opinion that this doesn't make the book less valuable as a resource.A couple of other points about the book that bear mention. The authors used the example of the Henry Ford Health System Web site throughout the book. This is a great example. There are a few other examples used in the book However, I think the authors could have provided even more examples. My recommendation for the authors would be to provide the public with a second, more detailed edition. Remember this book was published in early 1998. We've come a long way since then and the web is replete with examples of good architecture.Overall: Thumbs Up!"},{"Title":"Information Architecture for the World Wide Web","review":"a DEFINATE ASSET for ANY role in website development- from the project managers, designers, to even developers- it would even be a good book for clients who want results or are working closely with the agency developing content for their site. i am going to ask my boss to buy this book for everyone at work! this book reinforces many basic website organization &quot;rules&quot; while offering many that i never thought of- all to help me have a fresh approach to organizing websites and interfaces each time i begin a new project at work. it teaches you what to look for to constantly learn while working and visiting other sites. i've been to one of louis' seminars and would also reccommend you to go to one!"},{"Title":"Information Architecture for the World Wide Web","review":"This book may be OK if you've just been put in charge of an intranet and have never used the web before. If you have spent more than a week surfing the internet in your life, you will feel, as I did, that this book states and restates the blindingly obvious ad nauseum. I actually failed to finish this book, I found it so terribly dry and unenlightening. Another thing that really bugs me about it is that the authors pose question after question, but never really supply an answer. Sometimes they make tentative suggestions that this-may-work-then, but never many good examples. They also reference screenshots of one little area of a given website, but this doesn't work because (if you believe the basic premise of the book) a website is a coherent item, not a distinct set of pages. Therefore highlighting specific elements of a website out of context is meaningless. Better spend your time surfing the web and thinking for yourself why some sites work and some don't."},{"Title":"Information Architecture for the World Wide Web","review":"Very good book that has some really good sections on IA documentation, planning navigation, and good tools for putting things to gether.

It really makes a developer start to think about how others view their website and that just because they feel it should be presented in one way, that isn't always the best method for designing the information presentation."},{"Title":"Information Architecture for the World Wide Web","review":"The book argues for web masters/designers to think more about the site and less about single pages: Navigation and terminology should be unified throughout the site, before the individual pages are detailed. If you buy this argument, you may like the book, because there are few others which stress that point. However, the advice the authors offer on how to achieve that unification is not that overwhelming - I found most of the book vague and much too long; many arguments are repeated over and over from chapter to chapter. This book makes a good point, but is not really dense with information."},{"Title":"Information Architecture for the World Wide Web","review":"Put simply, this book was my bible when designing my organization's website. It clearly explains the need for serious information analysis before even putting the first tag on your page. It also details the methodology for organizing content, layout, navigation, structure, and planning search protocols. But most importantly it gave me the tools to go into my &quot;web task force meeting&quot; (the bane of any webmaster's existence) with the tools to get everyone on the same page.

To get deeper into any of the subjects covered, the reader will have to follow it up with other resources."},{"Title":"Information Architecture for the World Wide Web","review":"This is a good book if you want to get into the field of information architecture. It covers some of the most important issues a information architect faces on a daily basis. Some of the techniques the book talked about will be very helpful for you in a diverse web team. However, this book mostly concentrates on static-content web site. More and more of the websites today are task-driven, and this book doesn't cover much, if any, on this topic. It might have something to do with the time that this book was released, since a couple of years ago, static sites were still the mainstream.Overall, it is a good book for a beginner.

Some of the concepts were simple ones that I had gained a half-understanding of myself while others were entirely new to me.Although the book describes itself as Architecture for the Web, I've also found it helpful in my day job as a programmer/analyst and a number of my screen designs and process flows have changed based on things I first discovered in this book.If you've ever wondered why people find the data on your site confusing, I'd strongly recommend reading through this book and comparing your site to their suggestions."},{"Title":"Information Architecture for the World Wide Web","review":"I found the beginning of this book to be very informative and thought provoking.

It's still about the only book that addresses the design of _information_, and it still does the job very well.O'Reilly has become justifiably famous with its user-friendly technical volumes, but this one is a bit of a departure. There isn't anything in here about how to code anything; there are no handy lists of functions or commands for easy reference. What there is is a thorough, focused but wide-ranging discussion of the issues facing someone who wants to make electronic information usable and accessible via a website.(That includes database design, by the way. There isn't all that much detail and it's in the context of making websites searchable, but there's good discussion of e.g. controlled-vocabulary terms and how users actually look for information.)The overall approach is refreshingly big-picture: the authors emphasize, for example, navigation _systems_ and labelling _systems_ (rather than just &quot;labels&quot;), and they devote an entire chapter to &quot;conceptual design.&quot; No wonder, three and a half years after its initial publication, it's still the standard reference work in a field that usually puts books out of date overnight.And no wonder Jakob Nielsen thinks well enough of it to write the foreword. If you know who Nielsen is, you probably already have this book; but since none of the information on this page credits his contribution, it can't hurt to let readers know.Ostensibly devoted to websites but generally applicable to any context in which electronic information has to be organized, this book should be somewhere on the shelf of every IT professional. If you like Steve Krug's _Don't Make Me Think!_ (as I do), you'll like this one too -- maybe better. (Krug's book is a good one to show your boss; this is a good one to read whether your boss sees it or not.)"},{"Title":"Information Architecture for the World Wide Web","review":"This is the book you need for designing large-scale web sites, where a well-planned information architecture is absolutely essential. In building effective large-scale websites, as in programming large computer applications, much work has to be done in the preliminary design stage. The early design effort of the information architecture is valuable not only in the building of the successful large web site, but for the future maintainability and revision of this web site.This classic primer is written by pioneers in information architecture and shows information architects, designers, and web site developers how to build large-scale web sites that are easy to navigate and appealing to users. To accommodate the many web site display options available today, the book also addresses how to design for multiple platforms and for mobile devices.The authors first lay the background for introducing and defining information architecture and for presenting the basic requirements to be good information architects. Information is defined as different than data, different than knowledge and information-seeking behaviors are looked into before delving further into the study of information architecture.The components of information architecture are then defined as organization systems, labeling systems, navigation systems, and searching systems. Organization systems define how we categorize information; labeling systems define how we represent information; navigation systems define how we browse or move through information; and searching systems tell us how we search information. The study of these components in designing the information architecture of our web site comprises a major part of this book.Conclusion: In designing large-scale web sites, there are a lot of complex relationships between the information involved, the expected users of the web site, the objects involved, the storage of the objects, the search or browse methods involved, and yet many more subjects. This comprehensive book purports to address all (or most all) of the elements and components of information architecture that need to be addressed in designing a large-scale website so that when the web site is completed, it is an appealing and easy to use and navigate web site that users will enjoy, complete their tasks successfully, find their desired information, and return to the site again and again."},{"Title":"Information Architecture for the World Wide Web","review":"I picked up this book because of two reasons: it's an O'Reilly book (which I think are some of the best written books on computing), and because it was thin enough to look inviting!After reading the first two chapters I was convinced that the authors were on the right track. with web development in its infancy there are no standards for development of web sites that one can go by. This book, while in no way attempting to set or define any standards, attempts to list the principles and approach that an information architect should be taking when starting out on a web design project.I found the fourth, fifth, and sixth chapters to be the very best. These chapters touch upon Navigation, Labelling, and Searching systems. The chapter on navigation systems was a relevation. Many a time navigations systems make absolutely no sense on even some of the more reputed web sites.The chapter on Navigation systems is followed by the one on Labeling Systems. The relevation that emerges from this chapter is 'Know your target audience, and be consistent!'.If I like this book, why don't I give this book 5 stars? Because I feel that because the authors do such a great job of explaing what 'Information Architecture' I was very disappointed by the lack of detailed examples in the book. There is one chapter at the end that deals with a real world example, but that is not enough. Something like the entire layout of a real world web site (or a hypothetical example even) that set out that web site's labelling system, the navigation system, the Searching system, etc.. would have made this book worth its weight in cybergold!Hence the 4 stars. But still a must read, must have."},{"Title":"Information Architecture for the World Wide Web","review":"This book presents a thorough introduction to the concept of information architecture for Websites. Written by librarians who specialize in information retrieval, this book explains why some sites are easy to navigate and others are impossible. It explains the steps necessary to plan the architecture of a Website, especially a large Website that will be created by a team of people rather than an individual. The authors suggest techniques for making clear to clients the importance of information architecture before work on the site actually begins. The book covers navigation systems and labeling systems (choosing useful names for links). It also contains a very thought-provoking chapter on search systems and factors that a Web manager should consider before choosing or building a search engine for a site. I would recommend this book to anyone in charge of planning or maintaining Websites, especially large Websites."},{"Title":"Information Architecture for the World Wide Web","review":"In \\"Part I - Intro to IA,\\" obviously the basics are covered, like what exactly is IA? What does an Information Architect do? After reading this title, I would define an Information Architect as a glorified content manager. Someone that occupies the realm between UI designer and DB engineer.Google is pretty good at finding information for us on the vast Internet, but there is a long way to go. I believe these authors make a valid point that IA will become increasingly relevant. In fact, I wouldn't doubt that in the future you will actually be able to obtain a BS in IA. Nonetheless, IA is around us everyday when we use technology no matter what we want call it.The elements that make up IA are covered in \\"Part II - Basic Principles of IA.\\" The basis of IA is the interaction or retrieval of information in terms of organization systems, labeling systems, navigation systems, search systems, thesauri, controlled vocabularies, and metadata. What this basically means is, how do we categorize our data so that it makes sense, is easy to navigate and search, and is relevant or adaptable according to our users' vocabularies.\\"Part III - Process and Methodology\\" helps one plan a path to your IA goals. For instance, developing a research management team to discuss such goals, your target audiences, functionality/deficiencies of your current IA system, and integrating other software, such as your customer management system (CMS).My favorite topic here is the detailed discussion of \\"building vocabularies.\\" This is something everybody needs to constantly perfect. An example of this is, two people can search for the same thing using two different criteria. How can can we build a vocabulary system that recognizes that?Many research tools are discussed. My favorite technique, and it's so simple, is card sorting. Get some blank cards (20-25) and write on them the headings from categories, subcategories, and content within your site. Ask a user to sort this stack of cards into piles that make sense to him and have him label those cards using post-it notes. Make sure to tell them to think-out-loud and be sure to take notes. This will give you an idea of how one would \\"travel\\" through your site, what is relevant, and what should not be on your homepage, etc.The authors take the reader through the process of the IA development cycle, from concept, to getting managers to buy-in, to the implementation and administration of the system; very thorough.The hands-on aspects of IA are explained in \\"Part IV - IA in Practice.\\" One thing I found insightful was how one could pursue an official education in the area of IA, albeit there is no such degree. To gain a competitive advantage, the authors suggest obtaining a degree in Library and Information Science (LIS) or Human-Computer Interaction (HCI).At the end of chapter 15, there is a list of position titles making up an ideal IA team.This list may prove helpful for potential readers to get a better understanding of what IA is comprised of.1) Strategy Architect - responsible for overall design goals and integration2) Thesaurus Designer - develops classification schemes, controlled vocabularies, and thesauri3) Controlled Vocabulary Manager - manages the evolution of controlled vocabularies and coordinates the indexing specialists team4) Indexing Specialist - tags content and services with controlled vocabulary metadata5) Interaction Designer - creates navigation schemes and page layouts with a focus on user interaction6) IA Software Analyst - links the IA and IT teams, focusing on ways to leverage software to create, manage, and drive the user experience7) IA Usability Engineer - focuses on intersection of usability and IA by conducting studies that isolate IA elements, such as category labels or metadata.8) Cartographer - converts patterns in content, structure, and usage into maps, guides, indexes, and other useful navigational tools.9) Search Analyst - leads the design, improvement, and ongoing analysis of search system.\\"PART V - IA in the Organization\\" was a little dry for my tastes and irrelevant to me. May be very helpful for someone in a large bureaucratic organization that wants to implement their IA concepts.The moral of the story is that \\"site builders\\" must employ multiple info retrieval methods and tightly integrate them.

I bought this book hoping to ease that struggle. What I found is for a technical person like me, this book was so useless that it has compelled me to write my first Amazon review in years.I planned to read it cover to cover. After 50 pages I realized that I haven't really read anything at all yet. So far it's been ridiculously verbose, rambling, and content-free. So I gave up and started skimming.I couldn't find much better in the remaining pages. Page after page of touchy-feely gobbledygook that has not helped me organize information at all.There are more useless diagrams in this book than I've ever seen before. For example, the term \\"synonym ring\\" is defined as a group of words with the same meaning. Does it really take a diagram with a bunch of arrows in a circle to explain that? (Figure 9-2)To explain the concept of equivalence we have another diagram: \\"A=B\\" inside a circle. (Figure 9-21) Does such a diagram really enhance anybody's understanding of the concept of equivalence? Why does this diagram even exist in the first place?Maybe some business or consultant type might get something out of this book. For a developer, run away.

But I get the feeling that these guys decided just to knock off after 150 pages. That was easier than contending with the knotty implications of all the conflicting structural imperatives that IAs deal with day in and day out.Given that the authors work at nothing but Information Architecture, I sincerely hope that they have a far greater depth of knowledge than this book conveys.Mostly, the message that rings through this brochure is: &quot;Principle x is highly valuable sometimes, but it all depends on how it interacts with principles y and z, and you'll just have to figure out what's the most important as you go along.&quot;Well, duh. Those compromises between design principles are the hard part of the job, and the authors don't provide a solid practical or theoretical framework for working through the compromise process."},{"Title":"Information Architecture for the World Wide Web","review":"Rosenfeld and Morville's book makes, perhaps, its greatest contribution by presenting its potentially intimidating subject in a way that makes it accessible to virtually any reader.

Don't get this book if you're looking for ideas for the &quot;look&quot; of the site. It doesn't offer any. Instead if gives you ideas on how to increase its functionality, efficiency, and ease of usage -- concepts many of us ignore in our excitement for spinning logos and flaming navbars. Some concepts they discussed were &quot;common sense&quot;, but many of them were not, especially when discussing how to organize everyone from the marketing dept. to the artists of a company web site and pre-launch discussion of a site before the designing begins.

I found part one on the introduction to Information Architecture a nice tutorial for the uninitiated. It basically explains what IA is and is not and talks about user needs and behaviors and various models. Part two is great for those interested in concrete methodology. Particularly good were the chapters on navigation systems and on search systems. There's some very practical information on thesauri and metadata included in chapter nine. Likewise, part three was very practical information for practitioners. It covers the phases of research, strategy, design, and documentation in detail with many practical pointers. Parts four and five, on the practice of IA and the use of IA in the organization is not very helpful for professionals - they already have the education, got their foot in the door, know IA's role in the organization, and know how to make the case for IA to management. The one exception to this assessment of sections four and five was the chapter on enterprise IA. I found it full of interesting information. The final section, on case studies, contained two very interesting examples of how IA fits into real organizations versus the fluffier content of the previous two sections. Overall, I would recommend the book in its latest version to IA practitioners, since it takes what could be a very dry subject and makes it interesting and very comprehensible. Just realize that parts of it seem to be written to web designers thinking about transitioning to IA and to students rather than IA's that are already in the trenches.

Well, it's the former (mostly). There *are* problems here - it's a tad out of date, there's rather too much low-end padding and there's little in the way of practical advice. That said, when the authors do occasionally risk dumbing up their arguments the results are worthwhile - I certainly learnt a thing or two.

And this book makes it very clear that good Web sites must be architected, not simply designed and not simply coded. It is a shame, really, that the term &quot;designer&quot; has been appended to the word &quot;Web&quot; to mean anyone who has ever written any HTML. Hogwash. The creation of great Web pages is not random and is not done by one person. This book lays out the role of the person, called the information architect, who determines the structure of a site and how the visitor to the site will reach the bits they want. Once the IA is done, visual designers, developers, and other team members can implement this architecture. The two of them, through their former company Argus Associates, and through the Argus Center for Information Architecture, have forced the Web disciplines to evolve and to confront what lack of good architecture and design creates."},{"Title":"Information Architecture for the World Wide Web","review":"This book really opened my eyes, as I haven't really thought about Information Architecture as a discipline, which is probably a natural thing for me, as I am a programmer. What I found intriguing about this book is the \\"take a step back\\" approach by the authors to analyze a business's overall strategy for user experience. This forces the product owner to ask: how should users find things on this site? What kind of things would I want to find as a user? How can the site's navigation be improved to promote easier searching? The answers to these types of questions and help your Information Architect begin to formulate on overall architecture strategy.After a good introduction to what IA is, the authors take the reader through the basic principles of this discipline. In this section, the authors discuss organization and labeling of systems, navigation, and searching. In the third section of the book, the authors go into the practice of actually implementing the principles in the previous section. Finally, the authors examine case studies from two different sites, where they examine how IA fit into the overall goal of the application.I felt this book gave me a basic understanding of what Information Architecture is, and what types of things to look out for in developing an IA strategy. I would recommend this book if you have large amounts of data you want web users to have access to."},{"Title":"Information Architecture for the World Wide Web","review":"Good 'information design' is one of the things most absent in web sites to this day.

There was a good balance between vocabulary, understanding some basic grammar like verb conjugation and past and future tense, and explanations of how French and English differ or are similar.I especially liked having a transcription booklet so that I could refer back to the lessons at home and see how the words were written and spelled.I am going on to their Flash French II set, and would recommend the first set to anyone."},{"Title":"Gene Kelly: A Life of Dance and Dreams","review":"Ugh, where to begin? As others have written before me, there are so many basic errors in this book that I wonder at the author's \\"research.\\" If he had spent more time getting the facts straight instead of pretending to know what Gene Kelly was thinking during the AFI tribute, then this book may not be the shambles we readers have had to endure. As I was reading, finding the errors actually became a game for me. I would sit there with my book and pen and paper, just daring Yudkoff to pitch out another mistake. Here are the ones I found: (I'm sure there are several others.)1. Shirley Maclaine's dress at the AFI Tribute is BLACK not RED. An error that is SO basic, it shows how careless this author is throughout the entire book.2. In For Me and My Gal, Judy Garland's character was NOT engaged to the George Murphy character. Hey Yudkoff, it would help if you saw the movies of the person about whom you're writing, don't you think???3. Again, in For Me and My Gal, the Judy Garland and Gene Kelly characters are NOT \\"immediate sensations,\\" as the author states. Sheesh.4. Yup, another one regarding For Me and My Gal: the \\"author\\" (I'm beginning to use this term more loosely) states that Gene Kelly's character is a solo act in Europe. NOT TRUE. Watch the movie you careless dolt!5. In Living in a Big Way, Yudkoff says that there is a dance with a trained dog and a dance with a statue. AHEM! They are the same dance. Yikes, this is getting embarrassing! I'm glad I'm not this author!6. Here's one of the worst: When Yudkoff refers to Vera-Ellen's character in On the Town as \\"MISS SUBWAYS!\\" Oh my gosh. Her title was \\"Miss Turnstiles.\\" Hmm..sounds like someone really needs to sit down with some of the movies before writing any more books.7. Now here's something I've never seen before in any book, using the exact same quote TWICE. On page 197 and on page 202 he uses the same GK quote in referring to the pioneering on-location film technique of On the Town. (Of course, by this time, who knows if those are even real quotes? So much has already been fabricated!)SHAME ON THE AUTHOR, THE EDITOR, and THE PUBLISHER who bought the book!!! Gene Kelly fans have waited for 20 years for an updated biography of this legendary dancer, choreographer, and director. The readers deserve better and so does Mr. Kelly himself.Other annoying things are the way the author's internal monologue Gene Kelly is having with himself at the AFI Tribute(which I gave up on and stopped reading) basically just criticizes and insults everyone. And don't even get me started on the way he keeps hinting at homosexual rumors and portrays a young Betsy Blair as this side of a nymphomaniac. Plus, the book only focuses on about half of Gene Kelly's life. Twenty years are sideswiped in a couple of paragraphs and 40-some years are glossed over in a few pages. How about giving Gene Kelly some credit for being a single widowed father who raised his two younger children who lost their mother to cancer at ages 8 and 11? How about informing your readers that this generous father turned down numerous projects so that he could provide a stable home for his children and this was when he was in his 60's? All Yudkoff cares about are the glamour days. Not a nice way to treat your subject, who you claim to admire.If you're as frustrated as I am, do what the author did, just learn what you can about Gene Kelly from the 1974 book written by Clive Hirschhorn. You get several treats in one: ACTUAL quotes from Gene Kelly and those who knew him, ACTUAL facts about the man, and a thoroughly enjoyable read.As for this book: IT IS A DISGRACE! The entire thing is written like the author is wearing a neon sign saying, \\"Hey everyone! Look at me! I'm writing a book about Gene Kelly!\\" OK! So you wrote your terrible book, now do something useful like apologize to your readers. If I was Betsy Blair, or Kerry, Timothy, or Bridget Kelly, I would sue the pants off this guy. Ugh, ugh, and again I say, UGH!"},{"Title":"Gene Kelly: A Life of Dance and Dreams","review":"Gene Kelly : A Life of Dance and Dreams is well written and researched (the errors are only minor, such as the fact that Vera-Ellen did not speak at Gene's AFI salute since she died in 1981). Despite a fantastic and thorough beginning, the book really falls short in the end when it tries to cover the years 1952-1996 in only 35 pages. The second half of Gene's life deserves at least as much time as the first half! It's like there needs to be a second volume, but this one was going to press. More info was needed on Gene's relationships with his family, especially after the emphasis on his love of family in his early life. It was apparent that the author was unable to speak to Gene's surviving family members in writing this book. Despite that, the author did a good job with the sources he did use."},{"Title":"Gene Kelly: A Life of Dance and Dreams","review":"I have my own personal barometer to indicate whether or not a book is second-rate (or worse). I start counting the typos, and when I hit \\"five,\\" I officially distrust the author/editors. I hit five by the third chapter and knew I was in for a bumpy ride. This author should have concentrated on spell-checking and fact-checking, rather than obsessing with his thinly veiled,homophobic assertions (as mentioned by another reader, his repeated reference to \\"Leo McCrary\\" nearly made me hurl the book across the room!). This really was a maddening read, and it is hardly the biography that the great Gene Kelly deserves. Makes one even sadder to ponder that Kelly's own autobiography was lost when his house burned down in the 80's. That would have been a helluva read."},{"Title":"Gene Kelly: A Life of Dance and Dreams","review":"I just bought the new bio and have to be honest: I'm disappointed, especially with the author and his technique. Although he claims he talked to many people, especially Kelly's longtime secretary (which is one good point), the author uses very few direct quotes from sources, and many of those have been previously published. Often he is vague, and makes a few claims I find completely unbelievable. And he uses a technique I find irritating- extensively ''recreating'' the subject's thoughts, or private incidents. Now, he doesn't know what Gene Kelly's thoughts were, unless he had access to a journal or diary or his autobiographical notes--which clearly he did not, because he does not cite such notes as a source. And if by chance he did, quote THOSE, don't use fiction. This is a trend in biographies, but not one that, to me, creates a believable insight into the person concerned.I don't expect to see Gene Kelly portrayed as someone without flaws, but I do expect an honest, balanced, well-researched portrait. Colleagues and friends interviewed for the 1974 biography by Clive Hirschorn, a work Yudkoff quotes frequently if selectively, were honest about his perfectionism and high standards, his competitiveness and Irish temper, and his demanding rehearsal techniques. But this author, it seems, tries to give the man flaws he didn't possess.For example, it portrays him as a kind of absentee father, vowing to spend more time with his kids and never quite managing, but his eldest daughter spoke to Hirschorn of his dedication and concern as a father even at the height of his career, and said of him, ''He wanted so desperately to be an excellent father-and he was.''Another example: Yudkoff tells a story that one night, LB Mayer asked Kelly to dance with Vivien Leigh, which he did, but that she was so drunk that Kelly asked her if they could sit out the rest of the dance. Kelly told this story differently to his biographer; for example, that Leigh asked him to dance, not the other way round. Yudkoff quotes only part of Kelly's story, without explaining that he tells the story very differently from Kelly, portraying his rude treatment of her as fairly intentional, while Kelly used the story to illustrate his awkwardness at big social functions. Nor does Yudkoff cite a source for his version. Since this incident is used to illustrate Gene Kelly's character (with some fictional recreation of his thoughts), the discrepancy is disturbing.This new bio makes a few revelations, but in the absence of direct quotes from sources, it's hard to know what is reliable. There is no real in-depth insight into his relationships or artistry. Anyway, it makes me hope his autobiography will still be published. There is definitely a place for it."},{"Title":"Gene Kelly: A Life of Dance and Dreams","review":"I'm up to page 185, and fully intend to finish the whole book, but I thought I'd look it up here at Amazon.com to see if I could learn anything about the author's credentials -- the paperback offers none -- and, also, see how other readers had felt about the book. For me, it started strong with the Pittsburgh material and New York days, the formative years of Kelly's life with which I was so unfamiliar. But the deeper I've gotten into the book, the more I've discovered such careless mistakes (see the other Reader Reviews) that I can't help but worry about the veracity in the earlier passages as well. (Incidentally, one whopper which no one else has mentioned is that Yudkoff completely reverses the production sequence of THE PIRATE and EASTER PARADE, which in turn leads to many misstatements of fact.) I was willing to tolerate the infamous AFI interior monlogues -- at least, unlike Reagan's biographer, Yudkoff didn't attempt to pass himself off as one of Kelly's dancing partners -- but by this point in the book I'm finding myself very annoyed with all the sloppy mistakes. And now, thanks to the Reader Reviews, I see that Yudkoff is going to leave me in the lurch after 1952, which is frankly infuriating. And, yes, disappointing.POSTSCRIPT: I kept on reading, and it got even worse. Yudkoff's description of the title number in SINGIN' IN THE RAIN, incredibly, is erroneous in its description. It's one thing for Yudkoff to fudge the descriptions of the dances in LIVING IN A BIG WAY, an obscure -- though not IMPOSSIBLE to view -- Kelly movie, but to blow the facts on his most famous number in his most famous film...!"},{"Title":"Gene Kelly: A Life of Dance and Dreams","review":"I don't know why I'm writing a review since I agree with most everybody's comments, but perhaps I can help you decide if this book is for you. First off, this book is both good and bad. Good because it is the first book to be written about Gene Kelly in quite a while, but bad because the author uses techniques and makes little mistakes that weaken his work. Many readers complain that Yudkoff pretends to know what Gene was thinking during certain points. Indeed, Yudkoff does use a technique that makes the book more of a novel than a strict biography. For instance, he doesn't use the &quot;In 1940, this happened. Later that same year, this happened. In early 1941 he did this.&quot; Yudkoff creates conversations that he has no knowledge of actually occuring but I believe he did this to make the biography more readable and enjoyable. Some parts I disagreed with, but I can see why he uses this approach. One thing that hurts Yudkoff's work is his fact checking. For instance, Gene Kelly was quoted as saying that Fred Astaire retired after his wife's death. This was not true, Astaire retired years before his wife passed away. What is true is that Gene Kelly was wrong when he said this. However, if the author had done any research and doublechecked sources, he could have added a note something like &quot;although Gene said this, it was not true that Fred retired because of his wife's death&quot; or something along those lines. Its not a major mistake but I think it shows that Yudkoff may not have researched his topic thoroughly. In another instance, Yudkoff states that Frank Sinatra, a friend and costar of Gene's, almost intentionally angered studio head Louis B. Mayer so he would be fired and able to make &quot;From Here To Eternity&quot;. The truth is that Sinatra was fired and didn't make &quot;Eternity&quot; until a year or two later, the film hadn't even been mentioned at the time he was released from MGM. I'm sure that Gene Kelly knew this and its another example of the author not knowing his subject well enough. Good biographers are able to tell you about the lives of people close to their subject, as both Fred Astaire and Frank Sinatra were to Gene Kelly. Like I said, the fact that Yudkoff doesn't know these things shows a lack of research. Yudkoff also doesn't provide notes, which I always appreciate in a biography. It lets the reader know what sources were checked, who said what, etc. For instance, if unsure about a quote you can check the notes and see if it came from a close friend, acquaintance, or a different biographer. The good side, as mentioned earlier, is that this is the first biography of legendary song and dance man Gene Kelly to come out in a long time. Kelly's life is interesting not only for films but also for his time in history. He was a committed liberal and during the times of McCarthy this could prove a liability. Though this was an interesting period, it was only one part of Kelly's life. Unfortunately, Yudkoff barely talks about his later life. There is not even a mention of Gene's third child being born. I would have appreciated more detail on Kelly's very happy second marriage, but Yudkoff barely gives any.In conclusion, this biography does leave a lot to be desired. It is by no means a definitive book. However, its a decent introduction to Kelly and is the most commercially available bio on him. I recommend that you read it with an open mind, try to corroborate with other books, and if you can find Clive Hirschhorn's excellent biography of Gene Kelly. Its hard to find, but its more fulfilling and accurate than this."},{"Title":"Gene Kelly: A Life of Dance and Dreams","review":"The author tries, but fails, to adequately tell Gene Kelly's life story. There are so few materials on the life and career of Kelly that this book was eagerly anticipated by his fans. Unfortnately, this one doesn't make the grade. In his &quot;novel&quot; approach, the author attempts to crawl inside Kelly's mind as he sits watching the American Film Institute Awards in the 1980s. He thinks Kelly's thoughts and presents them to readers, as though he inhabits a secret corner of the choreographer/dancer's mind and is literally giving us &quot;the inside scoop&quot; on how Kelly felt about his life, career, and relationships. He also invites himself into closed door sessions (where he couldn't possibly have known what was being said between Kelly and Mayer, Kelly and Betsy Blair, Kelly and Jeanne Coyne, Kelly and Donen, etc.). The result is half novel/half biography, all failure. When the author finally does climb out of Kelly's mind back into the reality of the dancer's life, he doesn't get all of his facts straight. In one instance he reports that Vera Ellen saluted Kelly at the American Film Institute Awards. If so, she did it from the netherworld. Ellen had been dead for several years by the time of the AFI awards.For some odd reason writers have a hard time writing about Kelly and doing it well. Perhaps it is because Kelly's life is devoid of serious scandel; there is nothing scurrilous on which to hang juicy rumors. Let's hope, then, that Kelly's widow, Pat Ward, will soon release the biography that Kelly, himself, was working on the last few years of his life. Then we'll REALLY know what Kelly was thinking, and not have to rely upon second-hand Kelly-think."},{"Title":"Gene Kelly: A Life of Dance and Dreams","review":"This is a postscript to my review titled &quot;The Book Who Couldn't Dance.&quot; For me, the last straw comes on Page 218, when Yudkoff botches his description of the &quot;Singin' in the Rain&quot; number. It's one thing for Yudkoff to botch the numbers in LIVING IN A BIG WAY, which after all is a fairly obscure film -- though NOT impossible to view -- but to botch the most famous Kelly number in SINGIN' IN THE RAIN, the most famous Kelly film of all time?! Well, how can you trust ANYTHING in the book after that?"},{"Title":"Gene Kelly: A Life of Dance and Dreams","review":"I'm currently only up to page 175, and for the first time in recent memory, I'm giving up on a book. I've wasted way too much time on this piece of utter garbage. I have to thank the other knowledgeable and discerning reviewers here on Amazon for making me realize that there's just no point in continuing with this thing.From what I've actually managed to get through, it's clear that Yudkoff is many things, but, first and foremost, he's a bad writer. No, strike that: He's a horrible writer. One thing I've always felt is important with biographies is accuracy. Not Yudkoff. He seems to value contradictions and poor research. How poor? I just read the section about HUAC, and he expressed great disdain for director Leo McCarey. He had several paragraphs about him, and mentioned his name numerous times. Now, if you're going to mention someone over and over in your book, one would think that you would at least research him enough to get his name right. Yudkoff calls him Leo McCrary.The inaccuracies aren't the worst part of the book, by far. Yudkoff seems to be a Communist sympathizer, and that viewpoint is one of the main thrusts of his book. A couple years ago, I read Myrna Loy's autobiography. She was one of those who let her politics run her life, instead of the other way around, and every opinion, encounter and experience was tinged/tainted by her political view. She seemed to have a desire to bed every man in Hollywood, but only if they were a \\"good Democrat.\\" As awash with politics as her book was, though, it pales in comparison to the hammer and sickle-waving contempt for all things right of Lennin found here. Combined with the glaring inaccuracies (not to mention the outright libel in some passages--Yudkoff takes courage from Cary Grant being in the grave to state his rumored homosexuality as fact), it's impossible to take this book seriously, and nearly impossible to take it at all.One thing that's essential when reading a biography is trust: you have to be able to trust the author and his account of the person's life, otherwise it's a wasted effort. Very little of what Yudkoff writes--outside of direct quotes (and even those are suspect based on his glaringly poor fact-checking)--can be accepted as fact. This book was clearly written with an agenda, but unfortunately, that agenda doesn't seem to include an accurate retelling of Kelly's life. Avoid this like the bird flu."},{"Title":"Gene Kelly: A Life of Dance and Dreams","review":"Dear lord! Does this man have no shame? How can he possibly know what THE MAN was thinking in all those intimate moments in his life. Only once in a while he writes &quot;must have felt&quot; or &quot;possibly he felt like&quot; but for the rest Alvin Yudkoff just plain froces his own opinions into the book. That is, to say the least, HORRIBLY ANOYING! And this isn't the only bad part of this book. To make it a true catastrophy he doesn't even bother with the last half of Gene Kelly's life. AND he uses Clive Hirschhorn's work as a safety to keep his own afloat. What a rip-off! Alvy, Dear, how do you sleep at night? I can't belive anyone claiming to be someones fan could write so carelessly about this person's life. You just can't do this to people. Ladies and gentlemen, I very VERY strongly advise you to stay far away from this terrible waste of perfectly good paper. And if you really insist on reading it, just go to a librarie it's definetly not worth the purshase price. P.S.: I would not have given this book any stars but I had to put one to post my review. Just pretend its not there."},{"Title":"Gene Kelly: A Life of Dance and Dreams","review":"OK, I've been reading this book for a week now and I'm enjoying it so far. Yes there are some mistakes, but I've read all of the other books about Gene and there are mistakes in all of them. While it's true that Yudkoff did not talk to many people who knew Kelly, this book was written in 1999 and many if not most eye witnesses were dead or close to it. The one glaring mistake is that of having Vera Ellen at his AFI tribute. She died that year and never ever went to awards. She became a recluse for some reason. I do like the way the book covers more than just what happened, but also the emotions and back stories. Yudkoff did have Lois Mcclelland's diary for some of the inside intrigue for later in the book. Lois was a constant in Gene's life from 45 to the early to mid 90s. No one knew him better.This is just a beginning review and I'll finish when I finish the book."},{"Title":"Gene Kelly: A Life of Dance and Dreams","review":"I totally agree with K. Cooley's review. I'm halfway through reading the bio and glad I borrowed it and didn't buy it. His \\"poetic license\\" usage is absurd. He should have written a novel with GK as main character. To brazenly write supposed thoughts of Gene Kelly is ridiculous. How could anybody say this is a great or even good bio of the man? I might look for the Hirschhorn book and get some factual information on this talented guy, Gene Kelly. I doubt I would ever read another book written by Alvin Yudoff."},{"Title":"Gene Kelly: A Life of Dance and Dreams","review":"Whatever factual errors there may or may not be in Alvin Yudkoff's book about Gene Kelly, Yudkoff is a far more engaging writer than Clive Hirschhorn. There's no contest between the two. Hirschhorn is, to put it charitably, at best, a pedestrian journeyman as a prose stylist and storyteller. Yudkoff writes with a seasoned observer's eye, with nuance of language and detail, and with a practiced dramatist's sense of narrative. Hirschhorn's book on Gene Kelly is by comparison an amateurishly written, earnest bore. Please."},{"Title":"Gene Kelly: A Life of Dance and Dreams","review":"...did I see Gene Kelly's final feature film appearance, though it took me over thirty years to work up the nerve to actually watch it. (Like many people at the time of its release, I opted to put my money into the soundtrack album, which featured ELO at the height of their popularity, if not necessarily Jeff Lynne's creative powers.) As expected, the film was a waste of film for the most part, and Gene Kelly's phoned-in acting did nothing to elevate it. But within this mass of mediocrity was one shining moment when Gene, clearly in command of the situation--he did the choreography--does a few turns with his final screen dance partner, Olivia Newton John. As a grace note to wrap a great entertainment career, it's quite pleasing.Having watched this, and remembering all I'd seen of Gene Kelly over the years prior, I decided to read up on him. Gene Kelly: A Life of Dance and Dreams is the book I picked up and read, over a couple of months, from beginning to end, and quite enjoyed as my first and so far only exploration into his life and career. At first I was bemused by the fanciful cynicism of the AFI sequences, but they didn't strike me as farfetched, as who wouldn't feel jaded by such affairs after a while? They certainly didn't detract or clash with the straight biographical material, which was especially rich and satisfying concerning Gene's early life and formative career. In my view this book did a fine job of telling who this man was, where he came from, and what sort of stuff he was made of.I was also satisfied with the coverage of his primary career, from the first tentative stage successes to the pinnacle of his cinematic achievements, though it sometimes struck me that he was fighting against so many strong currents that it was a wonder he had any energy left to perform. As for Betsy Blair, his first wife, her place in the narrative was larger than I felt it needed to be; she was important in his private life, but figured little in the life of Gene Kelly the entertainer. The author tries to build her up as a serious stumbling block to Gene's prospects in then-conservative Hollywood (and I'd be the last to stipulate that she wasn't), but the case he presents at some erratic length is not convincing.And then there's that barebones overview of everything after Singin' In The Rain. The author gives some attention to Gene's television work, but less than I, who grew up appreciating Gene mainly for that work, would have liked. And while I was relieved that he mentions What A Way To Go!--the only time I saw Gene Kelly on the screen in first release--the elisions were coming hard and fast by then.And so, back to Xanadu. It gets a mention, and in most respects I hardly blame the author for wanting to dispose of it as quickly as possible, but he does so at the expense of ignoring that grace note I mentioned. It just doesn't do to give short shrift to the last dance by a great artist in the medium he loved best."},{"Title":"Gene Kelly: A Life of Dance and Dreams","review":"This is a rather strange little tome that succeeds almost in spite of itself. It has the cheap look and feel of an eighth grade history textbook. It is not especially well-written, and it contains many, many factual errors. But, it nevertheless turns out to be a fairly interesting read -- especially once Gene hits the big-time on Broadway and in Hollywood. (The first -- and dullest -- part of the book contains way too much detail about Gene's life and times running his chain of dance studios in Pittsburgh, PA, and the surrounding 'burghs. This part may be of some regional interest to those from the Pittsburgh area, but otherwise: &quot;Forget it.&quot;) In any event, the author takes the high road throughout, focusing almost exclusively on Gene's many professional successes (and, of course, a few major failures) as he climbed the ladder to 1940s and 1950s superstardom. A bit more information about Gene's family life, particularly his first wife, actress Betsy Blair (who was blacklisted as a Commie sympathizer during the Red scares of the '50s, and had to leave the United States to find work -- which this book doesn't mention, by the way) and his three children, might have added some additional interest. But it would also appear Gene may have had a few . . . ummmmm . . . pecadillos (concerning his attraction to &quot;barely legal&quot; young ladies -- one of whom he married when he was over thirty and she was just 18) that are best left to the imagination, so the author's discretion in terms of Gene's personal life is undoubtedly justified. Anyway, this is not a bad book for what is it, and it may come in handy as a ready-reference the next time &quot;For Me and My Gal,&quot; &quot;Cover Girl,&quot; &quot;An American in Paris,&quot; &quot;Singin' in the Rain,&quot; &quot;Brigadoon,&quot; and many other film's graced by Gene's one-of-kind talent appears on TV."},{"Title":"Gene Kelly: A Life of Dance and Dreams","review":"The most startling thing about this book is that it actually got published. It would be an understatement to say Alvin Yudkoff is not a legitimate biographer. It's been a few months since I read this book but I seem to recall that there were little to no primary sources. The bulk of the book is Yudkoff's use of quotes from other written sources which undermines Yudkoff credibilty as a real biographer.The author hangs his tenuous narrative on what he imagines Gene Kelly is thinking as he sits through his AFI tribute. Yudkoff, in turn, takes enormous license. These \\"memories\\" are the basis to go back in time to begin the history of Kelly's life. Yudkoff never acknowledges that his narrative is anything but fact. Kelly comes across as a bitter and negative man if we're to believe the imaginary narrative the author has created. Yudkoff refers to Kelly's dislike of Cary Grant. The only reason this might be, Yudkoff tells us, is because Grant questioned the validity of Kelly's relationship with his first wife, Betsy Blair. This is never backed-up with a passage or quote from anyone. Is Yudkoff now claiming the same capability with Grant, that he can read his mind as well?Reading this book I found myself asking: what is it that Alvin Yudkoff may have in common with John Keats? Oh yes, one thing, they both wrote when they were on opiates. Too bad Yudkoff didn't share any of Keats genius for writing.And as many have mentioned before, the author truncates the book by just dropping most of the narrative about Kelly's life after his second wife Jeanne Coyne died. A half-written life is not worth reading. Better to read Betsy Blair's biography. Both husband and wife come across as two fascinating human beings."},{"Title":"Gene Kelly: A Life of Dance and Dreams","review":"The amazing life, incredible talent, and legend of Gene Kelly deserve better than the sour and amateurish treatment received in this work of biography slash fiction. Whether it's the condescending image of an aging and embittered has-been that the author tries to spoon feed us in his presumptuous narration of Kelly's thoughts during the AFI's Lifetime Achievement Awards ceremony or the total lack of heart and detail given to the last half of Kelly's life, this book is a one star tribute to a talentless writer and an inept editor. It is certainly not an unbiased, in-depth biography of Gene Kelly's life and personality. At the very least, the book should have been more aptly subtitled, \\"The Childhood and Glory Days of.\\" The achievements of Kelly's post SITR and AAIP years, his family life and the selfless devotion to his young children after the death of his beloved wife, Jeanne Coyne are curiously ignored as the author spins us through the last four decades of Kelly's life in a rapid-fire and depressing mix of debatably failed artistic endeavors, severed professional relationships, and disillusionment. Hardly a fitting or realistic summation of the incredibly full life, charm, and joie de vivre of one of the twentieth century's greatest and most interesting talents.
