After book 5 I felt there was a drop off in the quality and direction of the story. I was even disappointed with books 8,9, and 10. But recently I decided to reread the entire series and I found out that if read straight through this is a Helluva story. I mean the writing is truly incredible. Because of the scope of the story I found that the wait between books was a definite cause of my discontent. There was simply too much to remember after waiting a year or two for the next book in the series.I beleive that for those who truly appreciated the first 4 to 6 books but felt Jordan was loosing his touch after that, try reading the entire series. Read all 10 books as one continuous story and do not pay attention to each individual volume. I beleive you'll come away with a new appreciation for what Jordan has created."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I must agree with seveal reviews I have already read, that Robert Jordan may just be writing now to fill his bank account, but at the same time, the way he writes is not all action and thins blowing up. This, is a book only for thoes that can follow plot after plot after plot, and have atleast a basic understanding of political intregue and hidden meaning. Quite frankly, most of his readers, in order to understand all of his works you have to read into everything like a Cairhienan. Most of this book and the one before it has been for &quot;Set up purposes&quot; to arange where things will be going. Yes, you should read into what the people you've never heard of before are doing. If you can not follow where all of the information is going, like following 1000 lines to 10000 different points, than perhaps this is just a filler book for you."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I AGREE WITH THE REVIEWS OF THIS BOOK,BUT I HAVE READ AND RE READ THE OTHERS AND AM AND STILL AM A FOLLOWER OF THE WHEEL OF TIME SERIES...WHAT CHOICE DO I HAVE...OH YOU CAN SAY I WILL NOT BUY THE NEXT..BUT YOU WILL HAVE TO ...AND THE HOPES THAT IT AT LEAST WILL BE BETTER..AND MABE EVEN END..I WOULD HOPE THAT IT ENDS AFTER THIS FILLER MATERIAL..I CLASSIFY THIS BOOK 10 MERELY AS THE MOST FILLER MATERIAL I VE EVER READ..HOW MANY WAY S CAN YOU DESCRIBE A BLACK BURNT SHRIVELED UGLY DISGUSTING ASH LADEN,ECT..ECT...BUT IT DID FULFILL THE NEED FOR SOMETHING..MABE THE CONTRACT WAS SO MANY BOOKS UNDER A DEADLINE OR SOMEHTING..BUT ITS OBVIOUS THIS WAS A BOOK THAT WAS FORCED FROM THE AUTHOR AND DID NOT PLEASANTLY ROLL OFF THE TIPS OF THE FINGERS ONTO THE KEYBOARD..SO WITH HIGH HOPES I KNOW THE NEXT ONE WILL BE BETTER!!

Even though it annoyed me by wrapping up virtually nothing, things still happened, maybe you morons were just so confused by the # of characters and subplots that you just didn't notice.(If you have not read this book skip over this next 2 paragraphs because I reveal some plot elements)Matt falls in love with the daughter of the nine moons and courts her(though he probably would not admit it even to himself), matt is trying to avoid seanchan detection, a band of seanchan goes in search of tuons kidnapper, perrin finds the Aiel that have falon, perrin throws away his axe, Aes sedai with perrin begin visiting masema without his permission,perrin trys to figure out how to get her out(a blacksmith's puzzle), he could of course get her out simply by traveling into the camp and leaving a \\"gaishain\\" ashaman to find her, but it seems that perrin will not use this method (he hasn't even thought of it) but will use a method that gets rid of all his problems at once (they are all part of the same puzzle), rand had been resting from clensing the source and decides that he needs to make a truce with the sean chan, and many more events that I wont even get into. Most importantly the shadow seems to be growing in power: Weevils are everywhere, so harbor is haunted with ghosts, Aes Sedai cannot get rid of weavils, and other events.also as others have said, this book is setup for the next one. The shadow is growing stronger. matt's and perrin's pathes appear to be moving towards each other(yes perrin is sitting still but his blacksmith's puzzle involves the seanchan. Rand has freed himself from the seanchn or soon will with his truce and will be able to concentrate on other matters. The tower is cut off from food by egweenes work with cuendialar chains, which means the conflict between the two towers must soon progress. egweene herself is captured which means there will be fresh new plots there as well.This book is wonderfull, with all is detail characterizations and sublots, so if you morons who dislike WOT's complexity and think nothing happened (even though things did)don't bother writing a review saying this book sucks nothing happens, that has been said so just give it one star and move on, you obviously are not intelligent enough to be reading a complex involved series like WOT."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"The title of this new book continuing the WOT series is very appropriate: not only are the characters coming to a turning point in the epic's development, but it seems many of the readers are also.I'm not going to lie, I had a hard time making it through this book. It *is* filled with such detail on sub-plots and supporting characters that it justifies re-reading the series (3rd time). Just because it's not all focused on the main plot does not mean you are justified in trashing Robert Jordan. Get real folks-- this is an EPIC and the story of the beginning/end of an Era of Time in a Fantasy world takes just as much work and development of the sub-plots and many supporting characters as does the main plot. Assuming that any readers of this review are Fantasy fans, you must have read Tolkien (or at least seen the movies). The unfortunate truth for those who were bored by this book (and for those who found themselves nodding off during LOTR) is that epic stories don't happen in one thrilling burst. They are epic because they encompass entire worlds. Accusing Jordan of losing his mind or his abilities as a writer is ridiculous; you may as well say Tolkien wasted his time.You want the short and skinny &quot;to the point&quot; WOT? Here:Dude has to save the world. His friends help out and so do a bunch of other people. There are battles and stuff. Someone wins.And while you happily go on with your narrow view of the world and of fantasy, I will eagerly await the next volume."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I was on the hardback trail of this seriers, and I managed to stop reading. Well, while looking around a Borders one day, I noticed CoT there in Paperback, figured I would give it another shot. I got this book on 1/16/2004, it is now 2/2/2004 and I haven't finished it yet. May not sound bad except for the fact that when I *love* a book, it can be finished in just a few nights. Hell, I remember getting one of Eddings books for Christmas one year and ended up spedning the entire afternoon and night reading and finishing it! CoT has put me to sleep several times already!I'm just about to start Chapeter 17, about 3/4 of the way through. Now, consider the fact that RAND HAS NOT SHOWN UP IN THE BOOK YET!!!!If you had got out of this series, don't make the mistake of giving it another shot, Jordan is probably going to drag this out long enough that he will reach the end of a long and prosperous writing career before he finishes this story off.If you haven't already, go read David and Leigh Eddings' books."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I must confess that I didn't even bother to finish book 10 in the Wheel of Time series. I decided to delay buying this book until I had a really long airplane trip that would allow me to make use of Jordan's dense style and high wordcount. It turned out I couldn't even make it past the first twenty pages. Let me remind you: me and a big book stuck in an airplane for eight hours with nothing else to do. The book is that boring. Do you want to know what I read instead? The Duty Free Catalog. Yes, the Duty Free Catalog.Jordan's work has gotten progressively worse over the years. Four (or was it five?) books ago, I thought to myself &quot;the only way to protest this blatant fleecing of the fans is to refrain from buying the books&quot; but, back then, I still enjoyed them enough that I couldn't resist buying the latest installment as soon as possible. I didn't have that problem with this book: I didn't buy it until just before Xmas (paperback edition)and even then I was doubtful. I decided that instead of me serving Robert Jordan's financial interests, his book would have to serve me. Hence, the wait for the long airplane trip. I figured if nothing else I'd at least be entertained for the eight hours of the plane trip and that should be worth the cost of the paperback. After all, I'd have to read SOMEthing. But the book doesn't even meet that measly requirement. It's just so dull. I'm not planning to buy any more RJ books.To all those who think Jordan is just an incompetent writer, I must beg to differ. We're all agreed that the first book in the series was fantastic. That proves he has the ability. He is just trying to take advantage of the fans' pocketbooks by padding the series infinitely. I don't mind a long story but this sort of padding does not add to the story. Does Jordan honestly think I am willing to pay him to bore me? Is he aware that when I talk about this book it is only to cite him as an author to avoid?My advice to others: Avoid Robert Jordan. If you must read this series then wait until he finishes it in a decade or so, and then check your local garbage bins, where hundreds of disgruntled onetime Wheel of Time fans will have thrown the entire series in disgust. To help yourself resist buying these awful books, try the hilarious Series of Unfortunate Events, by Lemony Snicket, in which each installment is a complete story."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This book is the worst installment of a series that has rapidly made me lose interest. I have absolutely no interest in a never ending story. When I was over halfway through this book, it suddenly struck me that absolutely NOTHING had happened so far in the book. It hadn't even progressed to where the LAST book ended! With most of the book behind me, all I had read about was a bunch of characters THINKING about what they MIGHT DO NEXT!I have no interest in reading any more books in this series. I've invested enough time in them to want to know how it ends, but I'll probably just wait till they're done (probably never) and just read somebody's synopsis of what happends. Jordan's writing, which I used to enjoy, now seems tired and jaded to me. I do NOT need to be reminded several times in every book how every little device in the WOT universe works, but this seems to be Jordan's favorite way of overcoming writer's block. Every time one of his characters has a thought or an emotion, I feel like I've seen it a million times before. Sometimes, I can predict how entire pages of dialogue will progress.Reading the Wheel of Time is like WORK to me now. I do not enjoy it, and I do not recommend it."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"OK, I admit that I truely enjoyed the first 4 books of this series. Then books 5-7 slowed down, but were still good books that advanced the overall plot. However the last 3 books have been terrible. Each one is over 500 pages and yet the entire plot advancement is on 20 pages scattered through out the book.I am also holding TOR responsible for stealing several hours of my time that I will never get back. Evidently TOR does not use editors at all on Robert Jordan's books. I can not imagine how any editor thought that a book with more pages devoted to describing the temperature of spiced wine, than pages devoted to actual plot development was a good idea. How can you defend writing entire pages describing in painfully exact detail the jewelry, clothing(right down to the quality of material), hair color, hair style, even the foot wear of some Aiel Wiseone who speaks 2 sentences in the entire book.So now I am left with a question regarding R. Jordan. Is this book so slow and overly discriptive because ,,,,A. R.J. is trying to milk it for every penny he can so he needs to drag it out as long as people are still buying the books.B. R.J. is so impressed with his ability to spend 2 pages describing the color a dog's hair that he feels the need to share that with everyone (I call this Stephen King Syndrome)C. R.J. has lost the plot line and is now trying to cover that up by adding hundreds of pages of nothing.Please, do yourself a favor and do not buy this book."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I really enjoyed the series and was wildly excited for the 8th and 9th book. The Path of Daggers diappointed me since it took forever just to do a few items. The plot is slowing.I ordered the 10th book hoping that the plot would start moving. Unfornunately, this last book was the worst of all. The characters appear weak and Rand has just about stopped doing anything.The best part was the beginning with Mat and that just left the reader hanging.The worst thing is that 3 months after I read the book, I could not remember if I had read the book or anything about it. If a book is not memorable, it is a failure.I think if the next book comes out,I will not waste my money, but buy it used in the forlone hope that the editor is doing his job to tighten the plot and advance the action of the book."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Yet again, Jordan has proven to his fan base that he is filling a contract with a publisher and not caring about the content of his books. And, we the fans (a.k.a. the lemmings) have fallen into the trap of buying a book because of what it possibly could be, only to realize we have wasted our money on a book with nothing redeeming about it. Face it Jordan, you are no Tolkien.COT is a mirror of it's predessors. A book with over 600 pages of words that amount to basically nothing. And only about 50 or so pages at the end of the book that are actual story. These are so obviously placed to wet our appetitie and make us eagerly await and eventually purchase the next volume in this story. (Something I plan to NOT do)If one were to take this book apart, removing the drivel which is meaningless and only keep the neccesary parts which pertain to the over all plot, you'd have a novel no bigger than a comic book. Which as we all know wouldn't make any money or make Jordan's publishers happy. Instead Jordan delivers excedingly more nonsense than content. Making sure he reaches his word quota to appease the publishing gods.I truely believe that Jordan has lost track of the overall scope of this epic, lost control of the world, and is writing books for the money rather than the enjoyment and entertainment of his diminishing fan base. There is no way he can conclude this series in two more books (as was previously thought). He keeps stretching the story into so many different directions. Just when you think things are starting to come together, they do a 180 degree turn, and lead us further away from the original plot of the story.Don't waste your money on this book, borrow it from a friend (after consoling them for their foolish purchase) or get it from the library if you really want to subject yourself to a mind numbing experience. (Unless you have Insomnia, then this may be a good cure.)Jordan will have to do quite a bit to redeem himself in the eyes of his fan base after the insulting novels he has published over the last few installments of the Wheel of Time."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"The only reason I still read this series is out of reverence for the greatness of the first three books in the series.It is quite simply a labor of love to read them. I don't enjoy doing it, but I feel like I owe it to the characters to check up on them.Well this 10th book has erased that feeling. The characters I loved are dead. RJ killed them. He smothered them in banal descriptions, trite quasi-emotions and hackneyed repetitive dialogue.I am no longer interested in what happens to them. Good books are about who feels the pain. Those are the characters that grab a reader. The character that is MOST effected by events...that most hurts is usually the most compelling.Which is why the best part of CoT was reading the reviews. That is where the hurt is. The people feeling the pain are the readers--not the characters."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Now that I have read the book and have been utterly disappointed, I now wish I should have just waited and borrowed the book from the bloody library.I was a very die hard Jordan fan, but now I just feel that Jordan is squeezing as much money as he can from us with this series!All you die hard Jordan fans will disagree, but imagine waiting every two years since the beginning and end up reading this bloody balony of a book!Half of this book happened before the end of Winter's Heart! What's that about? He should have included that in that book instead!And about the great endings of the WOT books. What ending! There was no great ending!Cmon Jordan! Get your act together!

Jordan has with the publisher. If you want a book, which can spend hundreds of pages with characters walking around, mumbling innanities to themselves and others, and frankly NOTHING hapening, well, you will undoubtedly enjoy this book.

I rate them slightly below The Hobbit/LOR, equal to The Foundation series and perhaps a bit better than the Shannara books.Six and seven were a drop off, but still highly enjoyable. There was still a reasonable standard of quality.Books eight, nine and ten are simply terrible. If not for the fame the first seven books garnered for this author, I am not sure they would have been published. This is a Frank Herbert \\"Cousin of the Hairdresser of Dune\\" type plunge motivated almost entirely by money. Why finish the series if the books are still selling?If not for copyright issues, the author probably would introduce \\"Conan the Barbarian\\" as the Lord Dragon's long lost cousin just to keep the series going.

The darn index needs to be bigger so I can actually remember who these characters are and where they are going or why they are doing what they are doing. How many new plot lines can the man throw into a book and still keep loyal readers interested? Do we really need new major characters in this series? Please, for the love of Pete, wrap it up already!

However, if I have to endure too may more chapters filled with descriptions of the &quot;stout Two Rivers Wool&quot; Nynaeve wears in Telarhanriod, I may just throw in the towell.

Faile tries to find a way to escape, knowing that if she does not do so soon, Perrin may die trying to free her. Egwene's army besieges the White Tower itself, the heart of Aes Sedai power. Rand al'Thor has cleansed Saidin and the repercussions are felt far and wide, by every channeler in the world.And it's all boring, with all of these plots flowing along at a glacial pace. This book is so thoroughly crammed with fluff and filler that it will strain the patience of even the most seasoned reader. Robert Jordan's biggest flaw as a writer has always been his somewhat droning prose, giving too much detail in most places and not enough in a few others, meaning that the Wheel of Time has always been a series that had to be read with patience, the prose a chore to get through in order to digest the considerable, deep, rewarding story behind it all, but this book takes it to its outmost extreme. I did a lot of skimming reading this book, to get through it faster, and I found that I missed nothing of importance and enjoyed the book quite a bit more than if I had tried to process every word. Jordan demonstrates his technical skill, from fleshing out every character to detailing every leaf on every tree, but the problem is that he bores the reader with all this pointless detail. Do I really need to know what some chap in Tarabon is doing when he has no relation to the main story whatsoever? Why are all of these characters taking away from characters like Rand, Mat, Elayne, and the rest that I'm most interested in?In truth, this is more of a transition book than anything. Jordan has never made the individual books of the Wheel of Time their own stories and never meant to. The Wheel of Time is one gargantuan, plus four million word novel, told in segments, so absurdly vast that it outlived its author and requires another author to take up the keyboard to finish it. This is the book that suffers the most, because it and Winter's Heart were really more like one book, and if the fluff had been cut out from both of them, they could have been.But, that's the nature of the Wheel of Time. In terms of the epic scope, the awesome characters (particularly Rand and Mat), the incredibly detailed and genius magic system, and the very good technical quality of the prose, it is undoubtedly one of the best fantasy series ever written. Unfortunately, it requires immense patience and only rewards readers after a very looooooong time, rewarding in the end, but it will try the endurance of any perspective reader, which I've lately found to be a rather common thing with epics of this size. However, I fully intend to stick around to the end of this series, and now that the Transition Book of Twilight is over, I have my hopes that the action will pick up before the end.The bottom line: CoT is well-written but hopelessly bogged down, a classic transition book, but certainly not a terrible book by any means. I think the majority of the vitriol directed at it, as the +1,000 one star reviews attest to, is that at this point, people are tired of waiting and aren't so willing to put up with this kind of crap any further without protest. I, for one, tighten my patience and press on.Ten books down, and the Wheel keeps turning. Bring on the (former) penultimate book of the Wheel of Time!"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"What in He$#fire is this!!!??I though Robert J. was an excellent writer with a great imagination, I did anyway, until I read the 10th book.This book is a failure, 1-9 were amazing, and they actually had some good fight and battle scenes, but #10 is just a lot of describing womens clothes, and almost all of it is detailing Elayne trying to gain the lion throne, which is not what anyone wants. We want Rand and Mat, and maybe Perrin.The only parts worth reading are the characters who can channel feeling the blazing beacon, the effects from Rand attempting to cleanse the taint from saidin, and how they all react to it.This book really just somehow sucks, after 9 amazing, fast-paced ones. I hope this book was just a set-up for the finale or the 11th book or something."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"K, the book stunk. Everyone with a brain, or at least any taste and reason agrees.To the people who are enchanted with this droning series, good for you! I'm glad you have found something you like. Some people like women's golf, too.Me, I am one of those people that will probably read the series until the end. This book and the two before it were terrible, and Robert Jordan will have to live with that at the end of his career, but I am excited to see how it ends.To those who ask why we fans (or ex-fans) continue to read this, it's because we are hooked, and we want to believe that Robert will finally repent of his sins and restore the series back to its original wonder. If he ever does, I want to be there. Everyone knows that the first six books were a wonder, and that if the series had kept up its pace of awe and intrigue, this would be the best series in fantasy to date.However, the reviews are right about the endless descriptions, braid-tugging nonsense, and lack of plot. There is no point in defending it by pretending it's higher-minded, political, dramatic, or anything other than boring. It's not a conspiracy to make money - RJ already has lots of money. It's just bad judgement on the part of him and his editor.Please, Robert, restore this series to the heights from which it has descended. You have all the setup you could possibly want. Turn the key and set things in motion! I honestly don't care if the series goes on for 50 more books, and I don't want some hack and slash thrill coaster. But by the Light, please stop disappointing your fans that love you, destroying the series that made you, and ruining your own wonderful career with this droning, pointless nothing. Bring it back!"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I read a few chapters at the bookstore I feel insulted and robbed by this whole series. Don't do it. Enough is enough. By book eight I was hoping for ten books. By book nine I knew Jordan was stringing a decology into a dodecology or more. I refuse to read this one. Maybe when the final volume comes out, I'll backtrack and read them all. But I can't take another thousand pages of characters wandering in circles followed by a two year wait and another thousand pages of nothing happening.

Through disbelief, or fear, we will probably never know. The back-cover has only 3 short, one-liner reviews. That's saying something. To be completely impartial, I enjoyed Jordan's style for the first 50 pages or so, although the fact that there is no action in the entire book made me relegate it to the proverbial dusty shelf.Do yourself a favour. Read something serious instead."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Ok, the Wheel of Time started out with constant surprise, action, and a growing understanding and wonder of Jordan's world that grew as the characters did. This book was a complete lead in to his next book. The story line has gotten huge, and he barely touches on each of the subplots, or even the main plots! I had to read over 500 pages before Rand even got a chapter, and then he didn't do anything. You could easily skip reading this book, and book 11 will probably still make sense to you. Let's cut down on the clothing detail a little Mr. Jordan, and start kicking some Forsaken @ss again..."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I have struggled through this book only because of stubborness and determination. It goes nowhere, addresses nothing, has no action and resolves nothing! For slow reading and lack of interest, I would definitely rate it a 5.I will wait for the reviews before I buy another book in this series. Perhaps it would be best to save your money and not buy Crossroads. Just skip to Book 11 (assuming that it is somewhat better)."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Robert Jordan has accomplished something no other writer has ever done before - turned me off of a series before I finished it. It no longer matters to me if there are 2 more books, 5 more, or 100 more. I have kicked the habit!A phone book has fewer characters to keep straight and a more interesting plot."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Reading these reviews is more rewarding than reading CoT. At least you'll get a laugh out of them. With an average of 1 and a half star out of 1538 reviews it needs to be clear that this book should not be bought but, as many put it, be gotten from a public library. That is if you still wish to read it.What I found more surprising than CoT being such a work of tedius, boring and unimaginative writing is that there are so many &quot;fans&quot; who, while apparently suffering from delusions, cannot seem to admit to themselves that RJ is either milking their favorite series or that he just lost the art he displayed in the first three books. But besides claiming that his writing is more than brilliant or something along those lines (which is fine with me although I couldn't agree less) they start to insult those that do not share their opinion about the book. Some even claim that all those one star reviewers lack insight, intelligence and (this one had me almost rolling on the floor) are not old enough to read the mature writing of RJ. It is also striking that most of those apparent delusional types can not seem to write a decent word of english as they lack not only in spelling but even in grammar. And most of them are native english speakers who should have been taught this at school. So to all of you out there thinking that RJ still has the talent he displayed at first and who are insulting those who did not like this book, &quot;Please, wake and grow up.&quot;And if you truly wish to read something more adult then read George Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire series starting with A Game of Thrones, it being part one.Marc"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Many other reviews here have stated that nothing really happens in this book. Admittedly it does move rather slow and doesn't entirely live up to previous books in the series. I did get the impression that his publisher locked him in a hotel room and wedged a chair under the door until he finished this book. It's as if the author wasn't entirely sure how to wrap the massive number of plot lines he's developed so that the series can end with the quality we've come to expect from Jordan. And while I'm cognizant of the fact this series has been written over the span of a decade, my biggest grievance with this book is that he methodically reintroduces almost every character and plot line from the perspective of someone just starting the series with this book. Ten books into the series and felt as if I'd been talked down to like some forgetful child that must be reminded that all these things will be important soon, or as if this book was instead one giant Prologue summing up the entire series to date. This might not have been quite so bad for me except that I had just re-read the entire series in anticipation of book eleven and so this book became doubly tiresome."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Mr. Jordan your story has become unfortunate. The Crossroads of Twilight was the worst book that I've ever read and I regret beginning what was once a fascinating story.

Lets talk about helping Mr. Jordan. My advice? MAKE... SOMETHING... HAPPEN!!!! PLEEEASE!! For the love of God, if I have to wade through another novel where absolutely nothing exciting happens, I'm just going to start writing my own Wheel of Time novels. I think I'll start by reducing the number of proper names in the book from, like, A BILLION, to a more manageable number like, say, six. And I'll give them easy names like Bob or Mary. Oh, and I'll also remember to make the names vastly different instead of having three characters named Bob, Baub, And Borb. I swear, I spent the whole novel just trying to remember who the hell everyone was because the last one I read was during the Carter administration. Seriously, the first six books, were awesome, but I'm starting to wonder if even Robert knows where this series is going. After &quot;Crossroads&quot; I'm guessing no where."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"OK, we get it.

And it happens in excruciating detail."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I've never read a 600+ page book where nothing happens. Literally nothing. At the end of this book you are essentially where you were at the end of book 9. I have no clue as to what the point of this book was. I can only assume that Jordan has either run out of ideas, or he is simply writing for the money now. The early books in this series were so good, and so promising...they have really taken a turn for the wrose. Hes still a better than average fantasy writer, but hes going to loose alot of readers if he doesnt turn it around soon.To me though, even more frustrating than the lack of events in the book, is the pitiful glossary....which wouldnt be a problem if he didnt have 200 or so characters you need to keep track of, many of whom have similar names. He seems bound and determined to introduce every aes sedai in existance into the books, as well as every minor and major noble. How the heck are we supposed to keep all these people straight? I eventually gave up trying and just tried to finish the damn book.I hope that what alot of people here are saying is true, that this is merely a setup, and that events will start happening again...because if he turns out any more drivel like this, theres not going to be anyone around to read books 30-40 when some events might actually occur.As a last word of advice, check this book out from the library if you must, dont give him any money for writing drivel like this, he doesnt deserve it with this effort. Lets just hope future efforts can redeem him."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This book is like a cruel joke. After finally moving the novel along in book 9, Mr. Jordan reverses course and writes the most worthless book in the series. The first 70 pages is devoted to new groups that readers could care less about, and the next 600 or so don't bring this novel any closer to an end. Nobody does anything. The entier novel is written only to set up the next book. As slow as everyone has moved in this book, I think its covered about 6 months with the last 4 years of novels, Mr Jordan actually has the nerve to start the story with each group, about 4 days prior to the end of book 9. It would be nice to know that after reading this series for almost 8 years that we were finally getting close to the conclusion. I wouldn't by this book unless you need paper to start a fire with."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Some of the novels in WoT series have been excellent. Others seem not only to lack pace, but to lack any plot development. Sadly CoT falls into the latter category. This came as a geat disappointment following on the heals of installment #9, which seemed to regain some of the momementum lost in the previous novels. One wonders if Jordan must pause to figure out where things are all going, and while he does so, churns out lemons like CoT?"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Book 9 was fantastic because stuff happened. Book 10 is still fantastic, although not as much happened in this book, but then it was a bit short. Still, we got to see lots more of Mat and Tuon than before, and for those who like Perrin and Faile, they were in it too. Even Elaida (where has she been for the past four books?) was in it.

I have read every book that has been written in this series. I anxiously await the arrival of the next book. I recomend this book to anyone who loves fantasy fiction, tales of heroes, ordinary people that become transformed. I was enthralled and I am sure that you will be as well.

I love it how Robert Jordan uses so many characters. I hope he keeps introducing new characters all the way through the last book. Do you think the main characters will just conveniently stop running into new people every day because the last battle is coming? They are not monks. Should Robert Jordan just empty the streets of Randland and make it one big ghost town because some people are whining about too many characters? I'm also hoping he takes the series to 14-15 books because just 2 more wouldn't be enough. I don't want it to end! All these negative reviewers have \\"Wheel of Time rage\\" and, like road rage, they go insane and froth at the mouth just because they have to wait at a red light.

Have some vision, and some faith that Robert Jordan has a plan. Plots need to be set in place and characters in the correct locations, for the storyline to go forward. No, this wasn't the most exciting of his books, but there clearly is a direction. Be patient and enjoy the calm before the storm.

These are his characters, so trust him to treat them properly! He has reached a moment of intense resolution and clarification of many subtle plot lines; in my opinion, the story needed &quot;Crossroads of Twilight&quot; to slow down the frantic forward pace of action, and become richer. Amazing."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"To be perfectly honest, the responses to this book so far are absolutely comical. A large number of \\"layman reviewers\\" say the same things: that they previously thought Jordan was the dominant figure of modern fantasy, and that now he has somehow lost his gift or gone senile or \\"sold out\\" as it were. The sheer volume of geriatric whining that has gone on here about Crossroads of Twilight illustrates with perfect clarity why these people are on the internet complaining instead of on the road fulfilling book signing engagements.COT is preparation. An education in chess would help the lot of you significantly. If the end has been determined-meaning you know the goal that has to be accomplished and have rightly calculated the events that have to transpire in a particular order for the goal to be reached (you want to take the king, but the king is directly defended by his queen and 1 pawn, which are in turn defended by a bishop, which is serving to block the necessary rank and file angles you require to achieve victory. Therefore, you remove the defenders in a specific order then apply irresistble pressure to the king. If you rush this process, if you do not complete the necessary preparation of your offensive, when you go to make it happen, youll soon find yourself on the receiving end of a lot of pain) then the final sequence of events have to be set up exactly right or the whole structure is going to fall apart like the plot of a sci fi channel movie.COT again is preparation. Jordan is moving the pieces, subtly, into their necessary positions. The final sequence of attacks will not begin until it is time. The only person on earth who knows how all this is going to end is Robert Jordan. The only person on Earth who knows how to make it all come to pass is Robert Jordan. The comedic part of all this criticism is that we can see with great clarity why powerful writers succeed, and incompetent writers make themselves into critics, and that is the presence or lack of an eye for subtlety and also like the chess master the ability to see not one or two moves ahead, but through deep calculation to see the entire game through from its current point.The bottom line is this: 1> Dear critics, when your next book is published, send it to Mr. Jordan and im sure hell be glad to send back a written review of it. 2> You are clearly not capable of the subtle and deep thought required to create an entire universe and plot its origins, its present, and its great future events to come in such a way that it all comes together with clear resolution. Otherwise you'd be doing it, and we'd be buying your books. Leave the deep art to the adults.I have complete faith that an author as skillful as Mr. Jordan will not have suddenly in the course of one novel lost his ability to write. I havent heard any reports of him having a stroke or forgetting English, so to expect such a leopard to suddenly change his spots is ridiculous. Jordan is making preparations and he is doing it for a particular reason. Your inability to see what those preparations are for and your infantile cries of \\"I want the good part now!\\" are absolutely laughable. Have some patience and let the man finishing crafting his work. It's ridiculous to start a judging fair on a work of art that still wont be completed for another three years...its not DONE.So stop being so bloody pretentious, assume a little humility, and show proper respect by allowing Robert Jordan to make HIS book series HIS way.And RJ, those who understand the craft have little doubt that you will continue to hold their imaginations in your hand until the last letter is written."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I'm going to have to jump on the bandwagon here.

It looks to me like he's aiming to replace Bill Gates in Fortune 4000.I started reading the series almost ten years ago, and the first six books were incredible. I cared about the characters, I cared what happened to them (although most of the women in the series were always annoying beyond belief!), now I wish the Dark One would just wipe everyone off of the face of that world and be done with.Another thing is, what's with all that clothing descriptions? I'm a woman, and it's beyond my comprehension how anybody can be this obsessed with clothes! Who is writing this book, for crickey, Dolce and Gabana?When it comes down to Crossroads, I started by reading the prologue, then skimming lines by chapter one and then skipping pages by chapter three. I pretty much deep sixed the whole thing. It's a shame that an author forced me to do that!Finally, I am completely disgusted with the series, with the characters and with Robert Jordan. He should go and take a long jump off of a short pier. That should give him something to write about, since he's obviously been brain dead for the past few years."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Robert Jordan is a pedantic writer -- and I don't mean that as a compliment either. For those of you who aren't sure what &quot;pedantic&quot; means, it simply defines an author who likes to hear himself talk a bit too much and who has a tendancy to write about the most technical details, no matter how trivial they may be (i.e. buttons, the style of lace on a dress, how weak the tea is, etc.), repeatedly; over and over again.As other reviewers have pointed out, you'll find tons of pedantic writing in this series but &quot;Crossroads of Twilight&quot; seems almost flagrantly done. In fact, the plot advancement hits such a snail-like, glacial pace I actually began to picture the book with legs, bifocals, and a long white beard brushing it's knobby knees as it painfully shuffles along with a cane. Considering the age of this series (over ten years now) I'm probably not far off the mark with that analogy.I'm not going to rehash what everyone else has stated about this horrible piece of fiction besides the fact that it's a waste of money since nothing at all happens. Matt's still fleeing the Seanchan, Perrin's still chasing the Shaido for Faile, Egwene still hasn't united the White Tower, yada yada. Needless to say, if a book can only garner 1 1/2 stars after almost 2000 reviews here then it's probably a good bet the readers know what they're talking about.But after mulling over how angry this book actually made me (I DO NOT like being fleeced or taken advantage of) I did come up with a great suggestion. As an alternative to investing any more money into this series I suggest disgruntled readers looking for a little justice buy one of these excellant writing books below instead (most are cheaper than Jordan's books anyway, especially if you buy hardcovers):-- &quot;The Elements of Style (4th Edition)&quot; by William Strunk Jr. and E.B. White-- &quot;Self-Editing for Fiction Writers&quot; by Renni Browne and Dave King-- &quot;The First Five Pages: A Writer's Guide to Staying Out of the Rejection Pile&quot; by Noah Lukeman-- &quot;Beginnings, Middles &amp; Ends (Elements of Fiction Writing)&quot; by Nancy KressOr any of the following books by James N. Frey:-- &quot;How to Write a Damn Good Novel : A Step-by-Step No Nonsense Guide to Dramatic Storytelling&quot;-- &quot;How To Write A Damn Good Novel, II : Advanced Techniques For Dramatic Storytelling&quot;-- &quot;The Key: How to Write Damn Good Fiction Using the Power of Myth&quot;Then wrap it up -- you don't have to get fancy, using a generic brown paper bag from the grocery store and some cheap packaging tape will do. Include a note of explaination to Robert if you wish. My note was exceptionally nasty but, as I said before, I do not like being fleeced for my hard earned money or taken advantage of. Now go down to the post office and send it to:Robert Jordanc/o Tor Books175 Fifth AvenueNew York NY 10010I think if RJ gets enough of these types of packages in the mail he'll eventually get the hint. Let's not forget though that he IS pedantic, so it might take a little while to sink in. However, once it does maybe he'll finally return th the style of writing that made this series amazing and epic. Who knows! He might even give one or two to his Editor/Wife Harriet who is obviously in need of a refresher course on how to effectively weild that red marker of hers.Meanwhile, you can curl up with a good series by an author who actually cares about his fans like:A SONG OF ICE AND FIRE SERIES by George R. R. Martin-- A Game of Thrones (Book 1)-- A Clash of Kings (Book 2)-- A Storm of Swords (Book 3)-- A Feast of Crows (Book 4)and... THE DRAGONCROWN WAR CYCLE by Michael A. Stackpole-- The Dark Glory War (Prequel)-- Fortress Draconis (Book 1)-- When Dragons Rage (Book 2)-- The Grand Crusade (Book 3)Martin has been recommended by many Jordan fans here and I agree he's an amazing author. You can't go wrong with one of his books. However, many people don't even know Stackpole's amazing series exists. I really hope he starts getting the recognition he deserves for such a wonderful trilogy.Whatever you do, DO NOT line Robert Jordan's pockets any more. Get this book from your local library."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"...but probably dangerous for insomniacs who have depressive or sociopathic tendencies, as most people would probably rather kill themselves or even better, kill Robert Jordan after reading only a few pages.I bought this book just before I embarked on a 21 hour plane journey thinking to myself, &quot;Okay, Robert Jordan. Book 9 was boring but come on, it's book ten...maybe this is the last one? And anyway, since I never really take in books that I read on planes, it won't be any great loss because it's only Robert Jordan.&quot;However! I started to read it and was immediately introduced to some fifty new sub plots involving some guys I had never heard of (and didn't care about). It's possible that these were continuations of threads started in previous books, but none of it rang a bell. I figured I'd just skip a few pages to get to something more interesting. About 50 to 100 pages in, I found a section with Matt in it and thought 'A-ha! Matt's always good for a laugh'. But no, Matt was as dull as dishwater as well.I then skipped another 200-300 pages and started reading again. It was some section involving 50 Aes Sedai that I may or may not have heard of before, and I definitely didn't care if they all died in horrible torment or lived happily ever after. I think Robert Jordan must have never had a successful relationship with a woman (be it a lover or his mother), as he certainly has no idea how men and women interact.So I skipped another 500 pages, hoping that one of the last couple of chapters would involve something interesting happening. It's possible that something may have happened somewhere in the book, but god, I really didn't care anymore.When I finally arrived at my destination, the first thing I did was burn the book. Yes, book burning is evil, but god, I couldn't have lived with my conscience if I was in any way responsible for someone else reading any part of that book.Without a doubt, the worst book I have ever read (but does it count as having read it when the most I could bear to read was about 20 pages?)"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I really didn't care much for the first several books in the series, as I found Jordan's tendency to \\"borrow\\" from other authors disgusting. Moiraine, Perrin, Thom, and Elayne seemed a lot like Polgara, Durnik, Belgarath, and C'Nedra from David Edding's series, and the Aiel are straight out of Dune. But that's not too uncommon in this genre. How many 14 y.o. farm boys turn out to be kings with super powers? Lots. Too many. What really annoyed me was that around book 7 this series stopped being even remotely interesting. That's right, the last several were stinkers. Not just this one. And each time, some fan cries \\"setup!\\" or \\"you're just not a good reader\\" or some such drivel to excuse Jordan's poor writing. These are the same readers who are continually surprised by the endings of Scooby-Doo cartoons. This is not setup or brilliant writing. It is garbage. One reviewer even likened the detail to script-writing for a movie and another wrote that anyone annoyed by 800+ pages of writing just didn't know good stuff when they saw it. ... This series was bad from book 7 on, and it cannot be redeemed. Want to know how it ends? As for the bad guys, the remaining Forsaken that DON'T finally die by balefire will one day realized that if THEY are loyal only to themselves, kill randomly and cruelly, and live only for themselves, then the DARK ONE (lame name) will probably do the same to them once he's free. Didn't that little fact occur to them at some point in the last several thousand years? Ane the heroes? Mat loses an eye, Moiraine is rescued, Rand sacrifices himself to save the world, and no one cares because they stopped reading long ago."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Thank God I didn't buy this one.

He has sold his sci-fi writing soul to Tor, but has lost his fans in the process.There is nothing in this book. Nothing. Crap. Crap. Crap.Goodbye, Mr. Jordan. I no longer care how you end this story.

I started Jordan's series years and years ago and gobbled up his huge books in record time, eagerly awaiting each new installment. Now it is apparent he is merely dragging the story out for financial reasons, and it is a shame because this series will be his legacy. It has brought him fame and fortune, and if he allows it to drown in unnecessary verbiage future generations will not even begin reading it; they'll be forewarned and forearmed.

I noticed that my bullet points became fewer and fewer over the last couple books, until I only had 2-3 for Book 9, and for Book 10: nothing.Not one single solitary thing of any significance happened in this book, except for the fact that I don't have my money anymore.Time for a boycott - WAIT before you buy. Read the reviews of Book 11 (customer/fan reviews on Amazon, not media whores) and if it's the same as this, don't buy it.

Alas, no such luck! Mat's dice in his head would fall out for lack of action. Let me start with the good point - it is a wonderful (wonderfully long) prologue to the next book. Lots of descriptions and insight. Having said that, the reader will still find the innumerable subplots, the unnecessarily similar names, and little or no action. There were steps taken but nothing towards any kind of sub-conclusion as in previous books.

That trend has reached its pinacle in this book. Want to know how it ends? Exactly as it started. The plot is not advanced even a little. All of the exciting plot points that have been hinted at in all of the previous books were hinted at again, but not developed any further. This is litterally this case this time, reviews panned book 9 for &quot;not enough happend&quot; but at least something happend. In this book nothing did. If you skipped this book completely and just read the next one you wouldn't have missed a thing.So, save your money. If you must re-read book 9, remind youself how frustratingly slow that book was. Take note of how little actually happend in the story. Notice once more how the orignial book's three or four main characters has been expanded to a host of who-cares? extras.If after doing that you still must read this book, goto your local library and read this for free.

Mr Jordan - do you take your fans for MUGS? In the pages of Crossroads of Twilight you wittered on and on about your seventeen thousand characters and plots within subplots, without making the slightest bit of plot progession or significant differences to the story at all! No wonder you predict another two or three books before you finish the series if this is the pace you have set for yourself. Clearly someone is trying to cash in on your success and it is insulting to have to wait for two years to eventually buy a book you have been dying to read, only to find you are skipping pages to find something remotely interesting in its content. As a fan I am insulted that you think you can get away with it. Had a less established writer published such literary junk it wouldn't have been published let alone reached the best seller lists internationally. Now I have to wait for the next two years (or so) to trot down to my local library (as I do not intend wasting any more money on you now too-long series) to see what happens in the next two days of the convuluted world that ios now the Wheel of Time. Can we start winding this up soon? Lets get Rand to the Last Battle, have a big war with the Power, and find out what pseudo-pilosophical lesson you are all trying to teach us about history repeating itself, the nature of good and evil and so on. You can then sit on your laurels content that after 11 or 12 books you have perhaps the longest fantasy series on record and maybe you can salvage some dignity (and a fan-base of sorts) by winding the epic up before it becomes duller than leaflet on Haemorrhoids.

It will be about 3/4's of the book. So when book 11 comes out you can then review this volume in about 45 minutes.And let's get real, this is all about money. How much is Jordan getting per book? How much have I sunk into this series already? (Hint: I have a first addition hardcover of book 2, and have bought hard cover copies of each book since.) But this book is ridiculous.Just get on with the story already!Jordan has it in him, and I hope he's as frustrated as we are (I doubt it though, we write the checks, he receives them.) He can obviously write a fast moving, engaging, full length book, but this delving into the personal thoughts, dress, and customs of characters 3 levels (or more) below the main characters is boring, tedious, and a shameless abusing of loyal fans.This latest book is boring, confusing, and introduces you to hundreds of people NO ONE can keep straight anymore. (Jordan's story plot program must have a file in the gigabytes by now. (Is this what computers have brought us to, novels so complex even the author can't possibly keep it straight without a computer program to help?)) I find myself just skimming over pages with meaningless characters having conversations with each other over trivial matters. Has TOR assigned staff writers to just pick a minor character, develop it, and write dialog for it? Are there 15 staff writers all submitting their meaningless drivel and the editor just publishing it all knowing we are stupid enough to buy it, in hardcover?!If you must, buy this book now, but I'd wait a month or two, this one will end up in the \\"bargain book bin\\" very quickly."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"And I though that some of the previous books were slow!

Each of the first three books matched all four of the last books combined for content. The story was quick and constantly moving; the characters fresh interesting.Then Robert Jordan started to infuse the story with far too boring detail, and far too many trivial and useless characters that detract from the big story he wants to tell. Too many enemies (way too many enemies); too many strong characters stewing but never doing. Too many Aes Sedai; too many Aes Sedai with similar names. In general just too much!Elayne wants her mother's throne. Her mother who we are supposed to believe was a stern and well-respected ruler is hardly more than a cowering girl. Tar Valon is split. Once formidable Aes Sedai are weak and useless bickering children. Is Elayne the strongest? Nynaeve? Egwene? But of course don't let the men think...We've all learned throughout the 10 books we've read that men can't be allowed to think! They are just not capable of intellegence.Lets face it, Rand is supposed to be the hero that conquers all that is evil. Not one character in the whole 10 stinking books gives him any respect, or acknowledges his power other than the Forsaken and long, long ago, Moiraine.I say for any character that thinks Rand is wool-brained to get off the fence and fight the last battle without him. Wait, that wouldn't leave anybody.Robert Jordan can keep writing until they nail his coffin shut; Robert Jordan seems to have nailed the Wheel of Time shut in a coffin already.At least for me.What a pity.See you in Westeros.(Please don't make the same mistakes George R.

Many of the characters were difficult to recall, and I found myself constantly referring to the glossary or previous books in the series in a desperate search for clues. Who is this Aes Sedai again? What is their relationship with Egwene - friend or foe? Who was this character? Why are they important? Are they important?It all proved too much for me, and I was beginning to suspect that Robert Jordan might not live to finish the series, so I quit. Ten books into the series, I decided I was out, and I wouldn't buy another book until the end was nigh.So several months ago, with A MEMORY OF LIGHT (completed by Brandon Sanderson) on its way to bookshelves across the nation, I endeavored to start again from the beginning, and read every book in the series consecutively. The idea was that reading the books back to back (to back to back to back) would iron out the confusionSo now that I've read the first 10 books in the series, I can positively tell the me from 2004 that it's not his fault. Even reading the books consecutively, it's difficult to remember all the characters and their relationships. The monster has grown too huge for Jordan to handle, and so inevitably we get books such as CROSSROADS OF TWILIGHT, in which all 822 mass-market paperback pages are setup. The book doesn't end with a battle, there's no climax in the final pages, all the steps to move the plot forward are incremental.It's.All.Setup.I don't want to include any plot spoilers, but if you've read the previous book in the series, WINTER'S HEART, I'd like you to think back to that book and consider what plot lines you'd like to see wrapped up. I can tell you right now, they don't.The bad guys all seem to have disappeared, so that the most frightening foe in this book seems to be the town where people are seeing ghosts. That and, as others have pointed out, the weevils that get into the food.I wish Jordan could have managed his plots a little better so that some major development takes place in each book. Either Rand should have killed a Forsaken or the Aes Sedai struggle should have been resolved or Perrin's search for his wife should have come to a conclusion. Heck, I'd have settled for something big in the Mat plotline.But none of those plots are resolved and as a result, we got 800 pages of filler.It's no wonder I was so confused in 2004, and it's no wonder I stopped reading.I'm about to start on KNIFE OF DREAMS, the last book Jordan published before his death. I hope it's great. I hope Jordan's final book is as strong as EYE OF THE WORLD was, and Brandon Sanderson brings the series home with a bang.I'm tired of the filler.

I wanted to give the author the benefit of the doubt, but it's really a waste of time. I don't think that tempting the reader with a small glint of hope that something might happen by the end of the book is fair, and the only good thing that I can say about the installment is that I got it at the used book store instead of at the retailer. I'm happy I didn't pay full price for it, but I regret having used the time to read it rather than just going to the forums for the summary. I'm crossing my fingers that the remainder of the series will be more exciting than this - after more than 10 years of waiting to see how it all ends and re-reading many of the books in the series, book 10 was a bummer.

The first few books lay out a truly inventive plot, with interesting characters, and a pace that really pulls you forward.

This particular volume is so completely content-free that I didn't even bother to finish it. It's clear that I could skip this book, and I would not miss a thing in the overall plotline. Nothing of importance happens here - except that Jordan and his publisher get another $40 from me.I can only guess that Jordan views this series as a &quot;career&quot;, rather than one of several works in his lifetime. It's the only excuse I can fathom that would explain this soapish pap. I guess he's having too much fun pontificating at FantasyCons to ever consider writing an ENDING to this story.

Just to put this book's unwieldiness into perspective: the Prologue was 100 pages long!In 1988, Robert Jordan caused a stir in the Fantasy/Sci-Fi world with the publication of The Eye of The World. A big, bold swords-and-sorcery quest which promised a messiah study -- what happens when the shepherd's son discovers he is the foretold savior of the world? And books 1-5 offered great payoffs: development of the main character (Rand) from disbelieving yahoo to a maturing young man who embraces and accepts his identity, with strong subplots involving his exiled friends from his small hometown who had their own destinies to fulfill in the backdrop of the battle of good vs. evil.In book 6, the series stalled a bit before an explosive ending that promised more violent changes to a fractured and confused world. But book seven began the downward spiral by adding new characters and sub-sub plots to what was a 3500-page epic at that point. Book 8 was worse: a waste of about 98% of the paper it was printed on. Book 9 provided some hope that the series would get back on track as Rand took a more active role.But this epic squanders the momentum. Instead, for the first 550 pages it offers basically a day-in-the-life update of the major characters' plot points without any advancement of the story. For the last 250 pages it offers slight movement on two subplots and nothing on what should be the main theme: the preparation of the messiah figure for the ultimate battle of good and evil. Take out the minutiae of Jordan's descriptions of various ladies' dresses and the men-understand-nothing/women-are-incomprehensible thoughts of the various characters and you have a 300-page book where nothing happens. It's a Seinfeld episode in large book form.The Wheel of Time series has now become a tragic tale of authorial self-indulgence and overreach. After book 5 the NY Times said that Jordan had begun to redefine the genre that Tolkien made famous -- a claim that is quoted in the inside cover of book 10. But five books and 10 years after that praise, Jordan's effort is merely an overwrought melodrama with little new, and few surprises, leaving the mantle of best modern fantasy writer for others to claim."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"... utter, contemptable trash.

An ant hill is a high point in the flat wasteland that is the WoT. His character takes a suprising turn in this book... \\"suprising\\" equating to clumsy. You'd think that after 9 books, Jordan could have eased Perrin into this attitude adjustment a little better. Like all the emotions and attitudes of the characters in this series, it just comes off as fake. I hardly call this \\"character development\\".There really isn't much of Rand. Not much of a loss. Afterall, there really isn't much of a book here either.As far as the rest... it's just Jordan playing around with all the loose ends again... bringing nothing to conclusion. It's obvious that now all he's trying to do in each book is drop a few more tidbits in for his *ahem* fans (I swear, these people make trekkies look sane) to debate over. \\"Oh gee... saidar seems to be failing. My o' my... what ever could this mean?\\", exclaims the ever-obssesive-jordanite-who-really-should-get-out-more-or-at-least-try-reading-other-books.Jordan should just turn WoT into a comic book. It's obvious he wants to keep writing this horrid series until his demise, and at least in a comic book format he could drag it out as long as he likes. Of course, he can't charge 21 bucks a pop for a comic book. And also, he'd have to churn 'em out pretty regularly... something obviously beyond his meager abilities.Nothing I say is going to influence most of the hardcore fanatics out there anyway.

I cant say that anything happened at all in this book. Instead of one great story, it now seems like youre reading a few separate stories that go nowhere. Jordan spends a few chapters on each, then just kind of ends the novel in some random place. I believe that Jordan has it in him to continue writing books like he did at the beginning of the series, Im just beginning to wonder if he wants to. This book was like one giant prologue. Just a bunch of filler. And I have to agree, he brought in way to many characters that have nothing to do with the main story. Way to many names to remember.

Now, utterly divorced from context and original meaning, it's endlessly repeated by Jordan's publisher to suggest that Jordan's terminal endgame of tedium is better than Tolkien, which anyone with two brain cells to rub together knows is not the case. I bet some of the early reviews (from about a decade ago) of Jordan's early books were just as kind. No longer.This book is awful. It doesn't even stand up to middle-tier fare, let alone something written by Tolkien or George R. R. Martin. When Jackson cast Tolkien's work to film, he created some of the most spectacular epic films Hollywood has yet produced. If he were forced to do the same to Jordan's works, even he wouldn't be able to do much more than end up with 'Mona Lisa Smile' and the occasional scene fretting over spoiled grain shipments.

ANYTHING!Sometimes I read Crossroads of Twilight, but only very late at night when I can't get to sleep. I am up to page 278. Currently I am reading four pages each night, after which I feel mentally exhausted by the intellectually-crippling tedium of the proceedings that I immediately fall asleep.I used to listen to lectures on media law when I wanted to sleep, but now I have Crossroads of Twilight."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"oh my god, this is like watching an industrial press pump out the same thing the same thing the same thing the same thing the same thing the same thing the same thing.Like most readers, loved the first 6 books. Actually the first 9. Yes, i even enjoyed Winter's Heart, I liked the atmosphere and it had a good ending (for me). But book 10, nup. This was no good.One of the problems with lord of the rings was that its female characters were unrealistic and to a large degree had no part and no power as individuals. Clearly RJ is out on a mission to redress this. But it has gone to a point where it is not only unrealistic it is just tedious, repetative and stupid.I am just so sick of Robert Jordan in page after page, chapter after chapter, book after book, telling me that men are idiots and women are hahaha beautiful but *scratches head* frustrating creatures and uh oh! my wonderful wife is throwing a plate at my head! I'd better duck and pretend that I can't believe it!! Je-sus. Okay Robert, okay. We understand, women are wonderful, lovely things that always, ALWAYS know best, men are useless brainless idiots who never learn that women know best (god bless women. Uh oh! Another plate! tee hee hee!! Gosh women are strange! If only I wasn't a male maggot I could work out what the f*&$ I've done with my life!! perhaps my wife can help by setting me some chores and a good rap over the head with a wooden spoon!! tee hee!)Ten books of this crap. Ten books of us reading about women yelling at men that they are useless fools and men reacting with frustration that is really doe-eyed love. Women sniffing, tugging their braids, slapping men for being so stupid and men wondering what they can do to make women happier. Ten books' worth of interviews with RJ upon being asked why all his women characters are so obnoxious and him replying that it is just easier around the house to be a submissive little church-mouse, you get more out of her or some such self-defeating disempowering childish crud.It's not funny. It's not cute. You might find it delightful, Robert, to write thousands of pages about adolescent girls and middle aged women keeping the supposed Messiah on a leash. But your readers find it self-indulgent and stupid. Enough already. It had novelty value at first. It was perhaps sort of amusing for one or even four books, but for christ's sake do something different already (like end the damn thing)."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I'm still trying to find a character in this series that I really like. I can't say that it would be any of the main characters, since they all behave in such a reprehensible manner. How can Aes Sedai live so long and yet never progress beyond the mentality of a pubescent-plagued insecure whining 16-year old? The main characters have become cliches of themselves....which were cliches to start with. I can't even root for the villains, since Moghedian/Semirhage/Mesaana/Graendal are almost all alike. Sure, they all torture people differently, but other than that.... Ditto for all the guys with the possible exception of Ishmael. I can't believe powerful, evil, educated bad guys like this fail so stupidly. Is it possible for any author to create a bigger boring world than Jordan's? I'm talking about a world populated by people as bitter, as petty, and as one-dimensional. And this series grows less logical all the time. Why, for example, does Lan marry Nynaeve? Is it her looks? Her sense of humor? Her....what? Her stupid blind arrogance? Her temper? Her childlike tendencies? Ditto for almost all of the other characters. Also, how can any editor worth more than $1/hr miss the repetition, the large boring sections (chapters, really...no, books)? Finally, let me predict the next book: boring until the last chapter, then we get an illogical stupid cliffhanger and wait 3 years for the next boring installment. In the meantime, all kinds of fools will defend Jordan's putrid writing as somehow brilliant."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I used to come to read the reviews to this book being in a bad mood with intention to cheer myself up. And let me assure you - it works! After reading the first 10 reviews I start smiling. After next 10 - I can't help but laughing. I think some of the reviews deserve to be included in the epilog of the book."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Do what I do. Start pulling for the Dark One.

I went and bought all the books and I couldn't put it down. I could hardly pick this one up. I felt obligated to finish it just because this was at one time my favorite book series. I just finished the book and I realize that I could just as easily have read the last few chapters of the book and I would have gotten all the very little plot advancement I needed to go on to the next book. A couple of things happen but all I can say is not enough to make it worth reading. I used to try to defend some of the slower moving books (starting with book 7 really) but I can't defend book 10. If things had been like this in book 1-6, Rand would still be wandering around in the Waste talking to the Clan Cheifs, Perrin would still be in the Two Rivers fighting off the White Cloaks and the Trollocs, only you would see him trying to scheme with the Women's Circle and the Village Council. Basically this story has lost it's edge what takes RJ three books to say he used to say in one chapter. Read the books and you'll see I'm not exagerating (sp?) My biggest question after reading the book was how someone could write so much and say so little. There is no such thing as a set-up book, not when they went from the Two Rivers to the Blight in one book and from the Borderlands to Falme with a huge battle at the end of the next. There was way too much action before to suggest that he needs an entire book to set up the next part of the story. He can do better, he did before, he can again. There is no excuse for a book where absolutely nothing of import happens until the end and what does happen should have at the beginning. This book was a waste of good paper!!!!"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Oh, how the mighty have fallen!The first 4 or 5 books in this series were excellent, but since then each book has been worse than the last. Unfortunetly, this book tops them all. I have never encountered a book that took so long to say next to nothing. I would say that 80% of the text is description and 20% is plot-advancing dialogue. It takes Jordan, on average, an entire page to go from &quot;Hello&quot; to &quot;How do you do?&quot; Filler, anyone? Not to mention the myriad of characters who all blend together because none of them are particularly memorable. Apparently, all Aes Sedai have some sort of hive-mind that gives them all the same personality, but different motivations.I could rant on and on about Jordan's obsession with every character's clothing or the inner digressions each character has after every line of dialogue. But I won't. If you're like me, and you must learn the fate of Randland, then read this book and get it over with. Hopefully, book 11 will have a plot."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I finally figured out why this book was written!I read it when it came out, and I really didn't get it then. I thought it was horrible, and a waste of paper. How wrong I was!People have been wondering how RJ was going to wrap the series up. Some have even gone so far as to say that the great RJ had (The wheel forbid!!) no idea how he was going to finish it. We all forgot his military training. It was all tactics! Just when we thought he had lost it, he surprises us!Here's what I think is going to happen. Rand (or one of the other couple of million characters) gets a hold of CoT (Hardcover, so TOR and RJ can scrape out a living). They put up with some weak tea for a while and make it to Shayol Ghul. They then smooth their skirts, giggle a little, and pull on their pigtails (if they were women. The men would just sleep with their multiple wives, who are happy to share), to keep the dark one amused. Then he/she shoves the book down the rift or bore or whatever (maybe with another copy for Shaidar Haran). The dark one reads it, falls asleep, he's sealed in again....and everyone lives happily ever after.They'd still need a few more copies for the rest of the forsaken, but that is a small price to pay.See how brilliant the man is? And here we were maligning his genius!!"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I have been following this series from the beginning and have enjoyed every book (to varying degrees). Crossroads of Twilight absolutely stunk! There was almost no plot advancement, no action, and none of the page turning excitement that made this series a bestseller. Add to that Jordan's insults to those who thought this book stunk, and a lot of readers will put this series down for good. The only reason I will even consider reading the next book is because the series has been so good up till now. However, I will wait for the new book to be out for awhile so I can check the reviews before I buy it. You could skip this book entirely and not miss a whole lot. I think I will burn it - at least then it will have one redeeming value: heat."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I turned page after page after page of this tome waiting for something interesting to happen.

Thank God for George R.R. Martin!"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"The title says it all. I'm a huge fan of Jordan, and like another reviewer said, I have been defending his last couple books against fans who found them lacking. But this most recent venture into the Wheel's world is nothing more than 600+ pages of clothing descriptions and details repeated from other books.There were no battles. Really not even any good brawls. Nothing. A couple of statements like, \\"What was that that just flew by the moon? A bat, or a Seanchan beast, or the Dark One's minion?\\" and, \\"I think I saw something over by that wall.\\" were the only encounters with the dark one that anyone had, excepting the scene with Mesanna getting tortured. That is the TOTAL amount of \\"evil\\" exposure in this book. Oh, and a few people saw rats. (and weevils! Ooo! Evil weevils!)Read the book and then read the teaser in the flap again, it almost feels like you are lied to.Mat: Flap says the Shadow and Seanchan are in deadly pursuit. Funny, because the Seanchan ignore them, and the Shadow never bothers to pop up.Perrin: Flap says his only hope is an alliance with the enemy. Again, funny, because that happens almost at the end of the book. Someone mentions that maybe the Seanchan soldiers would join them against the Shaido, and Perrin goes basically, \\"Hmm.\\", like maybe he'll consider it.Egwene: Flap says she is laying siege to Tar Valon. I can't stop laughing about this, because the extent of her \\"siege\\" seems to be her going up to the wall of Tar Valon in a rowboat and getting instantly taken captive.Elayne: Flap says she fights for the Throne. She needs to pick a dress for the fight though... that should take up another 30 pages.Rand: Flap says... oh, who cares? He's only in it for a few pages.Sorry to be so harsh, but kick it up a step. It is not worth the extra money to compromise your fantastic story by using cheap filler."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I think everyone has already pointed out the main weakness of the book. It's long, rambling (par for the course) and nothing happens. I wanted to enjoy the book, but I consider the Wheel of Time to be a sad example of what happens when an author creates a detailed world and characters with no organization. Robert Jordan has repeatedly said in interviews that he didn't plan too far ahead while writing each book, and after book six, the result of that tactic are obvious.A story can be sold on the strength of the plot or the strength of the characterization. The plot in this book (and you could argue the larger plot as well), is a complete failure. Mainly because rather than simplifying the multitude of minor plot threads that now plague the series, this book does nothing to advance any of them while introducing a few more. The result is that the main plot goes nowhere, characters are roughly in the same place thinking the same things that they have been for the last two books and formulaic and childish plot devices are used in a blatant attempt to make the reader excited (reading the last page did nothing to stir my imagination; if anything, what happens at the end is yet another thing that happens to the main heroines ad nauseum). Basically, the plot pacing as well as overall development in this book [lacks].As for the characters, to be blatantly honest, you'll find more intelligence, personality and character development in the cast of Harry Potter (which manages to be entertaining and a good, clean read; virtues that have escaped the Wheel of Time as a series for quite a few books now). Even more, you'll find that you like Harry and his friends, and have a good grasp of their personalities after a few lines of dialogue. Mr. Jordan could learn a thing or two from Mrs. Rowling in that respect. In addition, to be forewarned is to be forearmed; the cast of Wheel of Time are not deep thinkers, brilliant personalities or even entertaining. There are no intelligent and sympathetic female protagonists among the main cast (which I count as Elayne, Nynaeve and Egwene, since these have regularly had their own sections in most of the series). There aren't any ladies on the level of Jessica Atreides or Darwi Odrade (Frank Herbert), Catelyn Stark (George R. R. Martin), Morgan le Fay or Guinever (Ursula K. LeGuin). Neither are the male protagonists on the same level as Paul Atreides, Ned Stark or Jaime Lannister. To put it bluntly, each character in Wheel of Time is a collection of stock responses and canned reactions.I suppose the reason characters don't seem intelligent or don't seem to develop further is because despite the hundreds of pages Jordan has wasted away in book ten, very little time has passed in Randland between Winter's Heart and Crossroads, and the period of about a week or two passes in Crossroads of Twilight. Nevertheless, we want to see characters grow and change. To put it simply, they don't seem to learn moral or intellectual lessons. They get stronger and more powerful in every book, but they all seem to operate on the same intellectual level as they did at the close of book iv. Robert Jordan tends to move his characters around by plot devices, rather than giving the character enough legitimate personality that the reader can accept that the character's actions are believable and natural. I am as entertained by the Aes Sedai as anyone, but honestly, despite their ten years and more of training, I can't help but think they are very stupid. Even worse are the little \`social messages' Jordan seems to preach in the series; such as all the women feeling a need to belong to strict and unhappy social circles where each person's worth is judged to the last virtue, vice and history. No offense, Mr. Jordan, but the picture we get of the Tower is not of disciplined women working together for a common goal but a bunch of old maids who squabble more than they meet agreements.I sincerely hope Mr. Jordan starts killing off the characters who detract from the main story, and making use of a good editor to make the book an easy read. The series is already dead; why not get rid of the characters."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I have been a fan of Robert Jordan's books have the past five years and have read all of his books multiple times. However, Crossroads of Twilight was a let down. After waiting two and a half years I found this book to be unsatisfying. The plot devolpment was horrible, very subpar in comparison to Jordan's other novels. The circumstrances the characters find themselves in the beginning of the novel are nearly identical to those at the end.For the people that are big fans, like myself, I assume you will go on to by the book despite my criticism. For the people that are considering, skip it.

I was in love with this series.Then, I read book eight, Path of Daggers and I hit a brick wall built entirely of things I did not care about at all, such as the color of Nynave's shoes, of the vein in someone's forhead, or an entire page on how Egwene's little finger hurt a little bit.These books have effectively become retatrded and I am sad to see that a series I once loved has nosedived like this. I seriously think that Jordan just wants to milk this series for all it's worth and then abandon it.And I swear that if I have to read about Egwene's dress for a whole chapter again, I will hang myself with it."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Can we save some trees and just end the pain?

The series has so much potential - despite its seemingly unnecessary complexity and volume of characters. This book does nothing to move the plot forward, presents no resolution to any of the plot twists, and ultimately adds nothing to the series. The character development is of no value, there are numerous editor slips (grammer, people, grammer), and there is no real story progress. Overall, one could omit this book from the series and lose nothing about the plot development, character positions (geographically or ideologically), and ultimately would have saved themselves many hours of useless reading.

I enjoyed every other book in the series, some more than others. But this -- almost nothing happens. Its hundreds of pages with twenty pages of plot development.At the end of the ninth book, I was literally distraught that I was done with the book because I enjoyed it so much. After the first two hundred pages of this book, I was wondering when anything of interest was going to happen. There were maybe two paragraphs regarding the cleansing of saidin. Virtually nothing happened regarding split in the Aes Saedai. Nothing regarding Nynaeve and Lan. Elayne is still not on the Lion or Sun thrones. Nothing with Taim and the Black Tower. No confrontations with the any of the Foresaken. I read the book a week ago, and I am having great difficulty remembering if anything of import happened except for the very last few pages. In fact, you literally could skip this book altogether except for reading the last 10 pages and you would miss nothing in terms of plot development (or character development for that matter).Seriously, Jordan has really .... us all with this book. He knows that if we've bought and read the first ten, we're going to buy the eleventh as well. I have to wonder if maybe the original draft for this was much longer and the publisher decided to split it into two books to milk us for all we're worth. The publisher should have done some editing instead. Maybe Jordan's made so much money, he doesn't care anymore.

This book is a great compilation of all the items that were edited out of Book 9. I'm sure glad he addressed all those burning questions I had in the back of my mind after finishing Winter's Heart such as,\\"God, I can't believe Rand cleansed the source, that is so unbelievable; but you know, I would have REALLY liked to known what the rest of the world was doing while Rand was busy doing this. I mean, that is way more interesting then how the men and the world would be now that the source is cleansed\\"and BLAMO, out comes Crossroads of Twilight. Full of all those interesting plots and stories I was really concerned about such as how Elayne chooses her dresses for every occasion, and how yet more \\"I give a crap about them\\" characters are introduced and are deftly playing the mind boggling Game of Houses.I think Robert Jordan has written so many different characters and plots, that I honestly believe he can't really remember the direction he was heading. This book should be titled, \\"The Big Book of Nothing.\\" At no point during my reading did I ever feel engaged to read on, ever. I only kept reading because he has never written a bad book before and I just couldn't accept the fact that the book could be so bad.Not only does this book not move the plot forward at all, it actually moves backward. It's like watching a Discovery special on Raising the Titanic, except it concentrates on the fast pace action of Cook's preparing meals, while the real action takes place somewhere else out of the viewers sight.I would HIGHLY suggest skipping this book, and pray for Robert Jordan to return to his good health, because something was obviously wrong."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I remember being so eager to pick up this book after waiting so long after completing book 9. Upon finishing it, I can't say it was really worth the wait.Basically, as a majority of the other reviewers have stated, this installment goes nowhere fast. I tried to breeze through the beginning to get to some actual main characters, only to find that nothing was really going on with them either. Where as the other books in the series have some major conflict or battle in the end to make you feel like you accomplished something by reading it, Crossroads of Twilight has no such major event. Some minor plot twists was all that was given, in my opinion.I was left with a feeling of,&quot;Huh!?

How could I not? It's the worst reviewed book I've ever seen, with an average score of one-and-a-half stars, the second-lowest possible. I wouldn't say [Crossroads] is quite that bad, but there's a lot to dislike about it.Reviewers often echo each other in their sentiments that nothing happens in Book 10. That's not accurate, but to say that little of importance occurs would be closer to the truth. Part of the problem is that instead of telling a worthwhile story arc for a few characters, as in novels past, Jordan shoves every character back into one book, and devotes insufficient time to each arc, leaving most of the long-standing conflicts and mysteries unresolved. I'll go through a brief summary, detailing what I liked and disliked, and how much plot really advances.*SPOILERS*The book gets off to a dreadful start, chronicling the doings of a war general who had never been previously mentioned in the series, in Arad Doman, a land never previously visited. This is in the midst of the 100-page prologue, which compiles the small plot threads of a myriad of minor characters. Whitecloaks, Aes Sedai bonded to Logain, random Aes Sedai in the White Tower, blah blah, Gawyn, Davram Bashere, minor characters hanging out in Cairhien. This is bound to frustrate readers who will have to slog through at least a hundred pages before getting the chance to read about one of the major characters. I understand that it's been a while since we've seen Gawyn and Loial, and I'm glad to see them return, but they are not handled in an interesting manner.In this book, readers will witness the characters' reactions to the cleansing of Saidin. I said in my [Winter's Heart] review that Rand's story arc was the highlight of Book 9, and it's almost as if Jordan thought he moved Rand's story too fast, and has to scramble to get the other characters' stories up to speed, hence the return of so many minor plot threads. Even the major players (i.e. Mat, Perrin, Elayne, and Egwene) offer little in the way of interesting plot movement, however, which is the book's downfall. Each character is in roughly the same location at the novel's end as they are at its onset.-Mat has kidnapped Tuon to prevent his own capture, and is hanging out at Valan Luca's traveling show while slowly figuring out how to proceed, meanwhile attempting to court Tuon. The scenes between Mat and Tuon are entertaining and at times hilarious, but the rest is largely inconsequential. There's a side chapter about the Seanchan calling a search party for Tuon, which the heroes never encounter. At the end, everyone's in the same spot.-Perrin is searching for Faile (yes, still), while simultaneously trying to bring down the outlaw leader and \\"Prophet\\" Masema; Perrin comes closer to accomplishing both of these feats, but neither is finished by the book's conclusion. The conclusion of Perrin's arc is most notable scene in [Crossroads of Twilight], in which Perrin throws away his axe. This chilling scene is a turning point for Perrin's character, but not enough to salvage the irrelevance of the first three quarters of the book.-Elayne talks politics with her advisors and other important figures. She is becoming more regal and gaining support in her conquest for the throne, but of course she hasn't accomplished anything major. Instead, we're treated to the infamous Elayne in a bathtub scene. There's a side chapter about Elayne's political rival, which couldn't be more boring, and her general, who we've known is a Darkfriend for what seems like forever, which takes away any dramatic irony that revelation may have held.-Egwene, absent from Book 9, spends each one of her chapters talking to Aes Sedai, and nothing else. No exaggeration. She deliberates on attacking the White Tower, calling an alliance with the Black Tower, beginning peace talks with Elaida, but none of these actually occur. At the end, Egwewne is kidnapped by agents of the White Tower, making this the third straight Wheel of Time novel to end with a kidnapping. Oh, and the side chapters inside the White Tower are largely inconsequential.-Rand discusses the aftermath of Saidin's cleansing with his adviser Cadsuane, and where to proceed from there. Logain also warns Rand that the Black Tower is led by Mazrim Taim's hand, and headed in a dark direction. Rand decides to work towards a truce with the Seanchan in order to face the more important conflicts at hand. This is by far the best arc, because all of what is discussed is relevant, an important decision is made, and it only takes the author two chapters to do it. This is also what makes it the most frustrating, because it leaves the reader begging for more, especially considering that the potentially fascinating Mazrim-Logain conflict has been all but ignored.*END SPOILERS*There are, of course, some high points, in which Jordan invokes his supreme writing talent, and readers can see sparks of the old flame that powered the early novels. These moments are few, and [Crossroads of Twilight] gets bogged down in a pile of irrelevant detail. All of the complaints I had about the previous novel, [Winter's Heart] are still present: not enough resolution, passages with an overabundance of description, conspicuous typos, an unhelpful glossary, a nearly unmanageable number of minor characters being featured. This book, however, is a step down because lacks the plot movement of its predecessor, and teases readers into thinking more will occurI did not enjoy this book. I would have given it two stars, but I raised the score to three based on the following points:-Although the plot is terrible, there is a lot of character development.-The intricately designed world is still intact. Although little new territory is explored, it's a pleasure to return to the addictive settings that Jordan has fabricated.-There is a strong theme of the breakdown of social boundaries and the rigid social structure that has defined the world in novels past, reflective of peoples' changing attitudes in the face of the approaching cataclysm.-Enough is set up (thankfully) to make for a potentially interesting sequel in book 11 [Knife of Dreams].Objectively, this is not a terrible book, although it is a very frustrating one. Many a reader hopped off the Wheel of Time because of this book, and I might have been tempted to, as well, if I did not know that the series (now almost complete) is all uphill from here. After [Crossroads of Twilight] comes the prequel novel [New Spring], book 11, and the posthumous Jordan/Sanderson trilogy, all of which were significantly better received that Book 10. This one is a misstep, but not a disaster; the series has plenty of room for redemption and fulfillment."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I held off reviewing this because I think the other reviewers to date pretty much have it nailed down. Yes, nothing of real significance plot-wise happens in this entire (lengthy) novel. Yes, the character development and description presented here seem to indicate that Jordan is just filling pages. The other books in the series are pretty solid, this one is sort of the black sheep of the lot.That said, the real tragedy and disappointment here is that the late Robert Jordan never finished his final book in the series. All is not lost- he did apparently dictate the plot he intended to write, but he didn't get to do it himself.I can't help but wonder how much better that book would be if Jordan had just skipped Crossroads, and spent his precious time writing the finale instead."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Robert Jordan wants your money, and he wants it so badly that he copy and pasted an entire novel just to get some very loyal fans to shell out for another book. The main characters do nothing, and three separate women spend their time explaining to us how you should behave in front of your maid. Whoopee. And then there are the weevils, dirty little devils that are spoiling the food. Okaay....It's unfortunate, but with everything the characters have been through before, a little weevil infestation shouldn't be worth 700 pages of whining and stalling. Where's the battle? Where's the action? Where are the main characters, even? Jordan neeeds to stop listening to his publishers and get back on track before he looses his entire following. This book sucks, and I'm sorry now that I ever started the series."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I have been a fan of WoT since '91. The initial books were great. About 5 years ago, as the books became worse, I read two interviews in a row and figured out the problem. One was from Stephen R Donaldson, who said that when he gets an idea, he immediately knows how many books that idea can sustain. RJ's interview stated that his inspiration was \\"what would it be like to be tapped on the shoulder and told you are the Messiah?\\" A brilliant idea, which sustained the first 3 books; after that it has been nothing but plot without spirit or a driving idea. Everything else negative that people have said is true-- the annoying characters, excessive descriptions, lack of plot progression, etc, but I think the deepest problem is that the inspiration for the series is dead. RJ--please just let the Dark One destroy everyone and start a new book with a new idea."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This is SO typical of defenders of this piece of sh...um, I mean book. Instead of giving reasons why they think this book is good, they attack negative reviewers instead. This is the best so far: \\"If you don't like the book(s); don't READ THEM.\\"How do you know whether or not you like the book in question UNTIL AFTER YOU READ IT? ***SIGH***Another quote: \\"I don't like a lot of authors; and yet I manage day after day not to talk about them.\\"Umm, the whole purpose of these reviews IS to talk (or, in this case, write) about them. That's why there are ratings you can give the books that you are reviewing. If, according to the title of the review below you should \\"Stop Complaining\\", then why did Amazon.com arrange ratings of as low 1 star out of 5? If this \\"critic\\" had his or her way, he or she would have only one rating available, 5 stars. (Well, ok, maybe two ratings, 4 or 5 stars, since they only rated this \\"book\\" with 4 stars).Anyway, another splendid example of a Robert Jordan reviewer. \\"So here's an idea if you can write better than him... do it.\\" I AM a writer, thank you, and I certainly CAN write better than him. But I would feel very guilty if I wrote as poorly as Robert Jordan and robbed so many people of their hard earned cash. If I were him, I'd like to think that the money I was making was WELL-EARNED."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I cannot remember when I first started reading this series. It may be trite and cliche but Tolkien created a master epic in 3 books. Now there have been 10 books and if they all move things along at the pace of this last book he must have plans for 10 more. I was already frustrated by previous books so I checked this last one out from the library. I will never buy another book in the series. However I feel compelled to read them. Like many I was really sucked in by the world and characters Jordon created. Now I just want a conclusion. My current favorite series is the Fire and Ice series by George R.R. Martin."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Glacial does not begin to describe the pace. Nothing happened. It's as if Jordan got writer's block and just wrote descriptive, rambling nonsense. It contains endless useless descriptions of nothing. This book could have been written in less than 200 pages and been semi-interesting. At two hundred pages I would have given it 2 stars. The trouble is I am so hooked on the series I had to read it. I suspect that Jordan dried up but needed to churn something out to make a little money from us suckers. I would rather he was like George RR Martin and didn't turn out a book until it was ready."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"The Wheel of Time was the best fantasy series ever written. In the last two books (some 1,600 pages), Jordan has barely moved the story forward. There used to be great action in the books. Now, the author seems determined to fill in every bit of detail and back-story for the series. And it's simply dull.An advisor wants to say something to Perrin. He gets out a one-line sentence SIX PAGES later! They spent those six pages walking through the camp, and Jordan tells us all kinds of extraneous stuff. It does nothing for plot development. The whole book seems to go this way.Crossroads (paperback) is over 800 pages, and Rand doesn't appear in the first 600-plus pages. That's just silly.I used to stay up early into the morning to read the latest WOT novel. I barely finished this one. With New Spring (his latest novel) taking place before The Eye of the World, it feels like Jordan's main goal is now to write about the world he's created: not tell Rand's story.I want to know what happens to the Dragon Reborn. I hope the series ends soon enough that I'll still be reading it.Jordan is a superb writer, but he seems to have lost sight of his purpose with this series. It's a shame."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Possibly achieveing the lowest score on amazon ever, this book has downright defined how bad an author can write a story. While I love hearing about Rand's brown shirt over the course of 687 pages, there is no plot.Jordan just writes now to make money. He doesn't care at all about his readers. He decided to write about what appeals to him, and what appeals to him is &quot;fashion designer&quot;.I have never read a book so terrible. This book is crap. You could skip this book and be fine in book 11 probably, because nothing happens."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Very disapointing. RJ has created an incredible world with characters who the reader cares about. However, he has written himself into a corner. Rather than tying off subplots and starting new ones, he continues to expand the old and create the new. Almost 700 pages covers less than 6 weeks of time. Also, there is not one major battle scene, something RJ is especially good at creating and describing."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I truly appreciate Robert Jordans books. I have been following this series for years now. Each book always left you with a sense of &quot;whats gonna happen next... or is he a dark one...&quot; This book on the other hand just left me exasperated. Jordon strung everyone far to much in this book. He hardly touches on Rand. The action is NONE. He does a great job of establishing characters and closing some gaps left open from previous books however this book just leaves you dry. It almost make you not want to know what happens next. Its a good read as all Jordan books are, just seriously lacking in adventure or fantasy."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This is book 10 of the series, start with Eye of the world and read up to this one. With that said, the prologue(Glimmers for the E-book readers) seems to promise much more story movement. I read and re-read this book in the last week to make sure I was not missing something. The pace is way too slow, not enough about Rand, the Aiel, fain, most of the forsaken, Nynaeve...Perrin gets stupid, Matt gets boring and Egwene is much too careless. Rand is almost an afterthought,what are his plans? what happened to the Choedan Kal? I spent the last three monthes re-reading the entire series and was looking forward to some big progress toward the last battle, disappointed is definately how I feel! This is not Jordan at his best"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Keeping the plots and subplots...and subplots of subplots straight is hard enough, but the last few books leave a feeling of a story being dragged out....Mr. Jordon you can write wonderfully, please do so and finish the story....I promise I'll buy your next series too so it's Ok to finish this one...:)"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This book wasn't as bad as some here would have you believe. Really. I'm glad I read it, although if it weren't part of a series I've been reading for almost a decade, I would have waited for the paperback version to come out.It's well written. The dialogue continues to improve, Jordan's imagination is lively, and what happens is interested. But the plot has ceased to move. From what I can tell, 2 major decisions are made, and there's incremental progress in 2 subplots. That's it. The other 650 pages is spent in political intrigue that ultimately has no effect. Some of it is engaging, but certainly not enough to take as much space as it does.If Jordan can get back to his &quot;book a year&quot; pace, then I could stomach this. But 2+ years is a long time to wait for books that are increasingly uneventful."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Robert Jordon is easily one of my favorite authors, but the last few books and especially this one have been a disappointment. I enjoy the main characters, but in the latest books of the series he spends far too much time on insignificant characters, which made large parts of the books very boring. In fact, I skimmed large portions of this book and the last several because I couldn't bear to read them. And, I lost nothing of the story for my inattention to large parts of the books.I have to agree with the others and I said the same to my wife just as I finished this book - almost nothing happened in this book. I wouldn't care if he drug this series out to 20 books as long as there is a story to tell. There was little to tell in this book and the almost 700 pages should have been cut to 200 pages. It took over half the book to even have the other characters catch up to the climax of the previous book.I was really looking forward to this book. The long wait was not worth it!!!That said, Robert Jordon is a master storyteller. His descriptions and world building are incredible. I have been reading science fiction and fantasy for over 25 years and I can say that Jordon is among the best. It pains me to only give this book 3 stars, but if I hadn't read the previous books and enjoyed the characters so much, it would have probably only earned one star. I will buy the next book in this series when it is available and hope that Jordon regains my trust and praise in his writing skills."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Being the hardcore Wheel of Time fan that I am, I bought the Prologue \\"Glimmers\\" when it came out in September. I was thrilled upon reading the author interview: only a few more books! Surely Jordan will HAVE to pack a lot more action and plot conclusion into one installment than he has been doing. With a big silly grin on my face I wrote down a list of predictions of what might just end up happening in Crossroads.The shattering of illusions really hurts.The 680-page tome that is Crossroads crashed with the weight of a wrecking ball into any hopes I had of a repeat of the killer action scene found at the end of Winter's Heart. In retrospect, I must be more naive than I thought to actually believe that Jordan could actually wrap more than one plot up in a book. Heck, he proved in Crossroads that he can't even resolve ONE, for crying out loud. Yes, I was entertained by the political manuevering and the important decisions made, BUT...I crave some action. Now, I know some people out there will jump all over that last statement, accusing me of having a two-second attention span that can only be held by violence. That's most certainly not true, as I finished the book two days after it came out. I absorbed page after page, secretly harboring the belief that gripping, riveting narration was just around the corner. Even when it was clear I was down to the last few chapters, hope burned ever eternal in my breast. Nope. The dice stopped spinning in my head I guess, since my luck completely ran out. All this book gave me was frustration and more questions. In short, Crossroads was a half-hearted addition to the massive WoT saga. Two more years...:-("},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Honestly, after reading a few reviews on here I expected this book to be abysmal, but it wasn't nearly that bad. It was...quiet. That's the best way to describe it. I think it - and several other previous volumes - could've been cut out and the events inserted into other books, but as is, I don't feel cheated. Perhaps because I just read the paperback and didn't have to spend that much money on it I found it more worth my money.The story does slow down for a time, maneuvering characters for the last two (hopefully) books and their events. But you do get some interesting scenes and character development. Granted, were I the writer, the whole Perrin subplot would be gone and he'd be at Rand's side or nearby. The Seanchan subplot would also be trimmed - tightened perhaps - to not include so many other inconsiquential characters and their plots. That seems to be the whole problem: Jordan has fallen so in love with his world here, he wants to include so many individual stories that really don't have bearing on the overall.I look forward to some obsessed fan combing through the final twelve volumes and trimming the storylines that led to nowhere but the author's own sense of satisfaction. How long will the series be then? How many hundreds of pages could be cut out? It's my opinion that books 8-10 could've been one book, or parts of 8 could've been in 7, and 9-10 could've either been one book or part of 11. Not a lot has happened to move the story forward. It almost feels like we're leaving the second act with this book. Does that mean material-wise Jordan wants to write five more volumes to wrap up all the nonsense he's started?I hope he learns from the reviews on here and those of professionals in the field. Trim the fat, Robert, give us the focused story that you started. Crossroads of Twilight is a decent book, fair but not much more. It entertained me, but I came away wanting. Also, it had what the past few books had: numerous typographical errors. By now, Jordan should be thoroughly humbled from all the mentions of bad grammar, spelling errors and plain mistakes in the text. He should also care so much about the story."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I've tried to read this book 3 times, but the deeper I get into the book, the more lost I become.

I bought this book anticipating the best. I am disappointed. This book doesn't even really pick up where the last one left off. More to the point, it describes the event from another characters aspect and location around the time Rand cleanses the source of the taint. It does proceed forward a little, but not by much. This whole book could have been summarized at the beginning of each chapter related to the character involved. This was a huge waste of paper and time. I will continue to buy the books and read them, because I am too far in to not know how it ends, but give the public some credit. People will stop buying the books if you don't keep them interested.

I couldn't escape. Don't get me wrong, I love the WOT series and this latest edition does stand as one of the better books I have read. That having been said there were several instances while reading this that I began to think, &quot;OK, move it along, noting to see here. Yadda, yadda, yadda.&quot; Over 500 pages are more like one long Prolog to the next story or an extended Epilogue to the last one. I would say that we had some really good character development, but this is WOT, we've had good character development from the last 9 books. I don't think we needed any more to the extent that this edition gave us.I would recommend the series and I would still recommend this book (as long as you have read the other 9 first), but given that it will be another 1-2 years or more before we see any action from WOT, I would have liked to have seen a little more develop/reslove here. This whole book could have been reduced to 2-3 WOT chapters (IOW long) and placed at the beginning of the next book, in which I hope we will bear some fruit from all the previous setup.I heard a rumor that RJ said he didn't want to make the whole series go beyond 12 books. I fear that, with what is left, he may rush his incredibly rich plot to fit it all in.

Unfortunately, this book *has* no content to speak of. Jordan needs to learn how to write, Harriet needs to learn how to edit, and TOR should stop treating him as infallible because he most definitely is fallible. CoT is the proof of that.

That lasted until around page 50, where I wondered when anything good was going to happen. By the end of the book I realized with the exception of one thing happening with Egwene (at the very end), Jordan took us nowhere slowly. As I read the other reviews I can't help wonder why even a die-hard fan would give this more than the minimum 1 star. Most of these say it's a case of Jordan setting up the next big books. I think they've been saying that for 4 books now. Don't fall for it. ... Don't do it! Don't fork over cash for this book. Try a different author instead!"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"For me, this series really ended with book six.

I love the series and think Robert Jordan is brilliant, but this book didn't go anywhere. How much politics and court intrigue are we expected to read? This is supposed to be a fantasy novel, not an anthropolical study. It is one thing to give back story while elegantly painting a picture of an alien world, it is entirely another thing to give us a blow by blow examination of the governmental structures and their intricacies.Where is the action and fantasy in this fantasy and action novel? I get enough political analysis watching the news, I don't want it in a Wheel of Time novel.I'll read the remaining novels because I've already invested so much time and effort, but I'm prepared to complain a lot."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I'm writing this review for people who are interested in fantasy fiction, but haven't started on Robert Jordan yet (if there are any such).The first book in this series was one of the best fantasy books ever written (it is not comparable to Tolkein, but then nothing is). As usual there was a considerable drop off in the quality of the second book, but it was still better than most fantasy novels out there...ditto for 3-5. Then things took a turn for the worse... 6 was mediocre as was 7. Book 8 was almost unbearably bad, 9 was a tad better, but still bad.Now we come to book 10.

I feel stuck in this series because I've read through 10 books over more than a decade and I feel like I should at least stick it out to the end, but I don't think it's going to be worth my time anymore.Jordan can spend entire chapters discussing what skirts people are wearing and who is being a woolhead or a ninny - but that does not equal plot. It equals random useless filler that is BORING to read. The characters haven't been developed at all, they don't learn anything new, and nothing changes.

What someone may or may not like is not up to me...but something has to be said for the newest in Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series. Why? Why did he write this book? Why did he do so many things? It's one thing to have a never ending series. I wouldn't mind if this series never ended but only if it kept the energy and excitement of the series early on. The newest book, Crossroads of Twilight takes place after a very huge development occurred in the last book, Winter's Heart. A development so huge I was in suspense for the next book for two years. Well here is the book. Nothing happens. Characters sit around and do nothing for hundreds of pages at a time. The most interesting part of the story and the most interesting characters are given little time but we are treated a lot of Elayne the Queen walking around doing nothing for a good three hundred pages. Please. Give us a break Robert Jordan. Give us some action. I know nothing like this has ever been attempted before--a series that is insanely long--that's great! But he burned himself out. He's struggling with what is obviously writer's block. Put your beloved story behind you Robert Jordan! You've created a great world and story that deserves a great ending you can't possibly deliver anymore--hand your project off to another writer. Someone who can do the job for you. Someone who will kill off one or two of your millions of characters who all have horrible names.

I made the mistake of purchasing No. 9 and No. 10 in hard back. I will not make that mistake again. This book is the worst of the lot. Better than a lot of other writers work but way below par for Robert Jordon. There is very little action and the story progresses very little. Book 9 and book 10 should have been combined. Also, this book does not have a climax that we expect from Jordon. (Book 1 to Book 5, etc.) I usually read every word and follow every line but this time I skimmed the book. That is how little content there is in this book. I think Mr. Jordon has become bored with this story and is having a hard time finishing the series. This book feels like he was being pressured by his publishers and he just put something together to placate the &quot;masses&quot;. I hope he can finish it in a style befitting his earlier works but I am starting to doubt it. I bought this book from a book club in book club size.

I actually read where Jordan thinks his writing has greatly improved since the first books.This is so obviously wrong it makes you wonder where he is coming from. I also think RJ gets real enjoyment from watching his readers squirm about some of the plot twists that he's introduced over the years (some 10 years ago in the first book !!!!). Why answer questions when he can hear \`Who killed .....' for the hundredth time at a book signing. Watch them squirm, Watch them squirm ........ .

Something happened in that book - something huge, actually. But now, I think I'm done.This whole book is broken into very distinct sections each following the same pattern: Take a main character, provide 2-4 chapters of chatting and thinking, then one or two chapters of what is happening on the other side of that particular plot line.

Notice I said &quot;chatting and thinking&quot;, not &quot;doing&quot; or &quot;acting&quot;.The book is 672 pages long - the first 400 pages all take place during the last chapter of Winters Heart - and Rand finally makes an appearance around page 450.And that &quot;something huge&quot; that happened in Winter's Heart? No effect. Might as well not have happened.Go to Google Groups, look up rec.arts.sf.written.robert-jordan, and read something with [spoilers] at the end of the subject line. Save yourself the time and money."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"A big waist of time , the only thoughts that come to mind in regards to book 10 of this series. The 95 page prologue was bad enough, but the chapters just ramble on about nothing that has any relevance to the story line. Endless chapters about shawls and smoothed skirts brings nothing to the story. What started out a series of well written books has now become filler. I hope that Mr Jordan writes the final book before fan loose interest and move on."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I feel sorry for Robert Jordan. I do. He has seen his last 3 books trashed and Crossroads of Twilight will probably be the low point in this series for Jordan. As everyone has said the first 7 books of this series soldified Jordan as a great fantasy writer. The most recent books have dragged, this one being the worst. The book took 680 pages to cover a week or two. The Eye of the World covered a time span of a couple months and the books that followed it did the same up until book 7. I still enjoy the series but why end book 9 as Jordan did if he was not going to cover Rand and the cleansing of the Source. There was too much details put into the story, things I don't think will be too important when this series draws to a close. I didn't need a summary of what happened in the last couple of books. As it is there was not much to talk about anyway. Nothing happens with Elayne, Rand, Egwene, Nynaeve, or Perrin. The story ends quite the same as the last one ended, with much foreshadowing of great events happening. Frankly I am getting tired of reading about Perrin traveling the countryside searching for the Shaido and Faile. This book at least should have solved a couple of the cliffhangers of book 9. It didn't. The cleansing of the source maybe mentioned twice. Jordan, i believe, has 2 choices for book 11. Either make something happen, or continue to write hundreds of pages about meaningless details, and lose the fans that you still have. I myself lost interest in the series after A Path of Daggers only to pick it up again. Maybe I made a mistake. I hope not. Despite all my cricitism I do have a few praises for the book. Jordan did an excellent job developing MAt's character as he comes to grips with his fate. And the book does provide tantalizing clues of what is to come (Even though it should have come to pass in these book). My recomendation is that you should buy the paperback version of this book in 1 year. You should still read this book despite some advice saying that skipping this book is fine. You will have problems understanding Mat and Perrin if you do not read this book. The reason for buying this book in a year is that there will not be such a long wait for you until the next book comes out. All we can pray for is that the plot gets moving again and that Jordan presents his readers with something to latch onto before he loses all of them. ONE MORE CHANCE, Mr. Jordan."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"is this book written by the same author or did he take a vacation somewhere and had one of his editors write this bs?With the exception of some death-watch guard, this book doesnt move forward at all.

This latest book was worth about 4 chapters. The other &quot;million or so&quot; words seemed to have been put to paper by a different author. The phrasing and word choices were different than the unusually cunning usages that Mr. Jordan has given us in the past. Does Mr. Jordan have a ghost writer? If so, tell them to just put this series to an end and start something new. One last book for all of us diehard fans, will be more than sufficient.

I don't think that 30 pages of the whole book was directly involving him. HIs prose is as good as ever, but this books slogs along for almost 700 pages and nothing really happens until the end and even that is almost a non-event. I will read book 11 when it comes out because I enjoy the Jordan style, but I want a conclusion already. All this book did was drag armies from one spot to another with nothing happening. Too many names of minor characters and not enough contact with the major ones. Let's hope that book 11 winds this whole thing up so that Jordan can start a new adventure. The early books were much better."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"A major disappointment. Little plot development, endless descriptive paragraphs with little contribution to the storyline or character development, basically hundreds of pages with virtually no movement.

That book mentioned that it was the first book of a trilogy. Nine books later... apparently Robert Jordan has decided to milk this story for the rest of his life. Although the first three books were outstanding, nothing of substance happened in the last7 books!?! I for one have gotten to the point that I don't really care what happens anymore. I would have bought this book if the story came to conclusion, but from reading all of the other reviews it's just waste of more time. Robert, if your reading this, GET ON WITH IT.

Unfortunately, the following 600+ pages were just as meandering and meaningless. Mr. Jordan exercises an incredible ability to build sub-plots that go into more (unnecessary) detail and depth than the main plot(s) and apparently serve no real purpose. I've waited eagerly for the last few books in the series. Now it's like Star Wars...I'll buy it and I'll read it, but only to get some sense of closure. I no longer \\"eagerly await\\" the next pieces of story; just PLEASE get it over with. If you're a die-hard fan, buy this book. If you're sort of a fan, wait for the paperback.

Absolutely nothing happened. Only at the very end does one of our major players end up in the hands of the enemy. The rest of the book is a waste of time, both in advancing the plot and in developing the characters.In addition, Mr. Jordan is either thoughtless or arrogant to not include some kind of synopsis. If he is going to make readers wait so long between books, he should include some kind of list of characters and how they came to be where they are in the story. He could probably even make money by selling a separate &quot;Guide to The Wheel of Time&quot;. Because I enjoyed the first nine books so much, I would probably buy it, in spite of Book Ten.

For some reason I think that the Wheel of Time is turning at a slower rate, and in some cases going backwards.The page count in this book is marginal compared some other gargantuan volumes in this series, and three quarters of it is a recap of what happened in the last book.I was so exited to buy this book that on it's release date I was in line at the Store where RJ himself was showcasing the book for the first time, I get home and read it, and 4 days later I'm like, That's it?Wait for the paperback, and don't hold your breath for the next book.George R.R.

CoT is probably the worst. It's impossible for this series to return to the lofty heights of the first few books, but now I am concerned that Mr. Jordan is afraid or unable to finish the series at all. He goes on and on. Nothing of any consequence happens. Avoid this series like the plague.

Well, like the previous reviews have stated, nothing happens. I take that back. Fists are made, dresses are smoothed, braids get tugged, etc. Actually, it's on par with book 9 (&quot;Winter's Heart&quot;). It seems to me that Jordan needed something for filler between books so, he wrote &quot;Crossroads of Twilight.&quot; The entire book could've been summarized in 1-2 chapters in a different book. So, it could've been book 10 still, but it would really be book 11 with book 10 as the first couple of chapters.

Well, hands up everyone who thinks that what is what he has done? TWOT, full of action, adventure, a world of imagination and colorful, unique characters, ended around book 7 (some say even earlier). Now a second series has begun, full of cliches, the same characters doing exactly the same thing they were the book before - nothing. The worst thing about the degeneration of the series (other than the fact that I will continue to read the remaining books as soon as they come out, hoping that somehow all of my time and &quot;care&quot; about the characters and the world of TWOT has not been wasted) is that the characters that we loved in the beginning because they were different, unique individuals, have all become... well, the same. They all think about every triviality the same way, they all do nothing - at all - and worst, for some reason, they all seem to think that if they keep waiting and doing nothing, that that is somehow a brilliant strategy! What happened to the characters we used to love and cheer for? Now they all send me to leep - in the same way! There is no more uniqueness about them.And on the cynical side, one of the other reviewers prompted me to check on the amount of words in COT compared to say, TLOC - the margins are larger, the font is larger, there are less words per line and less lines per page (yes, that's how bored the made me that I went and checked these things) - ie. if COT had been printed the same way as TLOC, it would only run to about 400 pages!So, 2 stars - but that's only for the first books of the series, and the hope that Mr.Jordan will finish TWOT the way he began."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I have to agree with other negative reviewers. I have been a fan of the Wheel of Time since the beginning and Jordan's current trend is frustrating.Crossroads of Twilight just had no major plot ocurrances. There is the usual characterisation, but nothing of interest happens! As we are getting near the end of the series you would think that things be be heating up.I ask you....a 90 page prologue with no major characters just to go over what has already happened??With all the things that need to be done, the rescue of Faile, the storming of Tar Valon, the romance of Mat and Tuon, a united Caemlyn, not forgetting the final battle.....will the series go on forever??

Saidin is clean!!! Now let's sit around and do nothing.I originally began reading the Wheel of Time cycle with a lot of enthusiasm. It was a fresh look at the fantasy genre and I was drawn in by Robert Jordan's masterful interweaving of elements from multiple cultural myths. Since that time Jordan has managed to wring every last bit of enthusiasm from me. In its place he has left this 600+ page volume with almost NO content. I finished this book mostly out of spite, and am honestly beginning to resent the entire Wheel of Time enterprise. I feel like I have been taken for a long, slow, not very interesting ride, with no end in sight. I am definitely NOT going to buy the next book, and will probably wait until the entire series is finished to actually read the remaining novels. And I will buy them used because they aren't worth the cover price. Jordan has taken an excellent premise and frittered it away. This is sad because I think that there is a dearth of good fantasy out there. Anyone looking for a good entertaining read should avoid this series until it's done. If it ever gets there. I held out for 10 HUGE books, and personally, I'm just getting tired of waiting for something to happen."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This is the first review I've written. I usually just read the reviews written by other people but I felt compelled to write one about this book. I cannot understand why Mr. Jordan wrote this book. The book goes nowhere. A lot of characters I've never heard of, or will probably never hear of again were introduced. Absolutly nothing was accomplished, moved forward or resolved. What a &quot;LET DOWN&quot;.

Jordan has creaed such a wonderful world with interesting characters, but I am now at the end of Book 5, and I plan to abandon this series. It seems many readers simply continue to read because they have \\"so much invested\\" they don't want to end the insanity. I am honestly dumbfounded by Jordans' writing style, no other author I have ever read draws out a plot as he does. It is mind-numbing and boring. Like other reviewers, I find myself trying to read ahead in a desperate attempt to find something interesting. If you are just starting out reading the Jordan saga, I recommend you stop and save your sanity."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I waited anxiously for 2 years before this 10th book in the Wheel of Time series came out.

I'm glad I waited too!820 pages of which only 1 chapter chronicled the activities of the main character Rand. Sheesh! Lots of talk about him, but almost none of the other supporting characters and substories interacted with him. In Book 9, he cleanses Saidin of the evil &quot;taint&quot; of it and yet none of the other characters even know about it.All my griping being said by many other fans of this series, I will still anxiously await to read reviews of the 11th book in this series before I decide to buy the hard-bound edition immediately or wait for the paperback one.I only hope that Jordan's remaining days of life will permit him enough time to finish this story before one or both of us die."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"As many have said already, it was long and dry.

The last 2-3 chapters tell all that is really important"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Crossroads of Twilight is another book in a long line of over-discriptions and tiny shifts. I am still waiting for something to happen in this series. RJ hasn't written a book that has satisfied his readers since book 4. That said, the reader is left in a place that gives hope for the WOT series actually getting somewhere next go 'round. There are too many characters for the author himself to keep up with, and I don't care as much as he seems to just what each Aes Sedai in the room is wearing. Not at all satisfying, but it leaves hope for future installments.

Not since Melville's droning description of a whale's tail in Moby Dick or Dickinson's tireless ramblings about horses trudging up a muddied hill in A Tale of Two Cities have I seen such descriptive language used. For Jordan to keep the separation of characters is impressive. There is almost too much descriptive language in the book to be considered \\"recreational\\" reading. I can see why everyone is in an uproar.A large point of irritation is that the character, Rand, is hardly in it. Out of 680 pages of text, Rand appears in only 22 pages; only 3.5%. Every subplot left you hanging. There was no resolution at all. It is (I hope) a book to set the stage for the final conflict.It was much like running up a hill and being flung off a cliff, only to hang in mid-air. Jordan has created a monster snowball that just keeps getting larger and larger. It's got to be the most convoluted method for developing a plot I have ever seen.After the endless development here, I hope his next book has a little more action."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"As a french reader I have read Robert Jordan's books for many years, and was expecting eagerly Crossroads of Twilight...well, I was, and I am, very, very disappointed.

Basically a filler book.!!!"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"The late Mr. Jordan must have had a sign on his writing desk that said, \\"Tedium is the spice of life.\\"Endless unimportant and irrelevant characters--all of whom have the same name, or minor variations thereof--numerous towns which suffer from the same affliction, and a devotion to description that would have made Joseph Conrad or E.R.R. Eddison proud.Having slogged my way through this and the other nine pointless books, I have finally succumbed to my burning desire never to read anything by Robert Jordan again. This guy takes to boring the way a fish takes to water. I honestly believe that Jordan had a great idea for a novella or even possibly a single book and then realized that if he wrote it as it should have been written, he then would have been faced with the task of devising a new plot for a new book filled with new characters in order to keep the money flowing in, so in a flash of brilliance, he decided to spread that single volume across a dozen or so (exactly how many volumes are there?) books salting each one with a chapter's worth of story interspersed with reams of useless, irrelevant, superfluous drivel and youthful angst.When one reaches the point of skipping, not just sentences or paragraphs, but whole pages and indeed chapters without noticeably affecting the narrative (if one can call what Jordan wrote a \\"narrative\\"), I think maybe it's time to move on--which coincidentally is what I have finally, if far too late, decided to do.Read this book if you find watching paint dry or grass grow the highest form or entertainment--everyone else give the entire series a miss, you like yourself more for having done so.Did I say this book is BORING?"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I loved the first 7 books in the series.

I'm writing to the publisher to complain"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"RJ. I have been a big fan over the years. I loved the first five books. I understand that you want to give your characters time to develope the subplots, but enough is enough. There are so many subplots going on that no one without going back and re-reading every single book will remember who all of these characters are. It takes you half the book (more in this case) just to bring the readers back up to speed. In fact, after book nine, I went back and re-read every one. Nine then made since, but now after reading ten, I have to once again re-read everything (which I am not going to do because book ten did not advance the story line at all). I could have skipped the book and not missed anything.I know you can't make everyone happy, but take a look at this message board. 95% of the people gave you the lowest rating possible. Most think you are just milking them for as much money as possible.Bottom line, I will not buy the next book on hardback. I will buy the paperback. If book eleven turns out to be like the last few, then I will put them down forever. I really want to read the conclusion, but I can't take any more dissapointments from you. Now I will sit back and wait another 2+ years, please make it a good one."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I am amazed that Robert Jordan (RJ) and his publishers are unable or unwilling to smell the coffee. Witness the near unanimity among Amazon reviewers that the recent Wheel of Time books have deteriorated badly.Books 1-5, maybe even 6 were top drawer. RJ painted his world in bold strokes, we got detailed descriptions, the main characters were developed, the story clearly progressed. Most important of all, these books gripped the reader; it was a real struggle to lay them aside for food or rest! After that, some taint (!) seems to have struck down the writer. The pace of events has become glacially slow, the plot line seems to meander in a sluggish maze, the very quality of the writing seems to have become sloppy. The characters do not grow and develop further; instead they seem almost to regress. What happened to the RJ who wrote that fascinating time slice view of Aiel history, who expounded the meaning of ji'-e-toh, who described for us the testing of the Accepted?Don't get me wrong. I love doorstopper sized books and revel in sub-plots. But sub-plots are called so for a reason; they are incidental to the main storyline and get resolved soon. Yet RJ now dwells obsessively on the sub-plots leaving messy loose ends and as a result, the main plot line suffers in the sea of sub-plots and cannot progress. Book 8 ended with Egwene's Aes Sedai and Gareth Bryne's army poised to attack Tar Valon. Now at the close of Book 10, Egwene was just about ready to get the attack moving! Perrin appears for a few brief pages in the beginning of Book 9 searching for Faile, and disappears; now back in Book 10 he is still at best slightly closer to finding and rescuing her. Book 8 ended with Mat trapped in Ebou Dar, by the end of Book 9 he had barely started his escape and by the close of Book 10, he is still to cross the border!Huge discontinuities tear the fabric. Rand is now mysteriously in Tear and still playing silly games with Cadsuane, all while the Stone is somehow besieged. Mesaana is in trouble for ignoring the Dark Lord's summons; when was this summons anyway? And the rest of the Forsaken are mysteriously absent. I could go on.Apart from the story elements, again Book 10 sticks with the same pathetic scrap of a map which is so lacking in detail that it is useless (just try figuring where exactly Perrin or Mat are located and where they are heading with any degree of precision). How can you have a fantasy novel without a decent map of the fantasy world? And the wretched excuse for a glossary is so paltry and incomplete that I wonder why RJ bothered with it at all.I still think it would be instructive for Tor / RJ to run an analysis of sales of each book in the series. I will stick my neck out and predict that the Books-1-6 sold more in hardcover as well as paperback to individuals, the last four will have been bought by proportionally less individuals and more by libraries. Many of RJ's readers, who earlier would have given his WOT books pride of place on their bookshelf are getting disillusioned and falling back on the public library. I for one still want to read how the series ends, but not another cent of my money will RJ get unless he works for it. Contempt for his readers is coming back to bite RJ."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I can't believe I waited more than two years to read this extremely disappointing piece of work. The Crossroads of Twilight does absolutely nothing to advance the story line of the Wheel of Time series, if there is, in fact a storyline to be found anymore.It would be different if he were writing a TV series, or a soap opera where a new episode comes out every week, but after more than two years since his last volume,I expected much, much more.It's almost as if the writer and his publishers have found a cash cow and don't want it to end. Whenever they need more money, Jordan just cranks out another 700 pages of drivel and then drives to the bank.I have read and enjoyed Mr Jordans work in the past, but quite frankly, I don't think I'll be able to work up much enthusiasm for the next installment of his never-ending story."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I wanted to like this book I really did. There were only a few parts that I found to be interesting, such as the scene with Alviarin and Perrin's interrogation. Unfortunately that didn't justify the rest of this book. All of the scenes with Elayne were awful, I didn't care anything about that siege or the politics at all. Rand was hardly in it also, after accomplishing so much in the previous book, that's absurd. This was not the quality writing I expected after waiting so long. I don't buy the argument that this is a setting up book either, I don't feel that you need an entire book to set up your plot. Jordan should be ashamed of himself for putting out this terrible quality book.He owes us book 11 much sooner, and it needs to be far better than this or I'm done with the series."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Why is Robert Jordan taking so damned long to get anywhere? Think about it. The bare bones \\"plot\\" is fairly simple: The Dark One must escape his prison and the Dragon Reborn must, with the aid of the world, defeat him and give his life while doing it. Heck, the prophesies about the Dragon practically give the ending away.Given this, it's no wonder that Robert Jordan is dragging this out; introducing scads of subplots and characters and padding his story with many, many chapters' worth of description about bosoms, fine lace, people staring at each other, etc, etc. Unfortunately, this will tend to make the ending, if and when it comes, a little anti-climactic. Again, think about it: The Dark One unleashes evil, yadda yadda yadda, Rand finally unites everybody (somehow) and beats him and... dies...or not. (Yippee! Then everyone is free to bicker amongst themselves about matters other than how best to control the Dragon, or who should be in charge of which wedding party). Either way, big hairy deal; that's what supposed to happen, more or less: the bad guys gets it. I can't imagine there being a lot of different ways it can end.The end (if it happens the way the prophesies say it will) will hardly be something to cheer about, considering the fact that the Dark One is (correct me if I'm wrong) STILL getting free of his prison and (and simmering menacingly in the darkness, no doubt, or something); he hardly presents the reader with someone to HATE (as in \\"I can't wait for him to be dead). And the Forsaken seem to be dropping like flies, no matter how many times they're ressurected, the poor bastards. The Seanchan (who once seemed menacing), meanwhile, seem to be repelled every time they attack (which seems to be every other book).It's hard to cheer the downfall of evil when evil seems to hardly have any sort of palpable effect; it just sort of sits there radiating waves of menace and little else. So far, from what I remember, there's been a cold wave, a heat wave (lasted at least 2 books and in the end was dispelled by a bowl), and... boll weevils; and various other mutterings and grumblings. But characters that have names don't seem to die or even get hurt. It's the unnamed ones that get hurt and killed, but noone knows who they are, so who cares? Characters that are injured seem to heal quickly and characters who die get brought back to life. Take the example of the taint on saidin. Any man that uses it goes insane. Rand 'Al Thor is a man and no exception. We think \\"oh dear, Rand is going to go insane and kill some loved ones.\\" Except he spend books 3-8 resisting insanity until Book 9 when he figures out how to cleanse the taint (just about as anti-climactic as you can get). In short, the characters don't seem to be adversely affected by the supposedly dire events going on around them (not if they have the luxury of worrying about what to wear). They seem none the worse for wear despite their \\"troubles.\\"RJ, quite frankly, didn't pick the most compelling story to tell (for all it's window dressing and hundreds and hundreds of characters, it's really just another Little Guy vs. Dark Lord story). At some point, perhaps he realized this (maybe after the halfway decent books 1-5) and felt compelled to draw out his story even more, stringing his readers along with writing even more glib than before and prose even more bloated, the ultimate result of which, ultimately (in my opinion), is a very long-winded, very unsatisfying fantasy series."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Or just feel sorry for Jordan. I echo Jari from Sweden. I grew up reading Jordan's series and after I threw this one down in disgust I started to wonder if I had once thought his stuff was good because I didn't know any better. Or, is it just me and I've become old fast and critical and cynical? Glad to see that I'm not the only one who thinks Jordan's writing has taken a nose-dive. There are too many damn characters to keep track of--you need a character glossary at the back of the book (and there isn't one)! It's as if, for lack of real plot material, Jordan just keeps throwing in new names to keep things moving. Worse still, Jordan has developed this incredibly irritating habit of redundancy when relating his character's thoughts. Cauthon, for example, used to be one of my favorite characters, but every time we see him on the page now, he's repeating his same old obervations about women. By the end of the book you feel like you've spent way too much time in the company of one of those poor senile old men who holler out the same set of euphemisms every time they see you because that's all they can think of to say. Sad. Don't waste your time or money."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I love this seriese and I'm trying not to take this book personally, but its hard. I feel bad for every person I have turned onto WOT. Jordan and his editor have managed to turn die hard fans against them. I've kept hope that some of the side plots hinted at in ealier books would be resolved eventually, while the main plot progresssed slowly. Its hasn't happened at all. It just keeps growing and going no where. My little brother is currenlty reading book six and is loving every word. I feel bad knowing whats in store for him. I would keep hope, but I can't fathom how Jordan could address everything he has introduced with out some spin off books. It is all such a dissapointment now. I'll probably wait until the series is finished before I read another book and then I'll spend as little money as posssible."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I quit. I started reading this series in high school. I think I was able to read up to book five(?) before having to wait for the next book to be published. I graduated from college last year. I don't mind waiting years to read the next installment of a quality series but tWOT hasn't been a quality series for quite a while now. This book was the final straw."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"When I put this book down at 1:30 AM two days ago, I had only one feeling: I was angry. I was hoping, praying, that the book actually built to the end, as every book had before (including the glacial Winter's Heart). But the book went out with a whimper (barely), and I was left realizing I had wasted precious hours of sleep and would need a massive dose of caffeine to get through my law school classes in the morning.I read an earlier review which said this book started and ended where WH finished. That is not exactly true. The first 400 pages (seriously) are events BEFORE the actual end of WH. You like Rand (arguably the &quot;main&quot; main character)? Then skip to page 500, because you won't see him before then. Nynaeve? You can skip this one altogether.Why am I so angry? Let's start with the fact that this series was supposed to be about 7 books when it started. Now, we're at book 11 and there seems to always be only 2-3 more books. Add to that we have to wait 3 YEARS to find out the series is still going nowhere. I am also a reader of the Dark Tower Series. But at least Stephen King has written many books in the long hiatus, and the series is DONE in the amount of books (7) he said it would take. They just need to be edited and published, but the end is in sight. I wish that was the case here.I used to love these books, and have invested many, many hours into the series. The first few books flowed so well, there was always something happening. But that has not been the case for a few years. He just keeps adding characters (even now), and there are too many for the book to get anywhere. To be blunt, he is not a good enough writer to handle it all. My hope is that somehow this series reaches its conclusion, and does so in the next 5 years, but I am not holding my breath."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"....of course, if you are stuck to the series, this is no reason to stop now. It just leads up to a fantastic book. There is just one part in this book that throws it off balance, and that is Egwene's role. It just isn't fun to read AT ALL. 100 pages of descriptions on movements. I really like Mat's parts though, but he isn't going anywhere with that Daughter of Nine Moons! Besides from marrying her in the future, all that happened in this one is... well.. the same stuff. Perrin... hate to break it to ya, but all you have to do is send in an Asha-man in the white of the Aiel servents to an empty tent with travelling, and the take Faile, bring her back, and cry with happiness, it dousn't matter. But seriously, why not make use of the Asha-man, dangit! And Elayne is all this political talk...except only Daved makes it interesting (Can't wait until he gets kicked around by the Aei Sedai in the next one.)Anyway, the truth is, Jordan, you really have to bring back your good pace. We dont need descriptions, we need story, and I am stuck to your characters now. So I can't help but read the next ones, but make them good! Man!"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"The PUBLISHER!Listen, I love these books...books 5 and 6 were two of the best books I've ever read in the genre, but this is ridiculous.Jordan has stopped telling the stories of these heroic people, and instead is PADDING his work with endless, tiresome, and unimportant drivel.At this point in the series, do you honestly CARE what kind of velvet Elayne is wearing? Stop describing clothing and get to the point!I felt cheated and will not buy the next book until it is out in paperback...or maybe (god forbid) I'll just borrow it from the library and save the money."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This is by far the worst book in this series. If you've read the others, then you're used to Jordan taking his time with plots and characters. However, this book reaches new heights of boredom. Basically, nothing happens. No subplots are resolved, the main plot is not advanced in the slightest, and too many of the main characters are only given a scant few pages.This is largely the story of Egwene and Elayne, and hence, it is filled with page after page of squabbling women and the insignificant doings of characters you aren't given any reason to care about. This is not to say that these two characters are not interesting in their own right, but Jordan doesn't do anything interesting with them in this book. Neither character moves more than 500 yards throughout the entire book, and after slogging through hundreds of pages, you're not even rewarded with a climax.Sadly, this book is a huge let-down after such an investment by Jordan's readers. You're left with the strong impression that the author has nothing new to say and is spinning his wheels at this point."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I now know how to wash silk by hand, adjust a shawl to show varying degrees of emotions and how to willow weevils out of wheat and beans. All things I really didnt need to know to enjoy this story. I could tolerate the story not moving forward if something more happened at least once in while as we were are waiting for the big bang. There wasnt even any great sex, that at least is something to do while waiting for the world to end. Something new, anything new and exciting would have made the wait for this book worthwhile. Pleassssse Mr Jordan, write faster and get on with it. Buffy's Apocolypse is coming faster than yours."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I know I will draw much ire for my criticism of Jordon on this latest farce, but I am compelled to believe that this most recent book was more about the contract to write a book than do any justice to the world he has created. It's fluff, filler, boring! I found myself skipping entire paragraphs and then pages and finally chapters,looking for something to develop. I feel I could just abandon the series and never pick it up again with much regret, especially when stuff as mediocre as this last book is touted as being akin to greats like Tolkien. It will take alot for Jordon to redeem himself, in my opinion, or even match what has gone before in the next few books. I may never know, because as it stands now I just want my money and time back."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"A waste of time!! Wasn't this series originally supposed to end with the 10th book? There is no good reason to drag this out.Jordan has lost the respect and appeal he gained with the earlier books in the series.Guess I'll reread Glen Cook's Black Co. series again(best ending ever!) and hope George R.R. Martin finishes A Feast for Crows soon.Boy, did he ever raise the bar with the Fire &amp; Ice series!! Better to do it his way and take more time and deliver something that satisfies than the tripe Jordan has turned out the past couple of books."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Slow. Very little plot advancement--even less than the previous book in the series. Jordan took nearly 400 pages to catch all of the plot lines up to the ending of book 9 (Winter's Heart). Too many characters to keep track of, and one of the main characters, Nynaeve, didn't even appear in this book. Someone compared this book to &quot;filler&quot; and I have to agree. Come on Jordan, finish the series. This is getting old. On the plus side, Jordan is a good writer and is able to make me feel like I'm there. I also enjoyed the interplay between Mat Cauthon and the Daughter of the Nine Moons."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Let me start out by saying that I would defend every other book in the Wheel of Time series. Though some were certainly better than others, I liked every one and have reread the series numerous times. But, Mr. Jordan has finally written a book that even I can't say I like. I was unaware that it was possible to write a 700-page book about ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. But, I now know that it is possible.I look forward to the next work in the Wheel of Time series. I hope that Mr. Jordan can return to his previous standards of excellence. And, for those of you who plan to continue the series to its finale, I would recommend reading this book just so that you catch the bits and pieces of seemingly important information that Mr. Jordan sprinkles in. However, don't go into this with any high expectations."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Despite the waning of this series, &quot;The Wheel of Time&quot; has consistently provided; believable characters, thick and rich detail, well thought out development, well paced action, and an amazing world parallel to our lives but with enchanting differences. Crossroads of Twilight has NONE of that. The characters feel stale, and uninteresting. The detail that Jordan had so mastered was taken to excruciating levels. I couldn't stand reading through four pages about what the feel of the camp and the inside of a tent was. After it was already introduced!Each of the characters separate plot lines lead to nothing. No form of resolution, no answers to previous questions, and tedious new questions.Ether Robert Jordan is trying to sap every last dime out of this series, he has the worst case of writers block ever (despite almost 700 pages 0 content!), or he is senile.DON'T BUY THIS BOOK UNTELL THE NEXT ONE COMES OUT. Then make sure that one is not tripe either."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"If I had it to do over again, I would wait until book 11 comes out and then read COT. In this volume each of the major characters makes a small, incremental step toward the next book while managing not to do anything interesting.Very disappointing."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Well Robert Jordan has managed to resurrect the writing style evidenced in the first 6 books of the series which was sorely lacking in books 7-9. However, in nearly 700 pages, virtually no questions from the previous book were answered. In addition, very little action occurred: Elayne still does not have the throne, Mat is not married, Egwene was not taken/unified the White Tower, Perrin still has not rescued Faile and Rand does not seem to be one step closer to the final battle.Robert Jordan... if you or your publisher read these reviews, I think many of your fans, like myself who are teetering on the edge of never buying another one of your books out of sheer frustration and disappointment, deserves a public explanation. I'd like to know what you have up your sleeve for the series and when we can expect it to end.I'd like to draw your attention to the multitude of authors that have completed series in four books and less. Many others have set the bar yet you seem to fall short at over 6,000 pages published with no end in sight. Will we be left waiting another three years for you to bring this series to a close? If so, I don't have the patience for it.Even if you are an avid reader of the series, I think you should wait for the paperback and seriously give consideration to abandoning the series."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I'm a big fan of WOT, but this book is very dissapointing. At least in the last book, we had something big happen with Rand cleansing Saidin. In this book, very little happens with the plot and a lot of it is just people who can channel noticing Rand wielding a ton of the One Power and their reactions. One of the few good things in CoT is that we get to see more of Mat."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Up until a couple of days ago, I thought I was a diehard WoT fan. Sure the last few books have been a little bit slower, but there has been something interesting or exciting happening in all of them. The last book ended with one of the most momentous developments in the entire series....but it was barely addressed in this book! Almost nothing happened in this book. No single storyline was even close to resolved. Rand had about 20-40 pages in the entire book and that didn't even come until past the five hundred page mark. I'm sure that Robert Jordan is doing exactly what he wants to with this series, and that's fine. It's HIS series. But after this book, a think that there will be a lot of fans who no longer have the patience or the desire to follow him in what has become a long-winded, irrelevant hollow shell of what could have been a great saga."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Wasn't this supposed to be a trilogy?? I think Jordan has derailed any hope of making this series a classic for posterity. It started our with such promise. The richness in imagery is still there, but the bible isn't this long. I can only wonder at his motives. After the first three versions, each has become more protracted with less movement forward in the plot. He should have written a trilogy and then added supplemental books. I feel I have been had and after watching an interview in which his arrogance was apparent, I am ready to scrap the series. Here it is folks, the ending: Rand perishes in the grand finale at Mount Doom (whoops wrong book) and his buddies return to the shire (whoops). Some get married and live happily ever after and some carry the scars to their deaths. And, everyone gets stilled and the fireworks guys take over."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"It has been 2-1/2 years since book 9 came out. At the end of it, Rand cleansed the male half of the true source, Saidin. Now in the 10th book Jordan spends the first two-thirds of the book explaining what everyone else is doing during the cleansing. I agree with the other comments posted here. This book is a very big disappointment. Jordan had a lot of fans in the beginning, but they are starting to dwindle. If he doesn't finish this series soon, his series will be come to known as a bad one. It already has the makings of one, and he is walking a thin line right now in whether he'll be able to finish this well or not. He says it will take at least 3 more books to finish it. I hope he is reading this because I want to say Mr. Jordan, enough with all of the descriptive details. Please leave some of it to our imaginations. Your descriptions, while good, are lengthy and overdone. You lose us in the plot, and all of the descriptions is what is dragging this series on. Please finish this series at the end of Book 12. If your next books are anywhere near like this one, then prepare for ultimate failure. Other than that, be prepared to fill in a few words here and there that he left out of sentences. And like the others said, not much happens and more doors are opened. I only hope, for Jordan's sake, that the plot gets a lot better in Book 11 (which if he plans to keep us interested needs to be released next year)."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This book is perhaps the most boring out of Jordan's series. I thought book 9 would have taken the award, however it seems he must have divided book 9/10 from one long boring read, into 2 boring reads.The only reason this book rates as far as 1 star is I finally get a little glimpse at Mat, who happens to be my favorite character. The chapters with Parrin literally put me to sleep. The book was a total disappointment. It is SHORT. Yes it has been a long time since Jordan has done a long book with some meat.I read quite a lot, and I am of the thought that a 12 book series, where 2/12 books are just prologue for a \\"great ending\\" shows Jordan has lost his fire.The plot moves too slowly. At the end of each chapter I WANT TO put the book down and sleep, not read on like in earlier books.In short: this book reads like a bad episode of The Simpsons. It is a series we have grown to love, yet it disappoints when it falls short of the mark. Two + years per book is discouraging, especially when the last 4-5years have produced subpar books that if they were first editions would have have been published."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"While the book is written well, it is filled with a whole bunch of nothing. I think this is a dirty trick the author is playing. There are so many stories being told, that at this rate, the series will require 50 or more books to complete the story. It's time to start tying them together. I really don't want to be 50 years older waiting for the end of the story. But then, I suppose that is good for his wallet. I say, get the story told!!!"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This story really needs to move along. The book is beautifully written but is very frustrating for fans of the WOT saga like me who are more interested in the storyline than character details. It barely moves forward from the end of Winters Heart when Rand cleaned the taint of Saidin. Most of the book deals with the crossroads that the other characters find themselves during that time. Matt is interesting as usual and the others plod along. The new character of Tuon introduced in WOT-9 is quite good. I personally am at the crossroads of deciding how much longer to stick to this series that has truly had some moments but is now testing my patience. If you haven't bought it yet, you can't possibly be fanatic enough to make it worth the hardcover price."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I really don't want to be reading book 52 of this series some day.

It won't feel so much like a sleeper then (I hope). This book feels more a setup for the next novel.My fears are that RJ is getting afraid of intense action or having trouble maneuvering his characters toward Tarmon Gaidan (the final climactic battle).Maybe he needs more long-range planning."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Winter's Heart left readers with quite a cliffhanger. Crossroads of Twilight does nothing to alleviate that sensation. The better portion of this book is devoted to what the rest of the world was doing when Winter's Heart came to an end.And that's pretty much it.Like Lord of Chaos and Crown of Swords, this book represents a transitional phase of the story. Readers can probably look forward to another transitional book before the action picks up in earnest again. Robert Jordan's going to lose a lot of faithful readers with this book, and I can't say I blame them for it.And yet, it was still a halfway decent book.When this epic story is finished, this book will seem just another piece in the series. Granted, Jordan could have condensed this book down into the first chapter of a better book, but if he didn't take the time to describe everything it just wouldn't FEEL right.I gave this book 3 stars. It represents a low point in the story, but these things do need to be explained. The best thing in the book is a chapter involving Perrin and a handful of captive Shaido. I won't spoil it for those who haven't read it, but suffice it to say the chapter OOZES emotion. It's the most compelling piece of work in the entire series.But don't rush out and buy this.

A great story has a beginning, a set-up, a climax, and a follow through. We are now on the precipce of the climax, but the follow through (maybe another novel after the Last Battle?) will be a grand work of art.Reading between the lines, I feel as if the end will be like an Illuminator's display...full of action and brilliance that will be a delight to remember and talk about later with other people who are fans.As for this book, the hits just keep on coming! Another set-up novel to be sure, but a great story takes the time to put each piece in it's place so that when ready, a slight pull here, and a little tug there, it all falls into place almost effortlessly. This installment is getting everything into place but looking at the grand picture, it'll be a doozy when the climax and follow through get here!

I mean, what's the rush, right?I gave the book three stars more on the merit of the previous novels (which you have to read, this isn't a stand-alone novel). I enjoy the world he's created. However, I agree with the many, many other reviews here. Just when things start to get going, the book ends. And I really didn't get into it until about halfway (page 330 or so).I think the problem is that, with the breaks between books, it's taking Jordan a good 200 or 300 pages before he can completely immerse himself in the world he's created. This leads to irrelevant descriptions and pages upon pages of no plot advancement. He describes things I, and apparently many others, just don't care about. And what was once a keen story is becoming a drag. I think it would benefit the author if he wrote a good hundred or so pages to get in the groove before starting future books in the series.Having said that, I will continue to purchase the books as they come out.

Even with the slow pace I think that this book is still twice as good as everything else on the market. I have invested years into reading this series(since my junior year in high school, and I'm almost 30!), and I hope that it does eventually get finished. My greatest fear(when it comes to reading) is that this story will never be completed.

You could easily skip this book and go straight into number 11, if it ever comes out, and not miss a step.Don't get me wrong, Jordan is as colorful and detailed as ever, and that is the problem, I don't need to know EVERY LITTLE DETAIL OF EVERYTHING, just the main points!At this rate, the end won't come till book 15-20, and who knows if he is even going to be alive by then to finish it."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"It appears that Jordan has forgotten for most authors, the key to a good story is that there is a good story. One that brings you from a beginning to a hopefully rousing end.I guess he is too caught up in the warp and the woof of the weave of time that always is a beginning; not THE beginning, but a beginning, and absolutely never, never an ending.Frankly, no one would have missed anything in the plot development if this last volume of WOT was balefired out of existence.I most regret having bought all his books in hardcover... now it seems that they, if ever completed, would take a space on my bookshelf larger than the encyclopedia britannica, and yet tell a story that goes nowhere"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Since his terrific start in this series Jordan has generally gone downhill with the plot dragging on and on. In volume nine, however, he did recapture some of his storytelling abilities and, with his normal style, provided a huge and exciting finish. His latest endeavor, however, fails to move the plot along to any reasonable degree. The situation with Perrin and Faile has hardly changed. Ditto for Elayne. The Mat and Tuon relationship could have been handled in a few paragraphs, Rand is almost missing from this volume, and the marvelous feat accomplished by Rand and Nynaeve in volume nine was hardly even recognized. If this work were condensed into about two to three chapters it might be a good start for a book."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"You know I think I could of forgiven this book if it had another 100 or so pages in it that dealt with Rand, I have been waiting for several books for Logain to show up........well lets skim over that very important meeting and get back to Perrin Brooding. Even a little bit of talk of what went on in the last book would of helped, Rand did nothing and said nothing, heck he barely appeared, there were some major things that happened in this book, but they happened &quot;off screen&quot; while we got to learn how to hand wash silk and how Elayne likes her tea. The influence of the dark one is spreading, and how do we know this.... weevels in the grain. Give me a break, this was so obviously a rush job thrown out to cover a deadline (a deadline they missed the first time around) that it is just crazy.You want to skip the book well I'll cover the high points for you: Perrin made camp, Elayne took a bath, Mat flirted with a girl, Egwene went to bed after a long day at work and Rand made a guest appearance in the book that is supposed to be about him. Now off to book 11 with you, you know all you need to know about book 10."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This book is a waste of time. As some reviewers have noted, there are about 30 worthwhile pages in the entire book. What do I mean by that? Well there are about 30 pages in which the action moves forward, or decisions are made. In the other 650 or so pages, we get extensive detail regarding a day or so in the lives of a number of characters. Much of that time is spent reflecting on the various quandries facing the characters. The problem is that they are uniformly uninteresting. If reading 100+ page descriptions of how each character reacts to the main events of book nine sound riveting, then by all means add this to your cart, otherwise read something else.The reason I, for one, was immediately hooked by the early books of the series, was the excellent pacing, interesting characters and the excellent world creation. Jordan has abandoned any pretense of story telling and has become a medieval chronicler, merely jotting down details without thought to their importance.As many have noted, Martin's book isn't too far away at this point, so pre-order that and re-read the early Jordan if your fantasy fix must be sated."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I mean by this.... Book six is really a continuation of book five but with to many pages to fit in one binding. After reading this book I see it as the first half of one very long installment. The other reviewers are correct though, nothing really happens. Also, one reviewer mentions that you should wait and see how many more books there will be. According to Mr. Jordan, as of last fall, there will be two more installments."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I can't express how disappointing this book was. In the prologue it all seemed so promising and then NOTHING ELSE HAPPENED. Not a single thing in the prologue was developed more than 10 pages beyond the prologue. Rand was in it for a sum total of 15 or 20 pages, and he DID NOTHING. Not to mention i think they mentioned the cleansed saidin TWICE, and just IN PASSING. Also, there were no bad-guy chapters, so we got nothing new there, not to mention the fact that the boring-as-hell Perrin sidestory took a needless boring-as-hell detour to a stupid pointless town and took up half the book. All in all, it .... Please make the next one even half decent. After Winter's Heart, I was just so sorely disappointed. I ordered this book last August for god's sake. So disappointed. One extra star for an interesting prologue, but none for the entire rest."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Robert Jordan has proven himself to be an excellent writer in the majority of his books in this series, but it seems that the pace of his story has become excessively lethargic. This book continues a disturbing trend of focusing on less-than-pertinent minutiae in a plodding play-by-play of the charaters' actions. Until the last 30 pages or so there is no actual advancement of the plot, and even then all he provides us is foreshadowing of important events that, given his current plot pacing, may not occur until a thirteenth or fourteenth book.While I admire Mr. Jordan's style of writing, I find myself having to be an apologist to my friends regarding the quality of this book and the future direction of this series.In short, I am unsure where he is going with his magnificent story. I apprehensively await the next installment."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"While I wasn't expecting his book to be action packed, I found myself turning page after page wondering when SOMETHING, ANYTHING would happen. I did get one smidgin of action near the very end with an apparent abduction of one of the main characters, but the situation never evolved. Let me state that I am a HUGE fan of the WOT series. I think the whole mythos is wonderfully developed, highly entertaining, and intellectually stimulating. However, I read this book with the thought that Robert Jordan must not be able to decide where he wants to go with this. I felt the book was written as a money maker, NOT a continuation of an incredibly rich tapestry. This is the first WOT book that actually bored me. Not your best work Mr. Jordan. I'll hold out hope for the next installment."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Wow. That's all I can say. I buy a book, actually excited from the end of book nine (where Saidin was cleansed) and read... and read... and read. After almost 650 pages of reading, I get to the *first* chapter that features the Dragon Reborn (Rand) - who is, supposedly, the &quot;main&quot; character and the most important figure to grace the land in 3000 years. Once I get to his chapters, I convince myself that AT LEAST 90% of the rest of the book must be devoted to him, seeing as how it was so starved of him in the beginning. But I kept reading. And I finished the book. And two chapters were what I got. Two chapters, out of thiry. Paid by the word? Yes. Paid by the book? Yes. But, if Robert Jordan intents to write any more books about the Dragon Reborn and Tarmon Gai'don, perhaps he should *include* the MAIN character in his books. Otherwise, he should not even consider them part of &quot;The Wheel of Time&quot;, as they truly aren't about the Last Battle. What he wants to do is write a 3000 page index of what the styles, accents, colors, and tendencies of every individual or object in any given country is like under 30 different circumstances.Simply Ridiculous."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Go outside and find a nice stone. Then give it a good toss as far as you can. If the entire series was a cross-country trip, you just threw the stone as far as this book advances the plot. I just wanted to try to put that in perspective.I think everyone has already weighed in with how much of a disappointment this book was. I was a pretty staunch Robert Jordan fan. Heck, I even liked the books 7-9, which many people have been ripping on. But this book I cannot excuse. I can't defend RJ this time. I really didn't like this book. It was a waste of paper, time and money. Calling it Book 10 is misleading. It would be more appropriate to call it Book 9b.This was the only series that I've been going out and coughing up money for the hardcover as soon as it came out. But no longer. I think that honor is going to be transferred to George R.R. Martin (A Song of Fire and Ice series).If you want to skip this book, go ahead. You won't miss much. Just ask someone else what happened. It should take about 5-10 seconds for them to tell you."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Having been newly introduced to the series, I read book one to book ten within two to three weeks instead of being forced into waiting two-year periods for the next book to come out. That is why I am lenient with my review.If you have read the series in one shot like I did, and if you are adept at quickly flipping pages, you will enjoy COT for its few fragments of text having qualities reminiscent of his earlier books. This is easily achieved by skipping any chapters with the following words: Egwene, Elayne, Perrin, Black Ajah, Darkfriends, and/or Forsaken.While I find it regrettable that characters like Perrin became uninteresting, there are a few plot twists that keep you hooked to the series. You will especially want to read about Mat's current situation with the Seanchan, and the new plot developments involving Logain, Taim and Rand. Like CDs, sometimes all it takes are a few songs within a pile of filler songs to make them worthwhile.Any missing holes encountered while skimming the book can be remedied via google. I recommend searching for character databases since many new, but unimportant characters are introduced whether they are Cairhenin House leaders or Darkfriend/Forsaken cover names."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"NOTHING HAPPENS IN THIS BOOK! What on earth is going on? This series used to be fantastic, but it has digressed into something less appealing than a glass of Metamucil. These characters used be be wonderful, the writing was eloquent and engaging, and things *happenned*. But now, I read 200 pages of badly written narrative to learn that absolutely nothing has occurred. Forget about it and go and read something else. The ingredients on the side of your cereal box will be more interesting."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Now I've read all of Jordan's books. There's a lot in there that's good, and the series started off so well. Somewhere however, the series has become lost and mired in intricate plot that has no momentum or direction. Many have blasted Jordan, but I would suggest another source: THE EDITOR. Who in the heck could be signing off on this and saying with a straight face, &quot;Yeah, that's great Robert. Maybe you should introduce a few more plot lines and characters&quot;. Fire the editor, get Jordan back on track and let's bring this puppy to conclusion. Write another series in the same world later, but for the love of all that is good, please finish it. I hope the folks at TOR are reading these reviews."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"It's true that you wouldn't lose a stitch of the story as a whole if you skipped this one. It is amazing how so much was written without moving the story a day beyond the book before this one...it is like a politician chanting his campaign speech...I'm a WoT follower, the story as a whole is fantastic and even though this particular book doesn't push the story along I still had to give it two stars because it is still a well written book. Creative and intricate...just like a politician's speel. Colorful yet empty.You are going to want to read it. I wouldn't buy it if I were you...get a copy from the library, borrow it from a friend who like you was aching for the series to continue and couldn't refrain from buying the hardcover version...but don't you buy it.I wouldn't have added this one to my collection, but I got it as a gift. And I'll keep it just to fillout the whole set.AGAIN, you are going to want to read it, even with all the negative comments...do so...but just enter the story with the frame of mind that it is just filler and you might even enjoy it."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I have waited for a climax to this series for a long time now. The early books were interesting and had exciting settings and action. Book 10 on the other hand was like watching old reruns from Eastenders. It seemed to go on for ever with very little excitement.I am beginning to wonder if we will ever get to the end of the wheel of time before the end of this millenia."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"When I started reading the series many years ago I really loved the books. They were detailed but not so much as to get confusing. There seemed to be a point to the story that would be answered as you went along. The character's were rich and complex but yet understandable. I agree that the books got more boring as you went along, but that is inevitable in a series this long. &quot;Cross Roads of Twilight&quot; is probably the worst, most boring book I have ever read! It seems as if Robert Jordan has lost his way or his mind! You go through most of the Book without even hearing about the most important character &quot;The Dragon Reborn&quot; Rand. There are so many subplots, enemy's that you only hear about in one book and disappear,unimportant character's and people spead out everywhwere that you are compelled not to care! If you want to read this one better check it out at the Library because it is a serious waste of green(at least at the hardcover price). I think Jordan also needs to think about putting out a book every 6-8 mos intead of every couple of years. It's just slows the already slow pace down even further. I hope for the readers sake and his own that Robert Jordan Kicks it up a notch in the next couple of books. I still enjoy the basic story but am just not happy with where it is going."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"The Wheel of Time had a strong begining, but, personally, I found my interest waning over seven books ago. Strangely enough, despite the paper that has been wasted providing fodder for this series, the characters do not seem to have grown much at all-they've accumulated experiences, but no new maturity.I consider myself a highly selective reader, and the Wheel of Time has sunk so low with this newest waste of time that I am ashamed I ever brought any of these books. R. Jordan mistakes quantity for quality; unlike authors such as George R. R. Martin, Frank Herbert or James Clavell, he doesn't know when new characters start weighing down the overall story, nor does he exercise restraint when constructing descriptions or dialogue. As a result, the only thing that really separates the characters from one another are personality quirks (I regret to say that most W.o.T. characters don't really have what you could call 'fully realized personalities') and the type of clothes that they wear.I admit that I was mainly interested in the Tower conflict. Unfortunately, after more than five years reading about Aes Sedai politics, various descriptions of Aes Sedai clothing and the personality quirks of particular Aes Sedai and/or their warders, I have been surprised to find that I no longer care.To be honest, I have been reading the last few books just to get to the end. This series might have done better in a trilogy format, as well as a good editor. Unfortunately, it seems to be bogged down in repetitive plot contrivances, bland dialogue and explanations of politics that make you wonder whether the combined mental age of the characters is four years old or less.I wouldn't wish this horror on my worst enemy. Steer clear of this series before you waste your time and money. Try an author that will make you think as well as entertain you. I suggest Frank Herbert, James Clavell, George R. R. Martin, and Yukio Mishima."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Mr. Jordan has taken character and plot development to a new level...total boredom. I just read in one reader review that he, Jordan, said that he is writing for himself. Good for you Robert, another innovation in literature...well more like commercial writing, the author doesn't care what his readers think. I suppose that's fair. After reading this book I realized that I no longer care what happens... so I made up my own ending. At the current rate not many of us will survive to read the ending anyway. Actually I'm beginning to think that it would be more fun if the Dark One and his Darkfriends win in the end."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I want to preface this review by saying I've enjoyed most of this series, even the last few books but after reading the final pages of 'Crossroads of Twilight' I found myself pacing my apartment trying to think of a way to express my outrage, finally I just threw the book across the room. This is the first time in my life that finishing a book actually made me furious. I don't mind when a story leaves a few threads dangling to increase tension or to keep me involved but this novel takes that to a ridiculous extreme ... this 'book' was the last straw. Jordan's continuing saga has been leaving more and more threads unresolved as the series has progressed and it's finally gone so far that NOTHING is resolved. You could go from book 9 to 11 without missing anything but a bit of exposition about as important as what Rand had for breakfast or what color of socks Perrin prefers. It's not even the artificial extension of this series that really makes me mad, many authors have done this and been entertaining (one of my favorite literary series is 27 books long so far and I enjoy each one). It's Jordan's obvious contempt for his audience that really burns me, he didn't even try to hide the fact that this novel is meaningless filler. How could such a promising and rich story become so empty? Somehow Mr.Jordan has taken a universe, characters and story I love and drawn them out to the point I no longer care how it ends. I will never pick up another 'Wheel of Time' novel unless it is the last and likely not even then. To say I'm disappointed with this book would be a dramatic understatement. DO NOT, under any circumstances, purchase this book. If you absolutely must read it buy a used paperback or better yet get it from a library."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Harriet - What I need is an idea for a new bookRobert - I got it!

I love the series, and I enjoy epic novels of large proportions, but this story is getting out of hand. To anyone who was excited at the end of Winter's Heart with Rand's cleansing of the male half of the source, you'll be happy (being sarcastic) to know he appears in only one chapter of this book. Instead of following Rand who you are expecting to really bring it on now that he got rid of the Taint, you instead will be bored to tears following along, for a good portion of this book, Elayne Trakand and her attempt to gain control of Andor. The only chapters I want to read are ones that center on Rand or Mat because they are the only ones doing anything of interest at this point in the series. Even the chapters on Perrin are a drag. Since the end of book nine, you would expect Rand to really start to whoop on the bad guys.. but no, he's &quot;recovering&quot;. Also I think the amount of time that has passed between Winter's Heart and CoT to be about 2 days, since the first third of the book shows various wielders of saidin and saidar taking notice of the amount of the One Power being channelled by Rand and Nynaeve as they cleanse the male half of the source which happened in the last book. Also I don't see how this series will ever end since Rand has killed off at least half of the Forsaken, but most of them have been brought back to life. I have owned this book for almost a year now and have not even made it halfway through. The next book in the series better focus on Rand and be packed with action, or I don't know that I'll be able to finish off this saga."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Awful. Just awful.The WOT series has been on a slow decline for a while now, and CoT is Jordan hitting bottom. Within the innumerable pages, nothing happens of any substance. The &quot;action&quot; is a few small happenings that could easily have been covered in a 20 page prologue. There is so much exposition, tedious description, and murky semi-political maneuverings as to make the book close to incomprehensible. This is a far cry from the moving, action-packed and wonderful books such as The Great Hunt and The Dragon Reborn.If Jordan has not been seduced by the lure of putting out awful books to make money, then he has certainly lost control of his grip on the plot and the characters. They engage in needless trivialities, wander aimlessly, and do not advance the stories. Characters that were once fun to read are now tedious and painful.I will personally not be purchasing any more WoT. Jordan has shown that he can't keep the story together, and I refuse to pay $30 for a piece of drech such as this. I got more worth for my money using the pages as tinder in my fireplace.A great epic has died at the hands of it's creator."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"It appears that many reviewers agree with me when I say that this book was awful. I still don't know how I made it all the way to the end of this volume, which in retrospect was nothing more than 800 pages of fluff.I noticed the same problem with Book 9 in the series. While Jordan's attention to detail is undeniably incredible, he has clearly sacrificed plot development, character development, and any and all excitment in the story. He manages to write 150 pages per character, yet they accomplish absolutely nothing of any significance to the story line. I can't even say I'm remotely interested in what happens next anymore.The beginning of this series was great. The story was exciting, the characters were complex and interesting, and their challenges seemed real. However, as the series continued, Jordan focused more on the color of his characters' clothing and the expressions on their faces than the adventures and challenges each one faces. And amazingly, each book has become more pointless than the last. What could have been an epic has become nothing more than words on a page.The only thing this series is good for now is killing trees and killing time. If Jordan's next book was to be the guaranteed conclusion to the series, then maybe I'd read it. However, if he continues to write about nothing, then I'm giving up. And seeing as how he's chosen to write a prequel (which I've read is more like a re-run than a prequel), then I think it's time to put this series to bed. Sorry Robert, you had me, then you lost me. What a waste of my time this series has been."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I enjoyed the lambasting you all gave Mr. Jordan for this pale excuse for a book.

However, it will not force me to pay high hardcover prices - I will wait for paperback or the library to read the next installment. As indicated in many of the other reviews here, the first 6-7 books maintained an attention-grabbing pace, although it had become difficult by book 5 or 6 to keep track of the substantial number of characters and plot lines. I reread the previous books once to catch back up, but with 10 books, I don't think I can spare the time (or have the interest for books 7-10) to do so again.The quality of the writing is still OK, but there are so many characters, plot lines, and colors of silk to make dresses that it is difficult to recall what has happend to/in each. If I wanted to know extreme details of medieval dress, I would probably find books on that subject, not read the WOT. Hopefully, the pace will pick up in the next book and some of these plot lines will be resolved. I am quickly (or slowly, if you go by the pace of the books) losing interest in what began as an excellent series. Almost 700 pages of medieval fashion design and essentially no plot resolution, character development, or interesting events...I don't think so."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I'm giving this one another one-star performance due to the insulting and sanctimonious comments offered by defenders of the book.

The last book was a little slow, but there was a climax to the book, the story progressed. This book had no climax and very little story progression. In fact it was mostly story regression. The first half of the book was set before the ending of the last book. Nothing happened in this book. Rand was barely mentioned. Perrin was still looking for Faile. Mat was still trudging north. Egwene was still waiting. And Elayne was still pregnant. It's likely a series reader could skip this book and miss nothing in the story.I'll read the next book of course, I just hope Jordan actually moves the story along next time. He continues to introduce new characters which I don't care about. I wish he would focus on the characters which the readers do care about. Also, Jordan repeats himself so much its getting irritating. It is was fine at first, but if I have to read how much the men and/or women gossip according to the opposite sex, I will pull out my hair.

In the entire book, nothing happened to advance the story. There was not a single confrontation involving channeling. Come to think of it, there was not a single confrontation.

Decisions will prove pivotal, as the turning point in the Wheel of Time seems at hand. However, many have reached different crossroads and twilight is now for choices that must be made even when the options seem negative.Perrin considers obtaining help from those he does not trust to help liberate his incarcerated wife. Not sure what to do except flee from the Seanchan, Mat takes the abducted daughter of the Nine Moons, Tuon with him while she seductively toys with him. The sieges at Tar Valon and Caemlyn continue unabated leaving insiders to ponder an escape attempt. Egwene the Amyrlin tries to unite the rebel Aes Sedai against the Dark One and considers an alliance with the Asha'man. The Dragon Reborn has eradicated the Dark One from the True Source, but wonders if he should negotiate with the Seanchan or perhaps Perrin for the next trial. Everything is slowly changing with any one decision could prove the pivotal turning point in the Wheel of Time.Book ten of the Wheel of Time series adds depth and complexity to an already deeply textured landscape. However, as been the case of the last few books, the numerous involved subplots seem on a slow speed treadmill as no forward motion occurs and little action happens. Fans of Robert Jordan will cherish learning even more about the prime players as they struggle to decide what to do next as few writers can dig as insightfully deep as this author does. However, readers who relish action need to look elsewhere.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This book is setting up the final dash to the end of the story.

It is also the first time in the entire series we arrive at a book where the major plot lines are converging."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"By now I'm sure you've read enough reviews saying nothing happens in this book and to be honest there are no big events like in most of the earlier books, but hey so what.I like to think that Jordan decided now was a good time to bring us up to date with a few of the many hundreds of subplots hes weaved over the previous nine books in an attempt to set us for things to come. After finishing this book i get the feeling we are on the verge of some monumental events in the next book. EVERY major character is involved in some sort of standoff.I have to say i didn't feel this way the minute i had put down the book, after waiting for so long my expectation was built up to quite a level, but I'm more than willing to stick by the series to see what happens next and to be fair thats what Jordan always did best leaving you wanting more.If hes reading the same reviews I am hes sitting at home saying &quot;Conclusions???? When did i ever write those before anyway? You'll get the biggest conclusion of all when I'm good and ready and not a minute before, now where did i leave that new subplot?&quot;In conclusion, if you like the WOT series don't despair, buy the book you know you want to really"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This book is yet another masterpiece in the Wheel Of Time series. It shocks me to see so many people furious at Robert Jordan and claiming this to be a terrible book. This far into the series, I would think people would have become accustomed to the powerful world of symbolism and subtlety that Jordan has carefully created. Every description makes the world come alive around the characters, and every smoothing of skirts or tapping of tea cups breathes additional life into them.Despite what many seem to think, the plot of this book does contain a huge amount of action. It is more internal action shaping the characters and their direction then external action such as battles and conflict. Yet even then, there remains plenty of flashy combat to keep the reader on the edge of their seat.Don't let all the negative reviews dissuade you from reading this novel. Those who let themselves get absorbed into the world of The Wheel Of Time will find it a richly rewarding experience. However, Those who lack the patience to immerse themselves within the story in a rush to finish it may find it lacking."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I believe that most of the reviews for Crossroads of Twilight are a little harsh. It's obviously difficult to maintain the amazing level of writing Jordan displayed in the first six novels of the WOT series, and although I am slightly disapointed that Jordan's writing has tapered off a bit, I think CoT was still a great read.I agree that Jordan goes in depth into too many characters, but when the seven or eight characters I'm really compelled to read about are mentioned, it makes it all the more exciting. If you've already read the first nine WOT books, you have to continue reading, because Jordan is still on of the best fantasy authors out there."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"ok (...)i just finished listening to y'all write those terrible things about the books. I have to say that it must really be crappy to read the books out of order! my uncle came and visited us in october (he was on book 5) and told us that this was a good series and we should read it. my mom went out and bought the first book and started reading in January. I started in February and finished yesterday (the 16th). my uncle is still on book 5. i liked all of the books, however, i must agree that this one moved a little slow. When you all complain about the flustered Aes Sedai smoothing their skirts, did you ever stop to think about the fact that maybe he's emphasising that for a reason? obviously not. for anyone out there who wants to read the books, read them in succession and don't read other books in between-from other peoples reviews, it seems to help to read them all at once."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"The Wheel of Time series is \\"New Age\\" fantasy. Channeling, a new age technique, is the only form of magic in this series. The series GARBAGE! I've read much better fantasy than Robert Jordan. For example, Terry Goodkind's Sword of Truth series is 100 times BETTER than the Wheel of Time! I wasted my time reading the 1st 6 books, and I am glad I had the sense to stop there! Don't waste your money buying JUNK! Don't waste your time reading this JUNK!"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Before I say anything, I will straight out just say that Robert Jordan is my favorite author of all time. I like a lot of fantasy authors, but the Wheel of Time is the best series I have ever read in my opinion. I really enjoyed all of Jordan's Wheel of Time novels including Crossroads of Twilight, but I must admit that I was a bit disappointed with the ending. The main reason for this is that all of the other Wheel of Time novels ended in an explosive climatic ending that contained major relevations. The kinds of endings that make you stay up until 4 AM because you just can't sleep until you finish.In my opinion, Crossroads of Twilight didn't have a very climatic ending at all. It opened the doors for many future events, but the ending was anti-climatic. I also have to agree with some of the other reviewers that there was a bit too much focus on various political situations that didn't seem to lead to anything. I like Elayne as a character, but I just felt that there was too much focus on her that didn't include any action.However, saying that, the chapters that had Mat (my favorite main character...afterall, nothing beats having the Dark One's own luck), Rand, Perrin, and even Egwene were fantastic. Anyways, the bottom-line is that the book is still definitely worth buying in my opinion as are all of the Wheel of Time novels. I just felt the book could have been even better."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This is one of the best installment in robert jordans series.

No, we haven't returned to the days of \\"a Forsaken must die in the last chapter of each book\\" installments that began the series, and that seem so wildly popular amongst a certain subset of the fan base (&lt;whine>\\"Why isn't anything _happening?_\\"&lt;/whine>). And yes, I was a little exasperated when I realized that two-thirds of the book would be gone before we even pulled even with the last chapter of book 9.However, this is still a very good, extremely well-written book. I rate it a weak 4 stars, or a strong 3 stars. Count me amongst the camp that enjoys detailed explanations of the world and its characters. (Call me crazy, but I actually read every word of Les Miserables, another book where people like to say \\"it's good, but only if you skip over those 100 page chapters where Hugo talks about French history.\\")In books 7, 8, and 9, people complained that major plot lines and characters were left out. So in this book, we go into relative depth on four to five major plotlines instead of our customary two. And what is the response? Clamoring for Mr. Jordan to \\"leave something out,\\" to \\"get to the point,\\" et cetera.Step back and see the big picture, folks! Having just finished rereading the entire series right before this book was released, I am able to see the bigger picture of this story better than people who read Winter's Heart 2 years ago and then picked up Crossroads of Twilight without any refresher. And you know what I found? The story is definitely moving; it is definitely progressing. But it is doing so at a scale that is larger than any one book. Upset that Perrin wasn't included in book 8? Reread the whole series. You'll see that his story line is touched on late in book 7 and early in book 9. Mr. Jordan actually does an amazing job of advancing all of his story lines at a good pace, but you have to read at least several books in sequence in order to appreciate it. Reading any one book by itself, particularly after a long delay, does not do it justice.Now some will claim this further evidence that Mr. Jordan is an inept storyteller; that each and every book must have a set up, transition, climax, etc. I choose instead to appreciate the entire series as I believe Mr. Jordan intended it, and marvel at the epic scale on which this story is written.All of that said, I look forward to the series beginning the acceleration towards its conclusion. I believe Crossroads of Twilight sets us up well for that acceleration to begin in the next installment."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Alright, i admit, when i read this book the first time, i thought it was pretty bad. However, i recently re-read the entire series, and my opinion has changed. There are alot of small things that you just dont pick up on if you arent paying real close attention (for instance, i know who killed asmodean, do you?). This book is over flowing with the small stuff. I wont give any straight forward answers on that one, but i will say that if you have payed attention to the other books, then this one has its own rewards. you just have to be able to pick up on them. read it a couple of times, discuss it with friends, and see what you find out."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Robert Jordan is an excelent writer and I enjoy reading his work.

Like tolkien, he has created a world of great complexity and depth."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Another good read. Seems like I got through this one much faster than previous ones. This is partial because some of the other books I am reading are not very interesting to me, and instead of switching off like I normally do.That said, the plot for the series didn't really move forward much here. However, I did actually like seeing these snippets of story for each of the major groups involved in the action. I wanted to know what Mat was going to do with Tuon and how she would react, I wanted to know if the male half of the power had been cleansed, I wanted to know is the siege had started, I wanted to know what happened to Faile. And this book gave all that to me.It seems like this book is truly a Crossroads, where things are being set up for the final several books in the series. I imagine (and hope) that things will start happening much more quickly (if also overly-well-described) starting with the next book.So, while not my most favorite book of the series, I am still ready to start the next one."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This next installment in WOT contains almost none of the hard core action that was in his earlier works, but unlike Winter's Heart, stuff actually happens. We see Egwene as a growing Amyrlin Seat, and Mat's relationship with Tuon begins to develop. However, once again, nothing is actually resolved. Rand is still going crazy, Cadsuane hasn't taught Rand anything, Perrin is still looking for Faile, and Elaida has yet to be overthrown. I am also still waiting for Nynaeve to stop playing the role of a hopelessly lovesick newlywed. Although disappointing, Jordan fans should still continue, for this book seems to be setting up some exciting developments in the next installment."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"For fans who felt left hanging after reading Winter's Heart in all the the major plots, be prepared to feel as if you had only inched forward in their progress.The book actually backtracks telling readers what all of the major characters were doing while Rand and Nynaeve were cleansing Saidin. All of the major plots are left practically where they were to begin with with few exceptions. Elayne is still struggling for the thrown; Egwene has yet to lay seige to the White Tower, Perrin has not yet set his band against the Aiel who kidnapped Faile - so no rescue; Mat on still only a few leagues out of Ebou Dar; there is no progression or regression as far as the Forsaken are concerned -they're given around 10 sentences in 2 chapters.Character development has been the best in this book. With the exception of Rand and Nynaeve who get only a chapter or two at best in this book, most of the other major plot protaganist characters get some serious time. It's a nice change of pace in that sometimes Jordan appears to skim over characters in building them up. That's perhaps the best thing about this book.For those looking for a lot of action and resolution to conflict in the addition to several new subplots added in this book, I can only assume and hope that it will occur in the next book. Overall I would have to say I loved this book and am already counting down the days untill the next one is released and would recommend it to everyone who has worked their way through the Wheel of Time series."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Look at G.Martin .He's allowing the death of characters whose reality , colour , depth and consistence would make any writer happy and caring for them through at least 20 installements .I mourn for Rob Stark , his mother , his father and even Geoffrey .Jordan got it backwards and it gets worse with every succeeding volume .He's introducing flat , boring , stereotypical , useless , annoying characters at an ever increasing pace .They swarm now everywhere and make of that , oh so compelling story , a complete mess .Faile ?

Not that there aren't enough one-star ratings so far, but this book deserves more. The only comfort I have after reading this book, is that I'm not alone with my disappointment.If you've read the 9th book and think of getting the 10th, do yourself a favor and just skip it. If you want to know what essentially happens in the 10th book, just read the ~1400 character long summary of the book on Wikipedia: [...]. A close approximation of the plot summary can be given in only one word: nothing. Crossroads of Twilights is a new masterpiece of plot inertia: while the first books switch between fast paced action and more detailed but interesting plot setup, by the latest starting with the 6th book the story telling becomes slower and slower, drags on in books 8 and 9 and comes to a full stop in this 10th book.After book 5 or so I switched to the audio book, and boy I start hating that woman who reads the female POV parts of the book. Every now and then I found myself mocking the last line I just listened to. As so many other reviewers already mentioned, almost all female character are just plain horrible.Besides, I noticed that I'm just paying no more attention to the book - I'm not intrested in how the teas tastes, I don't care about emroidery, I really know now that Aes Sedai have ageless faces, I don't want to hear about Egwene's latest brain fart, and dear lord no more tugging, scowling, sniffing, vexed sounds, smoothed skirts, etc. I can't hear it anymore.By not paying attention to the audio book, I've even managed to miss the only potentially interesting event in the book, when Logain meets Rand. But thank the Jordan, turns out I didn't miss anything but an embarassingly missed opportunity for something interesting to happen.Why do I still keep reading, and will also read the next book? Because after wasting so much time, I at least want to know how it ends. If you're also interested, but really can't endure anymore braid tugging, then go to [...] where you will find detailed summaries for each chapter of the book, including cross references for the characters and other events you've probably long forgotten about.Peace outA disappointed readerPS: not satisified with my English?

This book felt like an episode of daytime television. Nothing meaningful happened, and I wondered if Jordan really means to keep writing the series until they nail his coffin shut. I actually took the book back to the store and demanded a refund. I have NEVER done that with a book before. I felt like I was being exploited by the author for his own pecuniary gain. Very disappointing. You see, I like Egwene and Rand and especially Perrin and the rest of the Scooby gang.

Robert Jordon took for Matt not appearing in Book 8, he decided that he would show the reader what happens if he touches on all of the major plot lines. Well, he wrote a chapter on each of the plot lines, added two new ones, that he didn't have time to do any development on, and published it, that was all he had room for. The development of Matt's relationship with The Daughter of the Nine Moon's was entertaining, but it was the only part of the book that managed to hold my interest. Otherwise, a handful of events occured that may help the plot advance in the future, but probably could have been condensed into 20 pages. The first 250 pages are spent bringing us up to the end of the last book, and should have been part of a 10 page preface. Oh, and the 90+ page preface, that could have been page 11. If he would have done that we would have say 150 pages of Matt (I'm trying to be generous) 20 pages of other plot, and 11 pages of preface. If we're making the book the same length we have another 480 or so pages where we could actually move the plot along, instead of the characters occasionally saying to one another \\"hey, shouldn't we be doing something?\\" \\"No, we've been doing things for 9 books, this is the book where we don't have to do anything.\\" Save your money folks."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This book was extremely disappointing.

The first 350 pages of this book take place prior to, or simultaneous with, the events described in the last chapter of the previous book.

The first 4-6 where outstanding. ... Crossroads of Twilight is painfully boring, devoid of action and continues to not move anywhere.... I have become very disappointed with this serious. I can't believe that the last 3 books of the series has taken well over 1500 pages to develop the meager plot that is contained therein.First, I will say that R. Jordan is a talented writer. But it seems to me that he is using his talents to create a franchise that will give him an annuity, at the expense of his fans who desire to see the Wheel of Time story and world evolve. This book, as with the last 3-4 books he has written, seems to follow the same formulaic cookie cutter template. It almost seems that R. Jordan has put his writing on auto-pilot and is traveling the same country side. Regardless of his skills in word crafting, I feel that in this book and the last 4 books, I am basically treading water.Furthermore, I do not understand R. Jordan's fascination with his characters' womanly angst and the petty minutia of the so called relationships. Please...stop, no more. Every single female character seems to be going through some self realization via some male character. What at first was some enjoyable subplot regarding the foibles of the characters in their relationship has become very tiresome. Every female characer of any note can be summarized by this: 1) she is powerful/infuential and 2) Regardless of being powerful/influential they get all flustered and angst ridden because of some male character.Overall, I think this book adds some lore to the background of the WoT series...I mean the Jordan Annuity, but I was frustrated by a lack of plot movement and the sense that I had already read this book. Maybe for people new to Jordon's francise...I mean the Jordan Annuity, it is a good read, but for someone familar with his body of work, it isn't a worthwhile buy."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I was fortunate to discover TWoT series for the first time last year.

The latest installment is very poor. Turgid plotlines, seemingly unending chapters of characters meandering through the plot: even the villans seem distracted.

Maybe one fight with the one power, I would have settled for him discribing a murder happenning instead of 'oh by the way someone got their head ripped off last night'. cliffhangers are for sequels, not 12 book series that are 600+ pages each.

The first few books were excellent, but Mr Jordan appears to have lost the plot. We have a comedy series on TV in the UK called Little Britain, in which one of the characters is an author who tries desparately to pad out her stories in order to write enough pages for a book. Her catch phrase is \\"How many pages now Audrey?\\", to which her trancriber invariably comes back with a figure of 10. Could Mr Jordan be having similar difficulties? I feel there could be a positive side to this if Mr Jordan is aware of the reviews his books are receiving... It's not too late to provide a cracking book or two and end the series to acclaim, in the same way it started."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Man must be getting paid by the word. Robert Jordan is never going to finish the series. He is going to keep on writing stories that get progressively worse with characters that get darker and less interesting with each page of one of his 1000 page booksFor those of you thnking about starting this serise stop at #3 please take my advice."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I read the series back to back, right up to book 10. The first few books I got new, then books 4-6 I got at the library. I had to wait for them to be returned by others, and they were \\"on hold\\" by the time I returned them. They were very beat up! I did not have to wait for books 7 and 8, and they were in much better condition. Book 9 looked almost new, and 10 was in quite good shape. It took me a while to read Crossroads of Nothing here, and it was overdue when I finished. Nobody had requested it, so there was no particular hurry to return the book.If you were dating the Wheel of Time, it would go like this: You and she hit it off really well in the beginning. You were even holding hands and kissing goodnight, and you could see that this relationship was going to be all sparks and fire! You couldn't wait to see each other! And then something changed. On your sixth date, you ate at the same restaurant and saw the same movie you saw before. The next few dates were the same, but you also got no goodnight kiss. Disappointing, yes, but you suppress your impatience, knowing that good relationships take time to build. But, on the last date wouldn't hold hands with you, and on this one she barely makes eye contact when you talk. She won't talk about anything that interests you, just keeps going on about how the tea isn't good enough. Clearly she doesn't even care about you, but she's perfectly willing to let you keep paying for dinner. You feel like a sucker, but you enjoyed it, right? She wasn't using you if it was your idea to go out, right? But now you have to admit it: whatever passion you had at the beginning is gone.You could edit this book down to less than 150 pages, after which it would be fun to read. Maybe 125 would be enough. The other reviewers describe the book beautifully, but just for the sake of completeness, I'll repeat what you've heard elsewhere. Yes, the writing is OK, but It's slow. It's very slow. And this is the point where I would normally warn you about:**spoilers**Not this time! Joke! Nothing happens in the book. There's nothing to spoil. Really. It's that slow.Matt's story is mildly entertaining, and I assume this is why the few opening and closing chapters of the book are his story. In that story they travel about 30 miles and, um, there's some foreshadowing. Exactly two interesting things happen. These are the high points of the book. They are strategically placed near the beginning and the end so you will remember that there were actually high points.In Rand's story, there is some foreshadowing.In Perrin's plot, a new subplot (yes, *another* one) is introduced, and there is some foreshadowing.In every other plot... there is some foreshadowing.Throughout, people spend a lot of time looking meaningfully at other people while they talk about what happened in the previous book.What I don't understand is how he can make this last almost 700 pages (hardcover). Yes the prose is good, but at one point in the middle, I realized that I spent two long pages reading about how different people walked up a hill. Augh.I regret wasting my time reading this book. Don't waste yours.[Update]In the months since I first wrote this review, I've read some fiction. I've read some technical manuals. I've read philosophy. And in that time I've had a revelation. There wasn't one part of this book I genuinely liked. More importantly, I'm remembering the hundreds of pages of torture. Literally hundreds of pages that I actually disliked reading. You forget those parts because you're in a hurry to finish. I hate Perrin and every part of that stupid drama now. I never ever want to see or hear about Egewene or Elayne ever again. I want them to fail. I'm sick of Rand's whining and... you know I'm sick of all of them. The only character with any charm left is Matt and that's because he doesn't care--I can identify with that. I don't care either, at this point. I've come to take back that second star I gave you. I like to be nice, but I shouldn't lie to you. I actually /hate/ this book. I know, hate is such a strong word. That's why I used it."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"First I started reading this series in 1993... I still cannot believe I have wasted more than 10 years of my life! Honestly though, the first 5 books were well worth the time. Of course I read those in a couple of years. Having to wait 2 years / book and then get this nonsense is criminal. There are way too many characters for any sane person to have even a vague interest in. Most of these are just clones of each other, right down to the way they dress and talk. It normally takes me a couple of days to read one of these books (1-5 anyway), Book 10 took me 6 months. I still have no clue what is going on. If you are planning to buy this, I strongly suggest you dont. Maybe if sales go down(probably too late now) RJ will start writing the Wheel of Time again instead of writing about his winter holiday and renaming characters.Can we give negative stars in reviews?"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Yes, this series has really ground to a halt and is slowly suffocating under the weight of it's own hubris. But I will still read each new book, though it's a lot easier to wait for the paperbacks, now. One thing bugs the ever living crap out of me though: what is Jordan's obsession with fashion? He spends four or five pages setting up every scene by describing EXACTLY what each person, important or not, is wearing down to the buttons (LITERALLY, HE DESCRIBES THE BUTTONS!). Was he an aspiring fashion editor who's dreams were dashed? I think he created the whoel dreamworld thing solely based on the idea that people could change what they were wearing with mere thoughts, fulfilling his fantasy of describing a new outfit every 5 seconds.Anyways, this book is nothing special. If you're deep into the series, then you know what you're getting yourself into. If not, well, reading war and peace will be quicker and make you look smarter."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Quick background about myself - I love fantasy/science fiction. As most readers will agree, Jordon brought a new world to all his fans - more than the usual elf/human vs orcs/goblins/giants stories with a dragon or two in the mix. That's what got me hooked to Jordon - yes, the attention to detail was great but more importantly, the story was really interesting - a true epic in the making. But I think most will agree that the last two/three books were incredibly hard to read - in fact, I am still stuck on Chapter 10 of Crossroads.....why? It keeps losing my interest. Seriously folks, how many of you read the first 7 books within 24 to 36 hours of your purchase? I did. As for the last 3, man, it's been a struggle - I admit that Winter's Heart did pick it up but Crossroads just sank it for me. Now with the prequel coming out, I know I can take my time to finish Crossroads - to summarize, Jordon went from a &quot;buy the first day it's out&quot; to a &quot;wait till the paperback or used books&quot; for me. I am so disappointed...."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"ohhhh maannnnnn what a terrible book. I mean, I love the Wheel of Time books, Jordan's a great author and all, and I give all the other books five stars, but book ten.....? Two Thumbs Down. no, better yet, three. Man, I was so into the books I read books six, seven, eight, and nine in a period of one month. When I got book ten I expected, like all the other books, that there would be huge development and stuff. Was there? Noooooo. From the first sentence, practically, I was just kinda like, yeah, wow, who cares about some random Domani soldier? Let's hear about Rand and co., please....? My hopes of seeing more of Rand were utterly dashed. Approximately one short chapter has Rand in it, and then the page and a half epilogue. All MAT does is kind of lounge about acting like a pessimistic bum. Perrin just kind of talks to his wolf friends and tries to stay away from Masema. Oooh. Great development. And ELAYNE?!?!?!?! She's like my least favorite character, and all she does is what.....? Hang around with bad-tempered Birgitte and the Sea Folk, drink tea, whimper like an idiot about how she misses Rand....grrrr. Oh, and wow, she learns she might have twins. Oooohh. Nothing of the Forsaken whatsoever. Nothing! Egwene walks around her camp, that's about all.I would suggest just get CoT from your local library.

To be honenst, books 1-3 are supurb, 4-5 were pretty good, six and seven started to literally suck two rivers wind, and I cannot even describe the horror of reading book eight, betrayed by the author with every sentence--every turn of the page--for not producing.

In addition to Strunk &amp; White's book on writing, this book should be quoted for 'bad style' quotes. Oh, this book makes an excellent fuel if you run out of logs for the fireplace.

It's too long, has no plot development and is so filled with incidental characters that I felt like I needed a reference dictionary.Did anyone else notice that characters repeat themselves? The first time it happened, I thought I'd lost my place and was re-reading something. By the third time, I started to get irritated. Doesn't Jordan have an editor?

I love this series, and will have every book on pre-order when available, but this book was definately unimpressive, and completely forgettable.When you have 8 or 9 major characters/storylines running at the same time, it is hard to progress all the characters... So what you have here is many short stories where next to nothing happens for the entire book. This is NOT what I would have expected after waiting 2 years after book 9. There is SOME plot progression, but not muchWhile not a complete waste of time, it is the next best thing to it.I can't wait for book 11... maybe in 2 or 3 years.

As we all know the plot development decreases pretty dramatically after book 3, and then takes another dramatic step down after book 7. Here we are at book 10. This is when plot development get's completely off the steps and just sits in the basement. I cannot figure out how Robert Jordan wrote an entire 600+ page book about absolutely nothing. It's obvious that not even his wife Harriet could stand this book because it's not even edited! Grammar, punctuation, structure, words just completely missing are all very abundant in this book. Unimportant words galore! I mean literally, read a synopsis of this entire book then move on to book 11 because there are zero events in this book. I don't mean limited, I don't mean small, I mean ZERO! Go ahead an call me evil Rober Jordan lovers, but maybe Robert Jordan should have spent less time writing worthless books and more time finishing his story, because now, as we all know, he doesn't get to. Kind of a karma thing if you ask me. He got greedy, made pointless books because he knew we'd buy them, then died before he got to finish his series, and now his name will only be on the last book as part of the \\"in memory of...\\" section. If your still thinking of purchasing this and \\"trudging\\" through it anyways, go for it. You'll end up exactly like me; \\"how bad can it really be. I'll just read through it and suffer then I'm on to the next one\\". 600 pages later you'll be on Amazon saying \\"well, I don't wanna say you deserved to die before you finished your magnum opus, but at the rate you were going, it was pretty inevitable.\\" At least they'll save a lot of money on the movie budget if they ever make them.

The 9th book was a relative improvement, in part thanks to the last chapter.The 10th ? as bad as the 8th. It sounded as a wrap up of EVERYONE around the conclusion of the 9th, and for the firsts 600 or so pages, nothing that really was new.I just have a simple question, how many dragging books will be written before this story actually ends ?

Perrin does nothing, Rand does nothing, Egwene does nothing, etc etc.I found myself impatiently reading the sections that weren't about mat; they seemed to be just fluff and filler. Yet more descriptions of people not related at all to the plot, yet more pointless places they visit (So Harbor - had all the markings of a fun mini-plot - the dead walking in a village, yet Perrin leaves after getting the grain. *sigh*)The Tuon - Mat plot was nice I thought, but even that didn't get concluded.

RJ has strayed from the rapid developments and masterful plot twists that served to hook dedicated readers in books 1-8.The first two-thirds of CoT is so boring that it makes one wonder if RJ himself knows how to move his own plot forward. (you don't even get to see what Al Thor is doing until the last third of the book) or if he is simply doing some remedial development. I for one get the distinct impression that if he does, he has learned that stretching the story out is far more profitable than bringing it to its (overdue) climax.For the hard-core WoT fan that will stick with it to the end, I advise passing on this one until the eleventh installment is available.

Reading CoT is labourious at best and you have to question whether Jordan can enjoy writing such trivial stuff. With the advent of widespread traveling in the storyline the potential to move the pace of the book at lightening speed is there but Jordan does not utilize this asset instead he spreads the story so thinnly over 700 pages, you barely notice its there. Rand al thor hardly makes any impression in CoT after is monumental efforts in WH. Perrin spends is time pining after his kidnapped wife with no real success in rescueing her from the renegade aiel, this takes up hundreds of pages. The star crossed lovers Mat Cauthon and Tuon court but at an uncharateristcly slow pace, disappointingly little of the book is devoted to Jordans best comic character. The Aes Sedai manage to umm and arr thoughout the book, Tar Valon is no closer to capitulating and a tentive alliance with the Black tower is sought by the rebel Aei Sadei. Jordan suggests he can complete series in two more books. He can but not in his present writing style, which is too repetitive and dwells often on the contemplations of the various characters leaving no space in a chapter for the story to progress. To give some perspective, book 1 EoW covered around 9 months of the story, CoT covers a passage of around 3 to 5 weeks. We know that some of the execellant and strong female characters that Jordan has developed are pregnant or will be, last time I checked this process took 9 months unless Aes Sedai develope an accelerated pregnancy weave. So I suggest a minimum of 5 books will be needed to complete the series, this means that I will probably have gray hair by the time it all is finished and Robert Jordan will be writing into is grave as he so aptly prophesised. Maybe I'm a product of a fast living generation, if you think you fit into this description forget about reading CoT or any other WoT book. However if you got a couple of decades of mediocrity to fill, this passes the time and its cheeper than drugs.

You could read the review from Publishers Weekly and know everything there is to know about this book. This was 600+ pages of dribble. Let's start getting to the meat of things."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Loved the first eight books of the series, but now it's all downhill.The prologue is completely meaningless and far too lengthy. In fact the first third of the book was review of the past three books and could have easily fit into the 76 page prologue.The entire book took place in less than a week and there were too many points of view so that the characters were repeating what was said by another previous character. There was practically no major action like there was in the previous books. For instance, supposedly the seanchan were supposed to be a big part of the story, but where were they. It was only at the very end of the story is it that they start to make their entrance.The story was nothing but a bridge from book nine to the next book. Trees died to make the paper for this book. Their sacrifice was in vain.As far as I'm concerned, Jordan could have taken the story, edited it into a couple hundred pages, and combined it with the next book. Best for putting you to sleep."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I loved the pace of the early books in this series. But, I get tired of the author's endless, repetitive, exposition. I don't need to be reminded constantly about how everyone feels about everyone else, or how the pecking order is determined for Aes Sedai (or wise ones), or how the bonding makes Elaine feel, or the 'Game of Houses'. Sheesh. The Game of Houses must be RJ's favorite expositional element. It doesn't progress the story, and yet RJ spends page after page on it. When RJ dwells on Rand, Perrin, or Matt, the story seems to pick up a little. I like Matt's character the most. Which is interesting, because when the series first started, Matt was a jerk. But, even in those moments that involve my favorite characters, reading this edition feels like swimming in pudding. I gave it three stars because I am hopelessly addicted and I'm disappointed about the pace of the story. I'll buy number 11 when (or if) it ever comes out. And if number 11 doesn't have any action, RJ may loose this reader permanently."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"The book is sort of a letdown after the end of Winter's Heart, which leaves you dying to read the sequel. Unfortunately, barely anything happens in CoT (about two major events that I can think of, and hundreds of pages of unnecessary dialogue).The one problem with this series is that it takes ten books to say what could have been said in five. Waiting a year just to read this book is sort of annoying. I don't really mind the length of the series, it's just the waiting that gets on my nerves.However, all this dialogue does give you some insights into some of the more unknown characters-like Tuon. (Also, with this book out, Robert Jordan says we have enough information to figure out who Mesaana is and who killed Asmodean.)In short, it's worth reading if you've read the preceding books and liked them, but you certainly shouldn't if you haven't."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I agree with most of the reviewers who feel that while I love the story and the characters, the last few installments have lost momentum. However, my major beef is with the editors of this book (and for that matter, book 9 as well). Who is editing these books? Granted, these are mammoth tomes, and it would be impossible to catch every minor grammatical error. But when I seem to find at least one error every few pages, it makes me question the thoroughness of the process. Hey, if the publisher needs some freelance editing help, let me know...."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Well I finally ended reading Jordan's 10th torment.

I have read the series twice now from book 1 to book 10. The books flow one into other very nicely. I think what most reviewers are missing here is that he needed to catch up the timelines between all the different groups(Mat, Elayne, Rand, Perrin,.... etc.) Yes this book was a little sluggish and I wish he would have tied up some loose ends that we all have been waiting for.

Any Ideas."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"ok. this book pretty much stunk. all i was excited about was the inevitable meeting between Rand and Logain and that ended up being dissapointing. nothing happened. how long will it take get something done. the last bood ended so good. i would almost say it was as good as the end of Lord of Chaos.i still have some hope for RJ, though. remember that he is the same man who wrote Shadow Rising and Fires of Heaven. i hope he gets the ball rolling on the next book because this one was frustrating. it made me very angry that he had little to no time with Rand. very little mention of the cleasing of the taint, even though the jacket to the book mentions it. i also did not like the fact that most of the book took place before the end of the last book. i will still hope that the best fantasy writer of our time can redeem himself."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This book is interesting, but really unnecessary.

Here is yet another book in which ABSOULTELY NOTHING HAPPENS! 600+ pages of nothing! Stop dragging this on just to collect more money!! Dont waste your money on the hardcover, please take my advice.

There are no conclusions to any of the previous issues just lots of dialog and no action. Very wordy and boring.Jordan should provide some forward movement of the story lines and finish some of them, so he can start some new ones.

However, like many other readers I feel this one is not up to par. The characters talk and talk endlessly and never do anything more than take a bath or look through a telescope. ALso, the Prologue was tough for me to follow, and I have read each previous book! I hope this is not the end of the series! I can't recommend the book and don't think any reader will miss out if he jumps from the previous one to the next to come. Bummer! And now we all sit and wait another year or two.

Martin."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I began reading the WoT series in June of 2002, and already I've finished reading CoT. I love the series, don't get me wrong, but number ten was VERY disappointing. It's great that an author would want to describe more of the world his books are written in, as well as current events within the series...but...where's the action? Where's the edge-of-your-seat feeling I got from reading 1-7 and 9 (sorry...ten seems to follow the monotony of eight). I'm waiting anxiously for number eleven, I just hope it's very soon and MUCH longer. Eh...this gives me some time to go back and review stuff in case I forgot, maybe even begin Terry G.'s Sword of Truth series. C'mon, Mr. Jordan, we want more!!"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"As with all of the books the writing is excellent and the plot full of deceit and intrigue. However it is far too drawn out slow moving. What Jordan could say in a page he takes a chapter for. Nothing is said about the male half of the True Source being used except for a line or two from Rand's miniscule part in the book. It was somewhat of a trial to get through the whole thing but nonetheless I read on, hoping that something important would happen. Only three very interesting things happened and one of them seems to be the setup for the plot of the next book. Nonetheless I would have to recommend it to people who are fans of the series because let's face it, there are things in here that you will need to know if you are going to read the next book and though it will be a slow ride just hope that the next book will make up for it."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I think we can all agree that Jordan is an excellent author. My disappointment is not in the writing but in the lack of movement within the storyline. I've never skipped a chapter before...before! I guess it'll be another 2 years for the next one. Since this 700 pg prologue sets up a promising 11th book. I would rather wait three years and have something worth reading."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Ok we get it, Jordan is fantastic at character development, but really, after 1000's of pages, I have a pretty good grip on the characters. I will definatly wait for reviews of 11 and find out if he actually advances the plot before buying it. If (like me) you can't stop reading the series despite its lethargy, check it out from the library."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"While very well written, the book seems to be just filler...a way to make the series last longer. After waiting the extra couple of months since they decided not to release it until January, not to mention the time since the 9th book was released, I was totally disappointed. And I hate to say it since I am, or perhaps was, a dedicated fan, but I am starting to lose interest."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Just when I thought the WOT series couldn't get any slower, Robert Jordan is more than happy to prove me wrong. If you've enjoyed the pace of the last 2 books then you'll absolutely love Crossroads of Twilight. But if you want a fast pace and riveting plot developments, this book will easily fall short of your expectations. Let me put it this way: the first half of the book doesn't even progress past the climatic event in book nine. The ending to Crossroads of Twilight left me feeling dissapointed and not at all excited to pick up its sequel. Although Jordan's world is undoubtedly rich, the sheer number of characters has bogged it down. The plot in Crossroads moves along at a snail's pace and the ending is far from satisfying. The book felt like it was missing another 200 pages, or that Jordan just cut things short so he would have material for book 11. The book does suggest that the Last Battle will arrive soon, hopefully in no more than 2 books. If you can, wait until Crossroads of Twilight comes out in paperback. That way, you'll feel like you've wasted only $8 instead of $30."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This book goes nowhere slowly.

It is like an aside rather than a main event. This is possibly the most disappointing book I have ever read in this or any other series. There are roughly 50 pages actually worth reading, essentially what you have here is a 700 page prologue.How this book took 2 years is beyond me.

Jordan's other 9 books of this series were slow at times. There were sections of a few hundred pages where almost nothing happens, and it was frustrating. But, the true Wheel of Time fan knew that Jordan had enough excitement in other parts to more than compensate.If you are a fan of the series... you may not want to subject yourself to this book. You are probably used to catching onto events because you can't remember what was going on with the 30 or so subplots, so skipping this whole book won't hurt you because NOTHING HAPPENS. That's right... this is entire book where NOTHING HAPPENS. Rand isnt even in the first 550 pages! None of the major issues are resolved! There is no fighting. No battles with the Forsaken. No battles between the 100 opposing armed forces in this entire ... series.I love the Wheel of Time series... and I will read the next book.

Like many fans of W.O.T., I reread the whole series to prep for the release of &quot;C.o.T.&quot; And what we've ended up with is a book, the contents of which could have been summarized in a forward. There is virtually no movement in any of the storylines. There are far too many pages describing the outfits that everyone is wearing. The first 2/3 of the book takes place at the same time as the last 1/3 of the last book. Mr. Jordan, some resolution please."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I've been a fan of Robert Jordan for over 10 years. I started reading his books as a junior in High School. Now over 10 years later I find myself barely able to finish his latest work &quot;Crossroads of Twilight&quot;. The book has several problems which range from; focus on minor characters, not hearing from Rand until 500+pages into a 600+page book, and no forward movement in the storyline to speak of.By book 10 you would think that Perrin could have gotten Faile back, Some of the events from book 10 (the cleasing of Saidin)would be talked about more, Matt and the circus he's with could have moved further than 30 miles away from the Seachen especially when he holds the daughter of the 9 moons, The white tower could become whole rather than camped outside the white tower for the entire book, and Hamila could have been caught as an agent for the dark lord.All in all I hope, I pray, that something happens in the next book to get the series going again. The first two books in the series kept things moving, but now we're lucky if 20 days pass in one book.Maybe Jordan should give up now and save all of us a lot of time!"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This books was indeed the worst of the series.

The book catches up our favorite Aes Sedai, Elayne, Egwene, Perrin & Mat from where we left off on book 9. VERY SLOWLY!!! Over half the book is dedicated to this goal. This was an awful slow read, no action, much plotting and finger pointing. The plot moves forward about a week, with little activity, with only one stupid ill-conceived action by one of our favorites for a new cliffhanger.I'm sure Robert Jordan put some foretelling in this book, and some plotting has taken place, but from my view, you probably can skip it and wait for book 11. The time taken to read this book was a complete waste."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I found that the best thing to do with this volume was to simply read the dialog and skip all the rest.

Unfortunately, it is a fruitless game because writing and publishing technology will make even longer books possible in future generations. Sorry Robert, your crown for longest book won't last very long.Robert Jordan spent a little bit more time on character development in this work. Unfortunately, when you have fantasy characters, the character development itself is going to be unreal.Really, what can Mat's love affair tell readers about life? Two people have visions and know they have to marry or the world will end. I am sorry, it really is not as good a vehicle for romance or character development. Political squabbling among witches really doesn't provide much insight on ideas either.Yes, if there are people who can blow up eachother with thoughts, then this might be how they behave. yawn.On the plus side, the work gives hope that there is some movement toward the alliances for the final battle. The book leaves the audience poised for a fast paced action book.Of course, the author might simply want to draw the audience into another couple 700 page treatises on fantasy character politics before we reach the end of the series."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I'm very disappointed... a couple suprising things happen, out of 600+ pages of the first WoT novel I've actually found hard to stay with.

Winters Heart was great , Mat was back ,people got to meet up at last, and Rand had a plan. It ended leaving you wanting more.Crossroads well where to start . Mat is sparking and spooning his new girl. Perrin chases his one true love over hill and dale. But decides to take his army to lunch instead. Elayne and Aviendha spend the whole time trying to figure out what to eat and drink and what to ware. and so on and so on with all the charactersAnd when people finally meet they say nothing to help each other. You see, it would not be polite .The rest of the book just gives background info to people who may not have read the first nine books.The only good thing was Jordan did not introduce many new characters as he did in earlier books.Just for the record .I will buy the next book.

This is the book where everyone stops and chats about things, what happened before, what they might like to do in the future. And, of course, endlessly complaining about things that they don't understand. Mat Cauthon, generally regarded as the next most exciting character, next to Rand, spends three chapters deciding to... pick up stakes and move a circus. Perrin spends over a hundred pages ... doing what he did in the last book, exactly nothing worth reading. Elayne spends several chapters discussing how she might consolidate power in Caemlyn. Egwene spends endless time discussing how she might overtake Tar Valon. If you've read the dust jacket you already knew all this!

Vanity run amok as Jordan blatently milks his readers."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Perhaps the most annoying thing about this tenth volume, issued after two years and much hoopla, is that there is very little advancement of the plot for each of the characters. Mat continues his slow-motion flight from the Seanchan and his love/hate relationship with Tuon (we're given a couple of teases about Seanchan and Prophet habits of hand-chopping, but it goes nowhere), Perrin continues his utterly irrelevant chase after Faile and the Shaido, Rand his indecisive random walk around Randland, Elayne her schemes to regain her mother's throne (look for an amusing scene when a handful of noble teenagers are brought to support her cause), and Egwene, at long last, starts her siege of Tar Valon. In the final chapter, this actually goes somewhere, and we are left with a cliffhanger.Another great source of frustration is that by the tenth book of a series, you expect the plot to start contracting towards the climax, in this case, it appears, Tarmon Gaidon. This book does not do so, and it even expands the scope of the series, as pages are given to point of view characters who we saw little or nothing of in earlier volumes. However many books we thought Jordan would need to wrap things up, add one more on.&quot;The Path of Dragons&quot; occupied only nine days of time. This book occupies a bit more, but its start is sometime before the end of &quot;Winter's Heart&quot;, with the result that the characters react to the apparent cleansing of saidin about halfway through the book. Frustratingly, it is not made clear if Rand was successful in his effort. I think we deserve at least that much.The level of detail we are given is ridiculous. I do not think that we need to know the ins and outs of Andoran politics to the extent we are told. The level of detail of the scenes (say, Luca's circus or the camp around Tar Valon), is again, too much. It is almost as if Jordan was trying to fill the book with fluff.There are the usual Egwenian dreams and some Foretellings and the like for us to interpret, which will keep the discussion groups busy. But with this creeping pace, how many volumes will it take to Tarmon Gaidon? Ten more?The book is not worthy of the anticipation and patience we expended waiting for it."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I simply cannot take another one of these installments. It became quite clear to me half way through this book that it was going nowhere so I decided to not finish it. There are entirely too many characters and after two years I have absolutely no idea who is who. There seem to be a million different Aes Sedai, Senchan, Sea Folk, Kin and Etc. Keeping them straight is difficult and when they do close to nothing, it seems pointless to try.This book was simply awful. I am deeply disappointed as once I looked forward to each installment with great joy, now, I will simply have to ask one of the poor souls who continue to suffer how it ended. I foresee this conversation taking place in ten to twenty years."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I had thought Tom Clancy and Stephen King had retired the title for Bestselling Author Most In Need Of An Editor, but with this volume, Robert Jordan has surpassed them. Like many other reviewers, the first six books of this series captivated me; a great, complex tale, interesting characters who act as if they are the focal points of the story, and a truly new view of magic. Unfortunately, the last four books have been completely different - wordier and wordier, with less and less actually happening. It amazes me that ten books in, Jordan can still get away with spending two and a half pages describing Elayne and Aviendha's appearance and characters when they first appear. My God, we know! Aviendha is an apprentice! She looks young! Aiel humor is hard for others to understand! They both love Rand! Elayne can't believe she is willing to share a man! For the love of God, stop writing this ... over and over again!I started reading this series when the first book came out. I now seriously worry that Jordan will die before he ever brings this monstrosity to an end. My wife gave up after book four, and plans to wait until the series is finished before she reads any more. I never thought it would come to this, but I've decided to do the same."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I've read some of the other reviews, and they are all correct. Yes, nothing happened. Yes, he once again takes two years to write a book where nothing of interest happens. Oh wait, we get to read two pages about the Rebel Aes Sedai holding a meeting of the hall, and who exactly sits next to who, why that is surprising, and of course what each of them is wearing. Oh wait, we get to read 4 pages of Matt walking through Luca's camp, and describe who all he sees. Wait, we also get to read about more Aes Sedai smoothing skirts, and what kind of embroidery is on their dresses. You get the picture. Critics all had the belief at the end of Winter's Heart that Jordan finally had set things up in order to have a tenth book full of rock'em sock'em action. Nope. Nothing happens.I did make an interesting observation. I was on a flight, and was going to finish Crossroads on it, and wanted to read an earlier book in case I finished, so I brought The Shadow Rising. I was SHOCKED at how different the type set was between books. Much less words per page in Crossroads, maybe 3 times less. Beyond that, look at what happens in the earlier books. In The Shadow Rising, Rand leaves Tear and meets the Aiel and fights Asmodean while the girls go to Tanchico and beat up Moghedien. Look at any of the books, and see how much each story progresses the epic. then look at Path of Daggers, or Crossroads. Nothing happens, except Egwene has an achey head, and Elayne takes a hot bath.I don't want the story to end. I love the story, and it's a great world Jordan has invented. However, the pace is glacial. He's not developing character here as so many have said. He's developed diarreah of the mouth. We don't need 10 pages of someone ruminating on who sat where in a meeting, or 10 pages of Perrin riding through a forest on horseback thinking of Faile. We need some motion in the story. And this book sorely did not deliver. So sad...I rapidly grow tired of this series."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Well, I won't be fooled again. I will not be reading another Robert Jordan book, ever. I'm so disappointed it has come to this, after so much time invested and such a promising beginning. When Jordan can't even get 3 stars from his most loyal fans (the only ones still reading), you know something is very wrong. The warning signs have been there for him for the last 5 books or so, and yet he can't seem to take the hint. I'll stick to George R. R. Martin from now on for my epic fantasy, a man who seems to still know how to put together a complex world AND make things happen in it that keep your interest page after page and book after book. Sorry Mr. Jordan, you blew it."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I truly enjoyed the first 5-6 books of this series, which maintained a fairly rabid pace of plot development and action. Alas, books 7,8, and 9 were less well crafted, possessing a dogged focus on mundane political details, and endless repetitive references to females crossing arms over breasts and tugging braids of hair. Argh!However, Crossroads of Twilight takes the proverbial cake for an excruciating read filled with absolutely zero plot development. Honestly, the book had less substance than an episode of 'Friends.' I have gotten to the point where I only skim the chapters to find out what happens, and I can tell you right now, it ain't a whole lot.I used to joke with my dad that Robert Jordan would croak before finishing the series. Now I am seriously concerned I may not see the end of the tale, and I am a healthy 27. I may read book 11 at the library for FREE, or better yet I'll save myself the time and catch a rerun of 'ALF' on TV, complete with 30 minutes of plot progression and a minutia of conclusion. Tor books, Robert Jordan, and Nameless Editor should be ashamed. I am aghast at the quality of the writing and the rambling storyline of this series."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This book is a complete waste of time, ink, and paper.Other reviewers have bemoaned the lack of action. There doesn't need to be action if there is progress and conclusion to threads, sub plots, characters. There aren't ANY! In the author bio in the first few books there was a statement that RJ intended to write until they nail the coffin shut. I used to regard that as a promise. Now, I think it is a threat. Victor Hugo would have hidden his head in shame at the useless excess verbage."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Since book six of the Wheel of Time series, I have felt like Robert Jordan has been making us wait a year for half-hour installments of a soap opera. This book reads and feels like a screen play for Dallas or As The World Turns. Characters make decisions that seem oh so important (Or in the case of Elayne, Utterly BORING, trivial, and not worth the 200 pages of space). The most interesting developments in the book (Mat and Tuon, Rand, etc.) are left only partially explored, and we have to wait for the next book for resolution (we hope.)Either Robert Jordan has gotten lazy and is merely relying on fluff, lost track of the story, or forgotten how to write. His book is like a box of Krispy Kreme donuts - delicious, but decided light bodied and leaving you wanting more substance. He has stopped writing in the compelling manner that in the first five or six books made you feel you were adventuring right along with the main characters. No, we just sit back and watch as the characters agonize (and it is agonizing to read) or what to do for 5 chapters. When this series first started there was more substance in the first 100 pages of any book than what has happened in entire 680 pages of Cross Roads of Twilight. As much fun as I had reading this series, this book left me feeling empty and like I had gorged on a whole box of Crispy Kremes.To Robert Jordan - write like you are capable of, before you lose a fan."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This one is the worst yet,and that's saying something, I only read it for the occational glimpses of his old style shining through.Unfortunatly it's too late for me to stop reading the series now, but if your new to the WoT then save yourself and get out while you still can, you will only be dissapointed."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This series had a good start for the first three books or so, but it has devolved into many plotlines that are sometimes skipped for entire books. That would be okay if the story kept moving, but instead we are subjected to multi-paragraph long descriptions of characters dress and beliefs and then the character is never seen again. That isn't good writing, that is fluff and filler.The only reason I bought this book is because I had thought there would only be 10 books in the series since the pre-quel is out. Foolish me. Not only has Jordan given up putting serious effort into the series, he will NEVER FINISH IT. I not only suggest no one read this series, I suggest no one read this author unless you are into masochism.PS: How do you look at a ceiling and see that the square tiles \\"interlock\\"? I mean, how can they be squares, yet be seen by an observer to interlock?"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This book is boring from the first to the last page. It seems that jordans books are getting worse as the series goes on. In this book he is focusing on parts of the overall storyline that we do not need to know and would frankly be better off not knowing. There was not one exciting scene in the entire book. And this was a fairly long book. There are too many names in this book. The majority of characters are not important in any sense and should be left out completely. This is a message to jordan: Get on with it and stop trying to milk us for all we are worth. I refuse to buy another one of your books."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"It's awful of course. Draggy and very slooowww. One suggestion for those of us who are stuck in the series. Don't read the book in chapter order. Skip around and only read about the characters who interest you. If Elayne bores you to tears and you find a section on her, skip it. That way you can get to the end with less pain.If you haven't started the series, don't! This is worse than book nine and frequently unreadable."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Content? We don't need no steeeking content.Or so Mr Jordan would have us believe. 620 pages of BLAH with maybe 50 pages of worthwhile material scattered through the entire book like corn through a fresh load in the bowl.Theonly good thing I am willing to say? No Nyv to *sniff* repeatedly.Plenty of tugging of skirts and knuckling of various features to more then make up for it.

You people have shown me I made the right choice. I will wait until this thing hits the [money]discount bins, buy it, and put in on a shelf with the first 9 (In my opinion only the first 4 were worth the money). When Jordan decides to quit milking his fans (suckers is most likely the more accurate word)I'll pull the books down and read them.For those of you who want to encourage him to conclude this thing, refuse to buy any more books until he does. Better yet, return every one that can still be returned.

I already know that \\"Winter's Heart\\" was a 'blah blah blah.' I guess this one is a direct 'Transition to Blahh Blahh Blahh' all in one...I borrowed this travesty from a friend that still backs and supports Jordan's cause (obviously) and felt pain while reading it.

More importantly, I get increasingly frustrated that the &quot;good guys/gals&quot; cannot seem to add 2+2 and come up with 4... I know they can't be perfect (or we would have no story), but do they always have to be so clueless?As many others have observed, George R.R.

Although the first five books are definetely more exciting and better written then the last five, until this novel I was still a satisfied reader. Book 10 however was a complete dissappointment. Jordan spends 850 pages on description of how a riding skirt looks and which fringes the Aes Sedai wear and less then 50 on actual plot development; &quot;slow&quot; is a nice way of describing this one.

I do believe a number of the negative reviews came soon after publication of the book where I can see how many became frustrated as the anticipation to see the series move to the end game had been immense. However (thankfully), I decided to take the plunge and have been pleasantly surprised as this book is much better than what so many have reported on this site (again, probably a factor of knowing the end is coming this January so I could approach the book with a proper perspective). I have to say I support what Robert Jordan did with the story here as I found it intriguing how the rest of the world reacted to the \\"Event\\" from Winter's Heart. I also liked how he used this book as the stage-setter for the move to the climax of the story which leads me to forgive the limited plot movement in the book. Sometimes Mr. Jordan carries descriptive prose a little far but I just fast forward through these sections when they get too overdone. I am glad I have continued reading the series and am looking forward to \\"catching up\\" in readiness for the finale. Would not hesitate to recommend not only this book but the entire series to anyone who loves detailed world-building and characterization."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"The tenth installment of Robert Jordan's The Wheel of Time series, Crossroads of Twilight, has been maligned from readers since it's publication and with understandable reasons. The story arcs of Perrin, Mat, Elayne, and Egwene are given the emphasis throughout the book with only a touch of Rand near the closure of the book. The majority of the book's time period leads up to and during the climatic final chapter of Winter's Heart before finally advancing when Egwene's story arc begins. Though out the book, everything seems to be moving pieces into place for something big to happen but it never really materializes. In each of the last chapters for Perrin, Mat, and Egwene a dramatic turning in the plot happens but leaving the reader to wait until the next installment to find out what happens resulting in frustration.Crossroads of Twilight is a mixture of positives and negatives, with the latter emphasized because of the two year wait and the fact that Prologue was almost a tenth of the book even though some of the bits within that were interest. However, even though this book can be frustrating at times (my came in about three-quarters of the way through waiting for something to happen) it is a necessity to read as The Wheel of Time draws to it conclusion."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Crossroads of Twilight is book 10 of 14 in The Wheel of Time series and is widely (and in my view, correctly) regarded as the weakest offering in the series. It suffers from two fatal flaws: it for no good reason covers the same period of time from the POV of a number of characters (taking up the bulk of the book) and it lacks any real climax. It also spends too much time on minor characters and too little on major characters.But it's also the most \\"real\\" book in the series. The mass of pages devoted to the minor plots of scores of minor characters allows Jordan to show off his deep understanding of power and human nature. The problem is, that just doesn't necessarily mesh with the narrative requirements of fiction.I will say that this time around I feel differently about the much-maligned Faile-Perrin-Shaido storyline. It is still too inconsequential to the greater story for the attention it is given, but I now regard it as very fine storytelling in its own right.The original cover is just awful (albeit depicting an important scene). The ebook cover depicts a far more integral scene, and beautifully.Supergirls \`It's a Trap!'

Someone in front of me in line asked the question on everyone's mind: How many more books until the story is completed? Robert responded by saying he doesn't know himself, but expected there to be about 3 more volumes before the story is completed.Since the signing was for Winter's Heart (book 9), and Crossroads is book 10, that means RJ will have to wrap up all the loose ends in 2 volumes. Unfortunately, I just don't see that happening, and this book helped little to persuade me otherwise.Crossroads of Twilight is aptly named. Most of the characters here are indeed at a crossroads, where they will have to make a major decision. Unfortunately, little is accomplished in this novel. There is an overall theme of waiting that permeates this book. Now, after reading all of the books in this series, a slower pace to recoup and assess the Wheel of Time environment is a welcome pace from the rapid pace of the earlier novels. But an entire novel worth of waiting just makes me feel as if I have contributed to the &quot;RJ needs a summer home foundation.&quot;When the last pages have been read, almost nothing at all has happened. True some decisions have been made by Mat, Perrin, and Egwene, and Rand (I will not tell spoilers), but was it necessary to force the reader to flounder through hundreds of pages of boredom to reach them? And once the characters have chosen their own personal paths at the crossroads, the book abruptly ends!It is a shame to see this wonderful series starting to unravel. Despite the flak Mr. Jordan has (deservedly) received for this and the last couple of Wheel of Time novels, the first several were excellent fiction. I personally feel Mr. Jordan just kept expanding and expanding his story, but now there are simply too many characters to follow, and because of the extended time between novels, the casual Jordan reader (including myself) forgets most of the minor characters and is required to search online at a Wheel of Time website for a refresher. Novels shouldn't require homework.Also, there are too many loose ends that are dangling for a couple of novels to wrap up. In addition to Rand's destiny to defeat the Shadow and save (and break)the world, what about the Seanchan? The Aiel? The Shaido? The Aes Sedai? The Forsaken? The Black tower? The Whitecloaks? and Perrin and Faile? and Matt and Tuon? What about the Sea Folk? Whatever happened to Moiraine and Lanfear? Who is Cadsuane really? And Moridin? And on, and on, and on....In a USA Today interview, Robert Jordan sticks to his guns, and is shooting for an even dozen to complete the series. However, based on the legion of major and minor characters, and a looooong laundry list of plots and subplots that require closure, this is a near-impossible goal. Although I could see this concluding in about 4 or 5 books myself, I would be very impressed if he is able to conclude the storyline in just 2 more books. Regardless, the story has expanded as far as it will go, and must now contract to an epic end. The tools, the story, and the writing talent are all here. And if Robert Jordan succeeds, I am willing to forgive him for writing this one particularly dull book. Instead, I will regard Crossroads of Twilight as part of a greater whole, where in this novel, we merely experience the calm before the storm."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Surprise, surprise more build up and little or no action. This series is definitely making me understand why men don't like to be teased for too long! Is it possible for your brain to turn blue?O.K. it isn't horrible, it just isn't great. Again we are treated to the characters doing little or nothing. Rand barely appears and the majority of time is spent just setting up what is supposed to happen one day in the future. The whole book is basically about traveling around and talking about what is happening to the world as evil gains more influence.I hate to say it but I am actually hoping that the \\"bad guys\\" will win, or at least kill someone significant! The series has gotten so pathetic that you know no one is going to die, after all they must be there at the \\"last battle\\". Jordan is so in love with his characters that even the ones that he killed off, he has to hint at there returning to life. I just want someone \\"good\\" to be less then invincible. At least have something horrible happen to someone. Maybe Rand could get ....? I know that is cruel but he does have twins on the way so it isn't like he wouldn't have children. O.K. that is bad, well maybe one of the girls could lose a leg or be tricked into having an evil child. Give them some hard choices for once!Basically if you have read the last few books then you know what this book offers, more of the same. Nothing happens and it doesn't look like anything will be happening any time soon. If you haven't started at the first book of this series then it really isn't worth reading. In fact, if he continues this way, even loyal readers should save some time and just wait until the final book comes out to read any more.Personally, I will probably continue reading the series and hoping that Jordan will speed it to its conclusion."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I dove into this book with the hope that at least some of the many loose ends from the last several books would be tied up. Unfortunately, everyhere that Mr. Jordan resolved a conflict in the plot, two or three others popped up. As I kept reading, I nervously tracked how many pages remained in the book. By the time I got to the end, sure enough: Mr. Jordan left us with a huge cliff-hanger ending along with a brand new crop of unresolved loose ends. While this may be a style that is acceptable to some (perhaps those who are big fans of soap operas), it is not something I find particularly appealing. Mr. Jordan is a marvelous story teller. In the fourth, fifth, and sixth books of the series, he really succeeded in crafting long, involved, wonderful stories that could stand on their own. In contrast, his past several books, including this one, have taken on the character of the classic movie serials. Oldsters like me know that the movie serials were minichapters in a long storyline in which each serial merely serves as a teaser, and the audience is kept hanging until the next installment of the story. Unfortunately, The Wheel of Time is becoming just such a serial story, with much left to be resolved in succeeding chapters. I have no problem with stretching a plot over multiple books--this is, after all, the whole point in multivolume works. But in my view, there is a difference in having a series book as a mere placeholder in a chain of books and in having a series book enlarge the story line by standing on its own even while tying the greater plot together.I am having a hard time staying loyal to a series that I have stuck with for over seven years. Mr. Jordan's style is still engaging, and he is still a master of bringing the world of his books to life with his power of description and character development. But the sense of completeness that each book (even one in a series) should have was sadly lacking here. I long for the gigantic tomes earlier in the series (such as the aforementioned books 4, 5, and 6). They were great stand-alone stories that also tied together the greater plot. They were well worth the wait. COT, sadly, was not."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"while authors write professionally to make money, I still believe that authors hold a special trust with their readers to bring out the best work that they possibly can. I do not here discuss the fact that RJ's works have meandered on and stretched out unnecessarily, since that is my opinion (altho one shared by a great many) I do however hold issue with the fact that RJ is choosing to SELL parts of his books in advance via the internet as &quot;preview&quot;, and moreover i hold issue with the fact that RJ seems to be deliberately writing less pages for each book. For example, today i happened to glance at book 6 of the series, and compared to book 10 the font seems strikingly smaller while the amount of pages remian same. Is RJ and TOR seeking to squeeze out an extra book from the series thru using larger fonts per page? WIll WOT books soon read like restaurant menus rather than book pages? One can't fault an author for trying to make a buck, but nonetheless it saddens me to see one sell out his integrity for profit."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This book is only mildly entertaining. In all about 200 pages are worth reading. If it was a film it would have had a number of scenes removed. There was far too much tedious detail which added nothing to the plot. I'm sick to death of Avienda and Elayne. There was way too much stuff about Aes Sedai and Egwene. Wouldn't it have been more interesting to have more detail about the Asha'man. There are also quite a few characters who I have forgotten. It would have been nice if the glossary at the back had more imformation for those of us with short memories. In an interview with Robert Jordan he said that orginally he had planned three to four books. He then thought six would be enough. It is now up to ten and this last one was a big disapointment."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I loved it.Some of the books in this series are slow at times, although I didn't see that in this one at all. For once, the prologue had a great flow to it. It reminded you quite well of the all the different problems around the world, and the sentiments of the people living there. (without touching the main characters)The book didn't have much to do with Rand, but what did you expect after the last book had EVERYTHING to do with him.Not all that much exciting happened in this book, but I see it more as a precursor to a lot of excitement to come.Overall, the storytelling was excellant. And just when you thought the plot couldn't possibly get any thicker, it does. Great book, and I'll probably read it again while waiting for #11.I read some other bad reviews on this book. People unhappy with the lack of answered questions, and with the slow movement of the plot.If you want constant crazy adventure, all of your questions answered, and the whole story wrapped up nice and neat...then you should have probably never started this series, much less continued through the 1000's of pages to get to book 10.Jordan has put out a series that only stays in the 'fantasy' category because it entails magic and swordsmen. But regardless, it is true literature."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I have loved the previous 9 books in this series and would rate them all 5's. This book, however, stinks. NOTHING HAPPENS. Most books have some sort of climax, this has none. I don't know what took him 2 plus years to write this but I hope I won't have to wait another two years to read the next book. I feel as though I wasted my money purchasing this. Do yourself a favor, borrow it from the library, this book isn't worth the paper it is printed on."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This book is true to Robert Jordan's form- slow, plodding and overly detailed. He spends pages describing dresses, of all things! Not a single clothing change goes unnoticed, as each dress, no matter how transitory, gets its embroidery, material, color, feel, protection from the elements, and cleavage showing described.He also fails to move the plot along strictly because of the sheer weight of the 15 or so subplots that don't need a chapter to review. The book lacks focus, and it shows.It wasn't always like this. Jordan's first five books in the series manage to include enough detail to completely flesh out the world without weighing down the action. The previous books had a minimum amount of downtime, but now he writes entire books of downtime.I don't know; I'll give the series one more pass. If Jordan drops the ball again, that's the last straw."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I can't believe I waited 3 years for this.

How could you have published this book, when it could have been pared down into the prologue for Book 10 is just unbelievable. If Book 11 is anything like the last 3 books and most especially Crossroads, then I will no longer be reading The Wheel of Time.

Seriously, if any reader of this review looks at the average Amazon review of all 10 of the books in the series thus far, you'll see that the Wheel did indeed stop turning, somewhere around Book 7. Jordan's pen/typewriter/WP was on fire for 6 years and brought us some of the most engaging stories and characters in fantasy lit history. After Book 6, it took Jordan 9 years to write 4 books that didn't go anywhere.I can accept one book in a epic like this as being \\"set-up\\" as many fans of Crossroads have extolled. BUT FOUR!!? No, sorry, Jordan has lost the touch. I'd like to think he's hit a major block in his vision and not sold out to the publisher but who knows. Yes, I think all WOT fans would like to hope and pray that Jordan will turn it around and we'd get back our great epic but that doesn't seem likely. Oh and if he keeps his current rate up, we won't see Book 11 until somewhere around mid-late 2005.Jordan, its time for the Last Battle, but stage it VERY soon, or you won't have any spectators at all who are going to care."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I am one of the fortunate fans that skipped book ten. My reasoning for not buying CoT has nothing to do with the other online reviews (although they are a great reinforcement), it has solely to do with books 8 and 9. Book 8 seemed disappointing to me, but I stuck it out to book 9, which was an absolute disaster. I ordered Winter's Heart with the latest installment from George R. R. Martin, and read them back to back. The difference was astounding toe to toe. Martin's work had such depth, creativity, action and plot development when compared to Winter's Heart. It was like a cloud had been lifted and I was able to see the truth - the WOT series now appears to be the juvenile meanderings of a has-been money grubbing sell-out. The characters are stuck in a rut and have not grown, matured, or expandend over the past several thousand pages. To top it off, it now looks like they don't do anything but wheel around aimlessly. It seems that the author is writing for the sake of writing, like some people who can talk for hours without listening. I swore at that point that I would not buy another WOT book until the series was completed and available in paperback, and only then if the reviews justified it. I am sticking to this plan in round one, and judging from the reviews, I am the better for it."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Reading this book is like reading the first draft of an obviously intelligent student's term paper, and realizing that it was started two hours before class. We know that Robert Jordan is capable of greatness, and we get \\"Glimmers\\" (heh) of it throughout the book, but the overall book feels rushed in the sense that it is extremely unpolished and slow in the sense that, well, as everyone has pointed out, NOTHING HAPPENS.Things that were once so interesting about his story(the male/female dynamic, for example...) have devolved into cliches, at the price of not only his series' greatness but also its realism. The best example I can give is when Setalle Anan hands Tuon a mug to throw at Matt during one of their little domestic disputes. Ok, has Setalle Anan, the former Aes Sedai who risked her skin to get her daughters and that petulant Green out of Ebou Dar alive completely forgotten that Tuon is the HEAD OF THE SEANCHAN ARMY, the EMBODIMENT OF ALL EVIL in her eyes? Or is it just that, in Robert Jordan's world, no matter what differences seperate the two, one woman will always take another's side against a man, even if that man is her daughters' saviour and the woman is (all together now) THE EMBODIMENT OF ALL THAT IS EVIL?What's worse, the main characters seem to have devolved as well. At first I was dissappointed to hear that my favorite female character, Nyneave, was hardly in the book at all. When I saw her cameo, and reread her sections in Winter Heart, I was relieved. She evolved quite a bit in the first half of the series, from bossy Wisdom to reluctant apprentice to self-loathing coward and finally, miracle worker and hero. Then, for some reason, she devolved into a petulant child who runs off with Rand and Lan in Book Nine to go on an \\"adventure\\" (reflecting, rather stupidly at one point, that \\"my God, people are going to die!!! Keep in mind this is the same woman who burned a Seanchan soldier to death in Book Two.) Now in Book Ten, we see her acting as Lan's cheerleader. I hope Moghedien finds her quick and reminds her of who she was.There were good parts. Alviarin's point of view was excellent (except for Shadar Haran, who comes across less as an avatar for the Dark One and more as a dirty old man) and the ghosts were a nice touch. But none of the main characters are readable anymore. Nyneave's a twit, Rand doesn't seem to do much, Perrin needs to grow up.... Elayne simply NEEDS TO DIE. Only Mat and Egwene still retain any vestige of their former selves, and Mat spends the entire book getting browbeaten by his future wife and Egwene gets clonked on the head.The book wouldn't have been so bad if the first half of the series hadn't been so good."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This is just one reviewer that will say -- I never bought book 9 (borrowed it from a friend) and will not buy book 10. I just scan the reviews to get an understanding of what happens. One way to send Jordan a message is to not buy his books. Which appears to be the case because this book has gone on the &quot;Special Saver&quot; list already in many bookstores.Waste of money and time after book 6."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I've been a fan of this series since the first book, but this one is a waste. I'm feeling more and more manipulated by the author here. I paid for the book in hard cover, and got nothing in return. He seems to be dragging this series out to no purpose, or at least just to sell more books.With one rather inplausible exception, all the charicters are exactly where they were at the beginning of the book, at the end of the book. Mr Jordan is so bogged down in irrelevant detail that he can't seem to move the story forward at all. This book is little more than widow dressing, and anyone skipping it will have no trouble picking up the next book and keeping up with the story.I mean no disrespect to Mr Jordan, the writing is solid, but who really cares about the rediculous details about minor characters expresions or manerisms? We get pages of it here! The last three books could have easily been one, and saved your readers the money and the wait. At this pace it's unlikely he will conclude this series in his lifetime."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Very disappointed. Not what I expected. Certainly not the type of writing of the first 5 books. Time to move on to another series."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I'm also one of his bigger fans, even going to his book signing on 1/7 in NYC, and have NO problem with a book filled with follow up and set up to what came before and what's to come. And I actually even appreciated the relatively constant point of view. In the past RJ jumped from character to character nearly every chapter. Here is stays with the character for 3, 5, or more chapters in a row.Problem is, the writing is really sloppy here. In the tenth installment and with the 100's of characters running around, his descriptions no longer stand out. Who can remember if someone's dress was crimson or blue? Which of the 100 Aes Sedai who seem to &quot;smooth their skirts&quot; is doing so this time? The writing isn't strong enough in this book to differentiate all these actions, characters and descritpions in a meaningful way. Its also hard to imagine that every character in the book is passive agressive...what happened to &quot;show don't tell&quot;? Can't RJ give us some credit by letting us figure out what the characters are thinking just from their words and actions every once in a while? He did this a little bit with Mat and Tuon, but not nearly enough.Sometimes its nice to be able to come up with yoyr own possibilities instead of having the character run through all 10 conceivable explanations for why someone was looking shifty for you....And it would have been nice to have at least SOME reaction from one of the characters that could tell what Rand accomplished in Winter's Heart. Maybe even Rand himself? Or Logain, Taim, one of the Foresaken, our tall friend Hand of the Shadow, anyone, someone, please! Its hard to imagine that Logain wouldn't have at least THOUGHT about it when the writing was from his perspective....Twice as much could easily have been put in here, still with plenty of rich detail. For the first time this book made me feel that RJ was just trying to get my dollar - that he isn't respecting his readers at all. If the first book had been this sloppy and slow he'd still be only in paperback."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Overall, I was quite disappointed with the content. I had a hard time getting into the book, and it wasn't till the last quarter that it really got rolling for me. I need to think on this for a week or so, but I think that CoT is right up there as RJs weakest performance in the series. To me there just isn't that much to discuss in the rest of the book.After I read Glimmers, there was dozens of points that I wanted to go over. But the rest of the book just doens't have them. I was bummed about this. There just aren't many revlations-- just alot of filler.RJ really startled me with this book. I thought he was a much better writer than this. This book was like the middle of a chess game. A lot of pieces were moved around, but absolutely no pieces were captured. Apparently, the captures will all take place in the take book. I will still bear with RJ, as I have been reading the series for 7 years. However, I don't think I will recommend this series to my friends anymore, at least not until RJ picks the pace up again.I am very hopeful for the next book, however. There is no way, unless he wants to lose all his fans, that he cannot have a good book. There is just too much posed right on the edge of action right now.I really felt like RJ could have squished this whole book into a couple hundred pages. I used to be an editor at my university so I have some experience in these matters.However, I really did like the last quarter-- I loved Rand's chapters, I loved seeing Tuon's courtship with Mat, and there was some good evil Povs.I wasn't too enthralled with Perrin however. It just seemed so redundant.There wasn't really a dramatic plot.Because there were no climatic points in this book, no character resolution. Everything just kind of stayed the same.In my opinion, this is the worst book of the series.Even PoD had some big events that happened, and not necessarily all of them were battles. I liked ACoS, and even WH was good,but if you make a list of what happened in WH or PoD and compare it with CoT, you will see that CoT is sorely lacking.I was made cause there was way to much filler description, and not nearly enough plot advancement.Fantasy is supposed to have battles, and struggles between good and evil. But this had no fights, none. Evil hardly appeared.This book was more like a soap opera than fantasy. I really felt that RJ needed a good editor to trim down some parts- cause this easily good have been 300 pages. Then he could have actually made some stuff happen.I don't care if there are battles or not, but this book just is not a good stand-alone.Finally, one crucial element missing was info to theorize on. This had almost no good info.I felt like the prologue had more material revealed then the whole rest of the book. That is very, very bad."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"How much longer can he milk this thing i think we deserve the end.

Jordan is a masterful story teller. If he were spinning this yarn by a village camp fire, we would be dazzled and never miss a session... it would also take several years to tell the story. If the story were being told live, we might expect to be able to ask &quot;remind me who that is again?&quot; when a character from last year's telling suddenly re-appeared, and the story would unfold in little bits while we sat on the edges of our chairs. We also might appreciate some of the extreme details giving a communal narrative presentation... things like the blue streaked marble of a fireplace in a room that we enter only once in 8000 pages and has no impact on the story.Meanwhile, back in book reading land, I've been reading these darn books for something like eight years. It a compelling story, with wonderful plot twists, and engaging characters, but it has begun to drag and lose momentum. The details about what people are wearing and how they style their hair are rich and give insight into the varied cultures of Jordan's fantasy world, but they are far too numerous. I can imagine CoT's story being told in 300-400 tight pages of prose and improving because of it.I'm hooked at this point, if I live long enough (and Jordan lives long enough), I'll read the whole darn series. I hope for better editing and tighter prose. If you haven't started, don't. Wait until the last book has been published. Two years between volumes is too long to keep track of the HUNDREDS of characters who have been introduced and DOZENS of plot lines. This is the first book I've ever read that in retrospect I would have been well advised to keep notes on each character introduced, just so I can follow the complexity of the story. Building a database would NOT be overkill.If you are looking for a fast read, don't start. If you are looking for a rich and compelling story, wait until you can buy every darn volume and then plan on spending a season or two doing nothing else."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I'm not really reviewing, so much as complaining...I believed that Crossroads of Twilight was to be the last of what has been a mostly good, pretty exciting, albeit somewhat exasperating series. Obviously, I was wrong and of course, I was bound to be disappointed - not in the book, no, though it didn't have the same pace as some of the previous ones, and was almost plodding in some places...however, I digress. I was merely disappointed, because when I started reading, it soon became pretty apparent that it WASN'T the last book of the series, and there was still a long way to go! Most annoying. However, depite the disappointment of the series not being finished, I did enjoy this book and at least it's setting things in motion for the last battle/end of the world/Tarmon Gai'don/whatever...I won't hold my breath in hoping that the next book will be the last, from some of the comments other reviewers have made. I'll just have to wait another 2 - 5 years before the NEXT book comes out... (Please can you write just a leetle bit faster, Mr Jordan?? Please?)"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Like other reviewers of this book, I have been a big fan of the WOT series and was bitterly dissapointed by this book. I think Mr. Jordan lost his place in the plot line and had to write a new novel to remind himself what happened in book 9. I am hopeing that book 11 will be better because it can't get much worse. I rated this book a three only because after two years I was simply happy to see Jordan hadn't died or forgotten he was writing an unending series. The book babbles with interior monologues and lacks the humor, sensuality, or plot of the previous novels. Also, several key figures are entirely absent e.g. Paiden Fain, Gawyn Trakland, etc. I was 100 pages from theend when I realized that Rand had not even been seen yet. Also, the characters have become stagnant. Perrin is obsessed, Matt is STILL whinning (since the first book), Egwene is growing cold, and Elayne moody (although the women have at least changed, if not for the better). Overall, if you love the series read the book only so the next one can proove how bad this one was. Hopefully Jordan will redeem himself before destroying an amazeing legacy of books."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I'm a devoted Jordan fan, but....skip this book, and try the next one.

They are still great, while the new ones get worse and worse. or... Perhaps my expectations keep going up, and keep getting dashed.If you are a die hard fan, buy the book. New readers, buy the older books and enjoy a real treat. If you are still facinated by the time you get to books 8-10, they still are OK with the promise of the best book yet to come. (If Jordan can get the plot moving, i.e. lets see 2-3 minor battles and several questions resolved in the next book. If he can get out the mud, we will see a book on par or better than the old books)Now a note (Rant) to the Author:Jordan, why are you spending so much time detailing every second of the day on these charactors???? WE have never been that interested in them anyway. I know, we said they were shallow, but the attempt to flush them out and make them more intersting is NOT working. The characters are still shallow, and the plot line is suffering badly.How about a major confrontation between Rand and his girls(possibly with the intervention of the Wise Ones, who seem to have a more adult relationship with the men). Let them realize he is an adult and does not need them to (always) mother him. Let them take on roles, as with the Aiel, and meet to discuss and manage their plans as a group of equal rulers. Also a confrontation between the Aiel Wise Ones and the Tower would be in order. Lets establish some mutual respect. EXACTLY what is the tower better than the Aiel Wise Ones at? Something I hope!"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Man I sure wish I could write something like the WOT series. I'd milk it for all it is worth every last penny like Jordan is doing. Other reviewers have called him a master storyteller and to stick with it. If I read another 1 page description of what one of the characters is going to wear(or is wearing) I'm gonna burn the book. I got news for the people that &quot;think&quot; him a master storyteller: A master does a whole lot better job keeping you interested in his work. And keeping you interested is NOT being so descriptive over and over and over and over. It just looks like filler for the word counter.

I have seen soap opera plots move along faster than WOT. While I enjoy his writing, and I'm rather addicted to the characters and storyline, Book 10 left me feeling rather cheated. But, I had to have my fix to what will happen next (Not much...) and I'll probably buy the next one in a year or two.WARNING! If you have yet to start reading the Wheel Of Time series, DON'T! Or at least wait another decade for all of the books to come out and then read it. It will save yourself a lot of anguish."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Jordan keeps stinging me. I waited to buy Winter's Heart when it was in paperback, then wanted to kick myself when I read it because I enjoyed it as much as many of the earlier books. So I rushed out to buy Crossroads, hoping it would keep up the momentum from Winter's Heart. Well, sorry, it doesn't.It won't spoil anything to tell you (except maybe your hopes) that two-thirds of this book takes place BEFORE the climax of Winter's Heart (Rand and company at Shadar Logoth).This isn't a bad book. Far from it. But it is the worst volume yet in terms of being standalone. Everyone's separate plotlines move a little further forward, but no plotline reaches any sort of climax. I could have dealt with this if just ONE plotline had reached a turning point (as in Winter's Heart). But no.What is funny, even as I lament about how the size of this story seems to be spinning out of control, the parts I enjoy most are the new characters Jordan keeps throwing into the mix, many of them point-of-view characters.Still, taken chapter by chapter, there are still great things here. A chapter told from Alviarin's point-of-view that probably needs to be reread several times to catch all that is revealed or foreshadowed. More of Cadsuane, who is rapidly becoming the most intriguing character. Lots about Mat's foretold bride-to-be, who promises to become even more important in the next book. And tons and tons of set-up for things to come.If you only view the book as chapters 710 to 743 of the novel The Wheel of Time, there's nothing to have a problem with. but if you were hoping to have your Wheel of Time itch scratched, well, the itch is going to be ten times worse after this one.My recommendation, wait till the next book comes out in hardcover, then read this one and that one together."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Jordan is still dragging this out...Ten books is more than enough...Let it go...Anyone who reads this book will notice that next to nothing is accomplished from the end of book nine to the end of book ten...It is nearly a complete waste of time as far as the story goes...And HELLO, Rand is the main character yet he is almost completely missing from this book...Very, very disappointed!!!"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I can sum up the Latest WOT book in one sentence.

True there were a few nuggets of information thrown in to tantalise the people who haunt internet message boards with clues as to what it going on behind the scenes..... But Nothing Happened! Unbelievably, instead of attempting to join and resolve plot issues Jordan has added a whole bucket full of new issues. I dont believe this series will ever end. It would take ten more books just to sort out the loose ends enough to have a Last Battle. Everyone in this book is so busy being mysterious and keeping their plans concealed from everyone including their own internal monologue, that by the end you dont even care that a main character is captured by her worst enemies.Some one needs to hand jordan a copy of the fires of heaven or the lord of chaos and then erase his computer database of characters so he might actually stick with the main three or four and abandon the five hundred bit players he has introduced. I am so sick of reading the same description of Thom Merrilon over and over again.While i am on character specific rants.... Why is Perrin out in the middle of nowhere? Why is Matt content to take four months to get back to Rand? Why are elayne and egwene so painful to read about any more? I feel like i am digesting a text book so i wont fail a test when i read chapters devoted to shopping for grain in So Habor, while Rand is practically left out of the book.Do your self a favor, start the entire series at the beginning before you read this installment, that way you will have eight good books to off set the 2 bad ones.

I've been reading this series for 13 years now, and was hoping that with the momentous event at the end of the previous book we'd finally start wrapping this thing up. Nope. The plot advances very little in book 10, there are no big surprises or revelations and the characters are all still in the same predicaments they were in at the end of book 9. I can't imagine what the author was thinking. For the vast majority of the book, we see what everyone else was doing up to the time of the end of book 9, so it's not even advancing chronologically. Still, I will be one of the first in line to buy book 11 because after such a substantial investment in time, money, and enjoyment of the first 8 books, I really want to see how this thing ends. If it ever does."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"My problem is I don't have a good one after two long years or the 100 hours it would take me to re-read the series. What started out as my favorite series of books--period, has slowly dissolved into echoes of boredom. I can't remember who 600 minor uninteresting characters are or what their place is. Rand, the best and who I thought initially was the Luke Skywalker of this series, is dangled in front of you 500 pages into the book simply as a cameo appearence. Perrin and Mat are great, but they do nothing significant. The rest are just a bunch of giddy girls, again accomplishing nothing. Mr. Jordan, please get the big three back together (Mat, Perrin and Rand), get their girl problems fixed, and go on the warpath! This book should have been 20 pages (he started to do it at the very end when Mat started courting Tuon). The last 20 pages of Winter's Heart was some of the best stuff in the series but again most of the rest is just fluff. New readers read the first six books and then read the Sword of Truth Series while you wait for the last book where I think there will have to be some action.... I think its possible, although it would be a total ____over, if right before the Last Battle Jordan has Rand wake up in Emond Field right as the Trollocs come (Eye of the World), thus discovering he is a Dreamer (and what he must do) and end the series!"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Robert Jordan wrote his review, &quot;The words popped out of his mouth before they were clear in his head. He realized that they had been lying there for some time, though, murky and slowly solidifying.&quot; (p. 131)"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I don't think that it is the same author who started the series. There was more time spent describing what everyone was wearing than there was advancing the plot! Not a single trolloc, myrdraal, battle, or discovery in the entire book. The only bright spot was the interaction between Tuon and Mat, other than that I'm horribly disappointed. If you are a fan of the series, you will probably read this book, if you have only read the first few, don't expect this to follow in the footsteps of the early part of the series. If Mr. Jordan cares about his fans, he will get back to what brought us all in in the first place; action, plot advancement, new discoveries, and a light at the end of the tunnel."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This book was pathetic. I slowly managed my way through the 90 pg. prologue, where, of course, we are plagued by new characters or minor characters that don't seem to have any real purpose in the greater scheme of things. And then I start getting into the real book. Nothing happens.Oh well, I shrugged, and continued reading. 400 pgs in. Nothing has happened. Absolutely nothing has happened. Unless you count a two page essay on how to clean silk.As I got closer to the end, I slowed, hoping that -some- action would end the book, that at least -one- plotline would be resolved. But no.Robert Jordan needs to wake up and stop writing what appears to be 650 pg. prologues for the next book. At this rate, the series will -never- end and he'll just continue to reap in the dough. Well not anymore. I, for one, refuse to buy a Wheel of Time book again. Thanks, Jordan, for writing six good books."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Much has already been said about this book, so I'll summarize my point here:There is insufficient plot and character development. Jordan essentially wrote 700 pages of prologue to his next book. Crossroads of Twilight could have set the stage while managing to tie up at least a few of the many loose plot threads in the series. It lacks any real direction or purpose, which makes for an unsatisfying reading experience."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I frequently sample new writers and am frequently surprised to find a new favorite author...which is how I initially lucked into Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series. I normally look forward to his releases but now just look forward to the final installment, if/when he ever decides to write it. The 10th book in the series is beyond the pale; just looks like random thoughts put together to meet a publishing deadline. I skimmed through countless chapters of minor players...too many threads in this convoluted picture. Hopefully, the editors will take note of the many negative critiques this book will get and will get Jordan back on track. As for me...I will wait and read the reviews FIRST before buying any new installments in this series."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"After reading through chapter after chapter of useless detail that failed to progress the plot, I was expecting something major to happen with Rand at the end to make it all worth it. What a disappointment! What a waste of money. I should have waited to buy this one used for 4 or 5 dollars. I thought book 9 was short on substance, but book 10 makes it look great!"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"There are two reasons for me posting this review. The first is to help ensure that the rating of this book never gets beyond its 1.5 star average. The second reason is more selfish, I need to make a public confession of my stupidity in order to get some personal closure (lord knows you won't find it in this series).I bought the hardcover of this book when it first came out and was stunned by its lack of plot and endless stream of characters. Like other reviewers have mentioned, I found myself grazing over whole chapters looking for sentences that contained some indication that something was happening. Thus my foray into stupidity began, I finished the book.But no, the greatest act of stupidiy was yet to come. Many moons later I was browsing around Sam's club (the poor man's Costco) and saw the latest novel in the Wheel of Time saga in paperback. It was cheap and I said to myself &quot;self, give him another chance, it's cheap and maybe Jordan will redeem himself&quot;. After slogging through about 150 pages or so I came to the horrible realization that this wasn't a new book, this was just the paperback version of the hardcover I had already suffered through.Aside from you now knowing that I am stupid, I am hoping that my experience is enlightening to those of you thinking about buying this pile of cr*p. Let's look at what you can learn from my experience about the nature of this book which I believe can be summarized in two sentences ( which also happens to be the number of sentences this book's plot could have been summarized in as well...a cosmic coincidence?)1. There are so many books in this series that I couldn't even remember the title of the ones I have already read.2. Book 10 had so little happening that it took me 150 pages to realize I had already read it. Yes, it was that memorable and filled with significant events.I would tell you to save your money and get the book from the library but that would be akin to me telling you to save money and extract your own teeth instead of paying a dentist. Either option leaves you suffering and should be avoided."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Robert Jordan is still not over the 7th Book Itch. Unlike fellow Charlestonian, Citadel Grad, and author Pat Conroy; RJ is evidently spending too much time walking the beaches of Kiawah and staring at his fish. Absolutely minimal action and no real plot development. I have read all the books in this series, and feel incredibly let down by this lazy apparently last minute effort. To add insult to injury, we are to wait 2+ years for more disappointment? Oh Goody. A tough critique from a loyal fan Mr. Jordan, because we all deserve better than this."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I have read all 10 books. I have never in my life read a series, where it did not end, which every one exspected in book 10. But instead, we got a bunch of run around, skip, jump, and no adventure, fighting, nothing to do with Rand, but 1 page. Who, as an Author writes 10 humungous(SP)books, and than never finishes the series, but starts a 3 book Prequil?, what is going through this man's head. I was so disapointed in book 10 I almost Puked, it took me 1.5 months to read it. I can usually read a 400-600 page book in 3 days, maybe even 2, depending on how it grabs me, well, 1.5 months, is the longest it has taken me to read any book, what a piece of garbage in my opinion, all other nine were good, most of them moved along quite well. Book 10 sucked, that is my honest opinion, I am glad I finally finished it and can get on to some good reads.But of course, me being one to have to finish a series, ordered book 11, and have it one my shelf, along with 120 more unread new books. And I tell you folks one thing, the Prequil Series better be good or I will consider this man a fruit cake for what he has done to his readers.David M.

Can you even call this a book? I first read the reviews posted here before reading COT so i was forwarned. I was just so curious to see if the book really is as bad as everyone says it is.GUESS WHAT. IT'S WORSE!!. TAKE EVERYTHING SAID IN THESE REVIEWS AND MULTIPLY IT BY ONE THOUSAND!! It's that bad. I will certainly not buy any more books by RJ until he finishes the series. And for God's sake STAY AWAY FROM THE PREQUEL! DON'T BUY IT. DON'T ENCOURAGE HIM. Anyway that was my 2 cents worth.

This story was great. I couldn't get enough of it. I Bought the first five books in hardback, mainly because I wanted these to last and possibly, share this wonderful story with others.While I'm glad I own several of these books, I just can't help but to come to the conclusion of severe disappointment over the last two novels. I've made mistakes in my life, I guess Jordan does too. It's too bad that I've made two mistakes in buying his last pair of pages, horrible things, with covers. COT has to be the most recklessly useless part of this wonderful story that drearly turns into absolute cesspool material. He could have taken it into fantasy porn and it would have been better.I honestly do not believe that this novel would have been published under any other author's name. Hopefully, Mr. Jordan will relinquish his obsession with the formalaties with tea and wrinkle-free skirts. Instead, I hope he concentrates on the conflicts which orignally gained him notability in this genre.This is a poster-child of a good story gone bad. Don't waste your money on this &quot;book&quot;. Hopefully, Jordan and TOR will stop milking this cow and try to return to something less disapointing."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Garbage...pure garbage. Like most WOT fans I LOVED the first three books, and very much enjoyed books 4-6. Then I read book 7 and thought, &quot;What the hell?&quot; Then I bought book 8 and declared that I would never give Jordan another cent of my money. I read the last two books, I must admit, but I got them at the library...Jordan will never again get a cent of my money. Also I skimmed books 9 and 10. Guess how long it takes to read a 700 page book if you skip all the crap you have already read 10 times before and just skim the actual things that the characters say? I'll tell you...it only takes a couple hours. How can a man write 4 700+ page books (books 7-10) and barely have the plot progress? It boggles the mind. After skimming book 10 you know what I think? I don't even care any more. He could tell me that book 11 is the last book and will wrap everything up splendidly...guess what? I DON'T CARE!! I still won't read it. My interest in Rand and his friends is totally and completely gone. Way to waste what was once a great story just so you could separate your loyal fans from their hard earned cash. Jordan can bite me."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Loved the first four books...end good review.To tell you how bad the latest books in the series are, the hardcover edition of winter's heart or is it winter's gate, I forget, has been on the same shelf in the bookstore at a bargain price of $6.99 and still hasn't sold.

I'll go to the library!"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Well, I have to agree with the person below who wrote that Jordan's characters are completely boring, all too similar, and childlike. I have to disagree with the person who said Jordan doesn't \\"steal\\" ideas, he just adapts them. I'd agree with that IF Jordan's \\"borrowing\\" was simply the general story of reluctant savior/youth saves the world. But the parts he steals are entire characters, tendencies, battle styles, etc. The Void is straight out of Steve Perry's works, as is the \\"Crane Fights Boar\\" \\"Turtle Rushes Down Stream\\" etc. battle moves. The main characters start out as sad copies of David Edding's works. I'd call that stealing, not borrowing. Of course, we see from recent books 6-10 that Jordan is incapable of creating anything interesting any more, so that must explain it all."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Let's face it, Wheel of Time is really some very good fantasy soap opera. It's not my favorite but I can't pretend that I didn't really enjoy the first several novels.But good soaps have to figure out how to keep their content interesting and Jordan is failing. I'm glad he's not just swapping slove interests around like TV soaps (although marrying off multiple women to each guy isn't that far off) Instead it's climax time. Jordan did a very interesting job of developing characters for a number of books. That is, IMO, what really set the series apart -- having such richly developed characters (along with having interesting truly long-term plot archs). But too much of a good thing can happen, and has happened.Book 9 did look to be setting things in a better direction, moving us towards the climax of the series. But this book took several steps backwards. The characters are cooked. They were getting brown and crispy a few books ago. Book 10 has pages, upon pages, upon pages of characterization that merely repeats what was done books ago (the Elayne chapters are the worst). It's time to take the turkey out of oven and serve it, ala climax, and move on to some fresh stories with lots of new opportunities to develop interesting characters."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"However the fingernail kept me awake. This series started out as such a great series quickly catapulting it to my favorite. It's good to see an author become only about the money and try to drag the series out to milk it for all its worth. I agree that there is a chance to turn this series around because I do see flashes of the writer that I liked. But the past 3 or 4 books have been increasingly disappointing, culminating with this book. This series has become a stagnant series and will soon be bought in the bargain bin.After waiting what seemed forever for this book, I ran home and started reading it. Finally getting disgusted around page 100 I got to the actual main characters. Yeah. Then around page 500 I got to see Rand. Yeah again. But can someone tell me why Rand has less pages than the supporting cast! Why all the fluff? Did his editors require a certain number of pages? I really do hope that the reviews of the still faithful are not incorrect and that you will turn this series around. But if this excuse of a book is the best Jordan can do anymore, I suggest he wraps it up in the next book and quits while he still has some fans."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I was an AVID fan of the first five or six books of the Wheel of Time series, but books seven through ten have really had that &quot;throwing in the anchor&quot; feel to them, as Jordan slowed the storytelling pace to a crawl and milks this thing for all it's worth. It's come to the point where I literally cannot finish reading the latest book &quot;Crossroads of Twilight&quot;. The story is so slow, so tedious in its detail, and so sprawling in the number of characters and political minutia, that I have reached the point where I no longer care. I'm deeply saddened that Jordan has transformed such an initially good and emotionally engaging story into such dry, lifeless tedium. Don't waste your money on this travesty."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I WAS a huge fan of the Wheel of Time series until book 9, Winter's Heart. Now with book 10, I am offically off of the Wheel bandwagon. Since Jordan began this series, several other fantasy have started and brought the a new, fresh perspective that Mr. Jordan did in '95. Most of these new wave of fantasy books incorporate a huge ammount of political intrigue and backstabbing and other &quot;historically real&quot; senarios. After reading Crossroads of Twilight, it is apparent that Jordan has been reading some of these works as well.Robert Jordan spins countless NEEDLESS political senarios, for instance the whole Elayne-Egwene-Rand-Black Tower issue... or you could choose the Rand-Black Tower issue, how about the sworn sisters-Rand-Egwene stuff too. He seems to be writing willy-nilly in this volume,trying too hard to incorporate a more political flair, expecting the reader to forget relationships fostered and nutured through the previous volumes. This makes the formerly only needless senarios also confusing.Mr. Jordan also furthers this ridiculousness by throwing out too many names and introducing too many characters. I for one am tired of names with one letter differences involved in a pages long dialog about nothing. I would have rather waited an additonal two years for Mr. Jordan to actually bring a book worthy of the Wheel of Time. As it stands now, he has been on a descent into uninspired blandness since book 7."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Crossroads is a miserable book. Just awful. There is no follow up to Rand's supposed cleansing of the source or anything that the series was originally about. Jordan, for whatever bizarre reasons of his own, chooses to focus on the absolute worst storyline in the series: the once likeable Perrin and his tiresome wench Faile. The Mat backstory barely redeems the book, because it takes 200+ pages to tell what should have taken 20.It is eerie how checked out the editors at TOR are. Have they, like, not read the last 4 books, much less edited them? I think this series is a case study in marketing a fading brand -- when quality fails you fall back and cannibalize your loyal customer base with new, similar products. ..."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"To say that I am frustrated does not capture the depth of my feeling. I, like so many others, suffered the years between the last installments hoping beyond hope that this one, unlike the last several, would move the plot forward. I like character development and I enjoy the art of writing a scene so that the reader can actually envision it. But, that said, we read epics because of the adventure. There was no adventure to be had in this volume. It was a sidebar: What everyone else doing when Rand cleansed saidin. It certainly could have been said, if it had to be said, shorter and without the repetition from earlier installments. And then, the book should have moved us closer to the Last Battle. I look forward to Number 11 with dread. I will read it because I have come this far. But it is the last time that I will take Jordan on faith. If 11 doesn't come through, I am finished with the series."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This book did not stink because it didn't have war. This book stinks because nothing substantial at all happened. NEW CHARACTERS were introduced. Get on with the story of the characters whom we have grown to love and whom we bought the book to find out about. There was no character development or plot development. I now have a clearer sense of what people looked like, dresses, smiles and all. This series is like a professional athlete; If it sticks around too long it will become a laughing stock. Robert Jordan if you are reading this, the reader wants closure. I seriously think he will die of old age before finishing the series."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I consider myself a fan of the series. Let's face it, anyone who's plowed through all ten of these things has to be a fan. But I could not have been more disappointed in the most recent installment. Anything that actually progressed the story line could have been covered in a few chapters. If this book had not been written, the next book could have brought the readers up to speed with a good intro, and nobody would ever have known anything was missing. For the most part the book is just rehashing the same points that have already been covered. There may be some new conversations and events with new or different people, but nothing changes the actual events of the story. For the most part the main characters end the book exactly where they started it. Considering this book covered only a couple days worth of time, and the fact that Robert Jordan now seems intent on covering every minute and mundane thought and deed of everyone's every day life, we have a long way to go till the end."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I don't really know what to say....this book was a real let down.....especially after waiting over two years...I was really hoping to say \\"Wow !

After finishing each, I couldn't wait for the next one to come out. However, in the last 2 books, Mr. Jordan has taken tens of thousands of words to painstakingly say absolutely nothing. With creations of fiction like this, he should take his talents to the speech writing corps for the Democratic Party. I have wasted [money] and two weeks of my free time reading his last two \\"efforts,\\" and have in doing so, I have been played for a fool. I'll not be again. I won't spend another dime on his books, and will read the reviews to see if anything actually HAPPENS in the next novels before I borrow them with great trepidation from my local library."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Ditto to what everyone else is saying. It would have been wonderful if something would have actually happened in this book, but descriptions of clothing, pointless conversations, and the introduction of literally dozens of characters that do absolutely nothing fill this book. I think Jordan has completely lost touch with the idea of what details are important to a story. If this series is supposed to end in another 2 books, my guess is everyone will sit around and smooth their skits and drink tea until the last page of book 12 when a horde of space aliens will swoop down blow eveything up."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"As I read the reviews for the WOT books i feel i am reading something from an impatient 1st grader. Starting with the first book i was hooked from the start. Unlike most people, I thought the books were great up to and including the 6th book. Yes the story has slowed some since then due to the huge amount of plot going on but its obvious the end is going to be worth the wait.Every book from Crown of Swords on has been setting up the end. I too wish the books would come more than once every 2 years but i eagerly purchase every one and wish the story would never end in a way. I have read every book at least 6 times and will read them again.The only reason for only giving this book 3 stars is that nothing really climaxes in this book. There are many plots that i am sure will finally be resolved in the next book though and cant wait.."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I know many out there who are Jordan fans were very disappointed with the last book. However, I just started the series in January and I found that if you read them straight through that Crossroads fits in nicely. However, if I had to wait three or four years I could understand the disappointment. I recommend reading the whole series again in order without any big breaks. You may find this helpful."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Robert Jordan's epic continues in this book with ever new plot twists and diabolical evil at every turn. Just when the protagonists seem to be settling in to their final positions for the \\"last battle\\" new developments turn everything around 180 degrees. I've been hooked on this series for only the past year - thankfully - no waiting a year for the next novel! As with all the others, this is a densely written adventure. It creates a world and characters with such detail that you are completely drawn in - the ultimate in escapism! After finishing a WOT book, I feel bereft for a few days, wondering how all the characters are getting along - they are real to me! The book would not stand on its own - but as a cog in the wheel (no pun intended) it serves its purpose admirably."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Just about everyone else has had it correct so far, the books good, but it dosent get the story moving more then a bit. I just finished it, and i must say it was very well written, like all of them, and entertaining....but VERY little happened! It just set the story up some more, but if the story gets set up much more, its going to fall down. The next book in the series has the possibility to be one of the best hes ever written, but after waiting two years for the tenth book, and having it advance the story less then a week or two past the 9th book, i dont know if i can wait that long again."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"It'd be interesting to take a poll and see how many people who are buying this series are still actively enjoying it and how many are just purchasing it through inertia, praying that each current book is the one that finally lays the series to rest. I think Jordan has finally worn out everyone's patience, however, given that out of two thousand reviews he can only muster an average of one star I don't think that's a good sign. But for the most part I don't think that's really unfair, my high rating is way out of whack but that's because I have weird star-awarding criteria and to be honest my lone five star review is barely going to make a dent in the deluge of one-star reviews. And I really can't blame those people. We were given a tiny morsel of hope in the last book (&quot;Winter's Heart&quot; for those just tuning in) that things might start happening again with Rand cleansing the male half of the Source, but instead we're treated to More of the Same in this volume, back to the wheel spinning that made books seven and eight so universally hated. Back then, we all thought they were just weird blips in the series, now it seems that the glacial plotting is the norm. Which isn't a huge deal, if something happened during the course of six hundred pages, but nothing really ever does, the characters fiddle about, talk about doing stuff, argue over doing stuff, hint at doing stuff, but never actually go out and do anything, so it's like everyone is caught in a flood of indecision and nothing really ever gets accomplished, or if the plot does move forward a baby step, it's washed away in the sea of static that makes up the rest of the book. The other day I was in my local bookstore and I started paging through the first four volumes or so to remind myself of what had made me start reading the series to begin with. And what's missing now is definitely a sense of urgency and mystery. When the series started the Last Battle seemed just around the corner, everyone was running for their lives from the agents of the Dark One and it was rather exciting. Now who knows when the Last Battle even is, the characters seem to be just killing time until they reach that point. And as for mystery, remember in the beginning how new everything was, how Rand had no idea what was happening him or what anyone was talking about and how he tried to stay out of all of it because he didn't want to go mad? I don't know if it's a case of familiarity breeding contempt but we've spent too much time with these characters, there's nothing new to discover about them so they just keep repeating the same mannerisms over and over again. With the plot on auto-pilot (or on hold) there's no place left for the characters to grow. When they make a decision it just seems arbitrary, just dictated by the aimless plot. So what does this book have to offer the wary reader? Unfortunately not too much . . . Jordan continues his style of decompressed storytelling, which means that conversations are spread across chapters and all sense of drama is lost. It's like you're reading the book in real-time, experiencing everything with the characters, and not in a good way. Things that should be important aren't even mentioned. Rand's cleansing of the Source? Not even brought up until two thirds of the way through and if there's any repurcussions from the event, it's nothing we can see. Men channel the same as ever. Remember how Faile was captured in the beginning of the last book . . . well she doesn't even appear and it's still not resolved by the end of this volume. Jordan has to start beginning and ending plots in the same book, otherwise he just strings the reader along. Each book used to have a specific set of plots that connected and advanced the main plot and made each individual volume a separate reading experience, now they just all blur together indistinctly. Mat's sections threaten to bring back the absurd male/female issues that took over so many other sections of past books. Everywhere you look there's something you can criticize until it stops becoming fun and starts becoming cruel. Are there bright spots to the books . . . sure, Jordan is a good writer and there are some nice individual moments, but in the end it doesn't add up to much and certainly nothing memorable. Perrin does the most memorable thing perhaps, but after the shock wears off, it becomes an issue of &quot;who cares?&quot; What we as the readers are left with are four straight books where only one or two major things have happened, with the possibility that it might all be wrapped up in two more books somehow. And considering how beautifully it started (go reread Eye of the World's prologue and tell me it doesn't want to make you keep reading) that's just sad. Jordan has created a real world here, unfortunately it's become too much like our world, mundane in its routines (where did all the Dark One's minions go?) and certainly nothing that offers an escape. And people have been saying these things for the last few books now, and I'm sure Mr Jordan has heard them, and nothing has changed. Which either means he's doing this deliberately to stretch things out or he's just stopped caring. Or maybe it's neither, but the fact remains that a series that I used to read out of compulsion has become merely habit, a world I check in on every few years to make sure it's still there. And a lot of people don't even go that far anymore. What's a reader to do? Alas, the only thing I can recommend is wait until it finishes (whenever that is) and read the entire thing straight through. Maybe it'll be worth it then, but right now, there's barely any reason to care."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I loved this series, and I am saddened that he died. We will never know how that he truly planned for this series to end. Robert Jordan and Raymond E. Feist are the two greatest current writer's of this genre. I feel for his family and all of the literary world in our loss. Few writer's can actually write well enough to take you in to his written world, he was one of them."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Their is a lot of critisism, and some praise for this book, and I think both sides need to realize that this book is exactly as it it titled, a Crossroad. This is the turning point, and as described by the chessboard comparison is setting up for the books that follow, may they come soon. However, what this also means is that we see that Rand is okay, Elaine is still fighting for the throne, Eqwene is still laying seige to Tar Valon, Perrin is still looking for his wife, and Mat is still trying to escape. The only thing new is that we know Rand is okay... this book would have been better as the first half to a book that provides us with something new, and a much better sence of acomplishment. My recomendation would be to read this book when the next book shows up, assuming its reviews are far better."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"The point to a great story is the end...fourtunately for us, the end is coming up faster (bookwise) than everyone thinks. A great story has a beginning, a set-up, a climax, and a follow through. We are now on the precipce of the climax, but the follow through (maybe another novel after the Last Battle?) will be a grand work of art.Reading between the lines, I feel as if the end will be like an Illuminator's display...full of action and brilliance that will be a delight to remember and talk about later with other people who are fans.As for this book, the hits just keep on coming! Another set-up novel to be sure, but a great story takes the time to put each piece in it's place so that when ready, a slight pull here, and a little tug there, it all falls into place almost effortlessly. This installment is getting everything into place but looking at the grand picture, it'll be a doozy when the climax and follow through get here! A must read just to keep up."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I first started to read this series when seven novels had already been published with number eight on the way. I was fortunate because I got to read the bulk of the series in a short amount of time. I truly enjoy the series and Jordan's writing style. Like many fans, I, too, had been waiting for two years for the release of the tenth book. The end of the ninth book was so great that I couldn't wait for the next installment.After reading COT I must admit that it was rather anti-climatic. However, that does not mean this is a bad novel and should be avoided. COT's slow pace and character work is absolutly necessary after the world-altering end of book nine. I understand that a lot of fans have come to associate this series as an &quot;action-fantasy.&quot; To you I say that you have deluded yourself. Once you found out how many novels Jordan was planning to write in the series you should have guessed what was in store for you. WOT is not an &quot;action-fantasy.&quot; It is a historic fantasy. Jordan is a historian and is treating is masterpiece as a historical work of a fantasy world. If you don't like studying history, put down WOT.As a stand-alone novel, COT is flawed. This book will never be appreciated until book 11 is released. The novel relies too much on future events. COT should be read as an intermission to the series, not as a step in the progression of WOT.To all the fans that want a quick resolution to the series -- GROW UP! Put down the remote, open more books and gain an attention span! The end of book nine removed the greatest obstacle of the ENTIRE SERIES for the MAIN CHARACTER, and you expect Jordan, the highly detailed writer, to ignore the world's reaction to this development? No plot development? This is a character piece, thus it is not plot driven! Trust me, Jordan has a very specific end in mind and is not dragging the series out for more money! Jordan has commented that he has the last chapter written. WAIT! It's coming. If its action you want, go to the movies, pick up a comic book, watch a football game."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I love the Wheel of Time story. I agree with everyone that the story is taking far too long to get to the point. It's a complex storyline with a large cast of characters, and by the time this latest book was released I had forgotten most of them and so didn't enjoy the story as much as I had hoped.This book did seem more like book eight, part three, than a complete novel in its own right, and I feel disappointed somehow. It simply feels incomplete. It didn't help that the main character only appeared in three chapters almost as if no longer a major part of the story.I am also tired of the big expensive hardcover format being the exclusive version for so long, and didn't feel it was worth it for this particular \\"partial\\" story.I do not want to rush Robert Jordan. I am in no hurry for the story to truly end. Despite the fact that this story was simply another interim storyline, the book was great! The characters and story are great. However, Robert Jordan should be concerned about losing his audience if this much time continues to elapse between books."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Sigh. Yet again...a Wheel of Time book. I remember when my cousin gave me the first book in this now delapidated series. It was so fresh, so vibrant, so interestingly differnt. He was vividly descriptive and even though a fool could've seen that the main character was the Dragon Reborn, it was still fun to see the characters slowly come to that realization themselves. And once they did come to that realization, readers knew they were in for something truly epic...and so they waited for the next book...and the next...and the next...and the next...and the next...and nothing has yet happened. Doing this with two books would have been forgivable, after all, everyone makes mistakes. However, Mr. Jordan refuses to listen to his former readers. This review says exactly what every other review said: boring, redundant, not worth the effort."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I was greatly disappointed in this book. Compared to Book 9, this could have been about Little Orphan Annie.The only action takes place in the first few pages. Nearly 350 pages are taken uup with &quot;deep&quot; insights of the three major female characters. There is no conclusion or even a hint of one. The three male heros are left in limbo.I think that Jordan is using The Wheel of Time as his annuity. I expect another ten in the series to keep his royalties coming in."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I have never written a review before and I suspect this is redundant based on the sheer volume of negative reviews but I have to vent my spleen regardless. Like the vast majority, I'm sure, this series has been one the most engaging and entertaining fantasy epics I have ever read. The world is captivating, the characters engaging, etc., etc. Unfortunately, the good author is either afraid to finish or is greedy for our money. I hate to think the latter is true based on the sheer volume of books sold to date. This leaves me with a fear that has grown since book seven that he truly has no plan to finish this series. All you have to read is the prologue and epilogue (and perhaps the 4-5 pages prior to the epilogue). The rest is just tedious filler. It pains me to have invested so much time into this story to just get plowed over with this filler. Most tales have a line, &quot;and after months of journeying, they arrived.&quot; This book tells you every tedious step only leaving out calls of nature. The worst part is that all of us have committed to reading the previous nine books and are compelled to invest in 700 pages of tree-killing wasted paper. I personally feel let down by the author and in unlikely event he reads any of these reviews, I hope he realizes how much he has taken advantage of his fans.PS: Go to the library if you feel you must read this book."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I loved this series, but this book just sucked! NOTHING HAPPENS! No issues get resolved, no mysterys are unraveled, no answers are given.

After 700 pages of discriptions of embroidery, silks, gilded chairs, how cold it is, and every other stupid detail that doesn't matter, we will have to wait another two years before the next book comes out. Will it even add anything to this great story? I hope so. Crossroads of Twilight is a waste of time. Everything that happens in this book is effectively summed-up in the liner notes.

We know you can't trust anyone. We know everything balances on the edge of a knife. Why doesn't he just get on with it and do something already!?And has anyone noticed that almost every character in these books has begun to have the same outlook on things except for Mat?

Other reviewers haven't done justice to how little happens in this book. There are 600 some pages in this book. If you have read book nine then you know it ended with a momentous event involving a lot of magic use. The first 500 pages of this book occur BEFORE that event and leading up to it. Basically it can be summed up as every character sensing the magic use and being scare of it.Rand, the main character, doesn't even show up in the first 500 pages.You could skip this book entirely and except for the last THREE pages you wouldn't even know you had missed anything."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"If this book had never been written, the Wheel of Time series wouldn't change.

Sometimes, I could not even finish a single chapter before drifting off. I know some of this has been said already, more than once, but there is a reason for it; it's true.I am loosing track of who is who and who is doing what. Okay, well, I guess I know who is doing what; they are all doing nothing. I would root for the bad guys, but they don't deserve to win either.The attempts at political intrigue were never the strong points of this series, and I wish Jordan would move on where they are concerned. They are becoming less interesting and less believable.The book was not all bad and boring, but a lot of it was a waste. Some of the chapters about Egwene were interesting, though it ended just as it started to go somewhere.I am very seriously thinking of waiting until I read all of the reviews before I purchase the next the book, if I purchase it at all; I will definitely not pre-purchase it this time.I think anyone that paid for this book should get the next one for free. It is bad enough that they are selling the previews as e-books, but now they appear to be selling an entire book as a preview; and not even an interesting one.Some say this is all setup for a future book. How much more setup do we need to pay for?A book, even as part of a series, should have a beginning, an end, a plot, and a point. I think this book may very well have failed to mee those requirements, on every count."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I just have to say I am very disappointed with this book. I was waiting for some great action after the source being cleansed and got none of it. I think Jordan needs to pick up the pace and get this series heading towards the final battle. Starting to get a bit ridiculous with all the tedious and boring routines the characters seem to be going though."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"After finishing this book I have decided to write my shortest review ever for Amazon. I have two reasons for doing this:1) There is not much I can say that probably hasn't been said by 2,408 other reviewers2) Maybe Robert Jordan will follow my example and learn to be more concise with his next installment in this seriesAs has been stated this book could be sub-title \\"Much Ado about Nothing\\" with apologies to Shakespeare. The descriptions are incredibly over long (I have sympathy for the reviewer who had to actually LISTEN to all this.) and almost nothing is resolved in this novel. My only hope is that Jordan has managed to set the stage for the next installment in this series and according to his website he is intending to finish this series in the immediate future. I would only recommend this book if you are a devout fan of the series and intend on following it to its' conclusion. However if you do not want to labor through the 822 pages, just read the reviews here on Amazon and you will find all the events that take place in this novel described in a much more concise version without all the extraneous narrative."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"When I first opened Eye of the World and began to read, I knew right away that I would love it. It was exiting and the description was just right. I rushed back to the library and took out The Great Hunt and The Dragon Reborn and tore through them like wildfire. Back to the library to take out the next four, which I read in a week and a half. There was a wee bit of slowing, but not enough to make a difference to me. I was in love with this series.Then, I read book eight, Path of Daggers and I hit a brick wall built entirely of things I did not care about at all, such as the color of Nynave's shoes, of the vein in someone's forhead, or an entire page on how Egwene's little finger hurt a little bit.These books have effectively become retatrded and I am sad to see that a series I once loved has nosedived like this. I seriously think that Jordan just wants to milk this series for all it's worth and then abandon it.And I swear that if I have to read about Egwene's dress for a whole chapter again, I will hang myself with it."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"It is a sad day. After seeing book #11 on the preorder list I decided to check a few reviews of the last book. Which I bought and read as soon as it came out, like I have with all the WOT books. However, reading these reviews brought back the memories of that reading and the 5 before it. And I'm lead to only one conclusion that the Wheel of Time has moved from a slow leak to a shredded truck tire littering the highway. And it's all the more sad since I started reading Jordan way back when with \\"Conan the Invincible\\". Jordan packed more excitement, fun, and action into a 250 page Conan book then he has into these 10 bloated volumes. And if I hear another 3-page description Egwene's dress, or somebody else's boots and lace cuffs I'll shoot myself. Fortunately for me though I wont. Like many others here I will not buy book 11, 12, 13.....and on and on and on. Until and if Jordan ever finishes this thing, which I'm beginning to doubt. Sad.RIP, Mr Jordan."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Before I begin I have been a loyal reader of the TWOT for since the beginning. The first books were written with such quality and imagination and care for the charaters. The books had become the center piece of my book collection. I've gone out and rebought all the books in hard cover so I could have a decent collection for these book that I held in such high regard, up too the Lord of Chaos.Unfortunately, as with most fans of the series, I have been continuosly disappointed with quality of stories that I shutter whenever a new book comes out, because I look forward to them so much and yet they continue to disappoint. Well Winters Heart book 9 while not the best in the series did seem to reinvigorate the series where it seemed like Jordan had finally begun preperation for the final battle. While I did not expect it to happen in the next book, I did hope it would happen eventually at it was coming within a couple of books. When an author puts out junk like Crossroads, I question wether I will buy another book, yet I will and He has got me hooked like a heroin dealer.Crossroads is bad not so much because of the writing. It is bad because nothing happens in the book. There was no progression of the plot, story, no new character development, no epic battles. Winters Heart ends with the imminent battle over the White Tower, Matt meeting his soon to be wife the daughter of the nine moon, perrin wife faile being kidnapped, and Rand cleansing the power. Nothing changed from the end of book 9 to the end of book 10, except the ridiculous ending with Egwene. Yet, there was almost a 700 page book I just read. One of Jordan greatest talents as a writer is his attention to detail, but it is his greatest fault as well. The book is nothing but detail, and he gets side tracked telling you about the drapes on the wall and forgets to move on with the story.This time I really felt dooped by Jordan, and I want my thirty dollars back. I even defended the series when others complained he was just sucking readers wallets with the never ending story. With this book he did just that.Yet, I hold out I will eventually buy book eleven because the story at the beginning was so good, I hope it too be good again. I'll probably pre-order the thing like I always do. Jordan always said he had the ending plained from the beginning. It seems to me he never had a plain on how to get there. But I hope the next books will be better than Crossroads, the worst one yet. Thank you for your time."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I have recently been introduced to the Wheel of time series and have read all 10 books in the last 6 months. The author is very long winded but the results have been good until this book. The series has been like a fighter jet that has suddonly had a flame out and is spinning out of control. The author can fix the problem, but it loks alot like he has sat back to enjoy the fruits of his writing and was pushed by a publishing contract deadline to put something out.Personnally, I find the plot has suddonly become a collection of very simple storylines that lack depth. None of the characters are the same as in earlier books and the style feels different. Ghostwriter maybe?I think the author has fallen victum of his own success and is just putting out pulp, and stretched pulp at that. His recent prequile seems to reinforce that. The story in this book is equal one quarter of the previous volumes yet the same number of pages. I hate to say it, but I think he is following Ann McCaffy's Pern series down a trail of too many books from one basic story. I hope he reads these reviews and realizes the ones who write want him to return to the quality of the earlier books and to realistically bring the series to a dramatic conclusion."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I was an enthusiastic fan of the series, couldn't wait for the next book to come out, then read... this... whatever it is.

Perrin chops the hand off of a captured prisoner to get information on his kidnapped wife, Faile. A minor character is stabbed (but healed), and the perpetrator is shot in the back with a crossbow.That's it. All of the action in the entire book, summarized in two long sentences. To be sure, there is plenty of tea drinking and hand wringing and various groups of women talking to each other.I suppose that the series is making progress, as we have moved from reading about how much lace they wear in Ebou Dar to how much embroidery they wear in Jurador.Clearly, Robert Jordan would rather write about hemlines and necklines than sword fights and magic duels.I want a refund on the last five books (books 6 through 10)."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I have about 50 pages left in CoT, so maybe it can save itself, but I'm not holding my breath.

Guess which is which.I feel live I've invested so much time in the WoT series that I have to finish it...but it's been several books since it's really been interesting. It appalls me that Jordan is still introducing new plotlines and characters at this point. There's very little mention of the Forsaken, a single mention of Moridin (some new uber-Forsaken introduced several books ago), but mostly just endless bickering between Aes Sedai. I wish they'd just go away, but he spends most of this book going back and forth between Elayne and co and Egwene and her crew, neither plotline is progressing at all or is interesting. I was encouraged that Rand cleansed Saidin, but that doesn't seem to have sped this toward a resolution.I just don't think RJ knows where this is going anymore and is either stalling for time, milking his &quot;fans&quot; for money, or both. I used to think the WoT World was fascinating, but now I just want it to end.

It is SOOO amusing to read all of these long, detailed, intelligent analyses of where Jordan abandoned all respect for his work to his own self-importance. Some of you should write your own books.And for his eternally awful tome of crap, people are giving him -- what -- nearly two thousand (and counting) book reviews for this mound of inorganic cattle dung, rotting to the top of the bestseller list! Wow! Not very many people achieve such notoriety! For that alone, he puts himself up in the rarefied air (just sniff it!) of other creators of great literature.This huge backlash would not exist with Jordan's consummate ability to bait-and-switch. (Write a few good ones, get the pump primed, then start writing reams of drivel to lure in the money.)

I find that the faster I read, the more I enjoy them; if I read too slowly I tend to drown in the details and get lost - but that's my problem, not the books'.These stories are about character, and while action happens, it's really the characters' relation to the events that's significant. So when a character gains something, or learns something, or loses something, that journey has import. It matters - and it affects that character forever. It makes these people real, and I love that. Because of this, these stories seem richer to me than the average fantasy adventure. If you would prefer more explosions and cliffhangers at the end of every chapter, this series might not be for you.If you're interested in the wheel of time, I recommend starting with the prequel bookNew Spring (A Wheel of Time Prequel Novel)which will give you a nice feel of the world and also require a smaller time sink than the first book. If you've read all the way to book 10, you would have to be some kind of maniac to skip this one. Events are building to the finale and I wouldn't have missed it for the world.

Even the morally upright Perrin does something reprehensible while his faithful wife Faile considers an act of unfaithfulness in captivity. However, Jordan is an excellent story-teller and does end the book in such a way as to bring two major threads together and leave the reader in great anticipation of the next installment.

In truth the book has a 100 page prologue with new characters who don't even contribute to the rest of the story. And some of the characters in the prologue are old and obscure because they themselves have only been in the prologues of other books.

This book sucks, and it is definitely the worst of the series. There are many reasons why, and there's probably nothing I can say that hasn't been said already, but there are some things that I must say. First off, Jordan is NOT lengthening the series for money. If you really look at this claim, it's ridiculous. Jordan already has tons of money, and he already has plans for what he will write after WoT. So he makes money whether he's writing Wheel of Time or not, which makes the claim that he's fattening his wallet with WoT books completely groundless. No, Jordan BELIEVES in what he's writing. You may ask how can he believe, why can't he recognize the trash he just put out? Well, remember, he's the only one who knows how the story will end, and looking at the story as a whole puts a different perspective on things. I do believe that fans will also be more forgiving once the final book is out.Let's look at the big picture. Pretty much everyone is in agreement that books 1-4 were wonderful. Then after that, things started going downhill. I personally think that things started going bad at book five, got worse on six, got the worst at seven, starting getting better in eight and nine, and then of course reached its all-time low with book ten. What basically happened was that things started moving slower, there wasn't enough action. Some people think it was the abundance of plot threads. I think that's part of it, but more than anything else it's all the little comments and thoughts on mostly irrelevant things. I remember Jordan saying in an interview that he puts everything in there for a reason. So, while I read Crossroads of Twilight, I paid attention to all the little bas+ards that he put in his sentences. And I discovered that, it was true, he did put everything in there for a reason. All the little bas+ards DID affect us, in a very subtle way, by showing us what the characters were feeling at the moment, their perspective on everything. But they're far from necessary. Jordan needs to learn many things can be IMPLIED. By using the correct words and phrases, he can tell us things without actually having to tell us. There are many authors that can do this very thing. Like George Martin. The reason I bring him up is because he's also writing a mammoth saga, with a complex plot. But I find the story easy to follow, nonetheless. Why? Because George Martin doesn't waste time with such trivialities. We're not stupid, Mr. Jordan. We can figure out some things on our own. We don't need three paragraphs to tell us that somebody is p1ssed off. We can probably figure out that Egwene's not going to like the tea, since she's already in a p1ssy mood. We know that those Aes Sedai are gonna be twitching those shawls, because they're all b1tches anyway. No need to spell it out. Jordan always said that there are events that he has to keep postponing till the next volume. Well here's the reason right here: all the little bas+ards that he dumps upon each book. Well finally it's caught up to him, in this book. Crossroads of Twilight is the catch-up book. All the excess from the former books is dumped here. That's all this book is - excess. Excess and exposition for the next book.Now, we all agree that is the worst book. If you think it's not, then there really is something wrong with you. Nothing happens. But, I wouldn't give up. Here's why: I like to look at the Wheel of Time as one big trilogy. Now, in a trilogy, we're all familiar with the notorious middle book. It's the book that is most of the time the worst in the trilogy. Well, that's how I'm looking at the Wheel of Time. Books 1-5 is Book 1, 6-10 is Book 2, and 11-15 will be Book 3. (Yes, that's how many I'm guessing there will be. Jordan says two more but he's been saying that since book six. 15 is a good number. It's a multiple of three, which fits in nicely with my trilogy analogy.) So, if you look at Jordan's last five books as one big middle book, then it makes more sense, doesn't it? It's a bridge between the first five and the last five. No one but Jordan knows what the ending will be, but I get the feeling it's going to be up to par with the beginning of the saga. Crossroads of Twilight ends with some major conflict on the horizon. In fact, it ends with several cliffhangers, something that hasn't been done in any of the former books. So try to keep a little perspective. I know for me that might be easier, since I started late enough in the series that I was able to read the first nine books all in one stretch. For those who have been reading since the beginning, that's ten years of mediocrity, and I feel your pain. But, I truly think it will be worth it in the long run. I don't know for sure, but I got a damn good feeling. I'm sure Jordan's got some surprises up his sleeve. He's definitely got vision - he showed us that in the first book of this little trilogy. And I don't think that that vision was lost, just submerged while he plodded through the middle book. The climax of the middle book was the cleansing of the taint. CoT was the falling action that comes after the climax. It ends with a definite sense of closure. Book 3 is on the way. And I'm ready."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Possibly the best Jordan non-verbal communication psychology book ever. Nynaeve doesn't pull her braid once, but that's not all! You get skirt grabbing stare-down action. Eyebrow raised insults, harrumphs of displeasure... If you're looking for action, a good fight, sorcery, or anything resembling a plot, don't sweat a drop, you won't find it here. That would be fantasy. This is the worst drivel I've bothered to finish in a long time. Count me out until 2007, but only if that's the last one. This one's for you, Chris and Tim."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I had an advantage over other people, my brother read it faster than I did and warned me of the anti-climactic ending. So I wasn't expecting anything grand. I really did enjoy the buildup in this one more than Path of Daggers, the other buildup book. It provides good characterizations, especially of Mat(he's the star of this book even though he is involved in no action scenes and his amount of chapters appear to be the smallest). Egwene's story line appears to be stalling, with all that buildup in Path of Daggers for them, it really hit a wall. This book is good if you enjoy characterization, but if you start reading it with the expectations of action, your opinion of it will be less than stellar. I can't wait for the next one and hope the book has more action than this one, because if Jordan thinks the series will be finished in two books after this one, he's got his work cut out for him to resolve all of the loose ends. I hope he doesn't turn into the X-files when it was good and become so convoluted that he can't resolve everything logically. If you are a Wheel of Time devotee, read this book now. If you have lost great interest in the series because of the last few books, pick this up in paperback."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This book is a continuation of the series. It can not be read by itself. Many people will not like it because it and the last few books are not independent novels. He started the series writing the first few so that you could read one of the later books and not miss out on anything, but now each new book is just a collection of additional chapters. Each individual book can therefore not be viewed as a separate novel, but must be read and viewed as an epic saga to be truly appreciated. It might be easier if you wait till they are done to start reading them, but if you are already in the middle then buy this book and enjoy."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed Crossroads of Twilight, and I re-read the whole WOT series about every couple of years, BUT, I was hoping for book 10 to be the Last Battle. RJ: Thanks for the series prequel, but please... give us the climactic ending and then start a spinoff in some other direction. Loads of great authors have managed it."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I personnally loved this book. The construction of a world as complex as Wheel of Time with so many interesting characters and plotlines obviously takes a long time to write. It is this attention to detail and intimate character writing that makes WoT so great. At this point in the series, Jordan is beginning to wrap up things up, and this book sets the stage for the big finale. Because of the scope of the series, this set up for the end actually required an entire book, which is why so many people disliked this book.No, there isn't as much action as many other books. No, there aren't any huge moments like at the end of book 9. But the last ten pages of Winter's Heart isn't what makes this series worth reading, though many people seem to think so. If you want nothing but action, find another series, because this series actually involves character development and political intrigue.Jordan took a risk in leaving out moments of major action in this book, and he's paid the price according to reader reviews. As a stand alone book without the story from the first 9 books or the anticipation of the impending finale, this book would be boring. But in the context of its position in the series, it's a great book and the series remains a must read for all."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"If the Wheel of Time series was a 3 book seires, I was call this book the classic middle book. Some say the plot doesnt move, which of course is totaly wrong. It simply leaves you hanging on every single plot line, which is what a classic middle book does. Im not exactly sure WHY people thought there would be any conclutions at all from this book, seeing as how Jordan has said many times he plans on going to at least 11, and now we know, 12 books. Im thinking what upset people is that alot of people didnt die in this book. In all of the other books, there were major battles to end each book. In this one, the same is certainly not true, but the plot does move. In fact thats the entire point of the book is to advance the many plot lines that exist at this point. My guess is that Jordan will be many of these plot lines together in book 11, and conclude in book 12. The first review listed is stated to be writen by a 62 year old I believe. Im surprised this gentelman hasnt learned more patience in all his years. Im only 22 years of age and would appear to have MUCH more than he does.Anyways, like I said, this is a classic middle book. Not alot of action, but the plots alone were enough to keep me reading, and it ends you on a major cliff hanger, making me hope the next book doesnt take Jordan to long to write. If your a lover of this series, then you should enjoy the book. If your simply looking for blood shed, as many here seem to be, then pass on this one."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I think that we've come far enough along the Wheel of Time Story to recognize that Jordan's tale is a massive undertaking, more akin to The Lord of the Rings (that is, a huge story broken into three books) than to other fantasy series (where each book tells a complete story, yet is part of the overall epic). And this translates into Jordan no longer even trying to &quot;finish&quot; a book by its end; rather, he simply finds a breaking point and stops telling the story. This has been the rule for the past few books, and Crossroads of Twilight is no exception.As disappointing as that may be -- and yes, I, too, am waiting eagerly for resolution to smaller plots that have been building for the past few books -- I am willing to go along with Jordan for the heady ride. His writing remains excellent overall, although at times he lapses into familiar descriptions. And his character development is superb -- each person who makes an appearance in the saga is treated as a player important to the overall story. The main characters are all at a crossroads of sorts, where they must make important decisions. Jordan gives us a few chapters each about Mat, Perin, Elayne, Egwene and (to a lesser degree) Rand, about how these characters make their decisions that will, ultimately, have an impact on the overall story. (The results of these decisions await, alas, for another book.)The only true complaint I have is two-fold: the prologue did not capture my attention, and at this point, I have no way of keeping tabs of who all the supporting characters are (mainly Aes Sedai). Some of those names are a mouthful.That being said, I am once again eagerly awaiting the next installment. (I am guessing that the series will run for 13 books; the number 13 has been important throughout. Maybe Book 13 will be called The Breaking of the World.)"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"The condition of the book was great as has been every book I have purchased from Anmazon.

I'm often disappointed in how many people I see &quot;give up&quot; on this series. Have you ever seen such depth and scope in a series before? No, you haven't, and probably won't.True, there is very little &quot;action&quot; in this book, but after the last couple, what did you expect. I must say, however, that at no time, ever, did this book get boring. There are so many characters, so many plot lines, so much going on, that if the series was suddenly resolved in 1 or even 2 books, I'd be severly upset with Mr. Jordan. Can you imagine Tarmon Gaidon being fought and over with in the next book? I hope not. In an era a quick cuts, fast action, and summer blockbusters with only effect to save them, take the time to read a book that makes you slow down and use your brain.Buy this book, buy the whole series, and be prepared to be amazed."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I started reading this series by accident on one of several deployments to Southwest Asia...as for all the people complaining about this latest installment all I can say is this...If you think you can do better shut up and do it....this book should set up the ending it fills in many small intricate sub-plots...reading about the main characters all the time you can end up missing some of the influencing factors that are causing our heros to act the way they do.

I would say the Crossroads of Twilight is a good book, but it seems like it is a compilation of chapters that should have been in Winter's Heart. I was anxiously awaiting to see what happened after the events of Book 9, but the majority of this book explores what is happening in the lives of the characters other than Rand, during the events of Winter's Heart. It's still interesting, but almost leaves you with the feeling of wondering what the impact of the events in previous book were (I don't want to talk specific details).My biggest complaint of the series is this (So you understand, I reread the complete series each time a new book is released), I get tired of Mr. Jordan explaining things that have already been explained. I don't need to be reminded of what a bond to a Warder encompasses, or the feeling of embracing saidar, or saidan, and numerous other things. My feeling is, I've never started a series of books with book 5, 7 or 9, so don't go over that in each book, PLEASE!Having said that, I've got to say that Mr. Jordan's writing in each book is superb. His style of writing and level of detail is at least as good as that of Tolkien, and I actually feel like I am experiencing the events in his books like I am there. I've read the reviews of this book, and my feeling is, \\"You've got to be kidding.\\" I can't wait for him to release another book, I'm hooked and I don't mind admitting it. Keep up the excellent work, and please hurry and release the each succeeding book. I could keep reading this series for a long time.

I honestly believe if the fast pace of the first four or five books was kept up, this would be the last book in this series. I personally do not want it to end. I love the quality of Jordan's writing, I find it very easy to lose myself in a world that is very clearly described in great detail. I feel that the reason that the first books went so fast is the time was devoted to rapid growth of the characters over a short period of time. Now the concept is to build up to the last battle. I feel that there are still some surprises left, but the characters are developed and it will be difficult to see them grow any more, they will only be able to take control of their destinies. All in all I think it was a great book and once again to all of the people who enjoyed the books so far, DO NOT GIVE UP."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I'll make this as short as possible. First of all, I want to tell any holier-than-thou critics that I am a deep reader. I enjoy extensive tomes, a-la-War and Peace. Ten books in a series is nothing to me as long as they are good, although I did expect the ending would come in vol. 10, as it is a nice round number.After the febrile page-turning of the first 5 or 6 tomes, the action of the novel slackened considerably around vols 7, 8 and reading became kind of boring. Vol 9 was bad.Vol. 10 though is an insult to the intelligence of the readers. Maybe Jordan had \\"writer's paralysis\\" (it happens to all of them, Tom Clancy's last book for instance sucks) and had no good ideas, but he had to turn out something, ANYTHING. In this book I found myself skimming through 10, 20 pages using fast reading techniques (which I don't usually use when I am enjoying the story).

It's ghost-written (and fake), but here's an outline:Rand is in deep emotional distress while all the Aes Sedai are far away at a 2 week meeting. An Aes S. named Tyrmalene arrives from a province so far away no one knew of it. She's sweet, loving, kind, older, wiser, & far more *gorgeous*& sexy (& **powerful**) than any A.S. he's ever known, & doesn't wear lace or drink tea. In fact, being kind and loving's AMAZING/NEW/SHOCKING! Plus she's been trained for 100s of yrs. in battle strategy, too. YAY! says Rand, & the next 2 weeks are spent being treated kindly, being guided in the ways of battle and using powers he hadn't known he had, and a lot of, um, affection. One power is like that of balefire, but doesn't affect the Pattern. WOW! Useful!When the A.S. return from their meeting, POed as usual, Rand's having a hot bath after a hard day of study. Tyrmalene is helping bathe him with gentleness & laughter. Nynaeve comes crashing thru the door. Rand zaps her braid right off at the neckline with 1 glance. Nyn. grabs at her lost braid like a chimp, squeaking. Tyrmalene stands up, takes frozen-in-shock Nyn. by the hand, and says, \\"Dear Nynaeve, let me show you how nice it is to have the freedom of shorter hair. We'll go play with a comb; imagine how lovely it'll be to not have the pain of pulling it all the time!\\" Nyn. blurts, \\"But what'll I do with my frustration, or my hands?\\" Tyrmalene says, \\"I'm sure Lan can think of something.\\" Rand smiles in delight at how relaxed he's become, how a little help, gentleness, and love could cut through his problems like a sword! Now he has ideas about how to vanquish his enemies, his face doesn't hurt from slapping, he doesn't feel alone in the world. His fear & anger & confusion have dwindled to almost nothing; the introduction of kindness to his life has worked more magic than a legion of Aes S.!Far away, Cadsuane: In a deep forest, she bumbles across Shaidar Haran (she: not paying attention, angry as usual). He captures her in a net of deadly spiderweb, throws her in a cart, & sics the spiders on her. Their bites take many painful days to kill her, but she DIES.Perrin: He feels Rand's new confidence & calm, somehow. His quest to save Fain is renewed; he accomplishes his goal! His lust's renewed, too, for some reason (LOL). He treats Fain with tenderness and makes !@^% to her and she responds with happiness.Matt: He realizes the games with Tuon're silly, somehow...was it a dream he had? Never mind; he embraces her with many flowers, declares his love, and they marry in a ceremony with much joy & laughter.Rand uses his newfound power on the Black Ajah; their smoking remains are found the next day. Pattern: undisturbed! HOORAY!Then Rand mounts a new, *effective* campaign against his enemies with Tyrmalene beside him. At first Min & those other chicks are jealous, but Tyrmalene's so kind & spreads seeds of companionship; eventually Rand's women get along better than you'd ever think possible (tho not perfectly - this is fantasy, not insanity).Etc. The story goes on from there. P.S.: Lan is REAL HAPPY with Nynaeve's new behavior.(Sorry this is so simple....Afraid I'd run out of allowed words.)See, Mr. Jordan, it's just not that difficult to make your story better. Sheesh.

If, for whatever reason, you read through the 2,000+ reviews telling you the same thing but can't be bothered to read the rest of this little review, fear not, thats essentially all you need to know.Robert Jordan dominated the modern fantasy genre for nearly a decade. That this is no longer the case can be blamed on two factors.The first is that there is a great deal of better fantasy being written these days than there was 10 years ago. George R.R. Martin leads the pack with A Song of Ice and Fire, a legitimate contender for the greatest fantasy series ever written, but there are others. Gene Wolfe's Wizard Knight, China Mieville's Bas-Lag Books, Robin Hobb's farseer works, Neil Gaiman's forays into the novel, Greg Keyes, R. Scott Bakker, Steven Erickson. All of them are putting out some of their best work these days, and if you like good, original fantasy at all, they're far more worth your time than Jordan, or for that matter, this review. In fact, I heartily recommend that if you haven't read them yet, you stop reading this and go buy them.There's not much Jordan could do to stop the rise of competitors, but he has no one to blame but himself for the other reason he no longer rules the field. Quite simply, he no longer writes anything worth reading. No where is that better epitomized than in the colossal failure called Crossroads of Twilight. Nothing happens in this book. Nothing at all. The sort of petty details that typically comprise the first couple chapters of novels like these have been extended into one of the most bloated doorstoppers in fantasy, which is saying something.Lack of plot could be forgivable if this was an especially engaging character study, or an excercise in modernist plays on language ala Joyce. Obviously, this is none of these. The characters are shallow and loathsome, the woman a bunch of sniffing, braid-tugging, control freaks, the men alternatively psychotic or weak-willed followers of the sniffers. And the writing! Every sentence is a microcosm of the bloated over-description that makes up this entire novel. Time was, Jodan wrote sentences that were necessary to his story, but simply included too many extra details. No longer. These are sentences that should never have been written, never needed to be written, and they are still bloated to the point where they'd make any self-respecting editor run for his life.As I said, this book sucks. Consider this review a sample of Jordan. A couple hundred words that could be summed up in three. This book sucks. The only difference is, you've wasted a couple of minutes and no money on this, whereas Jordan will waste at least a week of your life and a good chunk of your hard-earned cash to make the same point about his own suckitude."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Bla,bla,bla,bla,bla,bla,bla,bla,bla.........the END!

Problems with Creativity, Tor leans on you big time, and your woman is giving you a hard time, because she wants Aes Sedai on every turn.I got the solution for you.Concentrate on following points:1. Let's get this myrdraal and trollocs back on track. They were pure horror to witness. Let's get some of these totally idiotic forsaken to these trollocs and myrdraal and let them lead some heavy host in the blight countries to rape, plunder, pillage and massacre everyone in sight not bearing the mark of the Dark One.2. No more Women Politics bickering, please. Robert, you do not know how to write political fantasy. That's true, plz reconsider. Leave that to G.R.R.Martin and Robin Hobb. Concentrate on plotoriented, testosterone pumping Gemmell like writing.3. You need to make the forsaken stronger. Some of them at least, must be as strong as Rand. Let's kill off some protagonists, too, yes?How about the women? Your fans hate them Rob. I got some dreams about the rapings and torturing of Nyna, Elayne and Co, and it was funny, you know. I am not emotionally attached to these harridans. Okay?4. Let's end this. The blight must be crawling with lusty Myrdraal and rude Trollocs sniffing for fresh flesh.

No prequels!!your's truly,a former Fan"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Since most of these other reviews of this book are either vehemently negative of deliriously positive, I thought I'd offer a more level headed review with a few points people either miss or don't care about.The GOOD: Contrary to popular opinion, some things do happen in this installment of the Wheel of Time: Rand is finally getting off his ass, probably at the head of some asha'man and hopefully going to war in the next book; Egwene has finally gotten herself in some serious trouble, which may set up some dramatic scheming and escaping in the next book. She's physically in the white tower now, so maybe some reunification type thing of the white tower can happen; Perrin at least caught up to the Shaido aiel, so again, more possibility of development in the next book; Matt may be ready to get the seanchan involved as allies in the last battle as they should be, instead of constantly getting in the way of the real story, as has been pointed out. Also one of the foresaken was killed in book 9 and still hasn't come back, so there's a hope at least one of them is completely out of the way (at least for a while). FINALLY, THE DARK LORD has finally appeared in this book. For the first time we get a glimpse of what Rand will be fighting, and it also means a seal or two more have been broken and things should start moving in the plot. There's a little \\"plagues\\" thing going on as well. Ghosts walking, pests and vermin multiplying. Sounds very end-of-the-world to me, so perhaps the end-of-the-story is in sight as well.The BAD (hold on folks, there's lots of it): The Elayne side story is hopelessly mired in muck and doesn't seem to have an end in sight (not that anyone really cares). I also hate to say this, but I've been seeing small seemingly important advances in the last three books, each book seemingly ending just on the verge of major events, yet in each next volume Jordan seems to find a way to put things off. If you look at the timeline you'll find that books 9 and 10 span only one month, but in excruciating detail. So yes, there is potential for the next book to be very exciting, but the set up could have been done in 300 pages flat, instead of 1200+ and still nothing guarantees that Jordan will take his own set up for a great plotline and run with it. At the risk of repeating 2000 of the previous 2100+ reviews I have to mention the constant excruciating and unneeded descriptive detail. It is one thing to describe the moods, dresses and mannerisms of major characters, but PLEASE stop doing it every time a new minor character pops up. There are only so many shades of color or types of fabric used for dresses one can imagine. PLEASE GET THE HINT, we don't care what each person is wearing at any particular moment! There are some good turns of phrase here an there such as someone who \\"could irritate a brick\\" or ogier death watch guard staring at humans as if \\"wondering if they needed pruning somewhere\\" but there are so many formulaic \\"could cause X emotion in Y inanimate object\\" puns in book 10 that I thought I was reading a Xanth novel. Also, it's waaaaaay past time that the back of the book contained a list of characters with bio summaries. There's nothing wrong with having many people involved the story, it is an epic adventure after all, but a normal human memory simply isn't capable of keeping track of so many, especially when most appear only once in a great while.Jordan also seems to have forgotten where he was going with several of the characters. I do not agree with another reviewer who said that all the characters have become ninnies, but they have become very inconsistent. Aes sedai who have been described as very wise seem to act stupidly. In one castle they have the windfinders and the kin under their thumb, but in another it's the reverse situation. They move nations, but bicker with each other in such unsophisticated ways that one wonders how they manage to dress themselves in the morning. Some characters who have been written as wise beyond their years and good at moving through their treacherous world are now getting into situations that the reader knows they should have figured out. If this was a movie I'd stand up and shout \\"don't go into that room\\". The earlier books were good because it was difficult to foresee where the danger was coming from. The \\"who dun it\\" factor was high and there was tension. In book 10 the suspense is non-existent. Not because we've gotten used to Jordan's tricks, but because he doesn't offer any. There are just two surprises in the entire book and both are well foreshadowed.One of the biggest things that are merely bad, is (cliche time) the terribly slow pace. I already said that all the set up in the past 2 books could have been accomplished in 300 pages, but the events of book 10 could account for 50 of those 300 pages at most. It still manages to read decently, but instead of turning the pages because the plot draws you in, you try to turn the pages faster and faster hoping to get to something worth reading. It's sort of like trying to watch a movie by pressing the frame advance button on your DVD player or VCR very quickly, instead of just watching it at a normal speed in the first place.The UGLY (Things that are such extremely horrible flaws that I can not comprehend how they made it into the book!): One previous reviewer suggested that a volunteer reader should have gone through the book before it was released, and this is not an understatement. There are MANY MANY spelling and grammatical mistakes in this book. On several occasions I found myself rereading a sentense several times over in order to figure out what it actually meant. Apparently it was too difficult to hire an editor for this book, I really am convinced that no editing was done on this book at all. These aren't even the small typos you regularly see in books because they slip by without major problems, these are major mistakes that anyone could have caught on a read through, that any spell checker in any word processor should have caught. Secondly, Jordan is beginning to repeat his own words at an increasing rate. Bad enough when even minor characters are described with a level of detail that no one cares to read, but the line has to be drawn at repeating the same description multiple times. For example, how many times do we need to hear the the High Lady Tuon looks like a doll made of black porcelain? OK, she's got black skin, we got the point in book 9. Yet the same point is repeated 4 or 5 times in book 10. Many times almost identical descriptions are given for several different people. Persons a,c,f,and k all have blue eyes, all are hard, stony, cold, etc., etc., etc. Again, WE GOT THE POINT 1500 PAGES AGO. This is like seing stock footage in a movie and it is quite disturbing. Quite frankly it seems that things are going quite badly with the author if he can not keep track of which descriptions he has already used in the space of a single book, much less 10.The WRAPUP: This book is definitely the slowest in the entire series, but several important things do happen. Having said that, read a few reviews and synopses online to keep abreast of events and you'll be just as well off as reading the thing. The quality of writing has gone completely to hell. This might be a fault better laid at the feet of the publisher, but the author of a book should at least try to get it properly edited, if only to keep up his reputation. Robbie,Baby, Please, if you by some miracle happen to read some of these reviews, take a hint from your disgruntled fans!Finally, I would still recommend that you keep your eye out for book 11 because a few developments in book 10 point to major events that have to happen soon (and I don't mean the stupid prequels)."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I liken this series to a heroin addition. Sure, it may have been fun in the beginning. Meet interesting people, have fun, etc. But in the end, you are hooked and not really enjoying it anymore!I notice that every book features a fatter and better dressed depiction of Robert Jordan, and is it my imagination or is his smile getting bigger?As an avid fan of epic fiction, I am used to waiting for the payoff. Sure, it takes time for a plot to develop, and yes character development is a key element. BUT COME ON! The first four books featured a brutal battle with Forsaken (albeit at the very end of each of the books), but now we get 5 pages on what dress Avienda is wearing today, and how everyone &quot;smirks&quot; at the knife in her belt. ENOUGH! And do we really need internal dialog for 60 Aes Sadei, 40 Generals, 162 Aeil.... you get the picture.Get back to the basics, Jordan. Unfortunately, due to the &quot;heroin&quot;-like nature of this series, I will contine to buy this garbage from you, but I will watch for a book signing tour and not hesitate to give you an earfull given half a chance."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Ever since Book 4 (Shadow Rising), it seems like 3 months of action has happened over the next 7 books (at 600 pages per book, that's 4,200 pages). It's clear that Robert Jordan is willing to drag out this series until \\"they nail shut his coffin\\" (Jordan's words) so that he can suck in more money to publish this dreck. I seriously recommend you read the first 4 books and then read this synopsis:1. Rand leaves the Aiel waste and gets it on with Aviendha, Elaine and Min. Aviendha and Elain become \\"first sisters\\" which mean they're happy to share Rand between them. Between bouts of fooling around, Rand contemplates his impending madness over many thousands of pages, forms the Ashaman (a group of men who can channel) in preparation for the Last Battle, kills a few of the Forsaken (Rahvin and Sammael) and just generally wastes a lot of time. Of course, killing the Forsake doesn't do anything because they get reincarnated again in different forms and get reintroduced as new characters. Blah.2. Mat forms his band and keeps winning battles with the experience of his past lives. Mat adopts \\"Olver,\\" who is Gaidal Cain reincarnated, and the boy is destind to tame the \\"foxes and snakes\\" that gave Mat his scar and weapon. Mat fools around with lots of women, including the knife-wielding queen of Ghealdan and discovers that the gholam have been released to kill. Eventually, Mat meets the daughter of the nine moons he has been destined to marry and easily kidnaps her (the security for a head of state is ridiculous).3. Perrin becomes the Lord of the Two Rivers, marries Faile and then becomes the object of a weird bizzare love triangle game between Faile and Berelain. Eventually, Faile is kidnapped and Perrin hunts after her while fending off Berelain's sexual advances, even though everyone else (including Faile) believes that Berelain has successfully seduced Perrin.4. Elayne rips Birgitte out of the World of Dreams and makes Birgitte her warder. Elayne, Nynavae and Aviendha find the Bowl of the Winds and use it to break the hot weather imposed by the Dark One. During this search, they travel with a circus and engage in all sorts of stupid gossip over clothes, who is acting more silly around men and other useless minutiae which are dragged out over thousands of pages. Eventually Elayne ends up in Andor where she tries to regain the Rose Throne, which Morgase abdicated when she was ensorceled by Rahvin, one of the Forsake, whom Rand eventually blows away.5. Siuan Sanche is deposed as Amyrlin Seat by Elaida. Siuan gets back by spreading a rumor that Elaida and the Reds have set up Logain as a false Dragon. Siuan and Logain are stilled by Nyavae finds out how to cure this so they both regain their power, although Siuan is weaker than before. This causes a split in the White Tower and Egwene is elected to head the rebels. The Aes Sedai are in disarray as the Black Ajah takes over the White Tower led by Alviarin, Elaida's keeper, and others try to stop them. Other Aes Sedai allied with the Shaido capture Rand and intend to chain him but he is freed by his Maidens. Some Aes Sedai are imprisoned by the Shaido, who are dominated by big-breasted, jewel-encrusted, power hungry Wise Ones, some Aes Sedai are forced to pledge personal alliegance to Rand, the rest are either afraid of Elaida, the Black Ajah, the rebels or themselves. Jordan keeps saying how powerful and resepected the Aes Sedai are, but they believe every far-fetched lie, get manipulated by every other faction, beaten up by Ashaman, Windfinders, Wise Ones, Shaido, Rand.6. The Shaido run amok and the Aiel who can't accept Rand join them.7. The Whitecloaks are getting killed by Masema's fanatics and in the general chaos, but the \\"great\\" general Pedron Niall has a plan that even Sun Tzu couldn't figure out. While losing every battle, Niall sees plots everywhere and displays no evidence of competence whatsoever.Other crud happens with minor characters, but I can't remember and I just don't care anymore. It's a shame that this series which started out with such promise has become nothing more than a shameless churn of drivel designed to generate as much money as possible, much like what happened with Piers Anthony's 80 book Xanth series."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"WOT - does that stand for Wheel of Trite? Did Robert Jordan's wife write these last few books.?Either Jordan has a limited recollection of his earlier writings or perhaps he has contracted Alzheimers. Why else would he repeatedly introduce so many new trivial characters in place of developing original plot lines and major characters. It is pure frustration! (And shame on you fellow WOT fans who gave this book four stars even while pointing out the slow pace and lack of story deveolpment.)Tell your accountant not to worry however Mr. Jordan.

Twenty of the book club members have quit reading altogether. 10 (all men) are, for some reason, now afraid of women and never leave their homes. 15 members have dedicated their lives to the study of tea, tea drinking protocol, tea accessories, the proper attire for tea drinking. 17 of our members now suffer an odd form of narcolepsy; they pass out when the W.O.T or Robert Jordan is mentioned. And four have suffered some sort of brain damage. Coincidentally they were all found with their eyes taped open, a mostly empty pot of coffee in their hands, and the book \\"Crossroads of twilight.\\" We do not believe there is a connection.

I feel i was prepared for the task.Toe: (thinks to himself \\"you wool headed sheep eater\\") and what are your thoughts on the book.Tack: well, my brain is still kind of numb. But I'm drinking a special blend of tea. it's a combination of tea from china, India, Peru, and Columbia. The tea from china is grown ONLY in the winter and harvested by the Hakka tribe. The Hakka's are well suited to working in the mountains as their people have lived in their mountain village for thousands of years. The first settlers of course came from the Northern Province during the Song dynasty (not to be confused with the NORTHERN song dynasty. a rather common mistake) where war had broken out between the Mongols (pre-Genghis Kahn) and the vegetarian tea drinking sect of the Punta people. Suffering major losses to the Mongols, who by the way were great warriors even before Kublai Kahn.Tick: Don't you mean Genghis Kahn?Tack: I beg your pardon.Tick: Genghis Kahn.

The Punta's, having suffered great losses to the Mongols in the pre-KAHN error decided to move south to be safe.

I'll describe all 367 women for you including the dresses they wore and the ones they did not which were stored in their wardrobes.

I grew it myself in the rain season. The only light the tea plants were exposed to were sunrise and moonlight. I bought a special sterling silver tea tray with twisted tri-rope handles.

The previous pope not the current one. I've also grown a special blend of tea that turns the same color as my shoes when I add goat milk. Whole goat milk NOT skim and soy milk doesn't work at all.

Unfortunately somewhere between books 5 & 6 that all changed. More characters were introduced along with more twisted sub-plots, while the main plot moved at a snail's pace...This book doesn't really introduce anything new, but it keeps the main theme of the last few books: Move the main plot as slow as possible. The greater part of the book is filled with annoying banter between minor characters that have nothing to do with the main story line. The chapters that do involve the main characters don't add much to the mix. Half way through I found myself scanning pages and turning until I found something interesting. Needless to say I turned way too many pages without really reading them, something I have never done before.After the critism's leveled at the last couple of books, one would have hoped that Mr. Jordan would have gotten the point: You can't expect fans to stay hooked if you keep giving them books that are a chore instead of a pleasure to read. The action hasn't picked up at all, if anything it has slowed down even more.Wait until it's finished (maybe in another 6 to 10 years) and buy the rest of the series in paperback at a discount. At least then you won't be disappointed to have awaited almost 2 years for a book filled with boring prattle.

If you have not started reading this series, do not start now. Jordan's writing has never been very strong but it was passable in the early books when he had a tight storyline. However, as the series has crept along his writing has become the most painful thing I have ever had to read (and I'm a college professor and have read a lot of painful writing!) I appreciate that he is trying to create a rich fantasy world, however, by book 9 and 10 it reads like a cut and paste job. His most annoying habit, in my mind, is his tendancy to describe characters over and over again, so that each time a character is re-introduced you have to withstand a paragraph about that persons one-dimensional personality that you read last time the character was introduced. Jordan also loves clothes and hairstyles and loves to describe them. Hundreds of pages could be eliminated if he didn't feel the need to describe every bloody thing everyone was wearing.The major problem though with this story is that we all know essentially how it is going to end. That is the problem with relying too much on prophecy in earlier books. Yes, we know there will be a big battle and probably a lot of destruction and Rand will probably die, but considering Jordan's reluctance to kill any of his main characters, even he will probably get to live.Another major issue I have with the books is that whenever he comes to an obstacle (such as the world being to large for characters who are seperated from communicating with each other) he always finds a convenient way to resolve it with the one power or his characters are all of a sudden able to channel more powerfully than they should reasonably be expected to. And isn't it convenient that all the women are so in love with Rand and they have no problem with it because they love each other sooooooo much.At this point I don't care. I used to love the series, or at least the idea of the series, but now I read it wishing harm on each of the main characters and many of the lesser ones as well."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I was one of Jordan's biggest fans through the first 5 books. Great characters, imaginitive premises and satisfying resolutions -but each following book in the series has been less and less enjoyable. This one really takes the cake. Jordan seems to take great pride in introducing a minimum of 17 new characters in each chapter, each one supplied with generous physical descriptions and absolutely nothing more. It is impossible to keep track of , remember or differentiate 178 different Aes Sedai and 220 Sanchean, 44 Two Rivers, 28 Saldeans..well, you get the point. He's lost complete control of this series. I won't read beyond this chapter. Even worse than this is the fact that nothing happens. Nothing!! Rand himself is barely in the storyline. I've never written a review online, but I couldn't wait to burn this one. Do yourself a favor, and start following another writer."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I read positive and negative reviews of this before deciding to go ahead and check it out from the library. Having read the reviews below (and the book itself), I have to say a few things are clear:1. When reviewers that try to get you to buy the book can only try to insult the negative-reviewers, you know they're desperate to keep the Jordan bandwagon rolling-despite two broken axels.2. Instead, look at the reviews that give you specific complaints or specific praise. You'll see the former type vastly outweighs the latter.3. Ask yourself what you want out of a book first,then see if the reviewers that share that interest are of the positive or negative type. For example, if you really want a good story, one that develops and has characters that are interesting, then this may not be the series for you. If you want lots of description of nothing, unrealistic characters, and verboisity like none before, then go ahead and buy it. One person might like high-quality fiction, and so might eschew this book. Others might be trapped in hell for all eternity and, therefore, might find this book to be an interesting respite. It all depends on what you want out of the book.I don't know why people get worked up comparing Jordan to Tolkien. Quite honeslty, the whole fantasy genre is derivative of Tolkien's work, though usually in a better way. If any of the complaints about comparing Jordan to (insert author's name) are of interest, I find those comparing his work to Frank Herbert's, Steve Perry's, and David Eddings's the most damning. But again, would you really care that he rips off others IF the story were any good? Probably not.This book obviously isn't worth the paper it's printed on, as the myriad negative reviews argue. If that bothers you, then I recommend you don't buy this book. But if you really don't care what you read, go ahead. You might like it.Just don't blame me if you don't."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I have been a fantasy fan for a very long time. I started with Stephen Donaldson, moved on to Terry Brooks and then to Raymond Feist and David Eddings. At one time, Robert Jordan ranked with the best. That time has long since passed. The book is uninteresting and does nothing to move the series along. Jordan fans should skip it so as not to lose whatever love they may have left for the series. Jordan has long since run out of new or interesting things to say, and it is time to end the series. Hopefully he can find a final novel that is worthy of ending what was once a truly outstanding series. I do fear, however, that he has lost interest in what he does and is merely holding on for as many paychecks as he can squeeze out of this."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"My God! I thought Dickens took eight chapters to say what most people can say in a paragraph, until I read this! I'm a big fan of the series, but I'm ready to trash my whole set...anyone want them? The important events in this book should have taken place in less than two chapters. With Jordan writing under a pseudonym and writing prequels all I can think is that readers and fans are being taken on a ride by both the author and publishers. Enough is enough! Release the next book in the series and make sure there is some substance to it or more and more fans will lose interest. The whole series should end in the next one or two books, at the most."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"The one good thing about reading this book is that I can now procrastinate by reading the other ~2000 reviews of it and laugh with them about how awful the book is, and how ridiculous the series has gotten.1) I bought this book used, in paperback. I won't pay full price for Jordan's books anymore. I'm certainly not going to buy some prequel novel in the naive hopes that his writing will have improved by writing back in time.2) I read this book before my husband, who kept commenting that I was reading extremely fast. He's right: it's easy to read fast when you can skim entire pages without missing anything.3) Hubby now keeps the book in the bathroom and is reading it when he has time to spend in there. I've occasionally thought about picking up the book while I'm in there myself -- but honestly, I'd rather stare at the wall than read one more page of the book.Why do I dislike it so much?-- This book begins chronologically before the previous book ends. It takes approximately 500 pages for the book to advance to the next day from the end of the previous book. Rand is not mentioned at all during this time, except as people turn their heads toward the &quot;mysterious strong channeling source,&quot; and wonder whether it's Rand or the Forsaken causing it.-- When we do see Rand, it's for one chapter, and then the rest of the book continues as though he were irrelevant to the outcome of the series.-- If I have to read about one more slightly perturbed Aes Sedai smoothing her skirts distractedly, about one more dress of one color that is &quot;slashed&quot; with another color, about one more embroidery detail, I may go crazy. For all Jordan seems to dislike women from the way he writes their characters, he really seems to want to dress like them.-- Likewise if I have to read about one more supposedly strong male character being utterly bewildered (and thus disarmed) by feminine behavior. Mat can lead thousands of soldiers into a highly strategized battle, but he can't control one captive? Come on.-- In the previous book, at least the excitement at the end spanned some reasonably large number of pages and had a clear resolution by the end. This book? The last page is somewhat exciting, and doesn't offer resolution so much as a teaser for what may happen in the next book (though of course, he may skip this character entirely and bring her back for the book following the next one). Other than that, the series has not moved forward one bit.All in all, I may or may not read the next one, but I probably will -- let's face it, I'm as addicted as you all are. However, I certainly will continue refusing to buy the books at full price. Public library, anyone?"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"The only value in this book, is as a gap-filler. Jordan started well with books 1-5. 6-9 got steadily slower; pace was glacial if that. Book ten is ridiculous. He needs to get off the kick with describing every little detail and get back to the story. One chapter is two thirds filled with Elayne having a bloody bath - just that - nothing else. This book could have been condensed to about 4 or 5 chapters and distributed liberally around the other books.Jordan needs to get a grip, NOW. He's losing fans, and that right fast."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I think Jordan did not really start losing it until Book 7. That book was the first time an ending occured with really no big event occuring and no converging of plot threads. Since then things have become worse, with the exception of Book 9 which is OK.But this one takes the cake. So much has been said in the other 2000+ reviews that I will only add: THERE IS NO REASON TO READ THIS BOOK. Because no plot lines advance or characters converge or events happen, a reader will have no problem going from Book 9 to 11.I have hope that Jordan can round out the series with two more books channeling the 1990 Jordan which hooked us all.If that happens it would save the series. And perhaps future editions of the series will conviently omit this book. It would be easy to do and not missed."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"the best book in the series thus far."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I don't know what people have against the later books in Wheel of Time. It's my favorite series of all time, and if anything, I think the later books are the better ones!! The first book is by far the worst in my opinion: The characters are all pathetic weaklings, and sometimes the writing has the quality of a b-movie script. But later on, they just get better and better. I love how all the characters, starting from such humble roots, become all powerful and stuff. People who complain that nothing happens, that the books are boring, are obviously the kind of people who think action movies or 'thrillers' should win Academy Awards. It's political action, in a lot of cases, like in this book, and it's great. I agree that not much actually happened in this book, but the characters are interesting enough that I want to know what's happening in their lives, even if it isn't huge battles or monumental events. This is a great book, and this is a great series that has only gotten better. My two favorite scenes in the series: The Battle of Dumai's Wells (Book 6), and The Cleansing of the Source (Book 9), both in the later books. People who think this series has gone downhill need to A) Get patient, B) Learn to appriciate politics instead of just swordplay, and C) SHUT UP!"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I'm about half way though the Crossroads of Twilight. I can say right now that yes, there is not much plot advancement and their is alot of detail on just about everything from dresses or how cold it is. But is that a problem with the book or author. I don't think so. I think the problem lies in us, the readers, not the books or the author. We live in an information age and we want everything yesterday...We want everything right now in real time, the internet, books, everything. Jordon is writing a epic story giving us all the information he can about everything that is happening on the planet to make it come alive for us. His only fault is making us love it so much we want to know what happens and we want it now... We've been waiting since 1992 or 93 wanting to know how it's all going to end and 10 years later we still don't have answers. I think the real problem with the series is that Robert Jordon is human and can't turn out a book month. If so we could finish one and go right now and get the next one I believe thier wouldn't be such a problem..."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I prefer to have the characters developed. So often The author is so anxious to finish a series that it loses its flavor. Once the tale with these characters is Pau there is little chance of the author going back and fleshing the series, and characters out. I hope the author will stay the course and do what he said he was going to do at the very first. Make a lengthy well thought out series."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"While the last few books have lacked quick pacing and action, the complexity of the plot, the realism of the characeters, and the breadth of the world he has created more than makes up for this. Once again Jordan manages to create an immersive, and even more important, plausable fantasy. No mean feat, especially in a series of this length."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"... I don't want to put in any spoilers here, but suffice to say, so much had happened in the previous books, that we had begun to lose some of the multi-character perspective of the Wheel of Time series.Though I too was dissapointed that the story did not advance much, I will reread this book, and perhaps the entire series and appreciate the vast depths of this epic. Lets just hope that in the 18 months or so when book 11 comes out, Jordan takes advantage of our familiarity with the current state of the plot and moves things toward Tarmon Gaidon ever the more quickly."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I really don't understand why people as so upset about book 10. I enjoyed it quite a bit and am awaiting the next installment. Jordan has been writing an incredibly involved and engrossing story with numerous side plots and spins and so it is no surprise that this book is supplying the information that is needed to advance the story as a whole. If you don't like the story, don't read the books. I thought it was great."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"The &quot;wheel&quot; is finally moving. Jordan adds another good chapter to a complex storyline. It is good not excellent. We have all waited two years for this long awaited new chapter in a drawn out saga. Having said that I do believe that the book is a giant leap forward in what has been a dawdling storyline. You begin to believe that the end is drawing near. Mat is as always his usual gambling self, but with the daughter of the nine moons to occupy his time he is not himself. Perrin search for his wife continues and he perhaps loses his innocence in the process. Rand is not mention till the last 3/4 of the book; however, the decisions that he makes will develop the next possible 2 books and keep us coming back for more. It is not The Great Hunt, or The Shadow Rising, but it does keep the storyline moving very good. Read on, for Tarmon Gaidin awaits."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Many people seem to be complaining that nothing happens in this book. That is just not true. While no action (fighting, battles, killing} takes place, things do happen. Explanations of characters objectives, setting up action for the next book, thing I can't say because they are spoilers. Jordan does spend a lot of time describing clothes and small actions(snorting, sniffing, shawls), but that is how the entire series has been. If you didn't like it in previous books, why are you still reading?Jordan is not milking this series, he has a vision and he wants to portray right, not rush out the ending when hes spent so much time setting it up. If you are new to this series, I suggest you start on book one. If you want more action, read George R. R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire series, there's plenty of action there."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Robert Jordan, and his amazing Wheel of Time series, is the great collection of fantasy since JRR Tolkien. While many have criticized the last two books in the series, I wish to set to record straight, and to give those reading these reviews, including hopefully Robert Jordan himself, a completely fair review of Book 10 of the Wheel of Time. The epic fantasy tale continues, with all of the many great characters in the glory (or not so glorious) adventures. The depth of the story, with its many twisting lines of intertwined characters and events, is staggering, and without a doubt Robert Jordan is the greatest author of our time (no offense JK Rowling;-) This story continues where it left off, and takes on many new, and surprising angles, as the Wheel of Time continues to turn towards the coming confrontatin between good and evil, between Rand and The Dark Lord. His characters are amazing, the sheer complexity of the story is mezmerizing, and I recomend that anyone..... no..... everyone, who loves fantasy must read The Wheel of Times series, and enjoy the great story and adventures, especially of my favorite characters, Perrin, Moiraine, Lan, Faile, Davram Bashere, Bael, Basil Gill, Gareth Bryne, the Aiel, Nynaeve (and her temper!), and our little troublemaker Matrim (Mat) Cauthon, I can only wait to see what he gets in the this time! If you want to enjoy one of the greatest fantasy stories ever created, then read The Wheel of Time by the master of fantasy, Mr. Robert Jordan."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I waited eagerly for the coming of the tenth installment of this gargantuan series, but when I finally made the pilgrimage to the bookstore, handed over the $40 that I will never see again (note-this is one to borrow) I listlessly took it home. I placed it dutifully on my bookshelf, with all its' brothers and sisters, and there it stayed.For almost two months.Now, it's not that I didn't want to read it. I was just, shall we say, apprehensive? As most of us know, dear old RJ has been slacking off in the most shameful manner, putting out in his last two volumes such slow moving, irrelevant drivel that I now cringing with embarrassment that I ever compared him to Tolkien. What was I thinking? I used to worship this man. I praised his inventiveness, his swift storytelling, and especially his magnificent characterization and ability to pull you into his web so that you felt you were there, taking part, one with the book. Do you remember the first inkling you had that Rand could channel? So thrilling. Or when Lan finally married Nynaeve? I rejoiced. Who could forget the epic chapter in which Moiraine sacrificed herself to kill Lanfear and save Rand? I practically needed therapy, I was so overwrought. What happened?I shall tell you, as I have been pondering the downfall of the Wheel of Time for a while now. Mr. J. has quite simply spread himself too far over the world that he created. He introduced so many subplots, intrigues and conspiracies that he has lost his focus. Now, dozens of characters have apparently starring roles who should simply have been kept in the background, for colour. At this point if he were to tie up the hundreds (I do not exaggerate...hundreds) of loose ends he has tripped himself up with, the series would go on for another decade. Horrifying thought, isn't it?Now he is stuck trying to make sense of the colossal maze in which he finds himself, wandering aimlessly, spitting out useless garbage about who is wearing what, why this raised eyebrow could mean disaster, the significance of weevils, and how weak tea tastes. Like we care.Lastly, I am sure I am not the only female to have been happily surprised at the status women enjoyed in the early novels. The women were portrayed as strong, intelligent, powerful and far from helpless. In other words, not stereotypical. Now, Jordan's women are either utterly heartless, with no concern for anything but her own manipulative ways, or headstrong and foolish, with only a thin line separating her from outright stupidity. Furthermore, I am becoming more and more impatient with the way all of these women treat the men, as though they are useless, incompetent and needing to be 'carefully handled', lest they go astray. I have gone from being thankful that RJ did not portray women as helpless and frail, to sheer mortification at the behavior of his female characters, especially towards the male ones.Mr. Jordan, do us a favour. Either wrap this series up with a snappy ending, ASAP, or just put it out of its misery."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Except for the last two pages, where Jordan throws an unforeshadowed (and impossible, given what has gone before) cliffhanger at us in a vain attempt to create tension, here's the secret to this book -- nothing happens. I advise you to skip it, even if you've faithfully, as I have, read the first nine books in the series. If book #11 is worthwile, you won't have missed anything by skipping #10 except several hundred pages of drudgery.I mean, we get several chapters of Mat continuing his escape from Ebou Dar (boringly) while he doesn't make any progress with the Daughter of the Nine Moons; then some chapters about Perrin not finding Faile. Then a few more chapters about Faile doing flaming laundry while plotting to escape from the Shaido (she doesn't actually attempt to escape). Then a bunch more chapters of Egwene sitting outside of Tar Valon, politicking, for gods' sake, but nothing changes, she doesn't discover any of the plots around her or the male Forsaken in a female disguise giving her backrubs, or make any progress against, or with, the White Tower (or even notice that the Source has been cleansed) .... Then a bunch of chapters inside the White Tower -- more politicking with characters never discovering anything ...Finally, 80% of the way through the book, we finally get to see Rand, who is too tired after his ordeal in the last book to do anything this book. You don't see Nynaeve or Lan, except off-stage -- they don't do anything either.After two years of waiting, I guess we're doomed to another two years of waiting for the next Wheel of Time novel to come out -- we'll just pretend this one didn't happen (like Highlander movie #2)."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I remember years ago when I was recommending the Eye of the World to all my friends in college how much I like Robert Jordan. I can still go back to the first 4 books and reread them every so often. Can't do that with the last couple. I felt the first tickle of fear when the Forsaken started coming back (bringing back bad guys is never a good thing (ie Glen Cook's Shadow Company)).Some earlier reviewer defended Jordan with the following comment, \\"I have complete faith that an author as skillful as Mr. Jordan will not have suddenly in the course of one novel lost his ability to write.\\" Mr. Jordan didn't lose the ability to write over one novel, he lost it over 6 novels and 10 years of time.Imagine a prologue of around 100 pages with no mention of any of the major (let's say 9) characters from his first book (the 9 or so that most readers care the most about). So many Aes Sedai that I can't tell them apart (who's black, who's red, who's yellow, who cares anymore). Also, does every noble in every house in every country need to be named?Let's look at the names from halfway through the prologue (nearly as many names as pages): Yukiri, Meidani, Leonin, Serancha, Doesine, Ferane, Rina, Adelorna, Rajar, Narenwin, Katerine, Tarna, Lusonia, Daerilla, Jailin, Eram, Carlys, Bael, Elenia, Naean,Zavion, Shimron, Alsalam, Wakeda, Rajabi, Ituralde, Ailron, Barelle, Logain, Taveine, Desandra, Lemai, Mishraile, Saerin, Pevara, Silvaini, Galina, Celestin, Annharid, Alviarin, Bernaile, Juilaine, Shevan, etc.It is not writing ability to leave your readers trying to figure out who totally minor characters are. It is not adding richness to a world. It is aggravating and not pleasant to read. I call it writing an encyclopedia and we know how many people read that for pure pleasure (a few of you masochists).I haven't bought any of the last 4 (after buying the first one in its inital paperback printing, the second in its initial tradeback printing and the rest in hardback). Its just painful now. Painfully sad."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This book could have easily been edited down to a single paragraph. I held out hope to the last page. I've defended Jordan as the books have become progressively bland and I've been a huge fan until now. I'm done. I feel molested and cheated. When I realized that I had 3 pages left in the book and was still waiting for some big plot twist, something to blow my mind, it dawned on me that I'd wasted a lot of time not even being entertained. I feel betrayed and very disappointed.600 pages of characters sitting around talking about tea and the weather. Even when we come across a haunted village, the characters sit outside it and talk about it then leave. Nothing. nothing.... nothing. what a waste.You know, I'm becoming angry as I write this.

It was advertised that Mr. Jordan would sign all of the hardback books in the series and would graciously stay until each and every book was signed. Each person was assigned a number as they arrived. One young man had bought every one of Mr. Jordan's books that day with the intention of getting them all signed. However Mr. Jordan would only sign two per person, so if someone had more than two books, it was back to the end of the line.As the night wore on, Mr. Jordan began to very loudly complain that he had not eaten and that he wanted to hurry up and &quot;finish this&quot; so that he could go back to his room and eat. In fairness I will say that these statements were made in response to questions by his fans. Most people had their books signed by now, and the young man who had bought all ten was still patiently going to the back of the line each time in order to get two more books signed.At about 1015 Mr. Jordan declared that no more people were to be allowed back into the line. He was tired and hungry and wanted to leave. Our young fan was two steps from the back of the line, which contained about 20 people at that time. At the time, he was trying to sort out the books he had in his carryall. He needed only two more books signed. Since he was so close to the end of the line, and had in fact been standing there for a couple of minutes, I don't think he believed Mr. Jordan's statement included him. He took those two steps to the back of the line and became crushed.Mr. Jordan, very loudly, asked why people weren't paying attention? Why couldn't they understand when he said no more he meant no more? He even managed to glare at the young man through the rest of the line. Looking extremely uncomfortable, the young man stepped away from the line, his last two books unsigned. He was all of 18 years old, if that, and his &quot;Hero&quot; had just humiliated him in front of a crowd of strangers.I wish I hadn't acted as I did then. I should have put aside the two books I was getting signed and asked the young man to give me his last two and have them signed for him. As it was I was next in line at this point and as Mr. Jordan reached for my books, I picked them up instead and without saying a word returned them to the store. The books I had already had signed were for my sister, brother, and a neighbor who couldn't make it. The two I had left were for myself. I chose not to participate after seeing Mr. Jordan's attitude that night.I will not make any judgments or statements about Mr. Jordan concerning this episode. I will, however, tell you how it has affected me. I could now care less about the ending of WoT. I have no desire to read anything by this author ever again. The look on that young man's face as he oh so quietly walked down the stairs of Borders cured me of any lingering need to finish reading this series. That young man was a true fan.

There you are!\\" Legolas exclaimed, tugging his braid. \\"I ought to box your ears for not coming on time!\\"\\"This is the thanks I get for saving YOUR life,\\" Gimli retorted. \\"I will never understand elves!\\"Legolas regarded Gimli cooly. Seriously Gimli could be so wool-headed.\\"Lad,\\" Gimli sighed. \\"This story is going nowhere. Couldn't you control your clothes, or something?\\"Where was I going with this? Oh, yes, certainly most people can remember this printed on MANY various volumes of his books:\\"Jordan has come to dominate the world that Tolkien began to reveal.\\"--The New York TimesYeah, can you imagine Jordan writing in Tolkein's world NOW?Seriously, Jordan is the modern-day version of Dickens with one crucial difference - Dickens provided us with an eventual ending.It doesn't look like this is ending anytime soon, folks. Now, not drawing any comparison, mind you, but at LEAST we knew how MANY HARRY POTTER books there were going to be....Good luck, Jordan. At the last tally, you have over 2,200 reviews - and all of them average to 1.5 stars. I'd say you have a lot to make up for. In my case, too late - I'll never read another and I'm selling my used copies."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Crossroads of Twilight is without a doubt the worst book of this diseased series. I personally was unable to put the first six down and was lucky not to have to wait long for A Crown of Swords to come out; a disappointment in comparison, but not a total loss. And then The Path of Daggers... a much longer wait and a novel that left a lot to be desired. Winter's Heart took another couple of years (at least) and finally offered some hope that after a small (if you can call several years 'small') storytelling sabbatical, Mr Jordan might put the plot back into gear.And then the traffic jam that was Crossroads of Twilight.I echo almost every reviewer when I say nothing whatsoever happens in this book. Until the end that is... and I will return to that nonsensical 'twist' later.When did this tale hit the skids? When did this beautifully rendered, character-driven high fantasy turn into the fantasy version of Big Brother? Surely I'm not alone in having no desire whatsoever to experience every single second of the lives of the burgeoning cast of snide background characters in this meandering epic of a tale! Why has this tale stopped focusing on the already numerous and overly-dispersed protagonists? And why are those same protagonists chasing the action rather than being involved in it?The expansion in numbers of characters in these novels is remarkable! I work full time, as I'm sure many of you do, and I simply don't have time to re-read all of these books to jog my memory on which of the six hundred Aes Sedai are actually Darkfriends or which of the maids is actually one of the Forsaken reborn? And on that note, why on earth did Mr Jordan decide to start resurrecting the Forsaken to begin with? There were certainly enough of them to start with to last through a series of epic but reasonable length. One of the joys of the earlier books was Rand's confrontation with one of the Forsaken in the finale of each book. And with each victory you felt you were getting closer to the Final Battle. Now I'm quite sure there are more of them than before, and if there aren't, given the time and our money I'm sure there will be!I remember seeing this book on the shelf and being thrilled. I remember turning each page, sure that something exciting would happen in the next chapter, surely. Even into the last hundred pages (I think that would be Chapter 1, straight after the prologue) I was sure something would happen. Boy was I disappointed. In one of the most ghastly (in a literary sense) twists of the series, Egwene does something that makes absolutely no sense unless you assume that the editors, realising that nothing had happened over the last 600 pages, snuck it in. Even headachy and sleep-deprived I refuse to believe Egwene is that stupid.Please Mr Jordan. Keep going if you must. Write another 10 books if you dare. But please... please... at least give us something interesting and exciting.And as a side note, I'm very sorry, but if I lived in a world where ALL of the women acted the way Mr Jordan's do ALL of the time, and ALL of the men were spineless in the face of a woman's unjustified nagging ALL of the time, I too would sacrifice my immortal soul and join the Dark One in his quest to destroy the world."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Over 2000 reviews, what else can possibly be said at this point? Well, like countless other reviewers have said, I consider the first four books of this series to be unparalleled masterpieces in fantasy literature. Now some may draw the lines at different points in the series; but we can all agree that somewhere between Rand seizing Callandor and the Aes Sedai kneeling before him at Dumai's Wells, it all fell apart.Why is it that almost every review of this novel falls to one extreme or another? There are countless 1-star ratings, a handful of 5-star ratings, and very little in between. What makes it so painful to see a series like this fall apart is the potential we all saw for a grand, exciting climax to come shortly after the events in the first 4-6 books.Take yourself back for a minute, to the moment when you first finished reading Book 4, The Shadow Rising. Personally, I found the storyline of Perrin returning to the Two Rivers to be one of the most exciting in the entire series. It sent shivers down my spine to see the veteran Two Rivers men and women, who had once seen Perrin as just a boy, now saluting him and calling him Lord. And Rand, of course, had finally accomplished something we all knew had to happen before the final battle: he had united the Aiel and emerged as their leader. Mat had gained the memories of countless military leaders, making him a tactical genius and the perfect general to lead Rand's armies into Tarmon Gaidon.Wow. Picture it.Rand, leading the forces of Aiel out of the Waste and towards the final battle. Mat, at his side, leading the forces of Tear, Cairhien and Caemlyn. And finally Perrin, joining them from the west leading the reborn Manetheren armies.Epic. It could've been....something truly magical. And it could've been done in the next 1, maybe 2 books.Now I'm not saying \\"it shouldve happened like this.\\" Before you jump down my throat saying who am I to rewrite the stories, Jordan has an overall story in mind, blah blah blah...I'm only saying this is one way it could've gone, this is the direction in which I felt the story moving at that time. Now...well, just as an example...Perrin has gone from being my absolute favorite character...to a useless bore. His 'wolfbrother' nature is barely mentioned at all, let alone playing an important part in his tale.Again, this has been said by countless other reviewers, but I'll say it again...for those of you have not read any of the Wheel of Time series, do not start. You will only be disappointed by the falling apart of a grand fantasy tale. Like many others, I will continue to read the series, simply to see how it ends. But I will certainly not buy hardcover editions. I will wait until the books are available at the library. Even then...if the next book is as boring and uneventful as this one, perhaps it will be the last one I read.It could have been the stuff of legends, Mr. Jordan, but you have irreversibly ruined it."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"In over 600 pages, nothing happens that couldn't have been listed in a prologue. And the 75 page prologue is absolutely meaningless. It doesn't get you caught up, it doesn't review important current events, it does nothing but add more context for the absence of events. A major, world-shattering event takes place, and it's a mere footnote to what the characters had for breakfast. Mind-boggling!And how many characters look constantly startled in this silly book? I think it's between 8 and 10 now. I don't need to know what every one of the 200 characters is wearing during every moment of the day. I don't need to know every member of every family, Ajah, royal family or army. I don't need to know the different ways that each group of characters picks weevils out of their food.Let's get the show on the road. Let's get rid of the typographical errors. (Absolutely unforgiveable!) And lets start tying up some loose ends. Elayne in Caemlyn, the Aes Sedai conflict, the Black Ajah, Mat and the Seanchan, Perrin and the Shaido, Rand and the Forsaken, and Moiraine. Not to mention all the minor subplots and prophecy. Time to bring this thing to a close. Mr. Jordan is a good writer and he ought to move on to some new characters and new worlds."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I haven't even purchased this book nor even read the jacket. When the series started I was obsessed with it, I was also 14 years old and fantasy books were my thing then. Well 12 years later, a couple of college degrees, and many changing tastes in literature I am still stuck because I want to see if that light at the end of this tunnel is actually there. Robert Jordan has fallen victim to the meglomaniac idea that whatever he writes must be good and everybody will love it. Well, honestly we have to decide enough is enough and get him to finish this series in a timely manner. Unfortunately I will probably be suckered into this book as well, my curiosity will get the best of me but I am surely going to wait until it comes out on paperback, or maybe I can borrow it from someone. It would probably be a good airplane book because you really can't do anything else on an airplane but read bad books. But in the meantime there is just too much useful literature I will dedicate myself to."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"When I initially started reading this series, I could hardly put the first few books down and often found myself reading though the night to find out what happens next.The last few books in this series have been highly disappointing. With CoT, I have to literally force myself to read the next chapter, and most of which I skim or skip over because it is too detailed to be enjoyed, the plot is too slow, and the fact that nothing really happens in this book. I feel cheated out of my time and money by reading this book. A soap opera has more of a story line than this book.I really think that Robert Jordan has gotten away from the basics by drawing the plots out too slowly and creating too many new characters and subplots for them to really enjoy the book.In conclusion, this book is boring and drab. There is no notable action to mention and half of the main characters are hardly even heard from (Rand, Nynaeve, and the Forsaken in particular). I seriously think that Robert Jordan needs to end this series in the next book and ensure that the plot moves along quicker and sticks to the main characters that it was built around.If you're a Robert Jordan fan set on purchasing this book, then buy with the knowledge that this is the worst book in the series by far. Some of you may want to skip this book entirely seeing as nothing really changes or develops in this book with the exception of Egwene.Robert Jordan is an excellent writer and has proven it in the first half of this series, however, I strongly believe that he has lost the way as his last few books have been getting progressively worse. I just hope that he can redeem himself in the next book which I anxiously am awaiting.In the meantime, check out George R.R. Martin's series \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\". It will hook you completely in each book in the series."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I stopped buying the WoT books after Book 7 (which I could not finish) but from your reviews I can tell I missed nothing. Not buying until the last book."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"It's been said that Jordan intends to continue writing &quot;until they nail shut his coffin&quot;. After reading this last book I'm sending him a hammer. Over 700 reviews and the average rating is 2 STARS! Pah-lease, this book is lucky to make it into the positive scale at all. People giving it more than 2 stars must have been reading another book by mistake.I've never seen an author throw away fan loyalty such as Jordan has with regards to the (de)evolution of this series. I lost count as to how many times I climbed into bed only to fall asleep within a few pages because nothing happens, not even dialogue. If I wanted to read endless descriptions about clothing and how much lace and embroidery someone was wearing, I'd buy a fashing magazine. It's obvious that Jordan is milking his declining audience for all their worth simply because no one will pick up anything else from him after what he's done here. I can't believe that he's actually doing a tour for this &quot;novel&quot;. If I was anywhere near one of those locations would have taken my copy up to him, tossed it on the table, and walked away. Not possible to do now though (keep reading this review).Jordan isn't completely to blame for this mind-numbing drizzle. You gotta give some credit to TOR publishing for placing this disaster on the shelves. Check out their website sometime and you'll find the quality to just as lacking as Jordan's work.Regardless, we must always strive to look for the positives in any situation. As for me, I discovered that when you throw all ten books in the fireplace, you can roast some great marshmallows for several minutes."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Jordan is lost and doesn't know where he's going. Which way to turn. Crossroads? More like filler. Lazy and pedestrian. I don't mind long or rich - or both. Crossroads is like a cowboy movie with everything cut out but looped segments of riders and horses going forth and back and getting nowhere. Setup? The previous nine were also setups. Stay tuned? For what? He closed out book nine with Rand cleansing the Source -- but it takes him 300 pages of repetitious nonsense to get back to Rand and then wobbles badly. .... Like anyone else who's read the first 10 books, I'll probably read the next. I have an investment in the rich fantasy world Jordan has created. ... Every woman is in danger of becoming a cardboard Barbi simulation that swallows up the occasional great beauty Jordan once knew how to describe. Jordan delights in muddling up his work repeatedly with names of minor characters that are too similar to more important characters. At this rate he doesn't need a glossary, but an index to keep the names straight. Etc. ... Setup? This is a muddled mess. When Jordan is trying, he's as taut as anyone, no matter the length. Write as long as you want to, Mr. Jordan, but get back to the quality of the first three. If you're dedicated to this series as many of us are, don't buy the hardback. Wait until the next in the series comes out, buy Crossroads in paper and hope that Jordan rouses himself. At least the two books together will make more sense than a year apart...."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"If you have nothing to do (and you don't want to do anything anyway) and you have lots of time to do it, I encourage you to read this book. I'm confident that the opportunity to fill your time with drivel and pointless narrative will be satisfying.By my reckoning, approximately 10 days of time passed in the lives of the characters in the span from page 1 to page 800. At this rate, we can look forward to 36 books from Robert Jordan just so we can see how the characters spend one year of their lives.My biggest dilemma is this: Should I donate the book to a second hand store so that the next reader contributes no money to the author and to Tor, or should I burn it so that nobody is subject to this farce of fiction? Hmmm... something to ponder.Don't buy this book.

That is no longer the case, and hasn't been for several books.I WILL NEVER AGAIN PAY RETAIL for any forthcoming Wheel of Time hardbacks, and I won't even shell out good money for the paperback. When they trickle down to the garage sale price of 25 or 50, I will consider the price a fair and equitable one for his future books.Tolkien begat the genre of serial fanatsy and Frank Herbert perfected it. Jordan started out at a good clip...compelling story, great characters, surprising twists...his boat left shore in the first book and was clearly headed someplace worth traveling to with him. But as the books have come and gone, Jordan has beached his craft on some shoal of ego or greed he apparently can not or will not get off.I vote for \\"will not.\\" As the cries have gone up in the last 3 or 4 books, about the sloth of his pacing, they have gotten even slower. Crossroads of Twilight has so little breath and pulse left, I'm amazed the series is still considered among the living.Instead of punishing his critics (AND READERS) with fatuous and testy examples of just how slow his books can get, Jordan should get back to the real craft of storytelling, instead of throwing a 700-page \\"so there!\\" tantrum.Well, I'm through spending good $$ to indulge his manipulative horse manure. Mr. Jordan, you are free to waste any amount of my time in your future books trying to follow this story. But you will no long have my checkbook at your disposal while you do so. If you can waste 700 pages of my time for [$$], I can waste 3 or 4 years waiting for that 25 garage sale copy of all your future books. And I will."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Like most other reviewers, I am a long time fan of the Wheel of Time series - it has been more than half my life since I first picked up Book One.The first six books were a rollercoaster of action and adventure. I'd never encountered a fantasy like it, rich in detail, expertly plotted and awash with enthralling characters.Book Seven slackened the pace a little, but that was understandable: Book Six had been a behemoth volume that probably took years off the author's life.Book Eight was were the plot began to stagnate a little, with characters moving forward in increments, and events that would have taken a quarter of a chapter in previous volumes taking several chapters to cover.Book Nine was where things really slowed down. At this point it became blindingly obvious that the characters themselves had stagnated, the females all becoming mirror images of one another, and the males becoming caught up in their personal obsessions. And yet, towards the end of the book, a ray of hope appeared. Big Things started to happen, and it looked like they were going to continue happening in Book Ten.The readers were already weary. Many had already left the fold, claiming they would not pick up another Wheel of Time book until the series was finished, and then it would be from their local library. The rest of us were hoping against hope that Robert Jordan would find his feet once more, willing to give him one last chance.And then, Crossroads of Twilight appears, the worst book yet in the series. Pointless and plotless, this is the last straw. The excitement is gone - I remember not being able to sleep because I'd seen the COVER of Book Seven on the internet before it was published. I doubt I'll even be aware of Book Eleven until I notice it on the shelves while browsing for something else.I hope there is a reaction to this book. Tor should be flooded with the letters of disgruntled fans, and hopefully the returned copies of this book. I would, but it would require shipping overseas from Australia, and I've already spent enough money on the Wheel of Time."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I can't believe that it took three years and nearly 700 pages to write this book.

I have every book in the wheel of time series and have read them multiple times with great enjoyment. But this last book is just horrible. You keep reading the book waiting and hoping for something to happen and nothing ever does.In the Prologue, the &quot;Wolf&quot; is introduced into the story line then never heard from again. Are we to wait three more years to find out what his attack plan against the Seachan is and wether or not it will work?It is almost as if Robert Jordan doesn't know how to end the series and is writing this book to waste time.I recommend that anyone who has not purchased this book wait for the next installment and start from there.

The book spends 500 pages telling you about what other people were doing during events that happened in book 9.Nothing at all was accomplished in this book, no battles, no moves, nothing more or less then people talking to each other.

I was horribly let down.In fact, this book is even worse than the couple before WH, where the series sort of slumped. It's sort of sad when some of the best scenes in the book belong to Perrin Aybara (while I like the character, his previous point of views were tedious reading). In fact, the main character of the series, Rand, has only two or three chapters dedicated to him.Worst of all, except for one or two developments ( and the revealing of several clues to mysteries originating in previous titles), nothing really happens. One of the greatest things I loved about the Wheel of Time series is that each book before this usually had a vary strong endings (battles and confrontations for the most part), but Crossroads flops on this as well.One more rant: Robert Jordan inctroduces one or two new seemingly interesting story threads in the prologue, but fails to follow up on them in the book. One of the reasons I bought the books is because I had bought &quot;Glimmers&quot; (The early release of the prologue to the book) to get a taste of what was going to happen.I was sorely hurt to see the threads I had look forward to virtually ignored in the main body of the work."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Please do your self a favor and avoid this series like the plague.

That was the pinnacle Mr. Jordan was building up to, that's why he put in all these pesky details. It made me see the true scope of this battle between Good and Evil. There was the Creator (God), there was the Dark One (Lucifer), and there was our misfortunate hero who wanted nothing to do with this but had recieved a higher calling (Rand, of course. Just like Jesus.).It's a retelling of religion. That's why it works so well. Hasn't the bible been a bestseller for centuries? Mr. Jordan is savvy to this. He understand that humans have a crippling need to know where they came from. Rand'al Thor is the tool he uses to get his point across. Admit it! He's the character you want to know the most about, he's the one who DEFINTELY has to be in &quot;the last scene of the last book&quot; which Robert Jordan says he's known for years now.I stopped reading the series at Lord of Chaos, vowing never to touch another installment until the saga was declared over.Light, it's been a decade and Tar Ma'Gaidon is still not upon us!

I hated it. My disappointment with Robert Jordan couldn't be greater. He created an intriguing world of characters, complete with history and nuance. However, that was ten books ago. His writing has since degenerated into stagnation and trivia.There are so many minor characters that I can't remember all of them. Sadly, I don't care who they are. There are about 12 main characters I enjoy reading about. Jordan neglected all of them. Some of them didn't appear but in a few paragraphs, and the rest of them didn't do anything worth writing about.There is no reason for this book to be 680 pages long. Nothing happened. The book is filled with a bunch of skirt smoothing, embroidery, tired sexism jokes, rattling dice, worn-out clich&eacute;s, and overwhelming inanity. I skipped an entire chapter because I didn&#65533;t recognize any of the names of the characters in it.I&#65533;m sick and tired of reading 680 page Robert Jordan books filled with drivel until the last 20 pages wherein some cliff-hanging non sequitur occurs. Egwene&#65533;s capture might have been interesting if I had some vague idea of why she risked herself, other than the end of the book was near and something had to happen.I don&#65533;t understand Jordan&#65533;s writing choices. Faile is still captive. It&#65533;s so easy, Robert. Watch. &#65533;Under the cover of darkness, Faile sneaks out of the Aiel camp and returns to Perrin.&#65533; See how easy that was? Flesh it out a little if you like, Robert. The only interesting thing Perrin did in the entire book was discovering this ghost town. But Robert wrote that Perrin left the town behind to go and save Faile. Why, Robert? Why do you do set up something interesting only to return to boring junk? It&#65533;s so frustrating.Get on with it, Robert. Surprise us with a sudden attack by the Dark Lord. Force everyone to put aside his or her insipid plotline and confront the absent but ever-present *evil* Dark Lord. Open a rift, bring back Moiraine (the only Aes Sedai this book really needs), gather the characters on a battlefield, kill the Dark Lord, kill Rand, etc. The End.Then if you're compelled or need the money, write a whole sequel about the Tarabon embroidery patterns favored by green Aes Sedai but not Browns, or some other nonsense.But, Robert, finish the story already.

I can only figure Jordan's getting paid per page, because this book was entirely filler. I really don't see how he can end this series in even 3 additional books. He's got too many characters - that I can only imagine have no actual purpose to the story other than to bide the time before he figures out what he's going to do with the main 20 or so characters.

Using this innovative tool, we may finally be able to answer the question that has been plagueing us all since book one... &quot;how did the forest squirrels feel as they watched Moirain, Rand, et al. leaving the Two Rivers at the start of their epic adventure?&quot; Of course, given his current pace, we won't hear about it until book 20..."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Being a Wheel of Time fan is like being in a dessert, dying of thirst.

I took one step. I took another step. And finally, I was at the white bookshelf, when I found an ounce-thick book called Crossroads of Twilight.My fingers and the soft palm of my hand had touched the book and all the dust flew off the book as I had moved the book from the shelf all the way over to the counter. I had taken the money I needed to pay and placed it onto the wood counter. When I had gotten home, I sat down on the dark red leather couch and I opened the book and the first chapter. I had began reading all the words on the page because it was part of a story.A week later, I had finished the book and all the thoughts were in my mind about how awful this book was. I had placed the book down on the shelf, and my mouth moved as the words came out of it about how awful it was. Then my feet had touched the floor as I walked over to the chair where my laptop was, and I placed my rear on the chair as I began to sit down and use it. Then I placed my hand on the mouse, and my fingers had touched the keys on the keyboard which typed in the adress to a website called Amazon. Words poured out onto the screen as I then began writing this review."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Despite all the negative publicity, and my insistence that I wouldn't buy anymore of these books, I did. My new rule ended up being that I would wait for the paperbacks.So with Book 11 due in PB this fall, I decided to give this book another try.You see, a couple years ago when it came out in paperback, I tried to read it. I couldn't. My friends told me just to read the last chapter and skip the rest. I started reading anyway. I put it down. It is so boring; filled with so many people who I've never heard of, and lacking the best elements of the series (Rand v. Forsaken), that I couldn't do it.Well, here I am again. And I still can't read it. And now I hear that Book 12 will end the entire series? So we have a great first 5-6 books where tons of cool thing occur, a terrible next 4-5 books where nothing occurs, and then an ending where everything stops? Just like that?I now recommend that people read the first three books in the series and no more. TDR is a good stopping place, although there's good stuff in books 4-5, they require a reader to want more. Book 3 wraps it nicely. Just pretend Ishamael was the Dark One, and you're all done.What a tragedy to have created something so great and ruined it so thoroughly."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I'm one of the individuals who's read every book in this series and feels that I'm only doing so now because of the time I've put in already and because I'm hoping to see a dramatic shift in the writing. (The writing in the early books I enjoyed very much.)The books are about an epic taking place over the course of years and the books are covering less and less time. Over 700 pages into this book and only 4 hours are covered. If those 4 hours were eventful I might enjoy the book, but the chapters just cycled through groups of characters repeating the same thing. They all shared their thoughts on an unknown event that they didn't understand and came to the conclusion that they needed more information. The whole book could have been a prologue. It took such a long time to get to release that in retrospect I think he must have spent most of his time trying to find a way to use different words and phrases to say the same thing over and over.To further frustrate his readers he's popped out some prequels to a series he has yet to finish. I understand that sometimes an idea gets milked, but this is ridiculous. How does your editor allow you to put out a book that covers a 4 hour span when the previous books in the series cover a season of year if not more?The series has come to a crawl in what looks like a case of a complex story getting the upper hand on its writer. Maybe someday they'll remove this book from the series and new readers will never notice. Maybe it'll become a long prologue they insert into the next book."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Right of the bat I would have to say the first 6 or 7 books of this series have been some of my favourite fantasy writing ever.

I really wish I could say the same thing after reading it.How anyone can write so many pages and advance the plot so little amazes me - it really does.. Frankly the best thing you can do it NOT read this - it will only frustrate you.Go and get New Spring - I quite enjoyed this book. It might not deal with the main plot, but it certainly doesn't contribute any LESS to the ongoing story than Crossroads of Twilight.

They succeeded. Now Jordan writes a book that focuses on everyone else's reactions to the cleansing of saidin. Because of this, very little happens in this book and the plot suffers for it. Furthermore, Jordan becomes even more descriptive than usual, as if he felt he was a nineteenth century author getting paid by the word. Crossroads of Twilight is the nadir of the series.A plurality of the book focuses on Egwene. Almost nothing happens until the very end.Perrin/Faile - Nothing really happens. Lots of descriptions.Mat - Nothing really happens. Lots of descriptions.Elayne - Nothing at all happens. Lots of descriptions.Rand - only appears for part of one chapter and in the epilogue. Nothing happens.The rest of the book is taken up by POVs from people you don't care about. Although there is one scene that focuses on Alviarin that is pretty good.For this book Nynaeve does not appear and for the first time there are no sniffs from her.

Many people who I got started on the series loved it as well, but one by one they got frustrated and gave up somewhere around books 5, 6, or 7. Still, I stuck it out. I could understand the root of their complaints, but I guess I'm just stubborn.Reading book 9, I started to feel the frustration, but at the end there was a big event and I thought to myself, &quot;Okay, here we go--now things are going to start happening!&quot; I couldn't have been more wrong. Book 10 was like a creative writing exercise. Descriptive? Yes! Jordan's attention to detail and word painting has always been a highlight for me, making his worlds vivid in my mind. But descriptions are not enough where there is no substance, no story.My friends all say that Jordan has been padding this series since book 4 (I recall hearing that he originally intended it to be a trilogy). Maybe so. But when the reader could go from book 8 to book 11 without missing anything, it has gotten excessive. I learned more about what might happen next from reading the glossary (which, by the way, is frustratingly incomplete compared to the earlier books--at least I used to be able to remind myself who people were with a quick turn to the back of the book).I pre-ordered this book as soon as I was able.

Maybe the 'WOT' [one may insert 'waste' or 'wheel' for the 'W' at your wont]will make that 'Turn' back to respectability and return to the roots of its former greatness as evidenced in the authors first five novels in this epic. we shall see..but definitely not in hardcover...sorry Tor."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Another 700 page book where nothing happens.

In fact, I am no longer in college. Come to think of it, I'm pushing THIRTY (!!!!!!) and this story continues to unfold. The tragedy. If this series had been but a moderate success, I am sure that it would have been wrapped up (with a bow) by book six or seven. The author has lost his handle on this story, and on my interest. Though it pains me to declare it, I give up on this series. What a waste."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"It's tempting to compare the latest installment of the Wheel of Time series to Seinfeld, the show that professes to be about &quot;nothing&quot;. While doing so would be an exaggeration, it would be fair to say that COT could have done its job in many less pages and after much less wait. To be fair, RJ touched on virtually all major characters. To be honest, he didn't give them anything interesting to do. For instance, more than 130 pages and 5 chapters are devoted to Elayne trying on dresses, taking hot baths, and fretting over her pregnancy (and other momentous events in Caemlyn). By the time RJ segued into the next character, I was left to wonder if what I had just read had to do with anything. Similarly, two chapters were devoted to Perrin buying grain and supplies for his army. Come on RJ, buying grain? After the cliff-hanger ending of Winter's Heart, I eagerly looked forward to seeing what Rand would do next. Much to my chagrin, Rand was not mentioned until page 500-something. The few chapters concerning him were all too brief, and he did nothing that merited excitement . With such prodigal use of space, it's no wonder that the pace is even more &quot;glacial&quot; than in previous books. If you think that the last four books were slow, wait till you read COT. By the end of the book, Mat was barely out of Ebou Dar, Perrin was no closer to rescuing Faile (maybe that's a blessing in disguise because frankly I find her annoying), Egwene and the rebel Aes Sedai were still besieging Tar Valon, Rand was sitting on his hands again with Cadsuane shadowing him night and day, Elayne was doing whatever it was that she did in Caemlyn, and we were no closer to Tarmon Gai'don than we had ever been.I'm well aware that this installment supposedly sets the background for the next and final 2 books. The title implies that momentous decisions made here would determine how future events would unfold. So the rebel Aes Sedai's decisionconcerning the Black Tower, Perrin's decision concerning the Seanchan, and Rand's decision concerning the Seanchan would have serious repercussions. In fact, throughout the book were sprinkled abundant clues of plans already set or to be set in motion. However, it soon became apparent that RJ had no intention to reveal those plans in COT, except for a tantalizing hint in the epilogue. The epilogue! At best guess, readers will find out in the next installment, which would come out in, oh, 2006 or so. It's amazing that in nearly 700 pages RJ could manage to reveal so little, or at least so little that would satisfy readers. Even RJ's sly, tongue-in-cheek comments and remarks that used to amuse me so much were growing stale. And several times I got the nagging feeling that he was repeating himself. I used to think that when Tarmon Gai'don finally comes around it would be sad because the series would be over. I never thought that it would be ... boring. To be honest, I've had more fun reading the theory posts and predictions on wotmania.com. Perhaps RJ should consider changing his oft-used comment, RAFO - Read And Find Out, to RAFA - Read And Fall Asleep."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"A rich tapestry is not enough, and Robert Jordan has been laying it on thick now for 3 books. Randland has been an ingenious invention but I simply think Mr. Jordan has gotten carried away with himself. The world and concepts of history, race, factions, magic, evil, and chance have been awesome, but he is abyssimal at developing characters in a meaningful way without being tedious, repetitive and boring. I will just give one example, Mr. Jordan seems to think that discussing the subterfuge of the various Aes Sedai factions with everyone trying to guess everyone else's motive ad nauseum is interesting. It got uninteresting a long time ago, and I don't think this book enriched that part of the story at all despite how many pages were dedicated to it. It was roughly page 540 before Rand appears in the book, and I don't care how rich the weave is, I want the main protagonist to be featured as moving the story along.I also can't figure out why he couldn't bang out this book in a year. Nothing happened. And if this is an improved re-write of earlier drafts I shudder to think how bad the previous were.I obviously will keep reading Book 11 to see what happens next but I guarantee I will never re-read Book 10.I can put the richest caviar spread on a piece of toast to enjoy, but if I forget the toast then there is nothing of substance for the caviar to sit on so I can get into my mouth.

They were fairly well written, entertaining, and even at times exciting. If you have not read this series yet, the first 5 books are defininatly worth the time. The series begins to slow down at that point. Most of the action is talked about after the fact, described by characters debreifing themselves or others. By book eight, the characters have lost all depth they have had, and have become flat and lifeless caricatures. By book 10, I found myself hoping for several of them to be written out of the series altogether. Instead, the author continues to add new supporting characters who have little purpose and add no life to the story. If you have not started the series yet, I would suggest waiting until it is completed before starting it. I think the level of frustration expressed by most of the reviewers should be a warning to you.If you are already caught up in the series, and feel trapped by a need to see it through, I would suggest not buying each individual book. Rent it from the library or borrow from a friend. If Jordan follows in his current habit, the first half of the next book will be a summarization of the last, so you won't miss anything. The second half will be a prelude to the next, so you really only have to read every other book! I am glad I haven't wasted the cover price on the last two books."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I always thought of WOT as not an especially great series, but a good one at least. I have never really liked any of the characters, they are all mistrustful and arrogant which gets very annoying, and the descriptions are needlessly long and superfluous which gets very boring. What I have liked about the series is the world Jordan has created and the politics. I enjoy the machinations of the characters, if not the characters themselves. Jordan sets up interesting conflicts between characters even if they never seem to get resloved. In any case, with all the things I didn't like about WOT, I still found the first nine books of the series interesting enough to keep reading it. Even in previous books like Path of Daggers which many have panned because nothing happened to advance the plot, I didn't mind because still enough interesting stuff happened between the characters. That is not so with Crossroads Of Twilight. With this book I have given up on the series. It is totally unnecessary. When people say nothing happens in this book, they mean NOTHING HAPPENS. All you have are the endless boring descriptions and the thoughts of annoying characters. No plot advancement, no interesting conflicts, no resolutions, nothing.

Jordan really can't do characterization, can he? His characters feel like playing pieces he's moving around on a game board. Anyway, for a *good* fantasy series with convincing, well-drawn characters, one that actually makes progress from book to book instead of going around in circles, both plot-wise and with regards to character growth, check out Michelle West's Sun Sword books (The Broken Crown, The Uncrowned King, The Shining Court, and The Sea of Sorrows.)

And what I got for that wait was a substantially tedious account of the reaction of every female who could channel to Rand and Nynaeve's cleansing of saidin at the end of &quot;Winter's Heart&quot;, the ninth book of the series. It was like reading an account of how every person on a crowded bus reacts to a ... passing of gas. Those of us who have been following this series for years had a right to expect better from a 2 year effort from Mr. Jordan.The book is approximately 750 pages long, and 600 of those were literally painful to read. Endless descriptions of what every woman in a room was wearing, how tall they were, how they wear their hair, what kind of accent they had, ..., well, I think you get the picture.The book is not completely without substance, however. For the first time in several installments (mind you, with the gaps between installments lengthening, it's oftentimes difficult to remember the myriad of plot lines) we get to see some interesting development of Mat Cauthon's character. His relationship with the Daughter of the Nine Moons is beginning to coalesce and is becoming one of the more captivating story lines. In addition, Egwene gets herself into a spot of trouble at the tail end of the book. These are the only two bones thrown to us by an author with much more to offer than that.Let's all hope that Book 11 is more fulfilling, and more timely, than Book 10. With the investment we've already made (this series spans decades, and each book is a double-digit investment of hours in the reading), we, the devoted fans of WoT, deserve it."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Robert Jordan has lost his writing edge. The action packed political twisters that his first books were are just a memory now. As more and more of his books come out, his writing has slowed down. Crossroads of Twilight, a 800-plus page book focuses on what all the other characters in the book were doing when Rand was cleansing saidan in book # nine. As those of you who read Winters Heart know, from the time Rand and Nyneave link and when Cadsuane packs away the access keys, few more then twenty pages have passed. So how, one asks, does the author write an 800 page book (Crossroads of Twilight) around these events? By using tedious descriptions that go for pages. I feel that all the information that was interesting or worth knowing could be consolidated into a 25 page prologue for book #11. There are no fight scenes, no love scenes, no revealing discussions. The best part of the book was probably at the end, with Egwene...(I won't give it away)The 100 page prologue was an adjunct of the book. Come to think of it, the book was an adjunct of the series. Not only that, if you do read the book, Rand does not even appear until page 657. Even including the epilogue, it is a strech to say he is in the book for a full twenty pages! The main character! This would be fine if the other characters were doing interesting things, BUT THEY ARE NOT! I would advise everyone to wait for book # 11. I still have faith in RJ, but if number 11 continues in this fashion, i might just give up."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I've read this saga from the beginning and Mr Jordan is no Tolkien! My god; who ARE all these characters and why should we care how they drink their tea and what hairstyles they wear?

I want my 5+ hours I spent slogging thru to the end back!"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"No need to go into details as to why I didn't care for this book--plenty of people have voiced my thoughts. I just wanted to add my ranking to others."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"It is hard to critique anything that Jordan has done, because even when the pace of his books is crawling he still writes interesting stories, sound plot points and believable characters. That said, I feel that I also must echo what the majority of his fandom believes; things are slipping from bad to worse. After reading the last four books, one gets the sense that one of two things is happening: either he is losing control of the stories and finds himself unable to wrap things up, or he is milking his readership. I am an optimist so I will choose the premier. Is this book, Jordan has done everything possible to take the reader out of the story. Most of the action scenes are related in a quasi flashback daguerrotype. But the most frustrating thing is that the story seems to have stalled out. Jordan has insisted with regards to his stories and characters &quot;that he is an old testament god, with his finger firmly on his characters.&quot; Well, Jehovah, could you please get going! Readers disappointed with the slow pace of other books in the series would be better advised to wait until this comes out in paperback. Worth reading only for a few minimal scenes. This was rock bottom; things can only get better!"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I will say little of this novel itself, and focus instead on its author, Robert Jordan. This man almost single-handedly represents what is wrong with the fantasy genre today. It's not because he lacks talent - it's because he has talent but betrays it in favor of the all mighty dollar, and at the cost of his loyal fans....P>If you want good fantasy (which \\"The Wheel of Time\\" started out to be), turn your sights to George R.R. Martin and his \\"Song of Ice & Fire\\" series. THAT is how it's done."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"When I first started reading this series I enjoyed the first books because of the colorful characters, the fighting that went on, and way the characters worked through problems. This book added very little to the plot, very little action, (1 person lost a hand and one was killed), and was in general boring.You could skip this book entirely and not miss a thing from the series."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I heartily agree with the vast majority of OVER 600 reviews given here. I have read this series since the beginning and am a big fantasy/sci-fi fan. I am also highly educated and do not have a short attention span. Not only is this a bad book with no movement, repetitive drivel about clothing, customs and fashion, and an almost misogynistic treatment of women, but I remembered around page 470 that I'd promised myself not to buy the next WoT book for the same reasons. I'm extremely disappointed that I have stuck with this author through 7000 or more pages, and this ... excuse for a next installment is all I have to show for it. I hope I remember my pledge to not buy the NEXT book. And the millions Robert Jordan is getting for each of these \\"books\\" guarantees he could care less what his fans think."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I don't know what is going on in Mr. Jordan's life, but I hope he can pull this series out of the nose-dive it has taken. I like a complex and intriguing tale as much as the next person, but tWoT has gotten a bit out of hand. The numbers of characters (in different locales) are such that you can't spend enough time with the ones you like. On top of that, when you finally come to a chapter containing a character you care about, they mostly just eat, take a bath, or talk about needing to make a decision on some obscure point. The rest of the time reading is spent trying to remember who one of the hundreds of minor characters diffused throughout the book is. With each page I got more frustrated. When I got to the mid-500's, my hope rose for an instant, only to come crashing back down. I'm no writer, but I know what I like as a reader, and I didn't get it with this book.My hopes are that this book was written in order to bring the major characters back into one or two groups in the next book. Then maybe they can accomplish something worth reading about. I will read the whole series, because I have come this far already, but I have come to expect very little based on the last few books.Mr. Jordan, if you happen to come by this review, I am certainly glad you began this series. Whatever it is you have to do to breathe life back into it, please do it. Take as much time as you need. I don't much like waiting for things, but I would rather read good work than rushed worked."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This seems to be an introduction or preview to Book 11. However, if it takes as long for Jordan to publish the next as it did for this one, I am afraid this is another reader he has lost but then after reading this one, maybe he doesn't care about the readers."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Once again, I was back on the Jordan roller coaster with \\"Crossroads\\". After reading \\"Winter's Heart\\", I was hoping the momentum would finally continue for more than one book, but, true to form, the series has AGAIN slowed down.As for the plot (I use that term loosely), here's what's going on:Mat is still fleeing from the Seanchan, Perrin is still hunting for the Shaido, who still hold his wife Faile captive, Camelyn and Tar Valon are under siege, the Aes Sedai are considering an alliance with the Black Tower, Rand is pondering a truce with the Seanchan, there is a face-off between Egwene and her forces, who are laying siege to Elaida's forces inside the White Tower, and finally Tuon, the Daughter of the Nine Moons and the one who Mat is destined to marry, has being concealed by Valan Luca's travelling show.There are many plots and sub-plots going on at the same time, but none are really developed fully. As in the previous book, Perrin is still trying to rescue Faile, but Jordan never really pursues this storyline to completion. It is just left to \\"wither on the vine\\". The jumping from one story to the next left me confused and I actually forgot what I was reading during some passages. I felt Rand's basic omission from this book was a mistake, and I found it difficult to follow what he was actually doing when he was mentioned. The same goes for Mat.I'm glad to be done with this series for the time being. I realize that book 11 is due to be released in the near future, and I can only hope that Robert Jordan has drastically changed his writing style in this new book. Otherwise, I'll have to plow through another huge volume that has no real sense of direction."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I struggled through book 9, it was a roaring adventure compared to this one. Honestly, you might as well skip to page 600 and read the last few chapters. All Jordan does is continue to muddy the waters and drag out the story line on what has grown to too many characters. I have heard he plans to write 12 in all. Fortunately, he won't get any more of my money as I intend to wait for my public library to buy the books. All I can say is the next book better &quot;pump up the volume&quot; to get us closer to closure."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Mr. Jordan...for the love of...I know you intend this series to be your life's work but please don't making reading it, mine. The last 3 books have become tedious to the point of me only reading it the bathroom. I read the first 5 one after another with great delight and interest. Now you write in 500 pages what you could in 100. If I hear about mulled and spiced wine one more time I may do something drastic. PLEASE stop with the enless desciptions of landscapes and clothes. ADVANCE THE STORY!"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"As with all the other reviews, we have seen a downward spiral in this series. Each book gets progressively slower and shorter seemingly to make the series ongoing. Unfortunately I am getting the feeling that robert Jordan is doing this for money since each book ends up on NY times bestsellers list. I hope it is not true!!! Even if he ends story, any future books will sell Huge!!!I also see that his writing style is backfiring on him. Attention to detail and detailed descriptions are Robert Jordan's trademark, but in a small, clearly defined world where characters travel back and forth between the same locations, his detailed desrciption becomes very tiresome.For example: why does Jordan feel the need to decribe in vivid detail every part of Perrin's camp EVERY time he leaves and returns?!!! He does this probably 5 times in about fifty pages!!!In retrospect, if you think back carefully on the whole book you will realize that these repeat descriptions make up almost the whole book. I have never seen another book, let alone another Robert Jordan book with less dialogue than this one!!! There are some chapters where we don't actually see any characters for the first 3 or 4 pages!!!Mr. Jordan needs to do some reflecting and rethink his writing strategy!!! Readers are getting fed up with being strung along!!!Compared to the first six books, Crossroads of twilight is Atrociousand does nothing to continue the series. I am sorry to feel this way since I have a lot of respect for Robert Jordan and I read his old Conan books well before anyone knew what the Wheel of Time was."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I first began reading the Wheel of Time series when I was about 15 and read all the books which had been written in this series in about a year. Since then, I have waited with baited breath for each installment of the best contemporary fantasy series.For me the series really kicked off with &quot;The Great Hunt&quot; (Volume 2) but has decayed after the 5th volume.&quot;Crossroads of Twilight&quot; is probably the worst in the series. Aside from the abundant spelling and grammatical errors, I find it difficult to believe that it took Robert Jordan (who has proven himself to be a genius) so long to come out with this huge volume and nothing happens in it. It is simply a compendium of meeting after meeting after meeting. That's all that happens! What is Jordan thinking that these meetings are supposed to impress the readers with how pivotal they are???I remember one of the recent volumes where I read about 200 pages of it and all that had happened was that a group of people had gone down into a valley to meet another group of people.There is absolutely no sense of adventure in these latest installments which is a shame as this is what made the series so absorbing to begin with.I think either Robert Jordan is getting the wrong advice from his agent (in which case he needs to fire his agent) or he is not listening to reason. Either way, someone needs to tell him the way things are and he needs to listen otherwise he is well on the road to ruining a masterpiece.Still, as a real testament to how he has captivated his audience, I will still be looking forward to the next installment nonetheless..."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Apparently Jordan has to produce a book every year or so regardless if he has anything written or not ..

Robert Jordan opened my eyes to the world of fantasy books with his \\"Eye of the World.\\" It seems that the last few books has showed that the well of his imagination has begun to dry up, but the ink in his pen has not. Like many of the others who have reviewed this book, I find that he blabs on and on about nothing. He doesn't introduce anything new and exciting in this book. His characters, plot, and imagination have stagnated. Like another Amazon.com reviewer, I myself ask, \\"Why was this written?\\""},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This book was incredibly disappointing. This series is going downhill hard. Each of the last few books was a long (sometimes very long) setup followed by an exciting ending. This one is the same except it lacked the exciting ending. In a nutshell, nothing happened. I am eager to see how the series turns out, but Jordan doesn't appear interested in advancing the plot at all. He appears to be writing for the money by seeing how long he can drag the series out. Winter's Heart gave me hope that this series was picking up again. Crossroads of Twilight crushed those hopes."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"The first 300 or so pages of the book are worthless: Endless and useless details that barely touch upon the main story lines (yes story lines) after waiting years to pick up where book 9 left off.

One thing about Jordan's writing is that it's all about setting things up.. so that you can imagine what was the situation like and the scenario of the places involves.. One thing that I agree with this book story line is that it tries to cool down from the last book climax on cleansing the saidin.. it's a huge thing.. so we have to know the impact of that to the rest of the world.. If Jordan make it all in a paragraph to let in some new climax stuff.. we wouldn't have know what's in Egwene's mind, what did the Ashaman thinks.. are they afraid with sensing that someone far away are using the one power so much they could sense it thousand of miles away.. It's a good setup for the next scene.. the ending is good.. I never like Egwene anyway.. hahhahahabut thinking about the next book probably came out in another 2 years.. the wait are frustrating.."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I just finished this book. I'll admit I probably wouldn't have read it if I had to pay for it, but I work at a bookstore and so got to read it for free. I read it on my lunch breaks and it still took me a couple of months to chew through. This is the first book in probably five or six years by Jordan that I have read, and I was a bit disappointed as to how far his prose has decayed. I won't restate the typical and completely justified complaints regarding this book, and if almost 2,000 reviews averaging only 1.5 stars doesn't convince you, then perhaps the one slightly new point I bring to this may.I noticed in this book that practically none of the plot elements from the first couple of books are even mentioned, much less dealt with in detail. For instance, does anyone remember when that guy that went insane over the dagger (can't remember his name, because Jordan hasn't dealt with him in approx ten years) crucified the mordraal (sp?)? Wasn't that just the most powerful and wicked scene painted on paper? Weren't the mordraals kind of creepy and cool? Whatever happened to trollocs? Remember when Rand grabbed his (step?)father's sword out of his cabin and fought off those trollocs in the middle of the night? Wasn't that exciting? Remember what a stud Lan was and how you totally wanted to be like him? Wasn't the ogier culture kind of interesting? Does anybody even think about these plot elements anymore?I'm just bringing up these points because I noticed in this latest book that none of those elements exist. Nothing really exciting or interesting happens. In fact, nothing happens at all. Now, don't get me wrong. Not every book needs to be a rollicking sword-and-sorcery amusement park ride. But this IS the fantasy genre, not history or modern literature (not particularly known for its action sequences). It's ok if Jordan no longer likes the use of steel or magic to solve plot problems, but those problems STILL need to be solved, at least in some way. He also needs to do so in a rapid enough manner (maybe over the course of one 600 page book?) to keep even the most dedicated of reader's attention. Frankly, none of us are the most attentive of readers, if we compare ourselves to, say, 16th century French nobility. Perhaps they had the time to slog through what is, at this point, NEARLY 6,000 PAGES OF PROSE. In my life, with my schedule, I just need a little more than court intrigue and silly one-dimensional caricatures to keep me interested."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Like the sundry other reviewers, I've been a Wheel of Time fan since the opening pages of &quot;Eye of the World.&quot; Sadly, the series has experienced a sharp decline in quality, and unfortunately attempts to make it up with an ungodly amount of descriptive quantity. Book 10 is the pinnacle: instead of the vague sense that RJ has lost it, Book 10 either screams, &quot;Stall as much as possible until I resolve the plot to myself, or: I need a new yacht--let's write Book 10.&quot; The absolute repetitive and unimportant description (do we really need to know the minutiae of livery of every common house servant, or that Elayne drank &quot;watered-down wine&quot; before she slept, EVERY MOMENT?!) truly tests the let's-watch-paint-dry patience of even the most enthusiastic Wheel of Time fan. I used to wait anxiously for the arrival of the next book, but lately there's only been a vague sense to pick these incredibly boring books up. I'll admit, since I started it, I'll probably finish it, which is what RJ wants, but I certainly get the sense that I'm being an idiot for doing so."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"When I picked this up, I actually had some hope it would end the series. But this series is ending with a whimper, not a bang. This once great series has become a tedious, boring mess. I promised, given all the time I invested here, to give it one more book. This was it. I'm off the train. You CAN say that this book is a little better than tedious, rambling three or so that preceded it, although that is certainly faint praise. I can't remember any more exactly where the series went off track. It seems so long ago. But at a certain point, what was the finest Sci Fantasy series ever written (exceeding Goodkind's Sword of Truth, making even Stephen Donaldson and Tolkein look to their laurels) has come crashing down into nothingness. It is now simply horrible. It commits the worst of all offenses: it is utterly boring. As it became clear no ending would occur here, I found it harder and harder to finish this. At least this time the subplots are major ones, which helps. But as before, they ramble and there is far too much irrelevant and boring discourse. In addition, this has two major flaws. One, as has been the case, and as a major reason why the series has been crippled, Rand fades into irrelevance in this book yet again. In the last few books, he hardly appears, which seems frankly amazing, a monumental misjudgment. He does not even appear here until it is 75% done; and then only briefly. That means by definition that all the plots are subplots. It's what derails the linear plotting in the books. The most charismatic and important character never appears. On the other hand, the women, who are surely the most annoying group in the history of fiction, get more and more space andtime. (Could the series end by having all Aes Sedai killed?) So, biggest problem here: Eliminating your main character--and therefore your main plot. It is a critical error that this series has not survived, turning the last few books into boring, tedious works that have no discernible plot and dwell too much on lesser characters, and details. The second critical error is that it seems fairly obvious what happens next. Want to know what the next book will do? Rand will conclude the alliance with the Seanchan. The price of sealing it will be Matt's marriage to Tuon, and Matt will be royalty of the Seanchan. Together, the Seanchan and Rand will take out the Shaido. The White Tower and Black will align and mutually bond each other, after a battle in which Taim is defeated. Thus united, the forces will eventually head to the final battle. I may not have it all right---but there are some awfully big clues here that aren't so subtle. And there's not a whole lot of suspense. The final problem with this tedious book and the derailing of the series is that Jordan seems incapable of ever using the device of the scene cut-away. He has to spend page after tedious page going through every tedious explanation of how THIS happens or THAT occurs, or THIS is explained. This is frankly literary incompetence, nothing less. By a competent author, this series could have been concluded in 6 books--and would be vastly better for it. It now stands as a total disaster, one of the great disappointments in fiction. If you haven't started it...don't. It will break your heart. If you have---give up now. No point lining Jordan's pockets while he milks this series that is going nowhere. BTW, according to the end flap, Jordan's next book will be a Wheel PREQUEL--meaning there will be a long wait for the next book that plays back into the series plotlines or actually finishes things up (if EVER). What another monumental misjudgment. A prequel. Just what we needed."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I started reading tWOT back in the day when it was 6 volumes, thinking that it was complete and finished. It certainly didn't occur to me it was half-way (or most likely even less than that). 3000 pages or whatever it was at the time really seemed enough for any story IMO.As most WOT readers have noticed, things really go downhill from book 4. Obviously I was expecting this book to be slow as well and it is, very. I have the distinct impression that the first 400 pages or so cover a single day. Don't expect that to be an action-packed day, with battles and lots of power-wielding, it's all sniffing, walking around and pondering about woolheadedness.Others have noted that #10 forms a basis for the next ones, but that is just like #9 was a basis for #10 and #8 for #9 - doesn't mean all the details in #8 were necessary for the plot development in #9 or #10 (no jokes about &quot;What plot development?&quot; please). a) There's no need for all the minuscule details from the last 5 books and probably the next 5 and b) if this much detail really was needed, nobody is going to remember it by the time it is needed because it's simply too long ago in terms of both time and pages.It's not just detail, it's repetition in detail too - and not merely the sniffing, but really big pieces of text.Every time Egwene walks around the camp and sometimes even when she's sitting in her unstable chair (that wobbly chair probably has more text devoted to it in this book than Rand and the Seanchan put together - please just give Egwene a decent chair and get on with it!), RJ explains how all the apprentices don't recognize her as the Mother and how the Two Rivers girls can't come to grips with her not coming out to play with them any more. He could get on with the story and spare us the tedious repetitions if he just wrote &quot;and then she went to the tent where the Hall was gathering&quot;, but no, we must really understand that she needs to rearrange her shawl so that everyone sees the stripes and we must know exactly how many novices stare at her and by the way her head hurts a lot and it also hurt yesterday and the day before but not the day before that and nobody knows a cure etc.Every time Siuan enters the picture, we read *again* how powerful she used to be and how everyone makes her fetch tea now.Similar repetition is to be expected for other characters, leaving virtually no room for Rand or the Seanchan in all those hundreds of pages (which is probably the reason Rand doesn't whine about the dead Maidens), despite a hint somewhere that something exciting will happen in the very distant future. Nynaeve makes only a very small appearance, I'm not even sure whether she gets to sniff.So, is the book worth reading? Judged on its own, purely on its own merits, it's a bad book, to be avoided at all costs.Why do I give it two stars instead of one? Because if you've already read the previous 9 books, it's a relatively small investment in terms of time and/or money. Which was what I'd have said for books 5-9 too. Every one is just a small step compared to the previous ones, so why not read it? Yes, it's a flimsy argument in its favor, but it's all I can come up with. I also have given up hope that the pace will pick up in the next book, because I've been hoping that for a very long time now.If you're new to the series, I have two pieces of advice:1. Don't start reading until it's finished (it may take quite a while, since RJ has now started writing books dragging the beginning of the series back in time instead of giving the series a closure, which is what it badly needs by now). There's a real and ever growing risk that RJ will die before the series ends and leave you stranded with 12 books on your shelf but still only halfway the story, roughly where he could have been in book 6. There's also the possibility that he'll lose track of all that's happening and give up (if he hasn't already - his continuous claiming that he really does know what will happen till the very last page sounds suspicious given how little of that alleged knowledge has made it in the last six books).2. Never buy hard-cover editions. Wait for the cheaper paperbacks when buying new RJ books. The thrill and suspence brought by new books in the series are not even really worth the price of paperbacks, so you won't be missing a lot if you buy the latest sequel (or prequel) of this endless saga a few months after its initial release."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"In my opinion, anyone who gives this book a positive review is in the pay of the author or Tor, a close friend of Jordan, or doesn't know good fantasy/sci-fi when he or she reads it. This book is absolutely the worse sequel that I have ever read. Jordan is just making the story more complex and prolonged without adding anything of value. I would start to question whether the same man who started this series is still involved. If he is, then, he just doesn't care about us any more. All involved in this series should be ashamed of themselves. At least Wurtz said she was sorry when one of her hardbound books was made into two paperbacks. Jordan hasn't said anything about why he is doing this to those who have been loyal to him for years. Well, I am getting off this merry-go-round right now. I am not buying another book in this series, and I invite anyone who cares about the integrity of the genre to do the same."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Way back in 1994, I noticed the Robert Jordan \\"Wheel of Time\\" novels. There were three out at the time and I thought to myself: \\"A complete trilogy! How convenient. I can't stand to read a book and realize there are two sequels yet to come. I think I'll buy them all, read them back to back and be done with them.\\" I read them, enjoyed them, and was much chagrined when I reached the end of the third novel only to realize that the series wasn't done. I would have to wait for a fourth novel.I was stoked when the fourth novel came out. Finally, I could find out how the series ended. And then I reached the end of that novel. And then the fifth. And the sixth. And seventh...Well, the 10th book in the series was finally released this month, and I hate to say it, but this series may never end.Don't get me wrong. I've enjoyed the novels, for the most part. They were and are original, creative, and incredibly detailed. There-in lies the problem. After 9 novels, there have been so many detailed characters, places, events, etc. that, unless you go back and re-read the previous novels, you don't remember exactly how everyone relates to one another. Of course, you can assume that all of the women are stony harridans or doe-eyed rabbits, and all the men are frustrated and harrassed by all the women, and each is more powerful and dangerous than the next, but at least he deals with women, and that is something for fantasy novels. While I did enjoy the novels, I have no intention of spending the next three months catching up before reading the latest. Jordan also feels that each major character needs to have his or her own story told, which is fine, but Jordan is still introducing new characters and story lines.In fact, he is so busy introducing new characters and story lines that you get the feeling that he's forgotten where he was going in the first place. The book is totally stagnant and there is no movement. It even takes a few steps back! Nothing happens in the entire book. Nothing. I mean it. No exaggeration. If you read the 9th book in the series and want to skip this one and pick up with the 11th when it is out, you won't miss anything. Really. I mean it. If you don't believe me, read the book. All the plot lines are left essentially where they were when the 9th book ended, and some of those didn't even make it into the 10th book. It's like the book was written almost entirely as filler, a means of extending the series without having to do anything like start to wrap things up. I even think that maybe Jordan inserted this book simply to make more money off the series. Hey, if you can sell millions of copies of each book, why would you ever want to end it? It's a money machine! People want to know how it turns out at the end! People have invested a lot of time to get this far, why would they turn away now? Who knows? Maybe he just wrote it to fulfill contractual obligations or something like that.All-in-all, this is by far the worst novel in the series. I was very disappointed, because I do genuinely like the series. After reading this book, I am seriously debating just giving the rest of the series a miss, or picking up the remaining novels in paperback when the series is truly-and-for-real finished. I do enjoy the series, but I was offended by the latest shoddy offering, especially after forking over $...bucks for the hardcover. If you really want to read the novel, wait until the paperback is out, or get it at the library."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"After completing my newly programmed software designed to cross-index all of the WOT characters, plot entries, linked to page number and volume description, I realized I had a serious problem. My computer lacked the power needed to complete this task. Which in some ways RJ can probably relate to. How you can take a world of such promise and depth and drive it into the gibberish wasteland that is the WOT now I cannot guess. But I would venture a premise that his ego has outrun his talent just like my patience has outran my desire to see the end of the WOT as he views it. Good luck spending all of our hard earned cash that we deposited into your account of &quot;let's see how long they will go before they revolt from my pure tyrannical word processing ability&quot;. Thanks for the first five books. Chow."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I noticed today that I've been reading the Wheel of Time for something like ten years.And that's roughly how long this book seemed to take to read: a frozen ten years, in which precisely nothing happened. Everyone who's been reading Jordan for any length of time can tell you that he's been on a steady decline after such a stellar beginning.Somewhere around book four or five he realized that he was a one-trick pony and decided to drag it out. Hell, maybe he got used to the royalties and was too afraid of butchering the cash cow. The recently released and entirely unnecessary prologue 'New Spring'(a planned TRILOGY of prologues, no less) is more than enough evidence of this.I won't be spending any more of my money on the literary equivalent of watching paint dry. I no longer care what happens. Die, Rand, die.Way to lose the touch, Jordan. Just take a peek at the couple thousand other reviews of this heap of trash if you don't believe what I'm saying. Hint: alienating your audience is not a smooth move."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I hate to pick on reviewers, but seriously, who could possibly rate this four or five stars? Heck, two would be a stretch. Many argue that this is an epic, and needs to be &quot;appreciated&quot; or some such junk. Who are you trying to kid? This book stinks so much that it should NEVER have been written. There are strong indications it was given only a cursory look by the editor. Any sane editor would have told RJ to cut out the fluff--which in this case would be about 600 pages. Stephen King once wrote that the art of describing is a fine line between putting in enough information to give the reader a general clue, but not so much that we get bogged down in the minute details. RJ needs to learn from this. I think the essential problem is that despite several good ideas, he really only has about four or five character types spread out among about 150 main and pseudo-characters. Even if you are a defender and fan of long, boring, pointless books, as a few here seem to be, you cannot ignore the fact that Nynaeve/Elayne/any Aes Sedai/Kin/Sea Folk/Seanchan are ALL alike! Arrogant, stubborn, and generally stupidly written. I am tossing this one into the trash where it belongs. I urge you to laugh at RJ's defenders and join me in not buying any more junk."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"What I once loved to read I can no longer tolerate. I haven't bought the last two books (I swore that Path of Daggers debacle was the last time I gave my money to RJ) but read them in the bookstore. If this is the same man who wrote the first five books in this series, he has turned his creativity from entertainment to a sadism. A less enjoyable book may not be possible. Anyone capable of such a melodramatic go nowhere marathon should be hailed as the Antistoryteller of our time. Here's a tip; Three books (going on four) and Elayne is still trying to get the Lion Throne!?! It should have taken One Sentence: 'Elayne arrived in Andor at claimed her Mother's Title'. Or better, 'Elayne went to get the throne but was quickly killed along with Faile'."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"....That will never end...I think Robert Jorden is hoping that he will die first, so that he does not have to think of an ending..So add a few more characters, and a few more shawls and you can make this last well into your 80's..with any luck, guys like me who have been around since the begining will be long dead..that way, you can let the stupid Wheel of Time kill us all before it ends!I could give you some of my installation and computer software documentation from work to slip into the book...that could use up a good 200 pages!\\"Make sure all services are stopped\\" Rand Exclaimed!\\"Yes, Then reboot!\\" said the Asha'man!\\"Watch any error on bootup, after log in, check the event veiwer!\\" Cautioned Lan as he checked Technet.Sure...it would hold the user in suspense until the someone tugs a braid!P.S.--I am ready to cut of that braid if Nynaeve pulls it one more time!!!"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Typically, I refrain from piling on additional layers of criticism and negative feedback when it's painfully obvious that a novel didn't exactly win its target audience over, but in this instance I'm forced to make an exception. This book is awful. Really truly awful. It's perhaps the worst thing I have ever forced myself to read. Virtually nothing happens to advance the plot toward its resolution. In fact, most of the characters spend the story reacting to an event that occurred at the end of the last book. Several reviewers have mentioned that the pace of this series has slowed in recent volumes. Well, they're being too kind. The pace of this series was always a bit lethargic to begin with, in my opinion, but now it seems to have ground to a shuddering halt. It's been so long since this series has fundamentally engaged me that I can't even remember what is happening in the story. There are so many plots and subplots that I have trouble even remembering who the protagonist is. I guess it's that Rand fellow. Or is it? Many of you are probably wondering then why it is that I continue to read these books? Asking that question is like asking a herion addict why he continues to use drugs. WOT started out good. Decent characters, a phenomenal world, believable conflicts and a tittilating mystery. Good enough to get me hooked. But now, after this travesty, and - adding insult to injury - a Prequel?- I've lost all interest in the series. With all of you dear readers as my witnesses, I swear to not pick up another copy of a WOT book- at least not until RJ finishes the series. Then and only then will I even consider reading another one of these books. And by then, I'll probably be too old and senile to care one way or another. That's assuming, of course, that RJ actually lives long enough to finish the thing."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I purchased this book without reading any reviews, so it was with much relief that I saw the other reviews. This book isn't very good at all. It is dense, impenetrable, rambling. Etc. You can skip pages of dialog, and still not miss anything of consequence, why? There is so little of consequence in the book, you don't worry about missing anythingI have felt for some time that most of the characters were completely unlikable. If this wasn't an Amazon.com review I would use stronger language, in times past they would almost all be boors. Men and women both. I imagine if they gave the horses more lines they would be boorish too. How can they continue to fail to communicate? They make an art of it? The situations are so improbable, for example the windbags, you know the women who sail on ships. Many of the Aes Sedai, Aes is misspelled in the book by the way. I think it should have too s's. They talk all the time and never communicate, The Ash'Aaman again misspelled. Two s's no h. there is no let up. If these people are the saviors, it is clear why the Forsaken are arrogant, they can't help it! The drivel just continues and continues.Don't get me wrong, the series has an interesting plot line. The characters were at one time OK, and showed some potential for growth. It is worth reading but view volume 10 as a punishment, your punishment.

I love Jordan's many intertwined storylines, and I understand cliffhangers, but NOT A SINGLE storyline got resolved in this book. In 822 pages I expect some adventures to conclude and others to immediately begin. Not here they don't. Book 10 was OK for a WOT fix while I was waiting for book 11 to come out in paperback, but now that book 11 is in paperback, or if you want to spare several weeks of reading, save yourself! As soon as you finish book 9, go straight to 11."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Mature readers can tell that the size of a book does not guarantee quality. The ability to stretch descriptions and plotlines ad infinitum does not mean that the writer is talented. It just means that he duplicates the same thing over and over again with only minor variations.I am another former WOT fan. I even bought hardcover copies, something I usually never do. That is in the past. After COT Jordan will never get a single penny from me. This book is proof that he has lost whatever talent and integrity he once had.I feel rather sad for the people who feel compelled to defend COT by saying &quot;you're too stupid to appreciate it!&quot; Anyone who has followed the series for ten volumes can hardly be blamed for having a short attention span. A book needs some content. I'm not asking for huge One Power battles in which cities are destroyed. Character development would be fine with me...but we don't even get that. What passes for it is absolutely ridiculous. Enough has been said of RJ's women and the fixation on dresses, but far too little attention has been paid to the idiocy of Rand's male wish fulfillment love life. Three gorgeous virgins (blonde princess, tomboy brunette, fierce redhead) who agree to share him and don't mind at all that he goes from one bed to the next? I'm sorry to say this happy-happy sisterhood doesn't exactly convince me, especially when Rand has done nothing to appear more than a bland saviour of the world. I guess ta'veren do get all the chicks. Still, as a woman, I find Jordan's relationships either hilariously unrealistic or more boring than staring at grey wallpaper would be.Jordan has failed. If the only way to defend this book is by insulting the intelligence of those who dislike it...it's not exactly a glowing recommendation."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Oh brother. I just don't know where to begin. Any plot development in this entire 600+ page book, what little there is of it, could EASILY have fit into one of Jordan's infamously long-winded prologues. Everything else is nothing but tedious, painstakingly long descriptions of what each character is wearing, their facial expressions, Aes Sedai temper tantrums, etc., ad nauseum, ZZZZZ... snore. Wha... oops, sorry, I dozed off there for a moment. What happened, Mr. Jordan, did you have a bunch of airheaded teenage girls ghost-writing this drivel for you?What a shame that such a once-promising series has now become the butt of so many jokes. Mr. Jordan, on the off chance that you might see this, please get a grip, pop a hole in that blimp sized ego of yours, get back to writing books and leave the fashion shows alone."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This easily ranks as the most unpleasant book I have ever finished reading. Just when I thought that Jordan's Wheel of Time series was picking up again (Winter's Heart was really solid), along comes \\"Crossroads\\". Remember all that neat stuff that happened in Winter's Heart? Well, this book is all of the boring, mundane, and generally pointless stuff the rest of Jordan's endless cast of characters was doing while the epic events of Winter's Heart were taking place. Literally hundreds of pages pass in this book with nothing even remotely meaningful or interesting happening.Die-hard Wheel fans will call this book more \\"setup\\" for events in later books. But frankly after ten books I'm tired of setup. This book really takes the \\"epic\\" out of epic fantasy."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I am in agreement that anyone who puts more than one star on this review must desperately want a pat on the head by Senior Jordan.Books 8 and 9 ARE the setup!! They would have been total losses without the few money scenes. Book 10 was supposed to be their payoff! It ended up being a barren landscape devoid of activity - with movements so slow they actually travel back in time from the ending of the previous book. This way Jordan can extend the boredom further than any author has ever tried.Don't feel bad about having wasted your time reading this one. Just think how RJ felt when he lost a bet with his TOR buddies and had the choice of either writing a book where nothing happens or showing up naked to book signings.I think he made the sensible choice..."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"How can Jordan get away with publishing a book that has no buildup or climax. Seriously, nothing happens in this book. It's like he's giving a report on the status of his characters. Rand is still here doing this, and Matt is still here doing that. Everybody is still alive, no need to worry. The characters didn't die off while you were waiting for the next book. Thanks Robert, now piss off. Finish your damn story. He's like an old man who started off telling a great story and then alzheimers kicked in and he forgot what he was doing. What's more frustrating is that apparantly all those big time bad guys Rand killed in the climax of the first few books, are still alive. Why should I believe that there will ever be a conclusion to this unending series when no one actually dies. My reccomendation is that you don't buy this book or any others until Jordan finishes the series, then go buy the last one and call it a day.On a side note, I wish people would stop writing reviews that do nothing but defend the author. Review the book, compare it to the series, and let Jordan defend himself."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Long ago I had the joy of reading a wonderful book called 'The Eye of the World.' Its writing was succint, its insights were well put and, like the best of Tolkien, it was spun in such a way that while it left so much open, it closed with having made its point.However, Jordan has now passed from the 'epic' stage to the stage of inefficiency. The Wheel of Time was wonderful because it provided us with a world rich with fresh semiotic relationships, an environment that was palpable and, more importantly, well told.Jordan has now replaced this high quality of story telling with a slowness and turgid nature that cannot retain the freshness and the richness of the new codes we have been given. Instead of showing, he is telling, as if he has removed his characterization from the context of a narrative and placed it into a textbook. Instead of high fantasy, he has dipped into the sloppiness of the low.This is not by any means the 'game of chess' the recent reviewer described it as, nor does it exist at some higher plane of intellectual discourse of which the layman is incapable of understanding. This is not Pynchon or DeLillo; this is not high Shakespeare; this is not 'Being and Nothingness,' if you wish to expand the analogy to encompass philosophical discourse; this is the result of quantity over quality.As a writer, I know that even if one has a set idea of what the plot will eventually come to and how it will come to it, taking too long to 'get to the point' and reach some sort of conclusion will cause your writing to drop off in quality.Jordan should have learned this from studying the greats in fantastic fiction--grand does not equal long. Tolkien conjured up a timeless, limitless epic in four installments. There is a reason he did write 100 installments instead. Jordan needs to make his point, or suffer the sort of aesthetic decay that it pains a common writer to see."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Is how much retarded emotional investment has been put into these friggin' characters.

Some day i'll be messing with your body, but even then it'll be nowhere near the mindjob that Jordan has crapped all over us.

A bunch of people see Rand's Big Project from a distance and, effectively, go &quot;huh?&quot;. Meanwhile, everyone is still bogged down in the same plot-lines that they were last time -- and I do mean the *same* ones, and not a single one so much as inches towards resolution.After such an enormously portentious ending in WH, it's simply incomprehensible to me that Jordan would have chosen to spend yet more time twiddling with all the pieces he has on the board.What happened?

Once when I purchased it when it was just released and recently when I re-read the entire series from beginning to end. It is the only book in the series I don't like. Even books in the series that I had not liked quite as much on the first read when they had just been released worked very well when read as part of the series.The problem isn't the writing style. It is written as well as the first book. It isn't that nothing interesting happens. There are some very cool scenes in this book.The problem is plot. Nothing major plot related happens. Nothing. Nada. Zip. Don't get me wrong, he does lots of plot development, just no real development. At the end of book nine Saidan is cleansed. Major plot development. The rebel Aes Sedai open a gate to Tar Valon. Major plot development.

At the end of the book you have the rebel Aes Sedai sitting at the gates of Tar Valon with an army, a Cleansed Saidan, Mat with the Daughter of the Nine Moons, and Perrin trying to rescue Faile.

If this was true, EOTW would probably have ended with the Emond's Fielders arriving at Baerlon for the first time, and we probably would have hated them already.Action, big battles and lots of magic. That what all the COT-defenders are saying that we are all obsessed with. If that is true, none of us would have like Martin's \\"a storm of swords\\", because there were no huge battles, great sorcerers getting killed, magic abound in all shapes and forms, none of that. We all loved the book because of the incredibly tight writing, the masterpieces called POV characters, the speedneck plot, the incredible suspense and mystery, and the unpredictability of it all. COT has none of that, absolutely none of it.It is not that the plot has become so backwardly slow, or that for every page of plot-advancement there is 10 pages of clothing/scenery/facial description, or that fact that the book is written with a larger font and printed (almost) double-spaced (but this all counts) but it is that the writing has become so abominable that it is unreadable. Every page seems to contain slews of sentences that end with exclamation points that seem totally unnecessary. Every time there is a sentence where something might actually seem to happen (such as when Perrin finds the darkhounds pawprints) there are six pages following where you get to read about the facial expressions, darting eye-movements, clothing descriptions, horse-coloring, background stories, etc. of all the fifty characters that are present. The wording is just juvenile. The characters seem to say and think such childish things that you can imagine that they are sticking out their tongues and making farting noises. All in all this contributes that the plot sinks into obscurity. The plot in this book is like finding gold rings in a junkyard. Unconnected, unattainable, disjointed, and soiled. So much so that they best-written parts in COT are not even a good as the worst written parts in the first trilogy.I am not hooked on this book like so many others because I want to see the end and to see what happens to the characters, because RJ has ruined so many great characters that I want to see them all die. Of course, knowing how all the women in WOT came out, Moiraine will probably be ruined when she comes back as well. The goes to my next point.I have never seen writing with such absolutely horrible male-female relationships. I dealt with it up through Winter's Heart, but it's almost reached dead-bottom here in COT. The women are all so horrible it's almost unbearable. The most insane moment in this story came early on when Mat went to sit down near with Tuon, Setalle, and Selucia and each move their arms and legs so that he couldn't sit down near them....and Mat actually took it, and stood there seeming almost afraid of them!!!!!!! Besides the fact that these 20-something main characters (well actually, do we actually know if there are main characters anymore, maybe some SeaFolk person will be leading the POVS soon) are incredibly juvenile, but can you look at all the Aes Sedai/Sea Folk/Wise ONes. These are people who are all old and supposedly worldly and intelligent and MATURE, but have you ever seen people who are as immature and childish as all of them. They care about nothing then who seems to have more authority over who, or who should look up to them, or who gives them the necessary authority. I couldn't believe it when I read in the prologue of when Dobraine was injured, the Aes Sedai seemed to care nothing about it. The only thing that she cared about was that the other Aes Sedai tried to usurp her authority, or began to talk first, or was giving commands to servant when she should have been allowing the other Aes Sedai to be giving the commands. Geez, i almost took the book out and burned it without finishing the prologue. It makes me wish that Mat, Perrin, and Rand would just dump their girlfriends/wives/lovers, and just hook up with their guy pals and get it on instead, just so we didn't have to see or hear the women (especially Elayne).It's sad that a series once so thrilling and beautiful has fallen so far. It just had a magic to it. The feeling you got when the Emond's Fielders first came to Baerlon. The rush of excitement when Egwene was freed from the Seanchan in Falme. The thrill of the chase through a lightning storm when the Darkhounds first descended on Illian. There are no more magical times like that. The best we'll get is when Elayne and Aviendha will fight over who will walk in the front during the last Battle. Or maybe Aviendha will get smart and slit Elayne's throat. Now that would be a truly magical moment. Sweet! :lol"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I concur with the other reviewers. Nothing happens in this book.

In my first review, I described Mr. Jordan as being an inefficient writer. However, I had only finished a few CDs and was hoping for improvement.Having completed the book, I am now in a position to give an opinion more substantiated by empirical observation - the man is obviously paid by the word.Going through this book was one of the most excruciating experiences that I have ever gone through. I borrowed the audio version in order to have something to listen to while I drove long distances on business. However, I began listening to static-filled radio stations instead of the book. In fact, you almost have to listen to the book on audio to truly appreciate its verbosity. When you read a book, you can skim through the dross. When you're listening to the tape, you're stuck.The book simply had too many descriptions of flustered Aes Sedai, who were not normally flustered, smooth their skirts, one of whom preferred wearing high-necked gowns embroidered with patterns of tea leaves embossed in gold touched with silver, except where the lace began, which, coming from Tear, was the finest lace ever to be found, except, of course, for lace could only be found in Caemlyn, but even lace from Caemlyn paled in comparison to the lace made in . . .Some of Mr. Jordan's readers have described this as rich storytelling. I respectfully disagree. On one occasion, Mr. Jordan provided a ten-minute description of nothing more than what a group of women were wearing. Literally ten minutes, and literally nothing more than a description of clothing. If this does not cross the line from rich storytelling to schlock writing, I do not know what does.Having read or listened to all of the books in the WOT series to date, I thought that I was too far in to quit now. That assessment was in error. I quit."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"After all the reviews, I still bought the book. After knowing how the last 4 books have turned out, I still bought this one. I still held out faith that previous reviewers just didn't understand the amazing world that Robert Jordan has created. And now I am sitting here, tagging one star because there isn't anything lower. How could this have gone so wrong?I did not believe what a previous reviewer said until I read the very last page of the novel. Honestly, not a single thing of note happens until the last page of the novel (not the epilogue). Even when it does happen, I remember thinking, damn, new story line to spin off and add one more volume to the series. This is never going to end. The rest of the book is over 800 pages of people talking to each other. This would be ok if the conversations were interesting or had any point. More then 90 percent of this is Jordan describing what everyone is wearing, what they are drinking - tea or spiced wine - and what the room they are in looks like. It is like he had a specific outline for each situation telling him to describe main character (drawn out clothing description), introduce other character no one remembers from previous book (drawn out clothing description), now describe the tea or spice wine they will drink and their opinions of its taste, bring in another character...and so on. The real events that occur and progess made in the actual story can be summed up in less then a page.I never thought I would say this about a book in the Wheel of Time series, but if you can, skip this one and just ask someone what happens in the end. However, I imagine that if you are like me you will buy the book just to see for yourself. I have spent so much time reading these over the years that I just keep going, refusing to believe that Jordan has given up on us. Its like the heroin as gone bad but I keep shooting up to get that first high I felt so many years ago. For others who haven't bought this book and still have a measure of self control, get out while you can. I don't see any hope for the rest of this series."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I started out as an enthusiastic fan of Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time ten years ago, but I'm starting to think I may not bother to finish the series. The strengths of the first five books were the humanity and believabililty of the main characters, the elegantly described action scenes, the witty dialogue, and the great detail Jordan uses in painting us a picture of his world. In the tenth installment, this is no longer true. Too many subplots and new major and minor characters have been introduced and/or resurrected since, and since Jordan democratically devotes the same amount of time to each, the dialogue and detail have become tedious and melodramatic rather than interesting and important to the main plot. And the action...what action? Only 4 or 5 chapters can be devoted to each of the original main characters, which means that the story does not progress in any significant way. In the beginning of this book, Perrin is still trying to free Faile. Mat is still trying to get out of Altara. Rand is plotting his next move, having cleansed saidin. Elayne is still trying to secure the throne. At the end of this book, guess what: Perrin is still trying to free Faile. Mat is still trying to get out of Altara. Rand is plotting his next move, having cleansed saidin. Elayne is still trying to secure the throne. It's true! Almost nothing major happens beyond a few characters making decisions that turn out to be really not all that shocking or interesting. Egwene is the only character to have something significant happen to her, unfortunately resulting in a cliffhanger that is more annoying than suspenseful to someone who is waiting to see a resolution to at least one problem. This book was long-awaited by fans of the series, but disappoints in that its only purpose is to set up affairs for Book 11, in which (presumably) the characters will quit ruminating and do something and (hopefully) most of the minor characters and subplots will get killed off."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"It's painful to see that what was once a great series is now shred to tatters - and I dont believe there is any hope of recovery. The series has been progressively decaying since book 5 and is now stale and rotting.I find it impossible to believe that the same author who wrote \\"The Shadow Rising\\" (book 4) in the series has also written this piece of trash. I can only surmise that he is an _old_ man now, most of his brain cells are fading, dying or dead - it was a different man who wrote the earlier books. Pardon me for that uncharitable dig, but I am extremely angry at Jordan for his unforgivable act of destruction. He ought to be flayed for it or burned alive.It is an interesting, analytical exercise to deduce the thread of decay in his writing and observe the chief factors that have contributed to it. Maybe I'll blog about it when I have some more time.Please do believe me: any of the imaginative fans at wotmania could have done much better at developing and progressing plot lines. To drive the point even more strongly: _anyone_ of the legions of fantasy readers out there would be hardpressed to write such drivel.If there anything even remotely engaging in this book, it would be the peculiar romance between Mat and Tuon. However, one silver thread in a tapestry of rotting rags does not enduce one to liken it.I suggest not wasting your money, and _more_ importantly your time and sanity perusing trash of this nature. There are some things that are very wrong in this world and \\"Crossroads of Twilight by Robert Jordan\\" happens to be one of them."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I was the most avid fan Robert Jordan could hope for, but this book, like several before, leaves me saying \\"what's the point?\\". No element of the plot is advanced, no battles to speak of (his strong point), and no reason to finish the book. I'm waiting until this series is over (assuming it will be), then reading the reviews, then making a decision. If the writing doesn't return to the original story, SHOCK, story, I'm done.As of now, there's better out there. Prove your worth, Robert Jordan, right now, I have no desire to support your writing."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Here's one more to add to the one star rating (which is one more then it deserves)What I would recomend to someone who hasn't read the book is read chapter 21 and the last 2 pages. The rest won't tell you a thing, unless you enjoy 5 chapters of Eguens headache, a few chapters on tea sipping, 2 or 3 chapters on Elaine and Avendha's bath.Perin learns where the Shaido who kidnapped Fail are at, but he's nowhere nearer being able to rescue her then he was in the last book.I think anyone who gives this book top rating are the absolute die hard fans of Jordan that would give the toilet paper he wipes his but with a 5 star rating."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I agree with all the others who have stated that everything important that happened in this book could be summarized in one concise paragraph.I think Jordan has collapsed under the weight of the mass of characters and plotlines he has created. I was hoping by some Herculean effort, he could resolve something in this book, move forward, bring something to a head. I was wrong."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"The wasted pages of this book represent something only Tom Clancey could appreciate. Long-term readers of the series, like me, will be disappointed to learn that less than ten pages of this book advance any of the many significant story lines. Mr. Jordan, you owe it to your readers of many years to bring this story to a close, and not in a single book or the twentieth novel out of a series that was rumored to stop at twelve. Be warned! This book is boring. I enjoyed reading the character archives to refresh my memory more than I did this bland diatribe. One more book like this and I will give up the battle to see the series to an end."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This book was egarly awaited and is such a let down because there is no furthering of plot or action of any kind!

It amazes me how creative some readers are (and makes me a little bit envious). Because of reading these reviews, I read this book with the lowest of expectations, expecting pages upon pages of tea-sipping rituals, braid pulling, and much sniffing. Instead, it wasn't a bad book, given the low expectations with which I started. However, don't be fooled - this is nowhere near as good as the first four books in the series.I recently finished this book after reading the first 75 pages when it first came out. I was so disgusted with starting with even more new characters that I had no clue who they were that I put it down for some time, until I heard that the new book was second to last. I think only that would have made me pick up this series again. Sad -- I loved this series originally. I'm 100 pages into the newest installment, keeping my high hopes that all will be resolved."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Hell, this is getting to be a drag. However the first 6 books in the series have set the story and I need to know how it will end.

The first 5 books in this series are fantastic. The next 4 were not as good, but still I enjoyed them. I even enjoyed book 9 and thought many critics were a bit hard. I'm sure my enjoying book 9 more than most is because I do enjoy suspense being built even if it is at a slower pace than most would wish for.With all that said, book 10 is the worse book I have ever read in my life. I can not say enough horrible things about it. Imagine the worse book you have ever read, times that by 10, and then hope you are lucky enough to read that book instead of book 10."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This is not the worst piece of fantasy fiction ever written, but it is by far not the best. I would also say that it is closer to the \\"worst\\" end of the spectrum than it is to \\"best\\". Yet I am suprised to find reviews posted on here that states things to the effect of that COT is the best fantasy book ever written and it is the strongest in the series. You find a 5 star review for every twenty 1 or 2 stars reviews. I have a sneaking suspicion that these are just die-hard fans trying to raise the average rating on this book.Lets get one thing clear here. This is NOT the best epic fantasy book ever written, and it is MOST DEFINITELY NOT the best in this series. It is the weakest link by far. It deserves the rating it recieved.I have read others saying that this is the set up, the lull before the storm, and thats how you build tension. I want to say \\"Yes, but those who actually write novels or direct movies know that there is a thing called timing.\\" There is only a certain amount of time that you should draw out the tension for. A part of a scene, maybe even a chapter, perhaps a part of the novel. NOT THE WHOLE DAMN BOOK!Listen I love Jordan's series. I will probably buy the next book. (I will wait on New Spring though) And I am not impatient for it to end. If he could, by some miracle, maintain the high standard of good storytelling present in the first 7 books in his series, then I'd never want them to end. I love the process of the quest, the steps in the journey. I was immensely sad when S. King's Dark Tower series ended. But this is too much to the extreme. I would rather have some movement. This was too little. If you compare the leapts and bounds in time that his characters take in the half of the series and then now, you wonder what the hell happened.When I think of COTw, I feel the same as I do about the first two new Star Wars. Dissapointed, but hopeful that Jordan can still end the series well."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This once great series has become utter garbage. There's really nothing else to say."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"While I love the series, this book is an absolute waste of time and money. Save your money for a series where something is actually happening and you don't finish several hours worth of reading feeling like you just got ripped off. Anyone who read Winter's Heart will have no trouble with Book 10...assuming it actually has a plot."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I am a WOT fan. I have enjoyed this series, even through a couple of less...enjoyable...books. However, I am afraid I have to join my voice to all the others who have bashed this instance of the series. .... Pure and simple.First of all, the first 300 pages should have been in the previous book. I don't mind a flashback to the previous book in the prologue (like those experienced in previous books) but 300 pages worth of it? Get serious.Halfway through the book, we finally start reading material that would fit into the new book and, aside from some mediocre advances in the Matt/Perrin plots, nothing.Don't get me wrong. The writing is still top notch but the plot just does not cut it.Tor and Jordan better not make us wait another two years for the new book. If they do, Tor is better start looking for a new editor."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This book, while often read regardless of its quality because it is part of an involved series, is not worth the time of day. Reading this book is truly unnecessary. There are a grand total of 2 things that happen in this book that are necessary to know, and those can be gleaned by asking a friend or reading a plot summary, as each can be summarily noted in a sentence or less."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"My sarcastic thought after finishing this book: The characters in the book are either waiting for something to happen (like the readers), or the characters are trying to figure out what to do next (like the author).My serious thoughts: I feel that this book was poorly written. There are more sub-plots running than in any of the other books. The constant switching from 1 set of characters to the next made reading difficult. Not one of the sub-plots were resolved.I accept that as the story has grown, with more characters and a larger world to draw (and draw from), that the pace has slowed down. I have enjoyed all of the previous books, even the often bashed 7-8-9. But all of the previous books have had events introduced and events resolved. This book is sadly lacking in both. In all of the previous books, the world grew, the characters grew, events happened. I feel that this book is nothing but a 700 page prologue for the next novel.I do believe that Mr. Jordan is setting up something big, but shame on him for publishing this. Any book, even one that is part of a series, should have a plot and a climax. This book has neither. If he needs 700 pages of set up for what is going to happen next, fine, but don't sell it as a separate novel. I would rather have a 1400 page novel with some plot movement than this."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I agree with the majority of the customer reviews about this installment...a let down. I kept hoping for something to happen, even to the last page, but it was a complete disappointment. Very few, if any, significant events took place. The best that can be said about this book is that a little more light has been shed on some mysteries, and that both Mat and Perrin had some noteworthy character development. Otherwise, it seemed almost insignificant.I was looking forward to the release of this book with a great deal of anticipation...but if this is what I have to look forward to for the next book, I'll probably wait for the paperback; if that."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"How did this happen? There were great books in the beginning of this series; books that hypnotized and seduced readers into the Wheel of Time cult. I remember a time when every book was interesting and there was an actual story with forward progress and resolution. Now resolution means waiting many, many books bogged down in useless exposition bloated with maddening repetition and self-indulgence.Remember when a book might cover a couple months worth of time and the theater would constantly change? Me too. I long for those days, but instead we are given books that cover the span of a week and accomplish nothing. Just the fact that he is on the TENTH book of a series and still has so many plot threads unresolved says a lot. No series, I don't care how good, should go ten books long. A good book/series is supposed to leave you hungry for more. Neither this book nor its respective series accomplishes either.If you enjoy torture then read this book. It's like watching a 30 hour movie that begins and ends in the exact same location, with no change in situation or intention. These characters have grown stale and boring.For me this book IS the Crossroads of Twilight. The death nell of the series has been sounded and I now lay to rest what should have been a revolutionary fantasy series. R.I.P. Wheel of Time. Your epitath reads: I could have been great, but my creator loved his own words more than the fans he was writing them for.What a shame. Do yourself a favor and pass this series by. If it's fantasy you hunger for, then seek the land of Westeros."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"\\"Get to the point, Jordan.\\"That little prod kept echoing in my head as I waded through the tepid pages of Crossroads of Twilight. This latest installment of the Wheel of Time is once again bogged down by the sheer complexity of the Jordan's world. And yet, with this obsessive amount of complexity already on-hand, Jordan still introduces minor character and spends far more time than he should developing their minor stories. Sub-plots within sub-plots abound, relegating the pace of action to a snail's pace.And where's Rand in all of this? The pinnacle of the story is allotted almost no time- probably less than Faile in her struggles with the Shaido. Who cares about Faile? Who cares about exhausting dynamic between the houses in Andor? I want action, and I feel that with the time I've put into the series, I deserve it.Jordan also wastes time with his form fitted and overly simplified characterizations of Women and Men. Women are all scheming and cat like, while men are just plain stupid. I guess that's not a gripe with this book in particular, but it stands out more in this installment (perhaps because of the lack of plot movement). With regards to the relationship between the sexes, Men and women either fall in love, or hate each other. If Jordan's world has to be so physically complex, he should at least make some effort to see that it's emotionally complex.Now don't get me wrong. Books one through six are among the best works of fantasy ever written. I am still a Jordan fan (albeit a waning one), but the last four books have done nothing but set up action that never seems to arrive. Something needs to happen in book eleven. Some confrontation with the Seanchan or the Dark One or *something.* If you've put in your time with the series, then you're going to read this book no matter what the reviews say, but do yourself a favor and skim this one. With the time you'll save, maybe you can write Jordan and tell him to get it together."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"My Husband turned me on to the &quot;Wheel of Time&quot; series about a year and a half ago. Being an avid reader, I devoured the first books within a couple of weeks, and like everyone else, I drooled over each new installment. The 9th book was very good and more than encouraging. Something major finally was accomplished, and it appeared that the final books in the series would be even better.How wrong that idea was.A prior commentary used the phrase &quot;lack of movement.&quot;Constipation would be a better word, I think.There is absolutely NO purpose to this book. NOT A THING happens of any value to the story until the second to the last page. Most of the book is set in the SAME WEEK, just in different points of view. It's nothing but a long winded narrative of how each of the main characters (and ALL of the rest of them for that matter) couldn't get anything done.And, as if we didn't already have 10 or so different storylines to follow, and problems to solve, now he's adding MORE! Just as it seems something interesting is about to happen, he drops that line of thought and moves on to the next pointless babble. Just as it started to look as if it might be moving to some sort of climax. He ends it.I have NEVER been so irritated when reading a book. I just about threw the stupid thing across the room in frustration after finishing it. My advice; wait to buy this at a used book store. It's only value, in my opinion, is a collector's value."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I feel like I can't stop buying these clunkers, because if I do the story will get going again and I will miss it .

Absolutely nothing resolved from the previous novels, merely more colorful, albeit, competent, embellishment upon already laid grounds. Whereas the first few novels were masterpieces of drama, action, humor, and epic scope, the last few novels (excepting the last chapter of Winter Heart) have been like watching daytime soaps.

I cannot otherwise explain the unbelievably slow pace of the last four books.The content of this book could easily have been covered properly in two or three chapters - it did not require an entire book to cover the progress that was made (if any) in Crossroads.While I understand Jordan's political expertise, I do not want to be subjected to it except at my own choice.Can I suggest that Jordan concentrate a bit more on what his readers want rather than self-gratification. And could the publisher please take note of what the readers in ever-increasing numbers are saying !!"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Really disappointing but not surprising. At the end of the book, the characters are all exactly where they were when the book started. Nothing really happened. No loose ends were tied up. Plenty of forgettable characters were introduced though (among a cast of thousands of others that are already too hard to keep up with).I expected this book to not carry the storyline a tremendous distance. I was disappointed it didn't carry it AT ALL. I'll never buy another Jordan book even if the next one was the grande finale. It's really a shame, the series started off extremely strong and it's clearly a world that would support multiple series either before, after or during the existing storyline.

However, characterization is only good up to a point; after that, action becomes imperative. Jordan seems to have missed this point. The first time he wrote a book where nothing happened, I said I wouldn't buy any more if it happened again. After reading Crossroads and seeing absolutely nothing resolved, I have finally given up on the series. I may read the rest after he finishes the series, assuming he ever actually does, but until then I'm not wasting my money."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I believe that if you are reading this review, you have already read the first nine books, and are trying to get a feel for the tenth. Well, don't set your sites too high.Many previous reviewers are absolutely correct: the plot goes nowhere. I mean, nowhere. This book could have been 100 pages long, and the plotline would not have moved any less. MOST disappointing. As far as the title of the book is concerned, I believe it should have been titled Crossroads of Tedium: Wait Until Another Book Comes Out, and Hope We Advance the Plot Before Tar'mon Gaidon.My series-long complaint is the internal bickering between every single women's group. Between the Aiel, Kin, Aes Sedai (o my god!), Wise Ones, and Sea Folk, there is too much female tension. While the female characters are important, there is so much constant dress-smoothing,chin-lifting, and steel-eyed gazing that I found myself skimming the chapters centered on Egwene, Elayne, and even Mat. There's over half the book, right there.In Jordan's defense, his storytelling is truly artful. The third person style alters a little for each character's perspective. As the story is told through one person's view, the idioms, phrases, and expressions also change to coincide with the personality of the person who is centered in that particuar chapter. Very Cool: I think you'll enjoy it.In short, read the tenth book for the art of storytelling. Don't expect any major excitement, and you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Jordan's Wheel of Time series, up until this book, has been wonderful. The series has slowed down a bit with the latter novels, but nonetheless have the novels been good. Again, sadly, until this novel.A great many reviews here claim for this novel to be set-up for the next book or two. Sadly, in order for that to happen, Jordan would have had to actually provide something in this novel that was new. With the exception of the last 2 or 3 paragraphs of the last chapter there was nothing new to this novel at all. This novel is nothing more than a rehash of everything that has happened thus far.That said - I will, of course, buy the next Wheel of Time novel. As this point, after reading the whole series thus far, I've invested too much time to give up reading the series no matter how terrible it gets. Right now, I'm finally going to tackle some of the work bv R.A. Salvatore instead for a change of pace.Oh yes, any of you even remotely hoping to see Rand give up now. There's about 20 pages total worth of writing devoted to him."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"As I waded through the muck that is this book (give me back my $...!), it occurred to me - either Jordan is milking us for every penny we have, knowing that we, as readers, just keep hoping he'll get his act together, or he has simply no idea how to finish this series.I'm leaning on the no clue side, as opposed to the greedy. Regardless, this book was a complete waste of my time and money. Jordan could have accomplished the plot movement of this story in 75 pages or less, and saved me a lot of time.Don't waste your effort on this one."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Loved most of the books in the series to this point. \\"The Dragon Reborn\\" definitely ranks as one of my most enjoyable reads in any genre.

I should have known better than to criticize those who didn't like the book without weighing the merits of their complaints. But no, I blindly worshipped Jordan simply because it was exactly the kind of thing other Jr. High students would do. (O.K., perhaps it's really a grade-school kind of thing, and I'm just not adult enough to admit that my behavior was SO childish). I kept buying these books and defending them as clever or brilliant....and then I realized one day that I want my characters to be likeable. I don't want to have to wonder if one of the male Forsaken is truly dead at the end simply because Jordan was stupidly vague (like with Sammael). I don't want to hate characters NOT because of their actions, but because they are all poorly written. Somehow I didn't realize, until I went back and re-read them all in a row) that the characters behave the same way, over and over and over, and that there really isn't any difference between them. Plus, the plot gets sillier all the time: Why is it that these super-powerful people can't communicate? How hard is it for Egwene or Elayne to figure out what Rand is up to when they can communicate in the dream world with each other and with the Wise Ones? Why is Perrin so stupid? And to make matters worse, I really started to hate these books when I realized how much of the first 6 (which were better than 7-10) stole so many characters out of other author's books. Why isn't this guy being sued? Geez. Well, I'm truly sorry if I misled anyone into buying the other books. If you're thinking about buying this one, PLEASE don't, unless you're in the target age range: 10-12.Thank You"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Fortunately, I borrowed this book and didn't plop down the cash for it myself. This is an interminable journey that is going nowhere. Jordan obviously is depending upon this income source and is terrified of the end of the story.Absolutely nothing happens in this book. No resolutions of any situations, no battles, no character development - nothing.Furthermore, I'm becoming disturbed by Jordan's fascination with cleavage, spanking, and belt knives. I think he needs therapy.Even if you've already invested your time in the first nine books - don't bother with this one. If you're waiting to find out what happens I think you can safely skip this volume and not miss anything."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"In the hands of any other major fantasy writer, the material Jordan covers in this long, long book would have been covered in a matter of a few chapters. I suppose you could consider the following to be spoilers, but it's hard to spoil the plot of a book in which nothing happens. In this book:- Perrin wants to rescue Faile but doesn't.- Matt wants to leave the lands controlled by the Seanchan but doesn't.- Egwene wants to unite the two versions of the White Tower but doesn't.- Rand plans to do something, but we aren't told what it will be.- Endless minor characters, who receive no introduction and who most people won't even remember from previous novels in the series, eat up chapter after chapter doing nothing to advance the story.I've been reading the Wheel of Time series since the day The Eye of the World was released. The energy and excitement of the story has long since faded a the series goes on and on and on. It's a waste of the huge potential from the earlier novels. Thank God I got this from Audible.com and listened to it while driving. I'd hate to have wasted actual reading time on this book. Speaking for myself, I won't bother with the next book unless it is the final book in the series.

Where is the love for the deep, spooky characterization of the Forsaken? All good stories need tension, usually between good and evil, but Jordan has brought us to a new level of literature by creating a multi-volume tale of good versus itself. When has THAT been done before? Who needs an evil mastermind when you can simply watch the main characters blunder about trying to interfere with each other's plans (when said plans exist)?Let's look at the Forsaken, shall we? We know there are a bunch of them. The men slightly outnumber the women, but that's OK. An odd number is more interesting, right? Each of these Forsaken has some part to play in creating problems in the world. We know, for example, that a few of them deposed despots and temporarily took their places. Then they got whacked, often through their own stupidity or because they suddenly forgot that they were magical superbeings and let someone zap them while they gaped helplessly. One got eaten by a shadow-thingy, which was all around him but, apparently, he couldn't see. Several of them were reincarnated, but given new names and bodies, so that it took a couple of paragraphs to figure out who they were. We know that they were reincarnated because the Dark One needed them for his plan to....well, we don't know what his plan is, but surely he has one! And since this is a Wheel of Time novel, it MUST be a doozy. Even if it's non-existent, it must rule! Anyway, all the Forsaken have spooky names, which I've quickly forgotten. And they all had tasks. For example, Semirhage was supposed to disappear for the first 10 books, popping up about 2-3 times to torture someone for no reason other than she likes to. Wooo! Moghedian did her best to imitate Nynaeve, which led to a fight. Later, she got sucked into a black ball, but we're not sure what happened to her because it's not important. Rahvin was all set for a magical and physical encounter with Rand, which explains why Moiraine balefired him so easily. Apparently, he forgot that magic can kill. Sammael? That's the guy that got shadow-et. Lanfear fell into the evil elf-world, but came back bosomy-ier than ever. She wants Rand, because she wanted Lews Therin, even though Rand isn't anything like Lews. At all. Which is, er, why she wants him? Anyway, there's also Messana, who is in the tower plotting to....um, read or something. Graendel got sucked into a black ball. No, that was Moghedian. Graendel is pretty much the same as Moghedian, but not currently black balled. The music-playing bad-guy (Asmodean?) was whacked by another Forsaken. He was the scariest, as he was so evil that he BECAME JEALOUS OF OTHER MUSICIANS and turned to the dark side. Seriously. I'm not sure if he used music as a weapon, but that's his background. There were some others, but they died quickly and stupidly, too.With such terrifying bad-guys doing such terrifying things (reading! being gone! getting stuidly whacked! playing music!) you can see why this series is so tense and exciting! I can't wait for #11, so that Jordan can cram about 600 unfinished plot lines into 600 pages (that's about a plot line per page)! Woo hoo!"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Ok, I have read the entire series at least twice with the exception of this book. I have heard people bashing a few of the other books in the series but I have generally liked them. This book however has little if anything to do with the story. It does not develop the story along nor does it give us anything new. Some people say \\"oh it's just more character/world development\\" well, if after 9 books you need to develop your characters more then you are doing something wrong. Look at the world Tolkein created (regarding the original trilogy and the Hobbit, not the books published after his death). He created an incredible world and didn't just keep hashing out used up ideas.I will give Jordan the benefit of the doubt and read the next book when it comes out. If it moves at the glacial rate of this one I will not bother with any other book in the Waste of Time series."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I give high praise to Robert Jordan for his early books in the Wheel of Time series. Unfortunately his later books keep getting progressively worse.Don't even bother reading Crossroads of Twilight. Nothing happens. It is actually pretty amazing that Jordan can fill so many pages in a book and still not advance the plot.I'm finished reading his books. I might pick them up again if he ever finishes the series but I'm done waiting to the next installment in his saga.DON'T BUY THIS BOOK!"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"For the love of all that is good, please do as I have done and stop buying these books people. Stop saying &quot;this is the last straw!&quot; only to go out and buy the next installment. I have been &quot;Jordan free&quot; since book seven, which I couldn't even finish! These books should be boycotted and subsequently banned. Are you with me?!"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Another reviewer summed it up pretty nicely: Robert Jordan must be paid by the word. There's no other explanation for this book. The story simply does not develop from Winter's Heart. The progress of the story could be summed up in one to two rather short sentences, at most. Robert Jordan has always inserted lengthy descriptions of various persons, landscapes or whatever, but in the previous books I didn't mind because there was also something going on. I guess the pain that other reviewers felt during reading Crossroads really comes from lengthy descriptions without anything really happening. It's simply boring! Nevertheless, I am waiting for the next book in the hope of something new."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I can comfortably say that I will never read one of Mr. Jordan's books, based on the trend of reviews since his first Wheel of Time book; however, I hope he continues with his uninspired and plot-sloppy writing because he has inadvertently generated some of the greatest book reviews I've ever read. At the time of my review, this 10th installment (10th, are you kidding? This guy should write for Reader's Digest.) earned two stars after 413 reviews...wow. How can a publishing company willfully continue to print material that engenders such distaste for literature? I truly believe that a boring fantasy author is as close as it gets to no activity in the frontal lobe (unless you're a waning fantasy-author's book cover artist; I have some Crayons, too, may I be an artist?)...it's not history, man! You're not writing a thesis on Peruvian bush weevils.If Jordan's future books get any worse, and it sounds like he's beating a path in that direction, Mass Market Publishing will face the dilemma of supporting a Sominex-writing fantasy author, or risk having his increasingly tenuous fan base dig their eyes out with a bookmark. Neither path seems a very good source of future revenue.Again, I will probably never read one of Jordan's books...but I can't wait for his next attempt in anticipation of the reviews it will get. I'm beside myself with excitement knowing that an uninspired fantasy will not read as good as the people who will eventually critique it. Keep it up, Robert!"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This is the worst book of the series by far. Hands down &amp; without exception. Jordan should be embarassed to have his name associated with it. If you are reading this, do everyone a favor &amp; send a letter to the publisher. Maybe if they get enough negative feedback they will stop wasting our time with sensle dribble like Crossroads of Twilight...Or as I like to call it Crossing into Boredom.

The chapters with Egwene or Elaine are just painful. Jordan must be going through a messy divorce. This book has no likeable women characters. This book is an excellent arguement for stilling/killing all that can touch saidar. Or Jordan wife is pregnant, and he is tired of her changing moods.This book focuses on Perrin riding after his kidnapped wife, Faile. Personally, I like Perrin. But a half book devoted to him chasing after the kidnappers. I know Perrin is supposed to be slow witted, but does his story have to soooo slow too?Speaking of slow witted, the other half of the book is devoted to the Aes Sedai who cannot even decide on what tea to drink. They march all the way to Tar Valon to attack it and take it back, but now they are having second thoughts. At this rate, Tarmon Gai'don will not be the last battle. The Aes Sedai fighting over which tea to drink will be the last battle.Fain must have written this book."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Crossroads of Twilight was maddening. I read it years ago and ended up giving up on The Wheel of Time after this book. I tried again in my preparation for reading Memory of Light, and I just couldn't manage to do it again. So, as with Winter's Heart, I cheated by reading many of the chapter summaries at Encyclopaedia WOT. I skimmed the chapters involving Perrin's hunt for Faile because I remembered how slow, grueling, and painful they were when I read them the first time. And even though about 25% of the novel was about this storyline, it did not advance at all. I also skimmed a lot of Elayne's campaigning and dealing with the constantly whining Sea Folk because not much happened here, either. There were only two chapters (out of 30) from Rand's point of view. Mat was entertaining, but he didn't get anywhere either.In Crossroads of Twilight, expect more politicking, planning, negotiating, committee discussions, bathing, dressing, shopping, and description of tapestries and seating arrangements than action. THE PLOT DOES NOT MOVE. There were very few significant occurrences -- mostly the characters just talked to themselves and others. Only one major event happened, and that occurred in the last 3 minutes (on audio).Here is a sample of some of the pulse-pounding action you'll encounter in Crossroads of Twilight:\\"'I see,' Egwene said slowly. She realized she was massaging the side of her head. The throb behind her eyes beat on. It would grow stronger. It always did. By nightfall, she was going to regret having sent Halima away. Bringing her hand down firmly, she moved the leather folder in front of her a half inch to the left, then slid it back.\\"Riveting... But at least we didn't have to hear about Nynaeve's braid...There are 1880 characters in The Wheel of Time and it's impossible for anyone whose not writing a dissertation on the series to keep them all straight. It doesn't help that so many of the names are similar, either. At this point, many of them are all just a big jumble and you have to use a resource like Encyclopaedia WOT (who have all 1880 characters listed, described, and tracked) to even begin to understand all of the politicking. It also doesn't help that Jordan made occasional mistakes along the way (nicely pointed out by Encyclopaedia WOT).If it weren't for Brandon Sanderson's finale, I would absolutely give up at this point (I did once). By the way, let me say here and now (March 2009), for the record, that I don't believe Mr. Sanderson will be able to clean up this mess with only one volume."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"There are enough reviews on here to tell you this is a horrible book without getting into each detail. I bought this in hardcover as I was adicted from books 1-7 and the 9th was better than 8 at the least. Not only is this a great waste of my time, but the drawn out plot lines and character development bits are starting to fold on themselves.But was he ever really that good? I know he was very good at creating moments and plot twists that made the first books very good, but behind it was a cardboard cutout backdrop. Each city was far too different for their geographical proximity...if only to intentionally be that different. This while every one of these &quot;diverse&quot; cities seemed to be made up of nothing but Palaces, Inns and people selling their wares on the streets. All of these books suffer from a repitition of backdrop and environment, including dress adjusting, palaces, inns, sniffs, etc. In short, while Tolkien, Donaldson and Martin manage to write fully 3D in scope and drama, Jordan seems to only be a 2D writer, and after 10 books...it's finally caught up with him."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"That's it, I'm done with this series!!I can't believe that I've wasted hours and hours of my time reading this crap. The series started out great, then went downhill. I made it to book 10, and that's where it ends.This book is page after page of the most trivial detail... nothing actually happens. If I hear another phrase about 'spiced wine' or 'honeyed tea', I'm going to scream! Not to mention the childish little girls that apparently rule the world... trying to tame the evil men (that are good for nothing but breeding).I think Jordan has gone over the edge and lost his mind. I just wish I could tell him to his face.

Not much more than that, and only so I can keep my collection intact.This book is garbage. Nothing...I mean NOTHING at all happens in it. Can you imagine writing a 700 page book and have NOTHING happen.Oh wait...sorry. There are some earth-shattering things that do happen: some women tug at their braids and chuck stuff at guys. Some guys looked all confused when women chuck stuff a them and tug their braids (the women tugging their braids, not the men, 'natch). Oh, and there is a wonderful continuation of the whole, massive, everyone-misinterprets-what-everyone-else-is-doing plout...um...thingie.

It is greatly disturbing to see such a wonderful epic dissolve into nothingness. What a dissapointment. And now to add insult to injury, it appears Jordan is working on \\"Prequel\\" novels so the chances of him finishing this series in the next 10 years is pretty slim. Hopefully with all the incredibly bad reviews TOR will kick his butt, actually read his next book before they release it, and compel him to advance the story line. Little hope of that though."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"The only possible reason for this book is so that Jordan can pad his bank account. Here is a suggestion for those of you who had read the last 9 books. Go to a book store, read the last two chapters, and you know everything that you need to know to stay in the series. The worst thing we can do is continue to purchase these books until Jordan puts something into them. I made the mistake of buying, please don't do the same. Of course, if you are an insomniac, then read on."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Where are the editors? Someone has to stand up to RJ and tell him he can't write 600 pages of exposition and 100 pages of story. I'm being generous in giving him 100 pages of story. I want to scream that I don't care what the snow looks like, that you shouldn't take ten pages to describe nothing happening and what people think about nothing happening. It's like he writes and thinks that it is all gold, that nothing should be cut. I found simple errors in the text that make me wonder if an editor even read it. I started to get mad and actually counted how many pages it would take for the simplest thing to happen, 700."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I was amazed to see another review mention the possibility of a book signing tour by Jordan (not that one was happening, but that he would be on the lookout to give Jordan &quot;an earful&quot; about the slow pace of the books). I thought everyone had realized that Jordan passed on after the fourth novel, and the publishers obtained a roomfull of monkeys to write the next nine books. Time for a new joke"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Before I start this opinion, and in my defense: I promised myself I wouldn't buy another WOT book after my justified disgust with Book 8. But I had to read book 9 because my wife found it abandoned in an airport and she was so excited on giving it to me, that I didn't have the heart to say no. 2 years later she found Book 11 and without telling me, she went and bought Book 10... for $5.00, new. A new hardcover for $5.00 would be considered cheap except... well... it's by Robert Jordan. But she was oh so excited... So I read Book 10.Just as I finished the book I tried to recap the plot. A 10 line paragraph for each main character did it. Actually, I believe I could rewrite the book and cut it in less than one-third by omitting all irrelevant information and improve the review grades in this site. Why Mr Jordan thinks it important to name EVERY-SINGLE-AES-SEDAI and describe EVERY-SINGLE-REACTION and EVERY-SINGLE-THREAD of their dresses, is beyond me. But a 3 line verbal exchange always becomes a 3 page scene and very often even the exchange could be left out. Also editorial comments, such as the Warders' cloaks' appearance, are repeated ad nauseaum to only add volume to the book, not to mention the cheezy allegories and dolty expressions, which are neither colorful nor funny.Then there is the fact that he doesn't even try to add subplots for interest. Strangely enough, the material presented is fit for such use, but instead he goes on letting a character recite the conflicts to either one of the main characters. I honestly couldn't read more than a chapter in a single seating. It's that boring! Except it's not. It's like going to a party and hear a total bore recite a joke he heard on Frazer. It's a waste of a good story told by a very incompetent writer, or writers. I noticed the personality in the narrative change in a few chapters and it didn't have to do with the story at all.All in all the book is about nothing. I believe one could read book 11 end even 12 without missing it.This particular book I consider 85% fluff."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"In the 10th book of this epic saga, Jordan continues to weave a richly detailed and exciting story that captures the reader from start to finish. In fact, his ability to delve deeply into the events is what makes this series so singularly absorbing. As much as for the storyline, these books are about a world, with all its unique nuances laid out before us.The plot did not advance as much as many had hoped, but I felt that any less detail would have detracted from the enjoyment I got out of the book. There are myriad examples of this. The descriptions of the people and the houses in Andor give a personal basis to the political intrigue surrounding Elayne's quest for the throne. The interaction between Mat and everyone is fascinating. Etc. Personally, I could read another 10 books at this pace, and still be sad when they finish. The bottom line is--don't cheat yourself out of this book, or out of this series. It's fantastic."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"The book was good so just shut-up and wait for the next one.

Yes, I can see how it might be disappointing if you have waited for several years to have many questions answered and situations resolved, but try to see past your impatience for the gem that is Crossroads of Twilight. Jordan is not being paid by the word, he is capturing the essence of when time seems to slow or stop before a momentous occurence. My advice: Re-read the entire series before reading Crossroads. That way, it won't seem like a letdown. You will really see what a beautiful piece of work this book is, and appreciate the in-depth character development you get."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I disagree with all these recent negative reviews.

Of course I'm excited to think of the eventual development of Tarmon Gaidon but hopefully not too fast because Jordan is my favorite writer thus far.

Books 7-10 are the best written. I once thought books 5 & 6 were the best but they really got better.I like it how he uses so many characters. I myself often meet people and talk to them for 5 minutes and never see them again, that is life. It wouldn't seem real to have only a few characters living in a bubble, never meeting other people in the world.Apparently some people think nothing happens in this book. Are the pages blank? Something is happening, just not what many seem to want. If you want a battle every other chapter go write your own book like that. It would get old in my opinion.Also, so many reviewers are giving one star and saying they won't buy any more of these books but they will read it from the library. So I guess they like the books, but are just cheap. Maybe this young generation is so used to getting music downloaded for free, now they want to read books for free.The books in this series are the size of 2-3 normal sized books. Robert Jordan has written the equivalent of around 20-25 novels in about 14 years. All of great quality and bestsellers too. This is an amazing achievement. It is easy to get impatient for the next book to come out. I will have no problem waiting two years because there is just nothing like this series. A real work of Genius!"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"As a matter of practice, i will read many reviews of a product before I buy it, both good and bad to make a well informed decision. As far as a series of books goes, i generally dont read reviews unless i am deciding as a first time reader of the story, if i should invest my time and money.The Wheel of Time is simply the best fantasy story ever told.I have read many, and have found others enjoyable but nothing compares to the rich detail and unbounded imagination of the world Mr Jordan has created. It is that, a world, living and breathing, evolving and growing of the course of the story. Filled with such grand detail that you feel you know the charactors and are in this world with them.I began to read some of the reviews and quickly realized that many of the readers out there seem to have a negative opinion of the latter books of the series.I propose that this negative feeling may be due to the time between new releases, given that Mr Jordan tends to write with great detail on the subject at hand, be it action or building. This level of detail, seems to be causing difficulty with readers whom are expecting a quick resolution or movement of plot. It is my opinion that this detail is good and infact necessary to due to the vastness of the scope of this story.Honestly if you are expecting a fast paced , get to the final resolution and end it with a bang kind of story, this isnt for you. This story takes its time to unfold and there are many sub plots and directions the story takes that dont reveal themselves in any great hurry. But that is what happens when you weave a grand epic of a tale. The time is well worth the out come, and if the nay sayers give the series that time to develop, they wont be disappointed. I see on the horizon at least 2 books to cover the colliding of charactors and plots in an action packed pages that the past several books have been leading up to. You must have faith that Mr Jordan actually knows what he is doing and he wont let his fans down.I find it rather funny that the majority of the negative reviews also indicated that they will buy the next release. It must not have been that bad then.This story is big, and it runs over a great length and depth. I can fully understand some of the impatience expressed in the reviews, but only if you have pre conceived expectations on what you thought should be happening. Look at the series of books as a single story, not sequels. Each is building on the last and advancing the story. Let the story be told at its own pace. Maybe not as fast as some would like, but it is advancing and with the same richness and detail. In time the story will be told and the lenghts taken to do it with be all that more rewarding.Some have expessed that Mr Jordan isnt a great writer and that he has stolen ideas from others.....Well, if you listen to or read the interviews with Mr Jordan he flat out says that his inspiration was from the age old idea of someone being told that they were born to be the savior of all mankind, but he wondered if they would really except this just because they were told so and go run off to save the world. Or would they be reluctant and have great difficulty in accepting their fate, more having their fate thrust upon them and the manner they come to terms with it.He also stated that givin the concept he chose to use, time being a wheel instead of being linear, that he wanted to use a sort of metling pot of many popular mythologies and relegions to give them a possible source and the reader something to relate to.So you see, he didnt steal anything, he rewrote it in a very imaginative manner and made it his own, by redefining what was into something new and believable. In essence, he created a world.If you like great story telling, then this series is a good choice. I do recommend though, that you read all of the books, back to back, as a single story in its entirety. You will appreciate the telling alot more that way.If you can afford it buy the CD's and listen to it. I just did that and I have to say that you get alot more out of it than by reading, especially if you read causally."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This book is as well written and as exciting as every other book in this series. Yes there is no huge event such as the killing of a Forsaken or the cleansing of the Source, but there are decisions made that will be crucial to the final volumes, and Robert Jordan does not disappoint.I have read this book three times trying to figure out why this book was given an overall rating of two stars or whatever and I can't find it. I was entralled by the storytelling. The Seanchan have been deftly woven into the narrative so now that every character knows that they must make a truce with them. And based on the belief system of the Seanchan regarding channeling I can't wait to see how Robert Jordan will handle this.There are new developments regarding the siege of Tar Valon that is exciting as well as the political turmoil surrounding Tear and Andor.I will agree only that there is no clear ending as there was in the other books besides the surprise kidnapping (or whatever u want to call it) but this book should have been given five stars because a smart reader would have realized that this is the beginning of the end of the series. Not another book to make money as some ignorant people wrote, but a book to show that every character is at the crossroads of twilight before the Last Battle."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I think the Wheel of Time series is excellent, all the way to the tenth book.

However, having spoken with Jordan, I am aware that it is not his lack of vision of an end that keeps him from ending it.( he knew how it was going to end while writing Eye of the World) It is his numerous new plots and loose ends that he keeps creating that are stopping him. With so many, it becomes more complex to end a novel, as well as to produce a new installment(hence the long waits in between releases.) at any rate, enough of this rambling...A slow novel yes...a reason to lose faith in an excellent writer? never"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Path of daggers was supposed to be the final book. with respect to Mr. Jordan he should put this thing to bed already.

He has the ability to weave words into a three dimentenal reality. Crossroads of Twilight is however one of his less adapt works. Jordan juggles multiple subplots, each in devestating detail. The problem being that the work suffers from a distinct lack of action. Any of the subplots would make a book in itself. Only a few chapters are devoted to each subplot. As such none of the subplots move more than a few paces. The master,would be better served by devoting more time to each subplot.

All of us die hard fans have been salivating over the possibilities that Crossroads of Twilight had to offer. There is no doubt that everything that transpired in the book had to happen and should have happened.However, there was still something missing.Every WOT book had defining characteristics. Major events in the story are associated with the main theme of each novel. Crossroads of Twilight, however, has no such distinction except possibly at the very end where posible alliances are introduced. Those are not indicative of any real theme or progression in the book though.Crossroads of Twilight (COT) and Winter's Heart (WH) could be considered as one large novel. One could insert some of the sections of COT in between other sections in WH and there would be definite continuity.Loose ends in the story are somewhat tied up or are led to foreseeable conclusions. Prophecies are begining to be fulfilled and new plots and schemes pop up.The book is a page turner, no doubt, however with very little real activity that many of us were waiting for. With the expectations of wanting to know what will happen with Moirane, Rand, Mat, and Perrin, not to mention Fain, and the Forsaken, COT was a slight disappointment. And with the cliffhanger at the end that we will have to wait 2-3 more years for some sort of resolution, it left me wanting more.Overall it was a great book with logical progression of certain conflicts in the whole story, but, in my opinion, the weakest single book in the whole series. When reading you expect that the next chapter with reveal something new, or something you've been waiting to happen. This doesn't occur.It is my humble opinion, however, that after reading COT, Robert Jordan cannot finish the series in less than 3 more books. There are too many plots, subplots, that are yet to be addressed or developed upon before the end of the series. If he did so, I believe, it would be a complete let down."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I really enjoyed the book, as I have the entire series, but enough is enough. Jordan still proves he can make you part of the story, but in the past few books there has not been a conclusion to a single sub-plot. Jordan just keeps adding more and more.He needs to go ahead and kill Egwene, Naneave, Elayne, & Perrin. Rand is the only character that matters and Matt is the only one that really has a clue. If he would do these simple things, he could finish the series within 2 more books.The book finishes with a very disappointing (ending), if you could call it and ending. That was what keep it from being a 5 star book. My biggest fear at this point is that none of us will live long enough to see and end to this series.At this point, whenever I see anyone reading the first or second books, I tell them to 'stop while they can'. The only reason I continue is because I have gotten this far."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"it's the 10th and complains been pouring since number 4. i bet, though, that readers who appreciate the series far outnumber those &quot;intellectuals&quot; who give their 'literary insight' of what the book should/ought to be. personnaly i pick the book to have a good time for myself, relax and enjoy the read.i've always wondered how other people can sit through a soap opera with its dragging plot. but it doesn't take an 'intellect' to figure that these people do find something entertaining clinging to see what happens next in their chosen series. and i guess that's the key, entertainment. i don't like soaps, but then i don't watch it and i leave those who do be. so people, if you don't like what's going on in the WOT, then just drop it and pick one of Kafka, Tagore and the likes instead.as for the rest of us 'fans', well ... the _h__l_ with them intellects."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"The moment I put this book down after finishing it, I was completely satisfied. I was thinking to myself \\"What a Great Book!\\" and \\"I Love WOT.\\" The book was very entertaining and a great few hours of my life. Then I began thinking through what had happened. I realized that nothing had except for during each character's final chapter. Perrin will meet with Seanchan. Rand will meet with the Seanchan. Mat will meet with all of the Seanchan, not just Tuon. So I guess the title was accurate that it was a crossroads because every character is on the verge of a huge decision. But it appears that in book 11 Rand and Mat will be re-united, if not Perrin also. That makes me want to read the next book in itself. So on to my point, I got on to write my review fully expecting most people to have liked the book, and was shocked when I saw that after 885 reviews the average review was only 2 Stars. Then I started to read the reviews, and they actually started to change my mind about the book. Until this point I was just happy that the books were entertaining, but when I realized that since essentially book 7/8 nothing, NOTHING, significant has occurred (The cleansing is significant, but hasn't been addressed yet so it doesn't count)I became a little angry. I know that I have said this to myself for the last few books, but this time I think that It must be true - Book 11 is set up right now to be one of the best in the series. Things have been snowballing for a few books now, and it appears the snowballs are about to smash into one another. We should all just wait patiently for the next book like the little drones we are because everyone knows that in a couple of years when the next book comes out we will be just as anxious for it as we were for this one, and all of this talk about everyone quitting the series will be forgotten.By the way has anyone else noticed that Path of Daggers and Crossroads of Twilight both ended with Question Marks? (The final chapters, not the epilogues). I'm not an English Major, but I know that a book is not supposed to end with an open-ended question."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"What happened? This book was terrible. I kept dozing. To many wining women. The are like NOW, those petty feminists. I want battles and peoples heads, and bodies blowing apart. These books are getting too cartoonie. The strategies posed by Rand and his crew are sensless. He should have smashed the white tower, making those snobby feminists kneel to his authority. There can only be one head on creature (army) he is forging. Rand is turning into a panzy. Next time he pulls his Heron marked sword out, he'll don his ballet tights on too.I'm starting to think Mr Jordan is a Liberal.(ooooo, thats real low, there less than dung)I still have faith in Mr Jordan, and will get his next book."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Robert Jordan has excelled himself in producing 700 odd pages of largley incomprehensivle drivel.Vacuous, simpering, and wholly unbelievable women march through this tome with the credibility and speed of a ruptured duck. The male sides of the story,seem to specialise in indecision and between them would collectively have the brain of a medium sized walnut.The original storyline had promise but now seems to be bogged down in trivia.

I got this book when it first came out, tried to read it and lost interest. I have half of it to read still and may not even bother. He spends too much time on details which do not carry the story.

I am three hundred pages into &quot;Crossroads of Twilight&quot; and I'm realizing that nothing is going to happen in this book either, aside from someone glaring at someone else, or, for a change of pace, someone staring daggers at someone else.If you are looking to buy this book, you have probably already been hooked into the series by the first few books. If so, then it's probably too late to tell you to wait until this series is finished then buy the first several books and the very last one.I'm getting really annoyed with myself for purchasing the last four books in this waste-of-bookshelf-space series."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"The only reason I bought this book was because I started this series how long ago? 10 years? and I feel like there is some void to be filled, since the Last Battle, the elusive Tarmon Gaidon, is what we all got into this epic dinasaur for. Not that I want the lead character to kick the bucket, but it is definitely time for some action. This book was a complete waste of time... practically one meagre day in the life of every important character in the book... and after 9 installments, there are MANY. However pleasurable the author's writing style, absolutely NOTHING happens to advance the plot... the only saving grace is that the end must be in site, because there is only so much that intelligent readers, and current and former fans, will stomach of this incessant plot thickening process... Jordan spends 700 pages expounding on the nervous twitches of the Aes Sedai, and Elayne's pre-natal problems... get on with it already!! Thank goodness we actually meet the Dark One this trip... however fleetingly... I was beginning to think he was a figment of my imagination!!"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This book is absolutely the worst I have ever read. You might as well make the &quot;cha-ching&quot; sound with page you turn, because all Jordan is doing now is cashing his royalty checks. He ought to be embarrassed about allowing this book to be published. I know I was embarrassed for him when I read it (at least, when I read as much as I could stand).If you do insist on reading this book for some reason, do yourself a favor and just read the first sentence of each paragraph.

What started out as an excellent story line. Has deteriorated into just a big waste of paper and time. This wheel of time seems to have gotten a flat somewhere between book 6 and 7, and even the motor club can't fix it.Jordan stated that there were going to be &quot;13&quot; books in this series? Well the last three had better be 10,000 pages each, if he's going to drag it out this much.It's really bad when the actual center of the story(Rand) only gets an honorable (1 1/4 pages) mention at the very end of the book.Basically this entire book only covers 2-3 days, the same days covered in the last book.I think Jordan has too many charactors doing too many different things to keep this series rolling along.If your new to this series, it might be best to wait 10 or more years for Jordan to finally finish it, before you start reading it. Or you'll end up like the rest of us very dissapointed fans and start to look elsewhere for entertainment."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I read the first book in this series 2 weeks after it was published and have eagerly awaited every installment since. Until this book all my expectations were either met or exceeded. I have never read a book filled with more fluff and less substance than this chapter of RJ's epic saga. There was not a single event until the very last chapter (all 6 paragraphs of it) that was even remotely interesting. Robert Jordan has shown a serious lack of respect for his fans if he believes this book is worthy to be included with all those that have come before. The only people who will enjoy this book are the die hard fans who believe Robert Jordan can do no wrong.[...]P>Sincerely,A very disappointed fan"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Just another rehash of everything that has already happened. It would be easier of course if the books contained a list of characters so that rampant nearly identical spelling could be cleared up, but that would probably double the size of the book. Over and over Jordan reminds us about the past. I already know that Vanin was a horse thief. I don't need to be told again. If I can't remember that, I'm not going to read the book.Jordan needs to give up some of the secrets that we already know. We know the rings in the Aiel waste predict a weird form of the future as well as the three arches. Just let go of some of the secrets. This subplot with Faile and the Aiel is another waste of words. Jordan won't let his righteous character's fall, hell he won't even let them have sex.Finally, the quality of the book is lacking. The glue on the spine is coming off and the binding has separated from the jacket. Unbelievable, a crummy book and a crummy read."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I enjoy chess. I've played chess a lot in my lifetime and I have even enjoyed watching it played in the park when I lived in Sydney. The problem is the idea of watching chess all day is boring to 99% of the population, and so is this book.I used to be like you. I plowed through this series because I started recently in the summer of 2003, when many of the volumes were already released. To deny the fact that the novels have become less interesting over the last few, and especially this one, seems to be a bit of a reach for me.I have been an English major for (ahem) five years now, so I feel pretty aqainted with \\"high literature\\" as many people have put it. And I can't necessarily point out why I have stopped enjoying the series aside from the dragging plotlines. I've read books that have been slow before and enjoyed them.I'll use an example of Lord of the Rings. The popularity of the books, while undeniable, I still find interesting. I enjoy them a lot too, but when you think about it the ending is really bizarre, there really isn't a lot of character development, and there is almost no emotion shown in the books (especially in comparision with the movies).All I know is that people have been reading Lord of the Rings for a long time, and have been taking great joy in it. I've read the book a number of times, and I just can't put it down every time. I love it. I love the characters, the storyline, the battles, and all of that. I have to really find a reason to put it down, even after all of this time.I have no problem putting this series down. I just can't think of a reason to pick it up."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I have read all ten books of Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time, and the last 5 or 6 books have steadily decreased in quality. While I understand Jordan's desire to build a great tapestry of characters and plots, there's a point when enough is enough. And that point was crossed long ago.In Crossroads, we encounter the same fustrating format that has been used in the recent Wheel of Time Books. There are too many subplots. It takes a long time for the reader to finally get interested in what is happening in one subplot, and by the time you are finally not bored, the story cuts to another subplot, and you have to troll through another subplot. It is real drudgery, especially since the book is written with excessive detail in all things.Next is the problem of character multiplication. It seems as if there are an endless number of characters, whose names are all very similar. Given the amount of time it takes for a book in the series to get released, it is simply impossible to remember who is who. And most of the characters are meaningless and play no important role, with new ones seeming to constantly appear.To make matters worse, all the characters are the same. They all have cold stares, scowl every minute, or constantly smooth their skirts and cowls. All of them seem like a real drag to know and all with too much hubris. A million Aes Sedai and Aiel and Seanchan are all running around, and I really can't keep track of who or what anymore.I think the story has gone downhill ever since the death of Moiraine. I am sick of Rand and his Lews Therins psychobable, all the men having not a clue how the women think, and all the women seeming to think they are above each other. There is simply nobody interesting to read about in the book, way too many characters and subplots. The only thing worth looking forward to is when Rand unleashes his power and ends the series for good."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"A turtle, swimming in a sea of peanut butter, would be faster than this.This has got to be the slowest Robert Jordan book ever. I can't believe why there is the need to describe one scene using two to three (sometimes more) pages. Probably, if you took out all the unnecessary details, you'd be left with about 200 to 300 pages, or even less, and still get the same idea. The only thing that makes me continue reading this series is that I've already read Books 1-9 which, for the most part, I enjoyed. I hope his style changes in Book 11, although I'll most certainly read that also whatever happens, if only just to finish the series (coz the storyline is really good)."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Having invested in the story, I read and read and read this book.

I counted 37 lines of text in COT, and I think WH is worse. Additionally, I would have to agree with those of us who say that Jordan is putting more and more meaningless detail in his book for fluff.

The book is just as well written as any of his others, so one can immediatley disregard comments about his style getting worse. Unfortunately there is a lot of bad along with the good, I plowed through this book because I was hoping to get to the point, I didn't, Jordan should have added 50 pages to the first 9 books, rather than write this 10th one. Just about nothing actually *happens* in this book, and I was quite dissapointed by that. Having said that, however, I did very much enjoy reading it (until the bitterly dissapointing conclusion). It was, as it always has been, very interesting to watch the characters stories progress, but there were things missing, the cleansing of saidin had close enough to no relevance to have left it out of the book entirely, and the same can almost be said for Rand's part in CoT. The only thing left to say is, why the hell is Jordan writing New Spring? I don't think any of us really care to read it if we could have book 11 instead, since it does leave us with a lot of cliffhangers.I've gone about nicely contradicting myself here, but despite (or perhaps in spite of) my comments, I did enjoy the read, it did keep me going, I have two pieces of advice to those who want to read it : do not hang on to every word, you will want to burn the book and flush the ashes if you force yourself to read every word.

I read the small portion with Rand in it and then I put it back on the shelf.I have come to believe that Mr. Jordan is merely prolonging the WoT series just to make money. I have long ago revised my opinion of his genius as an author - rather, he's a genius at fooling all his fans and covering up the fact that he doesn't know how to tie up the story and end it; a genius consistently produces quality work.I still want to see the end of the series, but I am NEVER going to buy another book, in spite of the fact that I have the first nine. I have come to the conclusion that buying the next books will only add to Mr. Jordan's wealth and strengthen his resolve to milk the series for all it's worth. It's obvious from his interview that he does not care about his fans nor does he respect their intellect by producing such a mediocre book.I have read all the negative reviews (surprised by the good ones) and I'm amazed by the &quot;loyal&quot; fans who insist they will continue to buy the next book in spite of their frustrations with how bad the series has gotten. Don't you realize that by doing so, you are merely encouraging Mr. Jordan to continue in his pursuit of the almigthy dollar, without regard to your views?A good investor does not continue investing in a failing stock.

Fans who write 5 star reviews on this installment must do so because they simply cannot phatom that Jordan lost it. Admitting that will wreck their world.

At least Winter's Heart had a central event (cleasing the male half of the source) for climax - don't hold your breath for one in Crossroads. Really. There's nothing. Its 680 pages of text have little more than the main characters wandering around being suspicious of everyone, incessant inner monologues about gender roles, and (absurdly) the introduction of new and reputedly powerful characters.

I cannot believe that this novel was published. I guess the editor looked at the name, and then without reading a word, passed it on. It violates so much that a novel - notice I didn't say \\"a good novel\\" - should possess. Including very basic rules that high school students learn. If you are not developing a story or characters, then what are you doing? Robert Jordan mastered three novels, since then they have subsequently gotten worse, to a degree that must break some sort of record. Has a novelist ever fallen so far?Read the last two faults from Caro Clark's Beginners' Four Faults:(3) Tea, Vicar?\\"More tea, Vicar?\\" Angela asked, taking his cup and placing it on the tray beside her.\\"Don't mind if I do,\\" said the Rev. Phelps.\\"That was two sugars, wasn't it?\\" she asked, pouring the fragrant liquid from the heirloom pot into his cup and stirring in the milk. When he nodded, she dropped in two sugar lumps, stirred again, and handed him back the cup.\\"Thank you, my dear,\\" he said, accepting it with a smile.How often have I read loving descriptions of cups of tea being poured, pots of coffee being made, even whole meals cooked and eaten? Or rooms cleaned or decorated, or journeys made? Too darn often. Writers get a high out of conjuring a tableau from thin air, and in the white heat of creation forget that tableaus of mundane details are not exciting. The reader will not share that euphoria. Reading about a cup of tea being poured is about as exciting as watching paint dry. How does this scene help further the plot or character development? It doesn't. The writer simply got carried away with describing everything.Fiction is supposed to be like life, but with the dull bits removed, not spelled out in excruciating detail. Examine your work. Test every scene. Is there anything that you think of as \\"setting the scene\\" or \\"capturing the atmosphere\\"? If there is, cut it. Every scene needs conflict and movement to give it life, and tea for the Vicar has neither.(4) Styrofoam. This is related to Tea, Vicar?, but it arises not from self-indulgence, but panic. Styrofoam is egregious padding novice writers stuff into their novels because they haven't enough story to tell (or think they don't) and need to create word count. Padding is distinguishable because suddenly the forward movement of the story stops dead. Nothing happens for a few pages. I read, I read, and at the end I've learned nothing about the characters I needed to know, nor have the characters done anything essential to the story.Every scene has to propel the plot to the crisis that will resolve the story. Styrofoam does neither. If you fear you haven't enough narrative, add more conflict. Don't give me tours of the countryside, long rambling chats, the characters making travel arrangements, or any other lifeless block of prose. I want action. I want inexorable movement towards the crisis. I want to be gripped. So cut the padding. If that makes your novel too short, re-think your premise, your plot, your primary and secondary characters, and rewrite.If you want to be published, you'll have to cure these faults, because I, your editor, won't do it for you. I'll just send it back.The above (3) and (4) are Copyright 1998 Caro Clarke"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Does anyone else see striking similarities between the recent &quot;novels&quot; put out by RJ and the recent &quot;movies&quot; put out by George Lucas? Both of them appear to be happily languishing in their piles of money while laughing at the buying public which continues to purchase their pointless melodramatic duds.It's as though the two of them got together and said &quot;Want to have a contest to see just how bad a piece of media we can create and yet still have millions pay for it?&quot; I think the most scathing (and heartfelt) thing I can say about this book that has not already been said is that it is WORSE than Attack of the Clowns."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"In the tenth installment of Robert Jordan's The Wheel of Time series, Jordan again intricately and masterfully weaves his fantastic story of a handful of adventurers out to save the world from the sinister cluches of the Dark One. Jordan weaves his tale around familiar and unfamiliar characters alike, mixing in other points of view with battle scenes from centuries past, combining to make a sensational tale full of adventure, romance, and plenty of action.Most importantly, though, Jordan weaves a realistic tale of a man's war within himself, and he realistically and accurately portrays complicated human emotion. This makes the world he has created almost seem real. At times, it feels as if you are a denizen of Jordan's world, empathizing with all the triumph and anguish that his characters feel. This is what makes his very in-depth tale a masterpiece.But, like every book, Jordan's story has a hinderance. His scenes (and introductions especially) are descriptive to a fault, making even the most patient reader squirm. Sometimes, entire pages are used to describe a person entering a room, and prompts the eye to skip past the description. This can make it hard for anybody to &quot;get into&quot; the book, or to even start the series.However, starting the series is a very rewarding exprience once one is used to the depths of the descriptions, and should be read along with the likes of Tolkien, Goodkind, and King."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I did love the book. I am an eight-year veteran of the series and I wait for each book to come out, eagerly and with some small amount of patience.I understand that Crossroads of Twilight wasn't perfect and some people just want these huge action sequences, but I don't understand the backlash of anger in many the reviews. The series has always been a long run series. Along those lines, I anticipate that the novellas will be received with some anger because fans will want the next book to come out sooner and not want to read the prequels. Personally, I really do want to read the prequels and am excited Robert Jordan decided to write them; I am willing to wait for the end because I have been waiting for eight and two years or six won't make that much of a difference.The writing is strong and in the same style Robert Jordan has written the whole series. He persists in describing every piece of clothing and facial expression, which is necessary when there is little action. The political machinations continue, but we do have some real emotional development with Mat and Perrin's actions are a little shocking. What some readers found most exciting in the first few novels was the systematic/tedious removal/killing of the Forsaken. That style story has changed into a more mature grander scale story with our favorite major characters effecting political change throughout the continent.The next story is sure to be action packed and probably more emotionally satisfying for some fans. You can read hints of what is going to happen and you know the end is coming. The ending of Crossroads is more a cliffhanger of a mystery novel than a conclusion of a fantasy novel, which is alternately frustrating and exhilarating. Honestly except the Perrin's point of views, I found this novel a breeze to get through. Anyone who has read previous novels in a day or two, or the whole series in a week like me, should be excited to get through another exciting installment of the Wheel of Time.As For Crossroads of Twilight Specific good parts:I thought the prologue was very interesting, it brought up many views of how the world was reacting to current political trends, that is all life is anyway. Many minor characters brought good views and, as usual, the prologue seemed disconnected from the rest of the novel with a few notable exceptions.The Black Ajah hunt is still ongoing and about to make a break through, except later in the novel Alviarin looks like she is going to hunt the hunters. Also interesting treatment of the \\"Chosen\\" is quite revealing about the Dark One's actual grip on the world. The Domani armies meeting in the prologue is a reaction to Graendal's string pulling there.Gawyn being so close to Egwene for the first time since Fires of Heaven & neither of them knowing it is heartbreaking. Egwene's plot was a surprise for me, I had thought that their would be a battle happening, but it is talk talk talk. Her gradually growing control of the Hall of the Tower and her plotting against the White Tower leading to an ingenious plan to force an end the conflict between the two Aes Sedai groups (you do have to work it out, but the hints aren't too subtle to figure it out). Her plot thread was extremely exciting and satisfying/frustrating (the good kind of frustrating) in the end; it signaled THE END is coming and it will be good.Aes Sedai's joint realization, from both towers and even independents, that the Asha'man are a force to be reckoned with is seemingly the first good idea that has appeared simultaneously among the women of power. Men's real equality will start after the Last Battle, but its precursor is starting. Unfortunately, nobody is really aware of the change of the source except the Asha'man and the Dark One. The Asha'amn's idea on how it happened is quite annoying, but as with anything in Robert Jordan's books, I love to be annoyed by White Cloak prejudice, character non-communication, and closed mindedness of almost everybody about SOMETHING. It feels like a real world where almost everything is broken, people can't get over their own preconceived notions, and change is slow.I did dislike Perrin's point of view, it is getting old and I definitely would like something more to happen. I would have made his part smaller in this book. The absolute best part with him was when he threatens the capture Aiel, bold and strong and NOT pining for Faile was great. Faile's point of view was actually quite interesting, especially considering that she isn't a favorite character of mine, and I much preferred it to Perrin's, whom I like much more than Faile. She has some interesting dilemmas to sort out and lets hope this capture thing doesn't go on much longer.Mat's point of view has been hinted at all along so if you been waiting for him falling in love with Tuon, the Daughter of the Nine Moons, you will be rewarded handsomely, though it isn't all done in this book (when has Jordan ever let something so predestined happen so fast as to only take place in one novel?). The implication in the novel is: Mat is going to get caught. Whether you disagree is for you to decide, but I have many prophecies to back me up.I was not even expecting an appearance by Rand after the cleansing of Saidin, so his small appearance satisfied me."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"i not interested in reading but maybe next 6to 12 months i,ll read it @the bookstore."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I enjoyed this book much more then books 6-8. Although nothing major was accomplished, all characters were active, not just sitting around talking. Also, there was much less &quot;All men are lazy and do nothing but gossip&quot;, &quot;All women need a man to protect them and tell them what to do&quot; and &quot;I know he's the Dragon Reborn, but he'll never win the last battle if I don't teach him what to do&quot;. There was still some of that nonsense though. Like I said, the book was more interesting then normal, and faster paced. It just left me a little disappointed when nothing big had happened at the end. If he had ended (or even advanced) one major storyline (White tower war, Faile's capture, Mat's marriage, Seanchan war, etc) this book could easily have gotten 5 stars."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Like most Jordan fans, I got hooked on the series because Of his ability to write an extremy vivid and detailed world. This book did not disappoint! It was just as good as the last 3 installments, and I will buy it in paperback the day they release it!"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This book is more in the vein of The Path of Daggers, Jordan's eighth. It's definitely a less action packed installation, and unfortunately, too many readers misinterpret less action for less quality. This just isn't true. Jordan uses very different tactics to make this work shine, and shine it does. The discovery of darkhound prints in the snow and the appearance of ghosts as the veil of reality thins are great examples of this. It's just too bad that so many people can't seem to appreciate a great book, simply because there's not much killing. The ending to Winter's Heart was fantastic, but the cliffhanger at the end of this book is also a great way to leave us hanging. This is an excellent series, good enough to advance plot on its own terms, without having to resort to violent final scenes in every book. For that, Jordan has to be commended. This book, like the series as a whole, is a masterpiece."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This book would have been a lot better if the next book (or two) were already written. Although the plot is advanced, there is absolutely no resolution to anything in this book, nor are any major questions answered. Having said this, I still have to say I liked what I read and found what was revealed interesting and thought-provoking. Now if Robert Jordan could only write a book in less than 2 years..."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"if you're expecting alot about Rand then you may be disappointed. he is barely in this book but if you want to find out more about Mat and the unfolding of the prophecies concering him than it offers some progress. but over all i don't think this book should have been as long as it was, Robert Jordan seems to think that because he can write 700 to 1,000+ page books that he always should this book would have been better if he shaved a 200 to 300 pages off. I'm begining to think that Robert Jordan is like a parent who doesn't want to see his/her kids go off to college/leave home he doesn't want to end this story that has been a big part of his life for so long. My advice wait for the next one to come out before reading this one that way hopefully the story will start moving faster again."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Sure, if you've been waiting for the last three years, it might be a bit dissapointing that Rand didn't defeat the Dark One, or Egwene didn't seize Tar Valon, but a lot more happened than you might think. The series is reaching a climax, which will result in Tarmon Gaidon, and this is book is simply laying the groundwork. My advice to all those who have been waiting with bated breath, start over at book one, read all the way through to Crossroads, and you won't be dissapointed. (There are no beginnings or endings to the Wheel of Time, but it is &quot;A&quot; beginning.) Regardless, the writing style of Jordan is beautiful, and something to be admired. Don't worry, in book 11 or 12, the pace will really start to pick up."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Once again Robert Jordan has taken us on a grand adventure.

Keep reading and enjoy the ride!"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Jordan needs to get back on track and just tell the bloody story...he spends way too much time giving the most minute detail about about things that don't add anything to the moving the story ahead."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Mister Jordan is definitely short of ideas. I discovered the Wheel of Time five years ago and rushed throough the first eight books, but my enthusiasm paled by book 7. It is really quite simple: from book 7 onwards the author had too many subplots to do more than devote a few chapters to each of them.Book 10, alas, is no exception: more of the same plodding pace, of page after page where nothing happens but where the reader is introduced (or re-introduced) to a bewildering cast of characters (per subplot there are at least a dozen of them, and my memory is not that good, unfortunately, to hold all of them in). Add to that the problem of names that sound too much alike (Mariline and Merilline being two), and you will understand why one would get lost in there.If you want to buy the book, beware: things are not really getting that exciting, and personally I got bored enough to drop the book, which would never have happened with the first one in the series.The series, as a whole, has lost its momentum, and one gets the feeling that Jordan is milking it for all it is worth while trying to figure out what happens next (how he will tie all those strands of narrative together, for instance...)"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Nothing happens. Nothing happens. I say it twice to emulate the author. But I stop short of repeating it for 700 pages. This book is a disgrace. RJ should be ashamed of himself. His editor should be ashamed of himself. The pulished should be ashamed of themselves. Finally, I should be ashamed of myself for buying it after the other books in the series were so disappointing.Reading this book is like being stuck in an elevator with the musac blaring. A shot in the head would be merciful. RJ better hope I never catch him in an elevator!"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"thanks so much for a 100 page 700 page novel. i think it is amazing that someone could compile a book called winters heart, baffle their readers with an emense amount of brainless babble about what color someone's skirt, birches, or dirt are, and achieve the miniscule task of crossing the street and stumbling through barely half of spring. this story line would have been extremely interesting had it happened in the prologue. i have supported you through ten books, however, if you really expect your readers to believe that your players are as stupid as you have them acting and wish to continue to insult my intelligence by continuing this epic beyond its' normal corse of life, then i quit you. i suppose that i may be alone in this opinion, but i duobt it!!!"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I can't do any better than the others before me sharing my disgust with Robert Jordan's lack of respect for once-loyal readers. So instead I'll express my lack of confidence in TOR and its editorial staff. If they can let an author of Jordan's talent submit such a piece of drivel,then how can I trust that they will do any better a job with less talented authors? ....An editor can do so much to improve a book but the best thing he or she can do is be honest with the author and not publish something like this.Tor, you're taking a hit on this one. Booksellers, reduce your inventory."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I'm not sure how to put this, but if you are considering this buying this book, DON'T. I have been buying books in this series since it first came out over ten years ago. The first 3 or 4 kept me enthralled. I would sit down and read hundreds of pages at a time simply because I could not put it down. The excitement and suspense of not knowing what could happen next kept me more than just involved, it made me live the books.The most recent books, Crossroads of Twilight included, have changed dramatically. I wonder if it is truly Robert Jordan even writing these. That's how bad they have become. Where a 700page book from early in the series would last me a week, this latest reincarnation has lasted me nearly a month and I had to drive myself mad to even pick it up.The reason I say this is because he has changed from writing an action packed suspense filled fantasy to writing a fantasy version of a romance novel. Whats her name walks in wearing this and that with this expression and this is her background and this is the current weather and the walls looks like this. WHO FRIGGIN CARES !!! Give me the basics and let my imagination draw the picture. I don't need a chapter to explain an Aes Sedai's dress! Plus, don't tell me the names of each and every character that is in the book, I WON'T REMEMBER ANYWAY !!!As you can tell, I'm quite furious. End this series. Put it out of it's misery. So far, I have each and every hardback from the series. If I was to start over, I wouldn't even collect the paperbacks.This book doesn't even deserve a place on the magazine stack by the toilet."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"First off, let me say I'm a fan of Jordan and will most likely (or unfortunately) have to read everything else he writes in this series. Like everyone else, I'm hooked. I just hope, by the grace of God, that he stays with us long enough to finally finish this story!What he's doing here is classic fantasy novel marketing. Write some incredible first few books in a series, masterfully develop great characters, then drag it out for as many volumes as possible and for maximum profit. How else can it be explained? He's got this process down, and he and his publisher are laughing all the way to the bank!Okay, now bring on Book 11. I can't wait!!"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This book was a waste of money plain and simple. Only about one-third of it covered the the main characters. I believe that when you are at the TENTH book of a series you don't really need to bring in about a hundred new charecters. Jordan should have focused this book on Matt, Perrin, and Rand. Once the series is done you can tell us what Egwene, Elayne, the Black Tower, the White Tower, the Senchean and all the other ... were doing. I think there was only two chapters out of 700 pages about Rand. That was just sad. Loyal Wheel of Time readers that don't have the hardcover yet save your money and wait the 3 years untill this one comes out on paperback."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Unfortunately, Mr. Jordan has succumbed to what I call the \\"castle needs a new roof\\" syndrome (as popularized by Anne McCaffrey on her various rehashing of the same old Pern stories over and over and over......) by taking a fantastic series, and then turning it into drivel in order to cash in. This book does not move anything forward; at the rate he is bringing the series to a \\"close\\", I suspect it will be three to four more books (i.e., another DECADE) before this series concludes. Unlike Ms. McCaffrey's books, I will continue to buy them - but I think I'll stick to either paperback or used for the next one rather than pre-ordering and waiting anxiously."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Crossroads of Twilight completes a death spiral that has plagued the last few Wheel of Time books.

Half of the book takes place before/during the Cleansing, anyway. Zzzzzzzz... Don't waste your money buying the hardback. Borrow it from a friend or a library, or if you're a die hard fan you can wait for the paperback. Idea: Just skip it.

Zzzzzzzzz..."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This is the tenth book in Robert Jordan's long-running and immensely popular Wheel Of Time Series, and one gets the feeling that all the various plot lines are starting to link up. Though this book moves at a slightly slower pace than the others, the tension builds to such a point that it seems it will snap any moment. It really seems as though the last battle is coming.Elein and Egwane both fight to claim their lawful positions in the world, Elein to assume her rightful thrown and Egwane to unite the white tower behind Rand. Both are on opposite sides of the scale. Elein is under siege from her enemies while Egwane takes the fight to hers. The black aja are much more active, with their spies seemingly everywhere. Perrin struggles to rescue his wife against nearly impossible odds and Matt is on the run with the kidnapped Daughter Of The Nine Moons (who by the way, I still can't stand.)The prose is as richly detailed as ever, and the narrators Kate Reading and Michael Cramer once more do a tremendous job. As for the ending, That has to be Jordan's best cliff hanger so far. I'm so glad the next book is on it's way. I don't know how fans have held up during their two year wait."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This book was a perfect blend of suspense and action.

My attitude and the whole experience of the book changed dramatically when I decided to reread the whole series from the beginning with a yearly break in between. The reader of this series must understand that unlike most series where authors retains just main character but develops somewhat independent storyline this particular series is one huge book with 10 or more volumes to it and must be read as such. It is nearly impossible to comprehend and hold the feeling of the book while you waiting for the next book to come out. I am not even going into the impossibility of maintain all the details of the story in your head for well over a year at a time.The magic transformation from the ugly duckling to the beautiful swan happened when I read the book the way it was intended to read - from the first page of \\"The Eye of the World\\" to the last page of \\"Crossroads of Twilight \\" in one continuous reading scission.In the end the only advise I may give to other readers is to either reread the whole series from the beginning every time a new book comes out or just way a couple of more years till the last page of the series is written and then read it from the beginning till the end."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Sure it took place at approx. the same time as the last book, but you get a more in depth look at what is going on.

Each major character gets a few consecutive chapters and Jordan moves on to the next. Either Jordan got to a point where he said &quot;good enough&quot; and stopped writing, or the plot has gotten so involved in his head he has no choice but to take up an entire book and still not have gotten anywhere. It does not help that the major charcters are all spread out. A great read for anyone who follows the series, just do not expect any major plot breakthrough.

The largest amount of complaints about the book come from readers who want to know the plot. The plot is interesting. However, the prophecy and foreshadowing in the first books have already revealed the ending. Then there are complaints about a lack of action. Action is exciting but it is not what makes a book great.I know that this seems pedantic. The Wheel of Time is about characters. It gets better with time. After reading the books a second time, the characters get more interesting. Knowing the plot, it is possible to focus on the smaller things, characters, culture, hints, details. Great books have great characters. This book does. The series is worth reading several times.

Though this book does lack the fast pace of the first books it does bring all the story plots to the same moment in time. There are many moments in the book which draw the reader in and leave some plot lines to be further developed. Much of &quot;Crossroads of Twilight&quot; deal with what the other caracters were doing ath the time of the climactic event in the last book. Thus I would more likely dub this book being instead of book 10 more like book 9b. I don't know about you but I would be intimidated to read a 1200 page novel.

If anything, a setup piece should hook the reader in, make him want to read to the finish. Falling action belongs at the ending of a work, not in the middle, and falling, falling, falling is all this series is doing now.Yes, it is high time Robert Jordan wrapped it up. His descriptions and language are getting repetitive, as can be expected in a series of this length - not that that excuses it. I feel that his style is very dry and unexciting in the first place; with big ol chunks of straight, in-your-face, clunky, repetitive description, it seems exponentially more sleep-inducing.Not recommended for public consumption, this book. At least I won't want for toilet tissue for awhile."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Wow. After how much I loved the first few books, it's hard to believe I'd give this one three stars (and find that I'm actually being really generous).If you've read any of the reviews, then you've probably figured out that nothing much happens in this book. In the last book, the male half of the One Power gets cleaned. In this book, it stays clean. And that's about it.Well, it isn't *really* it, but it feels like it. Actually some kind of interesting things happen to Mat. His thread with Tuon was about the only thing that I cared about in CoT.I think that the major problem with the book is that Jordan has become obsessed with the details of all his characters. The party as we knew it was split up and the book tries to provide us with updates on all of their whereabouts. This is admirable, and I'm inclined to give Jordan some credit because he seems to really be trying to live up to the political landscape that he created in the earlier books. It's understandable because that richness was one of the best things about the Wheel of Time.However, as a reader, it's getting really hard for me to care about these people. There are *way* too many side characters featured and I'm getting sick of trying to remember every Aes Sedai from the last book to think how they fit in the bigger picture. I understand that he needs to do this since the main characters can't be everywhere, but as a reader it's confusing and annoying, in that order.I'm probably going to see this ride through to the end.

You've heard this in many other reviews with the usual motive of milking the cash cow. Well, I don't buy the cash cow motive. I'll try and define his motive leaving out some of the terms that I think got my previous review rejected.I think Mr. Jordan likes to watch his readers struggle with many of the clues hidden in his books (half the light of the world, give up the ax or the hammer, will the song be found , who killed ....). You get the idea. Many of these issues were introduced in the first book 10 years ago !!!! Why bother with this foreshadowing unless it has some relevance later. At first, I think it did. I think Jordan had a plan for where he wanted to go. Then came the book signings, web sites, fan adulation ....... . Jordan has been asked \`Who killed ...' hundreds of times. Why not answer this question unless Jordan enjoys watching his readers squirm. I think he has even admitted this in some of his interviews. I can't and don't respect this.

It was written by David Eddings and it was titled, \\"Pawn of Prophecy.\\" It featured the young farmer of unknown parentage who sees a mysterious shadowy cloaked figure trailing him at times--but it's always gone. It has a blacksmith of virtue and oh-so-practical values who doesn't like to hurt people or be called \\"Lord.\\" It has a mysterious dark-haired, beautiful sorceress who is very imperious, allows no nonsense, and can often be found brushing her hair before bed. It also has an old storyteller who has more skills and knowledge than others would believe--he's more than he appears. Oh, and there's a connection between the main characters and wolves. Jordan has ripped off most of these elements in this book but FAILS to cite his source, which to me makes this plagarism.I then read an interesting book by Frank Herbert, called,\\"Dune.\\" It featured these butt-kicking desert people who are SO tough that even their old, their women, and their children fight well and can take out even the best warriors with their thumbs tied together. Jordan has ripped off most of these elements in this book but FAILS to cite his source, which to me makes this plagarism.I also read this book by George R R Martin, called, \\"A Storm of Swords,\\" in which a main character lost his hand and then became a more richly layered, interesting good/evil character afterwards.

The name says it all, it is the crossroads, where vital decisions have been made by the main charactes and team; Egwene is deciding whether to attack or negotiate with Tar Valon; Matts decision to marry daughter of the nine moons with may effect Rands relationship with the Seachan; Elaynes attempts to win the vote of the houses majority in order to gain the throne in Caemlyn; Perrin trying to find a way to save his Faile and find out the nature of the prophet of the dragon reborn. All of these decision will directly effect the outcome of book 11. It is twilight which sets up the books mood, not quite day, not quite night; the tides are about to turn and is just within reach, this turn of events must happen in eleven or I will suspect Jordan doesn't know what he is doing.Although this is what the book is supose to be, it was still a little hard to get through, only smal moments kept my interests. A long wait for the next book, will have to wait.Mitch"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This book is not as bad as many reviewers suggest it is. One of the secrets to this series is to re-read all the books before the next one comes out, then it flows much better. This books biggest problem however, is that there is not one plot line - of the many Jordan has introduced, that gets resolved and therefore the book leaves you unsatisfied at the end. So it's merely a transitional book to get us to the next one. If the next one starts to resolve some of these then this book will be worth it if not there is always George R.R.

I liked the story line so far but always found the constant descriptions of how much lace and embroidery was on the &quot;bodice&quot; of dozens of dresses a bit much. Crossroads of Twilight is a whole book of this sort of thing but with no real story line development. What a fool I was to buy this in hardcover. Wait until this hardcover is on the bargain books table. It shouldn't be long now."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I personally refused to read anything concerning this book before I could get my hands on my own copy. In the previous books I've stayed faithful, and have always found something in each book that was great. (Which was a stretch for Path of Daggers) Now I'm sort of wishing I had.It's not that Jordan has suddenly started writing in a different way than in his previous books. The problem with this book is that it does not move forward the plot of the story a single iota. Not one element of the plot is changed in a signifigant (or interesting) way. Too much time is spent on Egwene and WAY too much centered on Elayne and the pointless succession of the throne.I am not a serious literary critic, but I think that I've stumbled across Jordan's problem. He seems to be focusing hundreds of pages (in his last few books) on unneeded details about the different cultures that populate his world. Kind of like he re-read Tolkien, who did this effortlessly throughout all of his books, and is now trying to make up for this by explaining the exact rules that govern an Aes Sedei speaking to the Hall...and other such unwanted details. Another thing I've noticed, he has started making jumps in plot as a substitute for describing action. One second the Seanchan are just landing, now they are taking all of the southwest of the continent. Did I miss a chapter in between?I'm not going to reveal too much about the events in the story, as they're pretty few and far between as it is. I rated the story three stars simply because when Jordan does hit his stride (you can't go over 600 pages without hitting it once or twice) he shows why the series started so strongly: he can grab you when you wants to.To wrap it all up, if I had it to do all over again I would have waited for the paperback. It continues the story you may love, and you may be drooling to find out what happens, but you can wait a little while longer before you are disappointed."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I started reading the Wheel Of Time series over ten years ago since there were only three books available which were amazing but the last ones have gotten worse and worse especially considering the wait between each one. I was really hoping that after Rand FINALLY accomplished something at the end of the last book that the series would start to pick up again in pace. This book was completely the opposite of that.There are no battles, no forsaken, no major magic used or any real conflicts just a bunch of characters treading water. At the end, they are basically in the same situations as they were at the start with no plot resolution or character development whatsoever. Rand doesn't even appear until around page 550 gets less time than some minor characters. The major players have no interaction at all which is especially disappointing considering they have the capability of instantaneous travel!The only reason I even finished the book was that I starting skimming pages and skipping the ones describing the weather, clothes, how much this character hates men or other drivel. I started hoping the Dark One would escape and kill all these whining characters so at least something would happen.It's become completely obvious that Jordan is just milking the cash cow for all it's worth by stretching it out as long as possible. He needs a decent editor to filter out all of the garbage and force the series towards a conclusion but at this point it doesn't look like that's going to happen as long as the books keep selling.If you feel like you have to read this one because you've been following the series then check it out at a library although honestly you could skip it and not miss a thing."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"The final battle will be Rand fighting the Dark One to start time back up again. As it is, Shaitan has managed to stop the wheel of time. Folks, this book has got to be the prelude to the final battle. I swear to Him above - all time has stopped in this book. Holy smokes. I'm starting to think that RJ died and that an admin is using MS Word to regurgitate his last 3 volumes.Wow."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I loved the first six books. Absolutely. Maybe not the ends of the first two, where Rand seemingly killed the Dark one both times -- but once Jordon realized the popularity and the scope he could achieve with the world he was creating, the series became absolutely brilliant. Books three through six are as good as any fantasy ever written.Then things slowed down. It was alright when book seven was slower than the first six because so much had been happening, but then book eight was even slower, and book nine even slower than that. Almost everyone complained, and begged Jordan to increase the pace, to start tying up some of the many unimportant subplots he had for some reason created, and to start moving things forward again. Enough with the politics and agonizing over decisons. Enough with the politcs and nothing happening. Enough with the politics and ever growing cast of useless political infighters. The politics were interesting as a background for the story -- but not as the story itself.In response, after two years of waiting, Jordan has given us book ten -- in which once again nothing happens. Nothing. If I hadn't enjoyed the first six books so much, I would never have finished this one. If Jordan hadn't created some very powerfull characters that I cared about so much in the first six books, I wouldn't have been able to stomach all the pointless, bland, anoying, time wasting characters he's concocted for the last few installments. Characters that take up enough space to relegate Rand to minor suporting status in this newest book.But Jordan doesn't realize that we don't need new characters. We don't need new subplots. And, dear God, we don't need any more politics. And another thing, he seems to assume that his fans are so devoted that we remember every detail of what every character is up to at all times, despite the similiar sounding names, the huge cast, and the large breaks between books. But I certainly don't. I read bwtween fifty and sixty books a year, watch movies, work full time, play games, hang out with friends -- I don't spend my life memorizing houses, names, plots within plots, and just waiting the two years between books to prove that I remember every little detail of what every little minor character is doing and/or plotting. But Jordan despite filling page after page with words that many of his fans have trouble slogging through, can't seem to see fit to remind us of things that have happened in previous books. Instead of introducing a character that went off on a pointless quest many years back (real world time) and reminding us what that quest was, or what the character's motivation was, or who they're planning to betray, or whatever, he seems to go out of his way to give as few clues as possible -- as if he's punishing those of us not devoted enough to dig through the previous books to remind ourselves.Anyway, as many others have said, this book is merely about hundreds of people continuing to try to minipulate each other, women being brats, bullies, or nags (which is getting REALLY old,) and nothing actually moving the story forward. I give it two stars only because of fond remeberences of the past.To sum up, I have stopped recomending this series to anyone. I will finish it because the first six books will make me, but I won't try to convince anyone to subject themselves to the frustration of the last four. Hopefully the next book will make me change my mind. Hopefully the pay off of the final books in the series will make these last few worth slogging through. I've been a fan of Jordan's since reading Conan the Victorious probably fifteen or sixteen years ago, and I know he can be a tremendous writer. Hopefully he shows us what he can do with the next book. Hopefully some of the greatest characters in fantasy and one of the greatest fantasy worlds ever goes out in style. But I said the same thing after book nine."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Robert Jordan is an accomplished writer and I would be the last one to argue that point. In the Wheel of Time series he created four fantasy masterpieces, two average books, three duds and then this one. The previous book (The Path of Daggers) had me really upset, but despite the miserable story progress at least its epilogue had a promise of major things to come in book number ten. Unfortunately, after a two year wait a bitter disappointment again. Let's see: Mat Cauthon and Tuon are still fleeing the Seanchan, dice rolling in Mat's head - roughly 200 pages; Perrin still hunts the Shaido to free Faile, his smell sense telling a long story - another 200 pages; Caemlyn and Tar Valon are still besieged and the battles are yet to be joined with Aes Sedai giving their icy stares roughly every third line - about 100 pages; miscellaneous fluff to fill the space - about 150 pages. Resolutions to previous plots - about 3; new story twists a plots - about 15, opening a possibility of another 25 books of the same junk character. The gullibility of the faithful Jordan fans may have just reached another defining level given the number of these books already sold. Mr. Jordan is laughing all the way to the bank and with the half a million dollars worth of marketing propaganda pushing this trash we are likely in for quite a number of similar books to come. Travesty to be certain; if you insist on reading it, wait for your public library to spend the cash."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"(No spoilers)Let me start to say that I once was an RJ fanatic and loved the series. I have read most of the books 3+ times. Lord of Chaos in my eyes was the best book, and I believe it has been downhill from there.This book \\"is bad\\".Before I started, I read a review (I think on dragonmount) about how this book was completely different from the last 3, and how lots of things happened this book. It also mentioned how this book seemed to finalize some plotlines and was awesome. Looking back, I'm not sure the reviewer read the same book as I.I can summarize this whole book as saying it follows the trend of the last 3 books. NOTHING HAPPENS. There is maybe 1 out of 680 pages of the book where something happened (yeah the last page). The whole book takes place during the day that Rand cleans the taint, and the following week or so. Let me just say that it really isn't an eventful week.About the only positive thing about this book is that RJ mixes the chapters up a lot better than the prior books 3 books. I was never truely \\"bored\\" reading the book (yes I read every freakin page without skimming), but I can't say I found it overly interesting. He definitely has taken describing every freakin button on every person's coat to the extreme.Honestly, if you a reading reviews for the book, and are DEBATING buying it, don't bother reading it. But if you read every shred of Wheel of Time material, well you probably won't be influenced by this review anyway. Also if you haven't read the other 9 books, don't consider starting with this, start from book 1.My advice if you read the book is to keep your expectations in check, so you won't be disappointed. After reading the dragonmount review, I was very very disappointed.

Legend fades to myth and even myth is long forgotten when the age that gave it birth comes again ... There are neither beginnings nor endings to the turning ...\\" of Jordan's plot writing.It seems that these words not only introduce the constant turning of the wheel, they also describe the workings of Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time. Though begun, it seems that it will probably never end. Have hope though, the wheel weaves as wheel wills. The wheel will never stop turning and Rand al'Thor will more likely die from a failed liver due to all of the mulled wine he drinks rather than on a trolloc's lance at Tarmon Gaidon. By the next turning of the Wheel (probably in November of 2005 at the current release of books), Jordan's legend will have faded to myth and I will probably have forgotten it.Running at 670 pages, the story runs concurrenty with the story of the last book, for those hoping for spoilers, there really aren't any to be given. There just isn't any real new stuff hashed out. Only in the last 100 pages or so does the novel really \\"begin\\" and truly introduce new material that wasn't completely transparent if you have read any of the other books of the series.For those who are considering whether or not to buy the book, it is well worth the wait it will require at your local library to acquire it. While it is a good enough read (it is nowhere near the caliber of Jordan's earlier works in the Wheel of Time), it is probably not worth the [money] that it will require to purchase it.In short, I found the novel to be redundant and dissapointing. Especially lackluster given the two year wait, I look forward to the next novel.

I think that the rumours are true about the author's self destructive life style. He has obviously lost a large number of neural pathways and has burned out his brain.This book was written by ROBOT Jordan. He is obviously on cruise control and living in some kind of artificial simulated reality where writing is a program and text is reproduced according to alogrithm. I think TOR needs to step in and have a real live author help pull his strings for him.. Kind of like what Geppeto did for Pinnochio. Better yet bring in a faith healer or an exorcist. All I know is that Jordan is going to need some major mojo or voodoo to re-animate his &quot;cold dead hands&quot;....Hopefully it will happen soon or else all we'll be left with is a pile of dust and a test pattern...."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Well, my fellow WoT fans, this is the book we all feared would come--a book where Jordan stooped to filling pages with virtually meaningless content, knowing that we would still read it.

There are only a few things of remote importance that happen in this book. I recommend that you spare yourself the agony and read an online plot summary instead.

I screamed with frustration nightly to my wife after reading 150 pages that redescribed what each person looked like, what they liked to wear, and how nervous they were.

The women wear colorful dresses though.Having said that, I feel the necessity to warn you, this is just another in Jordan's long-winded typewriter finger poundings, and \\"The Crossroads of Twilight\\" is just that. The decisions are made for future books, and yes your future money, are just a little too lackluster for your average reader. Yes, the decisions made are important, but not 600 plus pages important. Dragging it out the way Jordan has, left me with nice material to go to sleep by, but little else. The women wear colorful dresses though. As complicated as the series is, you could just skip this book and move to the next one to catch up, and save about 25 bucks.Rand the main character is only available for about 20 pages and then he's gone with movement in the shadows and out side of the main story. The women wear colorful dresses though.The bottom line is any book I can put down with only a page and a half left wasn't worth all the poor trees it took to get it published.

Through seven books Jordan delivered a sweeping story filled with action, excitement and suspense. I don't know what happened after that, but the series has deteriorated ever since. This book is so slow moving that by its end no one in the book except those involved even know about the climactic events of the previous book. More minor plots are begun, with none of the previous ones closed. None of the major plots moves forward. None of the major characters does, says or experiences anything particularly interesting. There is no action, and no suspense. After following this series for ten books and some 6,000 - 7,000 pages, I'm dropping out. Somewhere out there are writers who care enough about their readers to tell a good story. I'm going to stop wasting time on Jordan and go find them."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Lets cover the obvious points quickly. First, this is indeed a masterfully detailed chapter in a massive saga. Second, this book will not silence the critics of the pacing of the last three to four installments because it just crawls. Third, if you have ever read another massive fantasy saga (such as the Amber novels) you realize that there is a difference between pacing and sheer ponderousness (which this book suffers from). Fourth, those of us who embarked upon this saga are doomed to purchase every remaining book (whose timelines have now been reduced to the same passage of time as it takes the average reader to read this book), but if you have not spent a mini fortune on the Wheel of Time saga yet, for pity's sake go buy George Martin's Song of Fire and Ice saga instead.

In rebuttal to the rare reviewer who seemed to enjoy the book, I would say that one has to ask why is the plot moving at this snail's pace to which you only seem to be able to draw one of the following conclusions:a - Jordan is deliberately padding the storyline to make more moneyb - Jordan has gained a view of himself as so brilliant that he &quot;knows better&quot; than his readers what makes a good story or that he has deluded himself into thinking that he is singularly gifted and has a vision of the story that is simply to complex for his less capable readers to follow.I will I suppose give him the (slight) benefit of the doubt and suggest that (b) is closer to the truth than (a) but either way as a series WOT is dead. It's been arguably 3000+ pages since the story last had tightness, wit or engagement.

They have been travelling around their little continent for almost two years, jumping from place to place through portals, gateways and alternate universes, shuffling their groups comtiniously.At the same time, all the villains that were killed in earlier books have been reincarnated under different personas (sometime under different sexes altogether!) while a few new ones, using an even \\"evil-er\\" type of evil have also appeared.Robert Jordan keeps inventing the most ridiculous plot \\"twists\\" to shuffle all this even further and produce yet another meaningless 700 pages every year. Everyone is plotting against everyone else, no one trust anyone else, entire armies are dislocated and ending up guarding or attacking the wrong kingdoms, at least two queens that I recall have been dethroned and are being help captive by unwitting savages, just a bout every person alive can \\"channel\\" and at least four of five distinct factions have formed among them.What a joke! PLEASE, do not waste your money on this.... Ther are a lot of good books out there."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Whatever happened to Rand? You know...the Dragon Reborn? Robert Jordan has lost sight of the MAIN character in this last book. Im sick of Mat Cauthon and Perrin Goldeneyes Aybara with their shallow plots, mainly courting and love interests. Remember, Mr. Jordan, that Rand Al'thor and his battle against the encroaching darkness is the main plot line...not the sub-plot. I suspect that Robert Jordan is no longer out to right a piece of literature but is only out to make a quick buck."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Oh for crying-out-loud, give it a rest will you Mr Jordan? Either kill someone out or close of some of these sub-plots 'cause I've found reading your pedantic novels mind-numbing. I've spent my last dollar on this series, and I suggest to you to STOP MILKING IT. As a writer, when you place unsolved/unresolved issues out there for the protagonists, you put the reader into a state anxiety. \\"Will so-and-so overcome this one? Will so-and-so sucumb/triumph?\\" Haven't really seen that yet. Just more pain and more un-resolved issues and a greater amount of anxiety as the \\"journey of reading pain\\" continues. I kept hoping you'd get somewhere. You're Lost. Stop by the side of the road, ask for directions. Buy a ...map!Take a page from other authors in Fantasy - Characters die, issues get resolved, character development advances - it does not stagnate.I give this work 0 stars (but am not allowed to) and wouldn't mind a rebate on my time and injury to my wallet.

Books 7-9 of the Wheel of Time all start to slow down the plot more and more, but there's still enough forward momentum and enough major events - especially in the climax of Winter's Heart - that the books remain enjoyable to read. But Crossroads of Twilight resembles nothing so much as a novel-length epilogue to the major events that ended Winter's Heart, as all of the characters react and puzzle about what to do next. Plotlines stall out with no progress; characters debate their actions and reach decisions just as their portion of the book comes to a close; and just when things start to happen, you turn the last page and the book is over. With dozens of new-ish characters, chapters upon chapters of intrigue about storylines that feel extraneous to the events that drive the series, Rand not showing up until 3/4 of the way through the book, and more, Crossroads of Twilight is truly an inessential entry in a series that I really love as a whole. When I first read Crossroads, I was livid; after all, I had waited two years for the book, and would have at least another two years until the next one, and what I got was a book in which Jordan added nothing to his series. I had hoped that a reread would allay some of those complaints, or that I would be less irked since I didn't have to wait for the book/for the next entry. And yes, the wait is gone, but I'm still frustrated and irritated by just what a waste this entry in the series really is. Knife of Dreams, the next book, is a step in the right direction, but this book was enough to kill off some people's love for the series, and I can't really blame them for that."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Don't waste your time, read the wikipedia article and move on.

The series rebounds considerably in the next volume, Knife of Dreams, but I think it's safe to say that unless you're a masochist of the highest order, you can easily skip this book and read a Wikipedia plot summary without missing anything.The book takes the characters from where they were at the close of Winter's Heart and ends with almost everyone ... in exactly the same place. Matt is still on the run from the Seanchan with Tuon, Perrin is still trying to get Faile back from the Shaido, Elayne is struggling to regain her throne, and Rand and Nynaeve are recovering from the big event at the end of Winter's Heart. The big event closing Winter's Heart is repeated here several times, but since no one is privy to what caused it, there's no discussion about the impact of that event on the world or than \\"Wow, something huge just happened!\\"A lot of the set up that occurs in this book could have happened in a much more condensed fashion. I think it's pretty clear that Jordan was suffering from a case of writer's block, or found himself incapable of wrapping up his series, so he decided to tread water.I gave up on this book the first time I tried to read it when it originally came out, but made it through my Kindle read-through by sheer force of will. The bright side of all this is that Knife of Dreams is significantly better -- a real return to form.

The plot doesn't move and the characters spend too much time being themselves while the world, and the forsaken, continue along at a much faster pace behind the scenes. I ended up purchasing the audio version so I wouldn't give up after the first 100 pages.This book is a test. A test to see if you are willing to continue to read despite the pacing. Because after this, the end is really in sight and it looks to be a great ending. Perhaps we can cut Jordan a little slack for having a slow book in a massive series rather than a slow point in a single book. From what I understand, CoT was also supposed to be part of book ten but didn't fit. A problem that Jordan himself has acknowledged.So in the end is it worth it? I say yes. Though it is much easier to get through if you get the audio."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This is where the series finally starts to get its legs back under it, and I think I figured out why: Jordan went about writing it the wrong way.Let me explain: Following book six, Lord of Chaos, the series separated into five major storylines, which have thus far stayed pretty independent of each other. They've progressed at different rates, with different narrative structures, and have occupied different amounts of page space, and overall they synced up pretty poorly. The five major stories that I've spotted are these:Leading the rebel Aes Sedai, Ewene al'Vere, the Amyrlin-in-Exile, has deftly manipulated her people into a war against the White Tower and Elaida, the woman who usurped the office of Amyrlin and drove a wedge between the sisters. Originally intended to be a puppet Amyrlin, Egwene has proven herself very good at managing people who are highly resistant to being managed. Her goal is nothing less than the deposing of Elaida and the reunification of the White Tower, no matter what the cost. It's a story of politics, scheming and manipulation, all leading up to what must be terrible war.Elayne Trakand is fighting her own political war as she attempts to become the Queen of Andor. Under normal circumstances, this would be no problem. Her mother, the former Queen, is presumed dead, which would pretty much make Elayne a shoo-in. Unfortunately, Morgase ended her reign rather badly (she was under the control of one of the Forsaken at the time, but no one in Andor knows that), so half the Great Houses in Andor who should be supporting Elayne are very reluctant to do so. She's in a political battle which will not only decide the throne of Andor, but will also affect the world.In another part of the world, Perrin Aybara is hunting for the people who kidnapped his wife. The Shaido, a renegade clan of Aiel who refuse to acknowledge Rand as their Chief of Chiefs, are spread out across the land, and they bring terror, blood and death with them. Faile Aybara has been taken prisoner by them, and only quick thinking and some unexpected allies are keeping her alive. Perrin is determined to find her, whatever the cost to his body or soul.Outside of Ebou Dar, Mat Cauthon has single-handedly committed enough crimes against the Seanchan Empire to earn himself a painful death many times over. He has not only allowed three Aes Sedai to escape their clutches, not only spirited out three sul'dam, who know a secret that could break the Empire, but he has kidnapped the Daughter of the Nine Moons, High Lady Tuon - the daughter of the Seanchan Empress. His ragtag group of refugees have only one goal in mind - to get away from the Seanchan. But Mat knows there are stranger fates in store for him, not the least of which is his fated marriage to Tuon.Finally, we have the central character in this whole saga - Rand al'Thor. When last we saw him, he was cleansing saidin - the half of the One Power that is used by men - of the poisonous taint laid upon it by the Dark One thousands of years ago. This was yet another step in preparing for the Last Battle that he, as the Dragon Reborn, but one day fight. He has armies at his command, Aes Sedai sworn to serve him, three women who love him, and a madman inside his own head. His only goal is to stay same and live long enough to save the world. Even that is looking like it might not happen....Now any one of those storylines might make for a really good book by itself, and therein lies the solution to the sagginess of this part of the series. They're all interesting stories, but they all move at different paces, climax at different points, and have vastly different themes and atmospheres. In order to jam them all together into the Wheel of Time books, Jordan had to play fast and loose with chronologies, often backtracking in one story so that he could catch up in another. What's more, moving from one storyline to another was jarring and unpleasant, making it a chore to actually read the books.What he could have done was to create five mini-series following Lord of Chaos, perhaps of two or three books each. Each series could flow at its own pace, and stay focused on one of the five major characters, with no break or interruption in the story's flow. Each story would have been allowed to develop freely, and then they would all come back together to re-integrate into the main series, which would once again present a more unified narrative that brings us to the end.Or even - and this is something I'm pretty sure has never been done - let the five storylines play out without ever re-integrating them. That would mean the Wheel of Time series becoming more of a Shared World group of books, rather than finishing as the series that started way back in Eye of the World. This would never work, though - it's only in real life that people start off together, drift apart and never reconnect again, and if there's anything I'm reading this series for, it is not its resemblance to the real world.Temporarily splitting into five sub-series might have solved a whole lot of problems though. The reader would have been able to decide which stories interested him the most. Devoted followers, of course, would have bought them all and read them all, but if you're not interested in watching Perrin anguish over Faile, or you rightly think that Mat's storyline is pretty rudderless and won't mean anything until he reconnects with Rand, you'd be able to skip that mini-series. Some clever writing would be necessary once they all integrate, but it would be possible to enjoy the Wheel of Time without necessarily jumping around five storylines every ten chapters or so.My point is that the middle of this series has turned out to be muddled and clunky, and if there's any point where readers might just give up, it would be here. The good news is that in this book, the five storylines finally catch up to each other; the first 357 pages are describing what's happening in the other storylines while Rand and Nynaeve were cleansing saidin back in Winter's Heart. Once that event has passed in all five stories, the narrative flow seems to smooth out a lot, and the reading gets easier. I can't say how long that will last, or how long it'll take before they all re-integrate, but I know they will sooner or later.This volume, meanwhile, has some great character moments in it - Egwene cementing herself as the true Amyrlin Seat and doing what must be done to secure her victory; Perrin discovering just how hard he can be and what lengths he will go to to find his wife; Mat's intricate dance with Tuon, in which neither of them really knows the steps. And on the dark side, Alviarin discovers that even the great and powerful Chosen are not guaranteed victory, and Black Ajah sisters everywhere lay in wait to serve their dark master. And there's an interesting essay to be written on the psychological position that Jordan takes in these books - Behavior molds personality, and punishment molds behavior. Something I have to mull over as I read, but when I have it set in my head, I'll let you know.The story progresses. Fitfully, and in five different directions, but it progresses. Stay with me, folks, and we'll get there.....-----------------------------------------------------Sometimes, there were lessons in stories, if you looked for them.- Elayne Trakand, Crossroads of Twilight-----------------------------------------------------"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"As a WOT reader for 10+ years, I'm ready to stop.

I consider myself reasonably able to keep up with the myriad of characters, but by now I don't even CARE who's a possible Darkfriend and who's not.

By the all too long end of the book, there were no plot lines resolved from books seven or eight or nine, and only weakly discernible plot lines established for book 11.

Also, it probably helped that I got this from the library and was not at all concerned with getting my money's worth.

This book is once again a disappointment for me. In keeping with the trend introduced in the last book, there are now too many characters, the plot is too wide and the story line has slowed to a crawl.

Where is Rand? I skimmed through the book looking for names of the main characters but all I found were minor characters whose roles I couldn't even remember. Unlike other reviewers who feel the series slowed down around book 5, I think it was good right through book 7. Great in fact. Book 8 I remember being dissappointed by and book 9 I can't even remember what thappened except for at the very end. Does Rand even appear in this book? Does anything happen? Jordan has some SERIOUS making up to do in the next couple of books. Why do I care about what happens to minor Aes Sedai? I want to see what is happening to Rand. Am I wrong or is he the main character? I am also sick of all the male-female relationships in these books happening at the level of 12 year olds.

Characters have been altered so much they don't even remotely resemble what we saw in the earlier volumes, the characters we all cared about and found so interesting (Matt is probably the biggest let down to-date). Before the entire series loses all that held it together, it is time to end it. I, like many others, will buy any new installments, not out of a dire curiousity and intense lust (such as with anticipated books from George RR Martin), but rather as a need to put to rest an epic size series that has cost us hundreds of dollars and hours of reading time.

The plot moves in painfully slow increments and much of the book consists of channelers sitting around, staring into the distance in wonder at the huge flows Rand and Nynaeve use to cleanse saidin. For those of you who can't be bothered to plow through this, I will summarize the important bits.Most of the other characters sit around and jaw at each other. Egwene begins her siege of Tar Valon and proposes talks with Elaida. This is a signal for all the Aes Sedai to sit around and throw frosty looks at each other. Halima, who is presumably as bored as we are, begins to stir things up by randomly murdering Aes Sedai, including a rather important one. But she only kills two and this kind of runs out of thrills in a hurry.Perrin still doesn't free his wife, although he does engage in a spot of uncharacteristic brutal torture. Amusingly, all the Two Rivers men despise him because of what happened at the beginning of Winter's Heart, when he slept in Berelain's tent. Apparently everyone seems to think he took advantage of his wife's absence to start banging Berelain.Faile for her part plots escape. This is code. She does nothing. The Aielman who captured her starts trying to attract her attention and develops second thoughts about serving the Shaido. I see a plot line here, to be resolved five years down the road.Mat's plot line is by far the best. He and Tuon begin developing their relationship and it's revealed that Mat has already married her by repeating &quot;She's my bloody wife!&quot; three times at the end of Winter's Heart. Tuon just has to acknowledge this. Love those convenient foreign customs. Still, he is by far the most engaging character. There's an interesting bit when Tylin's fate is revealed as well.Those of you who were tired of Nynaeve's bitchiness will be relieved to know she has not a single line of dialogue in the story. Elayne's part is forgettable. Rand is barely noticeable and just yells a lot at anyone who disagrees with him. He still does nothing about the Black Tower. Someone needs to light a fire under his behind.Several major plot lines are set up, hinting at major things for the next - wait a minute, isn't that what we thought about the last one? If you're a major fan like I am and the prospect of a new entry makes you salivate uncontrollably, pick this up. Otherwise, wait for the paperback. It seems unlikely that Jordan will be able to finish this in two more books."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This has to be the worst book in the series hands down. Only reason to read this book is to put yourself to sleep. If you have read this series up to this book. I'm guessing you will get it. But please borrow it from a friend or find it on sale. and when you do read it. SKIP everything thing but the stuff on Mat, and maybe read the few pages on Rand. This was more of a chore reading then enjoyment."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I have to preface this review with the comment that I am a fan of the WoT series. That said, anyone interested in reading this would be better off saving their money and purchasing this as a paperback or get it from the library. It is the weakest of the 10 books thus far in the series.So, what are the problems? First, a general lack of editing is in evidence. The book is brimming with ponderous descriptions of items and actions. Trivialities bogs down the pacing. Did anyone read this before it was published and talk to Jordan? He's become another Tom Clancy, publishing massive, long-winded tomes that serve better as doorstops. Second, the plot has taken a hiatus in CoT. Characters make some decisions--I'm sorry! I spoiled the book for you and told you what happened. I can't think of another time that I have encountered a book (or something in any other medium-except a Fellini film) containing more indecision.All I can think after reading it is that Jordan and his pubisher know that they have a guaranteed NYT bestseller, so they are milking this for all it's worth. I originally heard that there would be five, then eight, then ten volumes in the series. Now, with #10 getting us halfway to Tarmon Gaidin, it looks like we only have to suffer through TEN more to find out what happened.Jordan's walking a fine line now. I know of many that have been alienated by the crass exploitation of his fans by stringing out this series. People are getting bored and they are opting out. Other authors (Raymond Feist comes to mind) where able to write several satisfying series in a universe almost as interesting as Jordan's and each series had a beginning, a middle and an end.There is some merit to CoT. The decisions made are important, and the relationship of Mat and Tuon is quite interesting (though it almost serves as bookends to the novel). Aside from that, another reviewer's comment that it is &quot;half of a novel&quot; is very accurate. Pared down by a good editor, that exactly what CoT is: a fragment. In a few years, I guess, we will get the rest of the story."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Well, quite frankly, I am at a loss for words. I can't stop wondering what happened to the writer of the first four books. Generally I am not pessimistic, but I think this series is done. RJ had his chance to redeem himself after the book eight disappointment but really blew it on this one. Would be readers who are looking for a good story should look elsewhere; this is no fantasy story, it is pure soap opera. RJ has taken &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; and converted it to RandLand.NOTHING happened in this book but conversation between unknown characters and far flung plotlines. I think the story has taken a life of its own, and RJ is not in control anymore. I am shocked that TOR let this book get out to the press. Nothing important happened in this book that could not have been written in one chapter.I shall repeat, 680 pages of diologue... if I wanted 680 pages of worthless dialogue I could have turned on CSPAN."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"~I have to say that this was a disapointment to me. I started reading the series five years ago and have had to wait a long time for the conclusion, However Mr. Jordan has created such an intricate plot in the last nine books that it is no wonder it takes a long time to tie up the loose ends. However I have to wonder when this story is going to finnish. I will not stop reading the series because I think that Robert Jordan is a great author and his next project will probably be just as great as~~ the wot, Lets have the conclusion. and the other reviews of this book show just how fickle the masses can be~"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"It's very disheartening that Robert Jordan has become so successful that he has ceased to beedited. In this latest installment, we spend several hundred pages reviewing where the each of the multitude of characters was at the end of Book 9,and are rewarded with 20 pages of new action. It feels like watching a tv show where you get 48 minutes of Previously on 'The Wheel of Time', and 2 minutes of new show. On the liner notes, Robert Jordan says he's going to write until they nail shut his coffin. Obviously we'll have to wait that long for him to wrap this up. It's sad for a series that had such brilliance."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Does anyone even remember the original plot of these books anymore? I am three hundred pages into &quot;Crossroads of Twilight&quot; and I'm realizing that nothing is going to happen in this book either, aside from someone glaring at someone else, or, for a change of pace, someone staring daggers at someone else.If you are looking to buy this book, you have probably already been hooked into the series by the first few books. If so, then it's probably too late to tell you to wait until this series is finished then buy the first several books and the very last one.I'm getting really annoyed with myself for purchasing the last four books in this waste-of-bookshelf-space series."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Nothing happened in this book. I was so disappointed in this book. After the conclusion of the 9th book, I had assumed that you would see Rand and the others actually doing something in this book. Wrong answer. You barely even glimpse anything of Rand, Min, Nynaeve and Lan. Too much time is being spent on setting up storylines and way too much time is being spent on describing what clothes people are wearing or how they are going to do something in advance or what the hall ways look like. Just tell us the story and give us the characters and action that every one has been wanting. The series has dragged on long enough - give us the conclusion !"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This book was a great disappointment. I discovered this series four years ago and was immediately caught up in the well-developed characters and intricate plot -- now I grow weary of these same things. This series needs to come to an end, and soon. This particular book does little to move the story along, the only reason to keep reading is to someday find out what happens! Don't waste your money on this hardback; instead, buy a cheaper book club edition, a used copy, or wait for the paperback."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"There was a time when I would buy Robert Jordan's books and spend the next 2-3 days reading them without putting them down. This is not the case with his latest installment. I thought he was finally starting to get things together in Book 9 when something started happening and plot lines started converging on themselves. In Book 10 he is back to writing long winded descriptions about everything with very little happening.Sadly it has taken me over 2 weeks to get through two thirds of this book. Even worse, in the 500 pages I have read, the storyline has only advanced 3 or 4 days. At this rate we will all be dead before the novel has ended."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I've read all the others, and am determined to finish this whole series. I just wish that he would write this a little more speed to the story. There is the tendency to over explain, re-introduce, and take his time in evolving the story. The story line, the twists/turns/etc., and the characters are great. Almost too great when it comes to characters. This series seems to have grown from 6 to about 12 main characters, all getting many pages worth of information on them. You start to forget about certain characters as you will only hear about them for several chapters in the book and then have to wait until the next book to pick back up their little mini saga. Maybe they will all meet up at some point in book #100 or so. His slant on a fantasy world is refreshing from the dragon lance/forgotten realms genre. However, any series that has more pages than the bible, and reads a little like Leviticus in some parts can wear on even the most diehard of fans. If you want to bring closure to this series, I recommend getting it. Other wise else, wait for the abridged version."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I have loved almost all Jordan's books, but as time goes on and the story stretches on and on, it has become painful to read. Yes he is a great story teller, but this story should have been over two books ago. Usually there is something that resembles action, but in this book it was as dry as the Sahara during a dry spell. If you have read all of the books so far as I have, you will want to read this just to keep it going. The next book I will wait until it gets to paperback, because this one sure wasn't worth the money for a hardback."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I join those who have been extremely disappointed by this book. It is another long set-up with not much happening. I give it more than one star mainly because of the scenes with Mat and Tuon, which remind you of the good parts of this over-extended series. The author clearly is not going to listen to those asking for some common sense editing and tightening. Of course, he can do whatever he wants and he's making a bundle of money. But it's frustrating. My suggestion is to wait for the paperback or borrow the hardcover, and then skim it for the scenes involving Mat,Tuon, Rand and Elayne. There is a lot in the book about Egwene, but it doesn't go anywhere and is not interesting. Nynaeve is hardly mentioned, and nothing significant happens with Perrin either. Too bad."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This has to have been one of my favorite series of all time. I couldn't wait for this one to be to show up at more door! How disapointing. Now the Wheel of Time series is a deep story wih lots of detail, and thats what makes it great. But this book, is ALL detail. There isn't one advancement to the storyline. The writing is still as good as ever, but its gotten way to slow. The story the characters find themselves in the beginning of the novel are nearly unchanged throught the story. This one in no way is need to keep up in the series, in fact, this one didn't change anything from book 9, so if you read that one, you are just as cought up with anyone who read this book."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This book disappointed me. Four years ago I practically fell in love with the wheel of time series. It was good fantasy that progressed at a perfect speed. Sadly, that nimbleness of motion is grinding to a screeching halt. Jordan is attempting an admirable thing, but I honestly feel that he is failing utterly. He is obviously trying to create a complex masterpiece, but most of his descriptions in this book are repeats of previous passages. Be prepared for a great deal of shawl twitching on the part of the Aes Sedai, as well as stare downs between women of all shapes and sizes.If Jordan really wanted to write a truly complex tapestry, I would encourage him to read George RR Martin's current fantasy first. Inevitably, my greatest criticism is that nothing happens in the book. That is, nothing that could not be contained in a very well written prologue. It would be a fairly long prologue, but Jordan fans are used to length by now. What he does here, is spend 700 pages describing the events of winter's hearts, from every other characters position. Mostly everybody is confused about the pillar of the one power in the sky. People move around some, though they remain in the same predicament as they began in. There is one interesting development in the entire book, and it goes past very quickly.Having read Winter's Heart right away when it came out, I found myself almost giddy thinking about how interesting the next book would be, because it would be the book that dealt with the male female relationships for the first time in a situation where men are free from the taint. That never occurs. Anything that you had hoped to have resolved, such as the prophecy about Thom pulling Moiraine out of the fire, never occurs. There are some interesting passages about Mat and Tuon, but nothing that merits 700 pages.Many reviewers attempt to defend Jordan's lack of action, by saying that it is only one chapter in a very long book, and there are bound to be boring chapters, but it seems like overkill to be boring for 700 pages. Others say that it is a very complex book, full of characterization necessary for the future books. This isn't really true. Many of the details provided are about completely esoteric subjects, and most of the characterization is fairly repetitious. I was very surprised to see that that one reviewer said that this was a book for people who are looking for something serious to read, and that those who want a quick and easy read should go to Tolkien.I also wanted to quickly address another reviewer, another guy who says this is slow, who compared it to a puzzle on an internet site. The puzzle that he described is the one known as zeno's paradox. It really bothers me to see the work of an ancient greek philosopher being subjugated to the realm of internet novelties."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I have eagerly anticipated the release of this book and the opportunity to touch base with the characters and story line that I have been hooked on for years in the hopes that Mr. Jordan would take us back to the heart of the main story and get away from the trends of his recent volumes. However, I read the entire book only to find that NOTHING HAPPENS! This latest edition seems to revolve around the characters reacting to one another with none of the action or provocative events so richly portrayed in the earlier books. The story has lost all focus with new characters and situations begin introduced with no resolutions being offered to the ones that we have been so patiently following. There was a time I would have put Robert Jordan just below Tolkien, with Goodkind and the rest just copy cats of their style, but the last two efforts in the Wheel of Time are making me long for a new Sword of Truth release!"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I really have been in love with this series ever since I picked up Eye of the World at a friend's recommendation and hungrily consumed the next 8 books. I was never disappointed until now. This book is one big prologue to I don't know what. Absolutely nothing happens in it. There are no surprises. It's basically all rehash of things we've already read and already know about. In fact most of the individual prologues (Mat, Faline, Perrin, Egwene, etc.) All take place before the end of the last book.Of course I will buy the next book when it comes out, but if it is disappointing as this one, I'll have to drop the series. In the meantime I'm looking forward to George R.R. Martin's next isntallment in the Songs of Ice and Fire series which so far has not been a disappointment and has far surpassed Jordan in keeping me spellbound and turning the pages."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This last year brought us Enron,World Com,and now Jordangate.com. Think I'm kidding ? Take a look at Amazon[.com] selections for featured Reviews--these first two...now look at everything else here.

The author takes almost 700 pages to go nowhere .Heres the plot summary- Mat takes a wagon ride with a valley girl,perin gets mad and stomps his feet,Rand does nothing, and his lovers get morning sickness.This book is total filler. It is more evidence that TOR has decided to milk a DRY cow till it just collapses. Setup !!! After over 7000 pages and 10 books we are being setup for 4 more...give me a break!! This is corporate greed at its peak. Books cost money. This one is totally worthless.It has no beginning,no plot and no end. Its awful..just awful!

Story moves nowhere (in fact, once again it moves back in time from the previous book), and there endless cliched descriptions repeated from earlier books (braid tugging, cool eyed looks, ageless faces, smoothing dresses etc).How many times do we have to have the *same* explanations for the way characters behave and dress? By book 10, we know it. But then, perhaps he is assuming that people who keep buying this series are obviously stupid and can't retain this information.Jordan is milking this series for all it is worth. Quite frankly, this isn't worth the money you are paying for it. If you must read it - despite all the warning reviews - then borrow it from a library. As for me, I'm not giving him another cent."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I can only assume that Greed is what has inspired lackluster writing and an un-moving plotline. Yeah ... I can see the setup just like everyone else, but this is just stupid.Also, this is the second book in a row which has a dustcover that contians lies ... nowhere does Perrin risk his soul for Faile. hmmm ... I seem to remember that being in the dustcover of book 9 too. Maybe the last battle is really between pissed off fans and a writer who seems to have lost his touch.Despite its shortcomings I must say that Crossroads did top Winters Heart for WORST BOOK YET and I think we can continue to count on Jordan milking his once loyal fans until no-one cares how the series ends ...A true disappointment."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"1.

Save [$$] by not buying it."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This book plods along and goes nowhere. I finished it only because I could not believe how Jordan could screw up a great story so badly. After reading the great books (1-5), this is like watching a senior tour golfer shoot 90 from the ladies tees. There are now thousands of storylines speeding to no foreseeable conclusion. This was an epic tale that should have ended four books ago. The remaining installments should come with $100 bills attached to pay you to read them. Can TOR resurrect the author of the earlier books?"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I really enjoyed the first few books in the series; a unique, novel approach to fantasty. However, the last few books seem to be nothing more than an effort to draw the series out so Jordan can make more money -- Crossroads is the worst. The first 500 or so pages are simply fluff with no meaning or advancement of the storyline. When Jordan finally starts to move the storyline along, he moves it so fast you have to wonder what happened. Jordan had the opportunity to produce a classic series on par with Tokien and Lewis. Unfortuantely, he let the series get out of control. Pass on this book and wait to see if the next one finishes the series. If it does, borrow this one from the library and read the last 100 of so pages to prep you for the final book. If he doesn't finish the series in the next book, reread Tolkien and skip the series entirely."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This is the most disappointing book of the Wheel series. Heck, this is a disappointing BOOK on al levels.There are 75-100 pages of REAL material that advance the plot at glacial speed, crammed into this 680 page bloated waste of tree pulp. The prologue itself is longer then the actual useful pages contained in this train wreck.The characters don't evolve, the plot stagnates, excessive use of description is rampant, and the characters seem to get stupider (and for some, this is QUITE a task).This is one book I would either snag from the bargain bin is you MUST own it, or borrow it from some poor sucker who bought it, if only to go through the same painful reading that the rest of us suckers went through. I will be waiting for the next book...at the library."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I have thoroughly enjoyed all of Robert Jordan's previous Wheel of Time books. Most have great action with spicy intrigue that give the reader an idea of how confusing it must have been to be in high politics in the days of royal courts, changing political climates and fast paced growth of \\"Travel\\". This book though, is all spice and no meat.There are too many new characters together in book 9. Old characters have mysterious motives for shadowy deeds; so shadowy you don't really know what they are doing or why you should care! I feel as though I sat down to a great banquet in Jordan's dream world Tel'aran'rhoid. Looked good but not filling.If you like mysterious characters and don't need action. You might like this. Just start it immediately after book 9.

But, I'm still going to read every new book he gets published. The first time I read EOTW I was blown away. That book is great, it moves at a steady pace, everything is still \\"new\\" (e.g. you haven't read 10,000 pages of Nynaeve tugging her braid and being an irrational you-know-what), and when I go back and read it again, it always renews my sense of love for the WOT series.The problem is: RJ has too many threads going on right now. It seems like he keeps tacking on extra story arcs, but he never closes them off. If he could close of a couple of the unimportant stories, we'd all be better off (like if Perrin and Faile would just die and go to hell, in whatever order).Another problem: Yes, we get the point that RJ is jaded towards women. But, seriously, couldn't you have at least a couple women in your book that don't drive my friends and I up the wall?Another thing that bugs me: this book ends on a \\"cliff-hanger\\" (sort of... I mean, something happens to a character, but by this time I could really care less about 90% of the characters in this series, so I'm not sure if this qualifies as \\"cliff-hanger\\" or not). Seriously... why would he do that to me? I've already made it to book friggin' 10! Do you think that if you don't bait me in to the next book I'm going to decide to stop reading at this point?My final whine: why in the world would you take one of the only good things this series has going for it (Matt) and F it up? It used to be that even amidst braid-tugging, manipulation, and a whole lot of sitting around doing nothing like a pansy; you could always count on good ol' Matt to bail the story out. With his current situation, it looks like that time might be coming to an end.But, all that having been said, I still can't put these babies down (even if I get emotionally and physically damaged from the stress of reading because the characters frustrate me so much at times).

Although written in Jordan's usual style with copious detail and characterization, absolutely nothing happens until the last chapter, with Egwene running into trouble.

I have to agree to some point. I have enjoyed the WoT since first picking up the first book some 4 years ago. Where as I would have rated the first nine 4 to 5 stars, I find myself a little disappointed after the 10th. Still well written and still compelled, I for one am prepared to read two or three more novels, as long as the plot develops and moves on. For the first time in the series, it really doesn't. Jordan has some work to do in number 11 to rekindle that majic. Otherwise, this reader, like so many others will be rating the next even lower."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Once again, I've waited 2+ years for an extremely disappointing book. No major plot developments, no battles, no excitement...you get the drift. There is significant setup for the future of the overall story, however, after four books of the exact same setup I'm sick of it. In all honesty, the only thing that kept me turning pages was the slim hope of something exciting happening. Of course my hopes were in vain. CoT reads like a bad Seinfeld episode; namely it follows the excruciating minutia of day to day living of several of the main characters. We see Rand for all of 10 or so pages. There is virtually no mention whatsoever of clensing of the taint. The only thing that makes this book better than Path of Daggers is that Mat is in it. I read that Jordan has said he'll be done in 12 books. Not bloody likely, especially if the next two move even at 10 times the pace of the last four. Of course, after 10+ years of reading and waiting for Jordan, I'm thoroughly addicted to WOT.

I read straight from the beginning to the end in about two months and loved just about every minute of it. Granted there were parts in the later books that I spaced out through a bit and some of the Nynaeve/Elayne chapters could grate on my nerves, but I didn't have any real problem with those later volumes. I loved Winter's Heart. I've since re-read the series 3 times. Now we have Crossroads of Twilight. It's the first book in the series that I've actually had to wait for. I'm very disappointed. I mean honestly, the biggest event in Perrins story is the purchase of grain? Here's what I find curious though: am I dissapointed because the book is grossly inferior to the others or because I had undue expectations?

How many pages of this book are devoted to what an Aes Sedai is wearing or what look she has on her face? And if I read one more line about the Warders' shifting cloaks I am going to scream. WE KNOW ABOUT THE CLOAKS ALREADY!!! Honestly, the wardrobes don't matter. After about 350 pages of this I started skipping entire sections of description.In the past, I have really looked forward to the release of the next book in the series. Now, I don't really care when the next one is coming out. Besides, at this rate the series is going to take 20 books to finish."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"There is no denying there is not much action in this book. More new characters are introduced, and more things are being set up for the next book. It is hard to keep everyone's names and backgrounds straight too, outside of the central characters. I couldn't read it the first time I started, but once I stopped caring a bit about what should happen I enjoyed it a bit more. This series will probably go on forever. The book gets better as it goes along."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"If you liked the Books 7, 8 and 9, you will love this one. It continues the 'pattern' of 1000 pages of nothing. I am so disappointed and angry I can not write or think clearly. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK. Mine will be for sale online in 2 minutes. Read the first six, go online and read a synopsis of all since then, and let us hope all the current outrage will force Jordan into putting a knife into this plotline. George R. R. Martin has plainly surpassed Jordan as the best author in the genre."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I have mixed emotions over this book. While I enjoyed reading it, nothing happens to advance the plot. NOTHING! I hear people complaining over the Elayne and Egwene chapters. I however, feel that these sections are the stronger part of the book. Perrin has only been interesting to read about in Books 4 and 6. Tuon, on the other hand, ruined the Mat chapters. TOY?!?! That's what she calls him. Very annoying, and she says it over, and over again. Although I would have given this book a 3, I think we, the fans, have to send Mr. Jordan a message, and show him our dissapointment."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I am very disappointed with ~Crossroads of Twilight~. The last book, ~Winter's Heart~ took forever to get somewhere. ~Crossroads of Twilight~ takes forever to get somewhere very close to no where. In his tenth installment, Mr. Jordan gives us almost 700 pages of vignettes concerning some of his characters. If you've developed a passion for Nynaeve, this book will disappoint you.I won't give a play-by-play. I will say that Rand's cleaning of ~saidin~ is barely mentioned, the Aes Sedai remain divided both within and without the White Tower, Egwene has not yet grown up, Elayne does not become Queen, the Aiel still have Perrin's wife, Faile, and Mat makes little progress towards matrimony with the Seanchean heir apparent.If you haven't been following Mr. Jordan's \\"Wheel of Time\\" series, this is NOT the place to start. If you aren't more or less up-to-date, there are very few guideposts to help you through this book. Even if you have been following since ~The Eye of the World~ came out in 1990, you may need to have at least ~Winter's Heart~ nearby. At this point you really do need a score-card, and the author fails to provide it.Mr. Jordan seems to be using this book to set-up the conclusion of his epic opus. Much as ~Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back~ made ~Return of the Jedi~ possible, ~Crossroads of Twilight~ is slowly leading us to Tarmon Gai'don (the Last Battle). Some may dismiss my low rating as a dislike for this sort of tale.Don't you believe it!Jordan's ~Crossroads of Twilight~ does not suffer because it is a point of transition in his story. It fails because next to nothing happens, and you have to slog through hundreds of pages of mostly superfluous description to find that out.I can't tell you to buy it unless you've got to complete the set. I would borrow a copy, or check it out from the library. There are a dizzying number of minor and not-so-minor characters to remember from previous books, and you may want to use John's Mediocre Wheel of Time Glossary (link below) or something like it as a Who's Who."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This book was a huge, disappointing, waste of time. Other than the Mat section, the entire book is just filler. Even the book description is terribly misleading. It should read like this:Perrin Aybara seeks to free his wife, Faile, but first he must deal with the menacing problem of weevils in the barley. Can the townspeople remove the weevils in time, so that the soldiers can eat bread? (who cares?)At Tar Valon, Egwene prepares to lay siege to Tar Valon. Will something else come along that will distract her enough to put off this plot thread for the entire novel? (answer: yes)In Andor, Elayne fights for the Lion Throne (By novel's end, she is still fighting for the Lion Throne).For Rand al'Thor, nothing happens the entire book (NOTHING).In summary, do not waste your money. You can pick up the next one and not miss a thing. Hopefully, some plot development will actually occur in that one.

I thought he was back on track - even if just a little with Winter's Heart - but no, he's definitely not. I'm seriously considering quitting the series, and I'd warn anyone who's dissatisfied to maybe stay away from this book if you think you'd be swayed to quit.... trust me... you won't miss much."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Nothing happens. If you are not a huge fan, do not read this. It is very dry and long winded. The only reason for the three stars is that I am a huge fan of the series, and anything resembling a Wheel of Time tale goes a long way. It is very well written, but not in keeping with the tradition of the books. After waiting for two years for another installment after the impressive 'Winter's Heart', I had hoped for more. Hopefully we won't have to wait as long for the next installment, and when it arrives there will be some progression of the story (I think Rand spent the whole book in the same room!)"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I love this series, but this one is really boring.

I will keep reading the series because I am hooked, but from now on wait for the paperback rather than scooping up the hardcover in the first week after a year of anticipation.You can skim this one and get just as much as you need out of it.

The story is not advancing in any measurable fashion and the books are getting more disappointing as time goes on.I will give an example. In the previous book nothing really important, or gripping, happened until the last chapter. That's 627 pages of nothing!!! Then the last chapter is a whole whopping 25 pages long! All the activity that happened over the course of that book was about enough to make 3 or 4 chapters.What does this have to do with this book? Well, the first 400 or so pages in this book take place at the same time as the last chapter in the previous book! I place that at about 10-12 hours time! Then continues in the same drab fashion as the last one, with a touch of spice at the end for the cliffhanger. The set up in this book still gets us nowhere near what is needed for the series finale, leaving me with the impression that there will be at least one more book of fluff before anything interesting happensIt feels as if the author is more interested in getting the money for the sales now than in providing an entertaining story. I do not recommend this book, and will wait to see the reviews for the next book before considering purchasing the next.BUYER BEWARE!"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I have been following \\"The Wheel of Time\\" series over the years.

This book further added more threads to the huge web of Robert Jordan's plots. I was deeply confused half the time, trying to figure out how things were tying in, if they were at all. There was no chapters at all on any of the Forsaken, save Mesaana in the Tower, and only one chapter on Rand. I was annoyed and frustrated that the timeline had barely moved ahead at all, and that nothing really happened except for a few minor things that just thickened the plots and sub-plots more!It seems Jordan just wanted to drag out the suspense more to get everyone ready for his next book, which won't follow for at least another TWO YEARS! And if those loyal to the series are disappointed once again with the 11th book, i think we'll all just give up on Jordan and write our own series. Myself, I'm rereading the series currently for the third time, and taking notes too, as to which characters do what and that sort of thing just so i can keep track of everyone.All in all, the 10th book was rather pointless and offered only more political intrigue and too much detail. It could've been skipped all together. Out of 700 pages, I really only liked about 20 of them or so. Read it if you must, but just ask anyone whos read it to give you a summary to save yourself the trouble."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"In writing the tenth volume of the wheel of time epic, Jordan fell well short of expectations. His tendency for excessive descriptions of every character bordered on tedium. Of the nearly 700 pages barely 100 made any contribution to moving the plot along. The remainder covered endless descriptions of characters clothing, mood, hairstyles, accents and continual smoothing of skirts. Even when the stated smoothing was not necessary. This volume was a complete disappointment based on the strengths of previous books in the series."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Like most reviewers here, I agree: this book goes nowhere. I didn't believe it until I read it myself. Literally, the plot ends in almost exactly the same place it began. Readers of the series could skip this thick volume and not miss a thing of import. Like others, I miss the early days of the series and am starting to resent Jordan's apparent milking of the series for profit (ie: the re-release of book one as two &quot;new&quot; seperate books...) With books like this one, you're losing fans by the thousands, Jordan..."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"It makes me very sad to think about the WoT series now. It started out so incredible I remember telling people that I thought Jordan had the talent to surpass Tolkien. Oh how wrong I was. This series has consistently fallen into mediocrity, and with this latest attempt has actually become quite bad. I was pretty excited at the end of the previous book since I thought the series was finally going to be getting back on track. Again, oh how wrong I was. An advanced calculus text is way more stimulating than this book was. I normally take about a week to read a book of this size -- this particular book took me 3 months to trudge through. About the only good thing to say about it is that it's better than a glass of warm milk for putting you to sleep at night.CoT is a 100 page prologue to book 11 that was padded and stretched into a 680 page book. It's offensive to see how little respect Jordan has for his readers and his own series."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"If only I had bought it as an audio book, then I'd have the cure for sleeplessness. Jordan has brought character development to a new length record.

Wait for the next volume and you'll miss nothing!"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I felt very dissatisfied after reading this book. I'm such a fan that I reread all the other books again before reading this one, but that didn't help my sense of outrage after finishing it. I was so frustrated to realize I was reading endless and pointless details that could drive one mad. I don't care how to wash silk, draw a bath, or how salt is made or sold. And will RJ ever learn that anything involving the Andoran succession or the Whitecloaks bores us to tears? Do we really need an extended scene of Perrin scoping out his camp, complete with ludicrous scent assessments every novel?Space taken up by this filler could have been used to actually tie up some plot lines, but no such luck. Believe the bad hype -- nothing of significance is resolved and barely anything happens."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Jordan finally achieved what he has apparently been trying to do since book 5 of this series - write a book that goes nowhere. The four to five pages of Crossroads of Twilight that actually involve Rand are succinct and to the point, but the rest of the book is ridiculous. Jordan routinely takes several pages at a time to describe a conflict between two characters that are clearly minor side carachters with little to do with advancing the plot. This book ends as if Jordan were simply tired of writing, and wanted to publish something to keep readers interested in his series."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"What ever happened to Robert Jordan's talent in writing. I used to really love his books and could not set them dowm. I would read them over and over. Now it is a battle just to read his book because it is so boring. I think the reason is Jordan used to pick one or two major things to accomplish and happen each book and he would dedicate the book to moving towards that for a great finish to each book. This would make the reader feel like &quot;Wow what a great book.&quot; Now you read this book and it has 100 little sub plots going on which he spends way more time on each of them than they are worth. Nothing happens Except maybe to Egwene which leaves you hanging because he doesn't finish it. When I read Winters Heart I thought Jordan was starting to get back on the right track because he worked towards at least one major thing happening which was the removing of the taint. Now this book I feel I could of skipped it because I feel like nothing of import happened or got accomplish in the whole book. In other words ALL FLUFF and NO SUBSTANCE."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I have enjoyed the level of detail in the previous novels, but this book seemed to bog itself down in the enormous amount of sub characters and moment by moment descriptions. Very little happens in the 650+ page book by the end. In fact, the only significant and interesting plot developments are (of course) in the final pages-merely teasers for the next book.The stereotypes of the characters are starting to grate too: the men can't understand how women think, women think men are wool headed, men struggle over the death of women they cause. Characters haven't seemed to develop much over the last four or five books.The only reason I finished this book in hopes that the future of the series will greatly improve. If you have enjoyed the series so far, then you should be able to plod your way through this (nearly) minute by minute account of what happens."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"How did he cram a 50 page book into 700 pages?

As one reviewer mentioned, 600 pages and nothing has happened. Quite frankly I couldn't care less how descriptive the dress of any certain individual is. I mean I read half a page to see what the person is wearing, nothing but fluff.To wait 2 years for this book and to read almost 700 pages of fluff. A major diappointment. Jordan says he plans on writing at least 2 more books in this series. The way the action has gone in the last 2 or 3 books, it would take another 10 to get to the fianl battle."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I started reading this series many over ten years ago and fell in love with the fast pace of the story line and the awesome fight scenes. In the lastest book there is nothing that goes on. No fight scenes, no intruge, no time went by. I got the feeling from reading it that only a matter of days has gone by and NOTHING. I am on the verge of ending my affair with this series. I am wondering if he know how to end it??? While he is still a well written author there is nothing in this book to hold my attention. It used to be that I would read his books till all hours of the night and get down in like two or three days. This one took me almost two weeks to get through because I fell asleep all the time.

When I first started reading it I was hooked. I ate, slept, and dreamed the WOT, finishing the first 8 books in about 4 or 5 months. Then I had to wait for book 9 to come out, and when it did I read the whole series over again. Let me tell you, books 7, 8, 9, and 10 are .... 9 shows a little promise at the end, but 10 is .... What's wrong with you Jordan? Too busy cashing your paycheck to worry about what you are writing? This book goes absolutely nowhere. There are now so many characters that I don't even try to keep up with them. The story doesn't progress at all, it makes me sick! How many more women are going to sniff and pull their braids? Are the rumors that Jordans' wife is his editor true?I just can't understand what is happening here. This had the potential to be the best Fantasy series ever, topping even LOTR. Now it is just .... Jordan, you need to write one more book, titled Tarmon Gaidon and just end this thing. You are a talented author. You can write so many books. Start a different series about Lews Theron, or the original Band of the Red Hand. You have so much history in your WOT books that we'd love to read about them, but please, PLEASE finish this series. I'm sick of buying your books only to be more confused and more sick than I previously was. We're the ones putting money in your pocket, our voices need to be heard. Finish this series."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"The Wheel of Time Series is not for those who read a couple of books a year. If that describes you, then, indeed, trying to delve into this series will be a waste of your time because you will never be able to keep track of the plot threads.If you love the Fellowship of the Ring movies but think that the books have too much &quot;descriptions of walking,&quot; again, Robert Jordan is not for you.If, on the other hand, you are a voracious reader, and you realize Tolkein's &quot;wasted space&quot; descriptions of Middle Earth are the reason that Peter Jackson was able to capture the mood and settings of the stories so well for the rest of us to enjoy, then you really should give the Wheel of Time a try.Some of the later books in the series do read more like C-Span than a Fox News sound bite, but I like the feeling that I am getting the whole picture of what's happening in this world Robert Jordan has created, and I continue to be glad that he has chosen to share his vision in rich and vivid detail."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This book delivers. Sure it only takes place over the course of a couple of days, but they're extremely significant days to the series. To anyone complaining about there not being enough Rand... they're forgetting that Mat and Perrin and ta'veren (who are linked with the Dragon Rebord) and just as important to the fate of Randland as Rand is. Perrin is dealing with one major thread (the Shaido nation) and Mat another (the Seanchan)... both of those have to be taken care of priot to Tarmon Gaidon.Bottom line: I couldn't put this book down. It was a page turner from start to finish. True fans of the series will see this book for what it is: one more excellent chapter in the WoT saga. People who like to ... and moan for no other reason than they have no lives outside of Internet message boards (I'm looking at anyone who rated this below 4-stars) should spend their money elsewhere."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"What a bunch of whiners!! Why do people think that authors \\"owe them something?\\" Just because you've read 9 of his books, he owes you something?I'll agree that in a sense \\"nothing major happens\\" - but frankly, nothing \\"major\\" happens in most of this series - the radical events have really been few and far between. To me, this is PRECISELY why this series is so outstanding! It isn't a Terry Brooks [\\"there's an epic battle in every chapter\\"] kind of series. Instead, you are really on the journey with these characters and you feel like you are really with them. Never before have I felt like I AM one of these characters with the amount of inner monologue Jordan gives us - the attention to detail with the politics of the Aes Sedai, or of the Game of Houses, or of Rands many thread-bare treaties that are always just a fraction from falling apart - these are what put the character and quality in these books that are so often missing from more traditionally action-oriented fantasy novels. When you really look back, Jordan is as likely to flinch from describing a battle scene as he is from describing a sex scene - it isn't in the action that he revels, but in the characters responses to these actions.Having said all this, I found Crossroads to be no exception to this style. True enough, this novel has the least actual action of any book in the series. But that is ok, because by now we are more interested in the characters every decision than in how many Trollocs they can kill in one sitting. Basically, I think the series itself has matured from an action-fantasy into more of a drama-series. The \\"major\\" things that actually do happen in this book are not deaths or conquests, but critical decisions reached - including a very suprising alliance reached both by Rand and Perrin (seperately) with the most unlikely of allies. Egwene and the Rebel Sisters concoct their own unlikely alliance as well - read to find out for yourself.In addition, we get to see several great verbal confrontations, including one between Elaida and Alviarin that is long overdue. There is a shocking moment with Perrin in an interogation near the end of his portion of the novel. There is a very tense chase with Mat near his conclusion (intense in what's at stake and what must be done in the end). And en excrutiatingly good cliff-hanger with Egwene.My only true complaint with this one is that the series main character, Rand al'Thor, does not appear until over 600 pages in - and then he only gets ONE chapter! Granted, it is a crucial chapter, but you want more of your hero! After the exciting conclusion of WINTER'S HEART, I expected a longer explanation of what he and Nynaeve did and how it changed Saidin for all men (I don't recall if Nynaeve even appears in this book!)But still, Jordan's characters are just so dang readable! Honestly, with all these people whining about \\"when is this thing going to end\\" I have to ask: \\"Do you WANT it to end?\\" I mean, this is hands-down my favorite series I've ever read! I was very sad to finish this novel (thus reading the first ten books in one shot) and realize that I have to wait for another installment. I could keep reading these till I die - and after finishing what has been published to date, I just can't think of anything else that seems interesting to read at this point.Now, I suppose I can appreciate the frustration level of those who have been reading this series since the first book appeared in the early 90s. But, I only started last year, and read all ten published novels in about a year - and maybe that is the key. Bottom line: I think this is a great addition to the series. If it had been the first book published, it probably would have been the last - but with everything that has come before, and the set-up for what will come, I think it is fantastic!Don't let the whiners keep you from it!"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"\\"'If I must prove I am alive, you will regret it,' Seonid announced loudly in crisp Cairhienin accents, a little more heated than her face suggested. 'If you continue to point that cross bow at me, you will regret it even more.'\\"This is my favorite quote of the book, because it shows humor in a dramatic situation. In this book, the 10th in the series, Mat, Perrin, and Rand continue their journeys in their attempt to unite the world and save their friends' lives. Elayne is attempting to regain the throne that is rightfully hers and her friend, Abiendha, is trying to get used to the \\"wetlander ways\\". Meanwhile Egwene is trying to reunite the White Tower without much success.I really liked this book because Robert Jordan did a fantastic job continuing the plot from his previous books. I feel each one of his books has a more developed plot and a more interesting story line than the previous books. I would suggest this book to anyone who enjoys a fantasy and suspenseful book, but I would highly recommend that they read the previous nine books and the Prologue first."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I liked it because it gave us something for which we've been crying for years: Put all the heroes in one book.

The problem, however, is that when this is done, no one advances much and suddenly everyone (mostly) is complaining that the author has lost The Thread or, (and even worse in mine opinion because the next statements are so annoying) they accuse him of &quot;milking&quot; it, drawing out the series just to make money. Pah! He is prolific enough of an author not to be that desperate, and if he is the man his bio says he is, he has more pride than that.The people who critcize him have their points and some of those reviews are very well-thought out(Thank you,Oscar) but many of these people seem to be taking it personally, as if Robert Jordan were going out of his way to insult them. I have made that mistake myself with other authors. Hey, we wanted a book with everything in it, and we got it. Remember, it was the richness of detail that made us want more, and if now it has grown repetitve, well, someday the story will be finished, and it will be read by someone who will not know anything about how long it took Robert Jordan to write the series.

To the critics of the book: All readers of the series know about braid tugging, ear boxing, folded arms beneath breasts. I'm not sure how critics reminding readers of the obvious counts as a witty review. I'm also not sure why someone would give the tenth book in a series a bad review. If you don't like the series why read ten books? Jordan does what any great story teller does: he creates drama and suspense which we yearn for years to be resolved. These books don't just jump from one conclusion to another ( I mean, there can't be a final battle in EVERY book), they fill the moments between significant events with characterization and vivid descriptions of everyday events in the lives of characters in a fantasy novel which should be interesting to everyone who reads fantasy novels."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"WoT fans, do not despair! Even though the book (CoT) is hardly exciting, you have to understand that in itself the whole series is one book and its following the rules. Its title implies what its meant to transmit: when its twilight things come to a standstill, an uneasy calm overcomes everything before the activity continues and at crossroads everything gathers before going its own way, and this book is just that. If you read between the lines and understand the way Jordan has built his work, you'll understand that this book was necessary to establish a pause and gather the necessary threads of the story before the climax comes. So I repeat, do not despair, I believe the best parts are yet to come."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This is probably the worst book in the Wheel of Time Series so far. However, I think that's a bit like saying the chocolate is Hershey's rather than Godiva. I'm not planning to read this two or three times like I did some of the other ones, and I sold my copy of the hardcover edition, but I did enjoy reading it once. Favorite characters appear and do interesting things. Maybe not as interesting as before, but there aren't enough decent fantasy epics in the world to make this a waste in paperback. If you don't have it, I'd get it now and use it for treadmill reading."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I love this saga, RJ is a great author and for those of you saying he has lost control of his story maybe you just need to gain some patience!!!

Martin and Terry Goodkind."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I had eagerly awaited this book, like many others. Although I thought Path of Daggers was a dissappointment, I was encouraged by the exciting developments in Winter's Heart. This novel, while perhaps more well-written than PoD, is much more inconsequential. The events that happen in this book would be taken care of in the prologue in any other series. Even more maddening is the complete lack of action. Rand channels once in the entire story, and then only to weave a ward against eavesdropping! The exciting climax at the end of the novel, a staple in this series, is completely absent. If the next book is not the last, I'm going to be upset.That said, these were the best 672 pages of nothing I've ever read. As angry as it can make me, I still enjoyed it, and will most assuredly buy the next book. I just wish that Robert Jordan didn't know that so well."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"The pace of the plot has slowed down over the last three books in the series, but up until now at least SOMETHING was resolved in each book. Jordan is not nearly an author of the quality required to hold one's interest through such tedious plot development. After over 6000 pages in the previous books, there's no need for developing the characters.There's a cheesy &quot;to-be-continued&quot; ending. However, I was so bored two-thirds of the way through that I'd skipped ahead to the end and cheated myself of the one unexpected turn in the entire book.If you've already read the first nine books, nothing anybody says will keep you from reading this one. Heck, I read it all too. Save yourself some money though, wait for the paperback edition or buy it used. Save yourself some time and wait for book 11 (or Book 12 at this rate)."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"The book was very slow moving and not much happened. It seems like things are set up nicely for book 11 to be filled with plot advancement and excitement, but this book had little of that. Crossroads was basically one long prologue. There were a few good parts which I did enjoy, thus, I gave it two stars instead of one. I hope the next book is better than this."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Robert Jordan came up with a great story, however, reading his work is like watching hours of the neighbor's home movies: He may be very interested but we can't wait until it's over. For every 5 pages of Crossroads, 4 are devoted to how the characters are dressed or the history of the tea cups being used. I'm getting the feeling that the author is hiding Rand the way Disney hides Mickey at Disneyland. And, what's with 95 pages of prologue to the TENTH book in a series? Why doesn't he just pick up the story where it left off in book 9?The many comparisons of Jordan to Tolkien are misguided. Tolkien took us on the adventure with Frodo and the Fellowship. Jordan's work, particularly in the last few books, has all the adventure of a flight delay in real time. I would like to know what happens to many of the characters, but it is simply not worth the sheer tedium of the writing."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"What a load of rubbish!I have been reading this series for 10 years and eagerly awaited this next installment. Instead of action and wonderfully rich story telling I got 600 odd pages of the politics of the Aes Sedai. The main character of the story, Rand, didn't enter the book until about page 520. The plot didn't advance, no one did anything. It was, in comparison to his last nine books, boring and tedious.Come on Mr Jordan, stop trying to pad out an extra book or 2. Keep the story moving and let it end when it has too. Another book like this will result in your millions of fans worldwide getting fed up and abandoning the series."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"800 pages where almost nothing happens at all. Last page contains the only significant event, like a parody on all movie series &quot;please stay tuned, will he make it, what will happen next...&quot;. There were a total of about 50 pages that I found enjoyable, recognising the writers ability to make a good story. Rest of the pages were read waiting for the story to start moving, for some intriguing story. In fact, if I decide to read the next book based on the fact that the previous books were better even if they have deteriated the longer into the series we get, I could have skipped this book totally and never even have known that I missed a book in the series.--- Mats ---"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Well, where to start? I've been a Jordan fan for years. For me, the series kicked off strong and I caught up just as Path of Daggers was released. While many have rated it poorly, I personally thought it was great. Although plot was not advanced far, we got a new insight into Rand, which has caused many theories to create themselves. Winter's Heart was another book where nothing happened, at least until the very end. But...This one takes the cake. NOTHING happens. I can't spoil anything because there is nothing to spoil. No real looks into characters. No attempts to fix things together. It felt like a cut-and-paste version of what used to be a great series. I was fortunate enough to obtain a copy while on a trip to England before the release date in the States. Imagine my surprise, sitting in a small room in England, to discover that I was bored enough to put it down and go visit Warwick Castle. PoD gripped me by the neck until I finished it. WH kept me with the promise of something happening. 15 Pounds and a hardcover did nothing to keep me there. Unfortunately, I'll probably buy the next one as well. But for those who haven't wasted money on this, I wouldn't urge you to. You can skip it and nothing will surprise you in Book 11.... when we get it in three or so years."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"All the reviews I've read so far seem to agree on the same thing.The book contains only a tiny amount of plot development.Despite having to refer to the last 3 books to follow the hundreds of minor characters, Richard again insisted on repeating his detailed descriptions of them, and their behaivour, each time you met them.For those who agree with Richard that humans learn how to relate to each other in school yards and stop learning after they turn 10, you'll love this book.I hope it was his publisher who forced him to write this book."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This book was a major disappointment. I have been a sci-fi/fantasy fan for many years, following this series faithfully, and this is the poorest example of Jordan's work to date. As another reviewer pointed out, I cannot decided whether Jordan's subplots have grown unmanageable even for him, or whether he is blatantly milking the patience of his loyal fans in order to maximize his profit. As you can gather from sampling the other reviews posted here, this book barely advances the plot of the series while introducing yet more minor and uninteresting characters into an already crowded subplot market. Nothing is resolved and more importantly, nothing new of any noteworthiness is even postulated. Instead we are inundated with already familiar cliche'd male/female character interactions and minor subplot variations, leaving the reader with a decidedly unsatisfied feeling. In my opinion, this book could have easily been combined with the previous installment, minus the subplot meanderings, and could have been released as one book several years ago. For those reviewers who defend this volume of drivel by saying that it is needed to create a \\"Tolkien-esque\\" feeling of scope, don't delude yourselves. Tolkien created far greater scope in a fraction of the words that Jordan has used so far. Jordan is barely in the same sport, let alone the same league as Tolkien. One can only hope that Jordan gets his act together and is able to finish this already over-extended series with some amount of credulity. Like other reviewers, I am now resigned to the fact that George R.R. Martin is the only game in town, since Terry Goodkind (not that strong to begin with) is also not worth reading any more."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I started reading these books years ago. They started slow and then got really good in the middle but the last two books have been disappointing.After reading book nine, I thought, hey, very little happened! I felt sure that book ten would fix this and move the story forward.Unfortunately, nothing happened..lets repeat that...Nothing Happens!!!! Most of the book is spent moving characters around but very little is achieved. Also Jordan is tending to focus more and more on repeatedly describing the same types of character interactions. It is getting boring!!!I figure, I'll give him one more book to move the story forward in a real way and then that is it for me.A very disappointed fan."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"...because this dog of a series deserves it. Like most of the folks who've written reviews, I was also enthralled by the first four or five &quot;Wheel of Time&quot; books, but have been increasingly disappointed since then. The quick pace and tight plotting of those first books gave way to the bloated, glacially-paced anchor-dragging navel-gazing that has come to characterize Jordan's most recent WOT books. His obvious disdain for his fans seems to be surpassed only by his greed."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Heh.You know, i only managed to read 20 Pages of COT, then i hurriedly closed down the book, and run off to the bookstore where i just could exchange it for WINDHAVEN from G.R.R Martin and Lisa Tuttle.Sorry, but the Prelude itself was horrible enough. As i read the very entertaining reviews here, i felt reminded of my own desastrous following of the X-MEN Series long ago, when i was a vivid fan of superhero Comics.There, the Same happened: You have a good series, that started with two brilliant writers (Claremont and Byrne), then they left, other Writers took over, and the Series degenerated into horrible Soap Opera.Granted, in Wheel Jordan still writers his Series, but isn't it almost more tragic? I mean, when other writers ruin a series you could always say: The didn't get it, or the company was at fault, etcetera, etcetera. But what do you say, when the original, once so brilliant Creator is the Source of the Problem? Where does it leave you?Wheel is not a book series anymore. Perhaps it was, a long time ago, when Myrdraal still walked Randland and created that delicious mood of horror, now irrecovably lost.Wheel is now just a Money Making Machine. Like X-Men or Spawn or countless TV Series like X-Files...the merchandising is more important than the book sellings. Dolls, Computergames, Movie rights, Spinoffs (soon to be carried out by work for hire writers, believe me) are getting TOR Books more MOney than the supposed eleven million copies circulating in North America alone (i don't honestly believe this figure. I would suppose that is the actual number of the Print, but nobody can tell me eleven human beeings bought this crap).So, youre complaints will change nothing. TOR will laugh in your face. It's utterly worthless, because the franchise Wheel of Time is already dozens of millions worth and will be exploited to the bottom. JOrdan will write Sequels, and trust me, you won't believe what's coming. These books will be so horrible, so boring, so lacking in every sense, that you will hug your soiled copy of COT and believe it to be a masterpiece of the middle portion of the WOT Series.It CAN and WILL always be worse. The only sane reaction is to bail out, and leave it. Forget the series and try out new writers. You will be far happier.PS: For example Robin Hobb und George R.R. Martin. Honestly, they're the most gifted fantasy writers to date. Alongside David Gemmell of course. And hey, all three can actually conclude something. You won't ever get that from TOR and Jordan.

This is the best series ever conceived. Unfortuntely, Jordan has become lost in his own story. While in the first 6 books he concentrates on the central, and incredibly well-developed, characters of Rand, Mat, Perrin, Elayne, Nynaeve, Egwene, Morraine, Lan, etc...and even adds more great characters such as Aviendha, Ruarc, Loial, Brigitte, Faile, Davram Bashere, etc...in books 7-10 we are innundated with huge numbers of worthless characters from such lame groups as the Sea Folk, the Seanchan nobility, the Kin, the rebel Aiel, THE LIST GOES ON. These characters do nothing and thus their longwinded addition to the story IS WASTING MY TIME. PLEASE JORDAN, GIVE US SOME ACTION. Why is Mat wandering around doing nothing? Perrin is equally doing nothing. Rand did nothing FOR ALL OF BOOK 10!!! We have countless women that I can't even tell apart anymore surrounding Nynaeve and Elaine and ALL THESE CHARACTERS DO IS TAKE AWAY FROM OUR BELOVED CENTRAL CHARACTERS!!! I wish I could sit down with Jordan and really have it out with him because I think he may have turned over control of the series to his 10 year old daughter.

Don't all these wondrous things just SCREAM to be written about? FOCUS Mr. Jordan, FOCUS!I don't know the man, I could be wrong. But I choose to think that Jordan cares so deeply for his story that all the minutiae he writes about in COT have meaning and seem important, at least to him,Sadly, they don't have meaning or interest to most of us.Every series has to have a low point, I sincerely hope COT is it for Wheel of Time. I agree with the many others who feel the editor is to blame. Authors are prone to excess unless reined in. If COT was Jordan &quot;reined in&quot; then the Light help us all.I have collected first edition hardcovers of what I was sure would be the greatest fantasy series of our time. Sad to say after more than a month I haven't even finished COT which I bought without reading the reviews. I thought surely he could not go TWO books with so little payoff.

The only way I can read this is at the gym on the bike (gives me a way to not ogle the women.. they resent that :P)..Jordan is obviously in love with hearing himself talk. I'm not sure who convinced him that we need to hear every little detail of the same contrived, shallow mannerisms of his characters over and over again.. Yes, we get it.. none of the men think they understand women.. Yes, we get it.. the women ALL think men are stupid and need to be looked after by them in their one-dimensional MargeSimpson hmph-ing clucking manner.I am going to have a hard time buying the next book..

At that time the first 6 volumes had already been published so I was able to read them through, one after the other, and was thoroughly hooked. But in the end I finished the 6th book (Lord of Chaos) and then had to wait eagerly like everyone else for book number seven to come out. When at last it did I went out and bought it immediately and dug into it, eager to see what happened next.Had Jordan been on the stock market, his stock would have been high and climbing with all of his first 6 books. But then came number 7 (A Crown of Swords) and his stock took a big drop. A great plot suddenly came to a virtual standstill (\\"glacial movement\\" is what Publishers Weekly calls it). I was disappointed. Almost nothing had happened to move the story ahead, but it did seem that Jordan had set the stage for the next book to make great strides towards the stories conclusion. So again I waited. For 2 years.When The Path of Daggers finally hit the bookstores, I again rushed out to buy the book; convinced that the plot would soar ahead and hold my interest like the earlier books had. I forced myself to read the 591 pages of the book. When I finished I felt cheated. Twice in a row, the plot barely moved. It was obvious that Jordan had stopped writing and was now just selling books. I told myself - and a few others - that I wasn't going to buy or read any more of his books until the final book had been written.But 2 years later when Winter's Heart came out curiosity got the better of me and again I ran out and bought the book. At last it seemed that Robert Jordan had heard the message of his disgruntled fans: a major milestone was reached in the story line and my fictitious Jordan stock rebounded. Jordan was back and I couldn't wait for book ten.I finished book ten, Crossroads of Twilight, a few days ago. I read 672 pages before anything happened: one event in the last 8 pages of the book that leaves you hanging (undoubtedly for another 1 to 2 years). Rand himself, the Dragon Reborn, makes only a few, brief, guest appearances in the book. Nynaeve doesn't enter into the story at all. She is seen once watching her warder sparing with other warders and is mentioned by others in passing. She doesn't appear otherwise and never utters a word.I'm not sure yet whether I should feel cheated again, or just bored."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Without piling on this is going no-where fast and this book goes absolutely no-where.

This book tends to be a catch-up for all of the characters that you didn't hear much about in the last few books. Book ten does move you ahead in many ways, but until about halfway through you don't catch up to the end of the last book. I love the way Mr. Jordan explains the relations between men and women, I find myself agreeing often. Mat and Tuon is a romantic strugle to even attract a womans attentions to this type of series. This book has a lot of twists and turns that you have to follow, to see who is a darkfriend, and who isn't. In conclusion if you read book one, you probably have read them all, and are waiting impatiently for book 11(as I am). You shouldn't be dissapointed, this is an excellent book.

Having read the entirety of the series 3 times over the years perhaps I cannot or should not be making the case but even the first read through (after the release of book 9) the plot and story were engaging and easy to follow, the side characters each had a purpose they executed it and it added to the overall feeling of a cohesive and dynamic world where effects carried through space and time. And what happened mattered. This effect is what made the series such a passion for me unlike I have experienced before or since and I cant help get the feeling that the readers complaining about the complexity or pace the series have taken are simply lazy or looking for immediate satisfaction. Immediate satisfaction in it self is not a bad thing but definitely not to be found here. If that is what you want go read a short story or watch a movie but you will be missing out on a depth and sense of realism not found in many places. And to finish my drunken rant.. some of you may simply lack the mental faculties to partake in the delectable ambrosia of WIN that is this book.

When we got the bizarre photo, it was over."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Firstly, I'd like to start by saying that I'm pretty bemused by all the pot-shots on BOTH sides of the argument. I've heard people who think CoT is good claiming that those who dislike it are brainless. At the same time, people who rate it lowly have been martyring themselves by saying that all the RJ supporters keep badmouthing them but then the anti-RJ reviewers go on to insult the grammar of high raters! I don't think either side is right in doing this and I think a review should just be that... reviewing the book. I know that I've broken my own rule but I'm not supporting either side in this - I think you're only weakening the authenticity of your reviews by attacking each other at all. I'm sure that everyone can see that I and many of my fellow RJ supporters have perfectly good grammar but at the same time, I'm not aware that any of those against RJ are lacking in brains. Now to the important business at hand...Yes I did enjoy Crossroads and no I'm not too blind to realize that I'm in a minority... but I'm afraid that's just me. I can understand why many people are feeling very miffed - there is no massive climax at the end and in fact the cliffhanger is extremely irritating... but also tantalizing.What I really enjoyed about this book was all the political developments and meetings of the Hall - and I think therein also lies the reasons that so many dislike it. Being a great fan of law and politics, I am always excited when RJ includes such things. Yet I remember lots of people complaining about how PoD was too concerned with the petty business of Egwene and her manipulations of the Hall... if you didn't enjoy that in PoD, then I'm afraid you're going to have a long slog through this book. For me though, it's been a luxury to see all these squabbling Aes Sedai and a very nice chapter where a guilty pleasure of mine (Elaida a'Roihan) shows her claws. There is also a very unexpected revelation, which came from an Aes Sedai of the Red Ajah that left me practically drooling for further developments. I'll say read and find out of course but what happened certainly came left of centre for me.On the other hand - I can see the point of those who disliked it as well of course - NONE of the plots that we were expecting to be resolved were resolved, I'll be quite blunt about that. But for those wanting action, I promise that it will be there in book 11 - and even I will be lost as a fan if I'm wrong. I do believe that book 10 was necessary to set up for the true action and I know a lot of people have told you this to death already but let me reiterate it. There is going to be an explosion and it will be in book 11. I will stake my life on that!Keep reading and have faith..."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I think book is nice people are crazy to say it is not.

The \\"middle\\" acts have always been about furthering the conflict, building suspense, raising questions, and Jordan seems to be, *HOPEFULLY*, building to a finale that should deliver very well.He does pack a lot of information into these books and I had thought not very cohesively, but, I have since changed my mind about that. The books that seem \\"SLOW\\" are very revealing. I must admit I had to go back and re-read because I could not remember specifically a lot of the material, but, once I did I was like \\"Aha!!\\" that makes sense now.I say this to say that, although not as rousing as the first 3 or 4 books, the lastest are every bit as satisfying, to me, but in a different way."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I read a lot of reviews before I was able to get the book and every review said it was terrible.

Also what could lead others not to like this book is that a couple of characters that aren't widely liked are in it (Eg and Elayne; I do like them).

Tragically, Mr. Jordan sees fit to name each and every one, including their rich diverse backgrounds and relationships with every other living thing. The result is rambling long books involving little action, and holding precious little interest. To be sure, Mr. Jordan writes descriptively well. But the last several books have no longer been as eagerly awaited as the first five or six. Even the most diehard of fans are losing interest, as they can get their epic fantasy fix from the likes of Peter Jackson. Rereading the LotR trilogy reminds one how an epic tale can indeed conclude. Mr. Jordan should take note. Of course, as an author, writing for money is what he does, a fact that has become disturbingly clear every two years lately."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This is the worst book in the series IMO. Whatever happened to the Robert Jordan who wrote books 1-6? You know, back when important things happened, and not just rushed into a climax at the end. Of course, this book doesn't even have a climax. Nothing happens! All of the major plot threads are practically at the same place they were at the beginning of the book. Some people claim this was a \\"character development\\" book, but I must have been reading something different from them. I read more of the same inner character turmoil that we've seen for the last nine books. Others claim that this is a \\"setup for the next book book\\". Likely, but I can't even fathom anyone can write 700 pages of setting up. When I physically look at the book, I'm bewildered by how someone can write 700 pages of nothing.Of course, I'll keep buying 'em until the series is done. I'm a junkie in need of a shot. But I'll no longer recommend the series to others, except perhaps when it's all finished."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I just finished reading this book. It's got Jordan's usual flair for description of locale and depth of emotion. It's got an awful lot of adjectives and similes, anyway. And I suppose you could say it's well-written, the way that all of the books in this series are. In fact, the charm of Jordan's writing style that made me fall in love with the series has actually managed to improve in this, the tenth book of the Wheel of Time series.But nothing HAPPENS. It's 650 pages of fluff, and 22 pages of plot advancement. After spending almost ten years of my life following this damned story, I want it to END. I had just received my driver's license when I started reading the first book. If Jordan keeps up this pace, I'll be in my thirties by the time it's over.If he were more focused on advancing the story, instead of introducing dozens of characters that have nothing to do with it, he would have been done two books ago. His descriptive style and depth made me want to hear his story, but now it's all description, and no story.Crossroads of Twilight is 672 pages long, and Rand Al'Thor, the main character of the series doesn't even show up until page 550. The 549 pages preceding that are very well written, but would have been much easier to digest if they were cut by half. It seems Jordan has introduced so many trivial characters and sub-plots in his previous books that he's painted himself into a corner, and now has to close all those threads before he can continue with the actual story.To its credit, this book at least hints at big advances in the plot, which sadly don't come to pass in this book. This book is all set-up, and although I hate to hope for fear of being disappointed, the next book might end up being the best in the series to date (save for the first..."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"In \\"Crossroads of Twilight\\" Robert Jordan has hit a new low. In each of the previous 9 installments of the Wheel of Time, at least *one* major sub-plot or mystery was brought to some sort of closure. Not so here. Virtually nothing at all happens. Do yourself a favor. Save the ... bucks and wait for the Reader's Digest version. Jordan has \\"forsaken\\" his loyal audience in what I can only assume is a crass (albeit successful) attempt to milk every dime out of this now-wearisome psuedo-epic."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"With the Wheel of Time series Robert Jordan created and introduced interesting characters involved in the familiar (but with a unique flare) theme of good versus evil. Crossroads of Twilight, however, is not worthy of Robert Jordan or the Wheel of Time.Robert Jordan needs to reread the first 3-4 books in the Wheel of Time series, revive his writing style and retake control of the story. He also needs an editor who will cull out unnecessary details. (Compare the first book in the series (The Eye of the World) to this latest effort -- you will be astonished at the change in style, content, and pacing.)I hope that the remaining Wheel of Time books will reflect Mr. Jordan's work earlier in the series."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Robert Jordan my be losing control of his creation. He has introduced too many minor plot lines and twists that are now bogging down the story to the point where nothing happens. The plot doesn't move forward in this book, in fact, it barely catches up to the end of the last book. Most of the book is concerned with details that really should have been taken care of in the prologe. The problem with that is the prologue was already 1/7 of the book. Robert Jordan really needs to decide where he's going with the story and trim a little of the fat. As it is he's heading into a disturbing patter of every other book being good. Four years is a long time to wait for any sort of plot movement."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Boy this book takes like half the book to finally get into anything meaty. I tried reading this book several times before I just put it down. The writing in this book also doesn't seem very clear and concise. Maybe I was bored out of my mind after reading 5 chapters that I wasn't paying attention anymore. Or it could be the Robert Jordan is just getting too old to write good books."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"The tenth in the seemingly never-ending Wheel of Time series (seriously, is this wheel ever going to stop rolling?). Rand al'Thor is still the Dragon Reborn, still fighting against the Dark One, and still counting on his friends Mat Cauthon and Perrin Aybara. Perrin's wife has been kidnapped by the Shaido, and Perrin is giving chase as best he can. Mat is fighting his way out of Seanchan territory with Tuon, the Daughter of the Nine Moons, whom he's been told he will marry someday. Elayne Trakand, one of Rand's three sister-wives, is trying to solidly claim the Lion Throne of Andor. And this is all just part of the plot. Not a lot of resolution here, unfortunately, but KNIFE OF DREAMS has recently been published in paperback and I'm told there is some resolution there."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I gather many are irritated with this book because it has few of the momentous events and speed that previous books in the series take. I WAS bothered by that at first, but in retrospect, I don't think it's quite that bad. It may be the \\"weakest\\" in terms of shocking events and stunning revelations, let's keep it in perspective: We're reading an epic of Homeric quality; like any real war, it has it's ebbs and flows. I had thought clear back at the end of book 4 or 5 that Jordan would be drawing the story to a close soon. After all, we had two sides in a war, getting ready to slug it out. What more could we need? Then, to my surprise AND delight, he added at least one more faction to the mix.Yes, this particular book slows the action quite a little, but I think it makes plenty of sense to do so. I gather many are irritated by Jordan's \\"random\\" grabs for previous characters, but I personally love it! In real life, complications happen all the time, especially when you least expect.In summary, I suggest that someone buy this book, if they've reached this point in the series. It may be slower, but it'll pick up again in the following book(s).I'm looking forward to the last two books with eager anticipation!"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I've got a real problem when reviewing this book. From what I've noticed here at the comments section, the reviews are either 1 star or 4-5 stars. Of course, this doesn't mean anything - there are also 5 star reviews of \\"Baldur's Gate\\" which in my opinion has completely no redeeming qualities whatsoever. So, why my \\"in between\\" 3 star rating?I have a tendency of buying and reading books in whole series. I'm a quick reader, and I prefer to read whole series rather than wait for the next part to be published in a year or so. The same was the case with Wheel of Time. I read through the entire series with quite a lot of pleasure. I have a tendency to skip overlong irrelevant description fragments, so they didn't hurt me that much. But I did have the impression of a gradual decline in the last few books of the series. It is as the amount of pages \\"waiting for something to happen\\" as opposed by \\"something happening\\" has increased from like 30% to 80% of the books.Still, I wasn't bored. There was still enough content for me to read through it and enjoy it. However, I understand how people who bought or read CoT after a year or 2 from reading the previous part(s) must have felt. I recently bought Salvatore's third part of his latest Drizzt trilogy. It wasn't that bad literature, but a year had passed since I read the previous part and the book, like CoT, lacked climax. Although there was far more action there than there was in CoT, I still found it a hard read and I could barely plow through it. I can only imagine that if I was reading CoT in similar circumstances, I'd be furious over wasting money for such an insubstantial book.So, my recommendation is simple. If you've just read the 9 previous books and you're anxious to know what's going on, then this book will probably give you an enjoyable read. It's slow paced to say the least, but as long as you're just after reading the previous parts and you're \\"feeling the mood\\", it doesn't matter that much. If you're a resigned reader who's been reading the series as it was being published and you felt that book 9 was getting too slow for comfort, don't read it. You'll have problems getting through it and you will probably regret the wasted time/money. Instead, wait for book 11/12 where the culmination is to take place and read the reviews on it. If Jordan actually does unwind the plots then, you can get book 10 before reading the other ones and you probably won't be disappointed. If he doesn't... well, at least you won't regret losing time and/or money."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I guess I'll try not to spoil anything. I am an avid reader, ever since I have been in elementary school I found that reading brings me to a whole new world, one that I can become fully immersed in. Out of the dozens of series I have read and finished, the Wheel of Time by far surmounts any other piece of literature I have picked up. Robert Jordan has created a world that is so complex, so beautiful, that no words can describe his words. The thirst for knowledge this book and series imbues onto you is insane. The characters experience strife, find their determination, and continue on to face what fate (AKA Robert Jordan) has in store for them. I find that Robert Jordan's way of encapsulating his world near-perfect. The world seems alive in its own. Sometimes I am able to predict what happens but each time I can't Robert Jordan surprises me and stuns me. Things will happen that you will never have guessed and keep you wanting more.**Storyline Review**While everyone says the series gets too slow or that Robert Jordan is trying to stretch the series out for the worst, I disagree, at least about the stretching part. While the series does slow down, it slows down to explain the complex world in depth that some people might not appreciate the art and beauty of it, or that they do not like having too many intricate story lines and patterns in their books. If you are one of those people, I guess you wouldn't enjoy this book. but I for one LOVE complex stories, trying to guess who that person is or how he is connected to certain events that I still haven't found the answer to from book 5. All the books set up for something greater, the ending. There are so many complex stories within this book that it amazes me how they all interconnect. The complexity is awesome, and I wish more series could achieve the level of writing that Robert Jordan has.While everyone complains that this one in particular is crap and it is just too slow, and though I do agree about the slow part, it is simply setting up the stage for Tar'mon Gaidon, the Last Battle. The book is still great and major events occur in this book. I finished half of it in one night just because I was eager to find out what had happened to the characters from the previous book's events. Robert Jordan still has his way with words, and the way he weaves his events.All in all, It is still a great read for those who can appreciate the complex story."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I really enjoyed this book, despite all the negative reviews I'd heard prior to reading. Sure, there wasn't a great deal of action, but there were many interesting plot and character developments, and I still adore Jordan's writing style. Descriptive, but not overly so. (And to anyone who disagrees--try reading anything by Dennis L McKiernan, THEN tell me CoT has too much description). Overall, this book was a turning point in the series, and I think readers can look forward to more fast-paced books in the future."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"(This review ignores book eight of the series, which this reviewer nearly sacrificed to the deities of writing.)There is a problem with this book. If you think about it, then it should become clear. Mr. Jordan's prose has not changed in a significant degree over the past decade; the pacing of his description has also not changed to a significant degree since the first book.So what could the difference be that causes long-time readers of a series to turn coat and say that they hate the author? The answer is in two parts.Up to and including, depending upon whom you ask, the fifth or sixth books of the series, Mr. Jordan managed to maintain a constant sense of forward motion and gathering momentum. Even during the slower parts of the books, those that involved nothing more than characters' rumination on past or present events, there was always the sense that there was always a sense that things were moving forward quickly, even when they were actually moving quite slowly. In other words, there was always a tone of urgency to the narrative.That sense of urgency is gone. It has been replaced by a much more deliberate pacing, and this, I believe, is the source of many readers' disappointment. When reading a Wheel of Time novel most people expect that same feeling from the first book that great, inescapable forces were constantly pushing at the characters, and those forces had to be dealt with NOW. Now that Rand and the various other characters have gained some measure of power and control, they no longer have to bend immediately to the will and whim of fate. Rand, for instance, is so powerful, in all meanings of the word, that only something of true magnitude can hope to force his hand. It is almost the problem that Raymond E. Feist faces with his wizard character, Pug. When characters reach a certain level of puissance, there is only so much that the author can do to challenge them.Unfortunately, Mr. Jordan's prior world building and prophesying has forced him to slow the action a great deal while Rand and the other characters move the world into the proper position for the Last Battle. The scope of such an endeavor obviously requires a major change in overall narrative pace. This is the first problem that many have with book 10, The Crossroads of Twilight.The second problem many see is that this most recent book departs from what most see as the main plot of the story to follow the actions of many ancillary characters, etc. All I can say to this reaction is that these ancillary characters comprise much of what Rand and the others need to deal with before the prophecies can be fulfilled. The Seanchan need to be quelled or placated, the Aes Sedai and the various nations are the same. Much of what constitutes the substance of this book is the placing of the chess pieces so that the endgame can begin. Whether that means that certain people need to talk to certain other people or that others need to do some killing, it can't really be said that nothing is happening.This book is essentially the calm before the storm that is eventually coming to all of the Westlands, the storm that Nynaeve sensed from the outset. While there is little action in the sense of battles and adventure, much happens to set things up for the next installments. The ends of many plot threads are brought within sight, and several unanswered questions are put to rest. Granted, there is nothing approaching the level of excitement found in the first books, but it is a worthwhile read for the purpose of preparing the reader and the Westlands for the Last Battle."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":". . .

More books, more money perhaps? Long story short, if you've come this far you have to read 10 as well, but don't get your hopes up if your dying to hear about Rand after book 9.

I must agree with the vast majority of reviews in that this book is slow and ponderous, and does not accomplish much. What I find most frustrating now is what I once enjoyed the most. I once reveled in the complex plot and huge character base, now due to the time extended time between books I can't remember what Aes Sedai did what back in book four and who got re-incarnated in book nine and is now a man or a woman. I also found it incredibly frustrating that we don't get any news of Rand until after 500 pgs! I can understand a large series such as this has sub-plots that need to be dealth with, but come-on, Rand is why we read these books, not Egwene. Speaking of sub-plots, how about we wrap up just one or two every book? With all that said I did still enjoy the emersion in the story and think it is the best Fantasy I have ever read.

So the more words you use, the more money you make. The essence of Good Writing is telling a story with as few words as possible. Jordan seems to have forgotten that. We liked Rand, Egwene, and the rest of his characters, so we bought Jordan's books; making him a star. Rather than be true to his craft and tell the story, Jordan has chosen to string us along for \\"All the market will bear.\\" He has forgotten that WE made him a star and his name is only worth something if we CONTINUE to buy his books. Betraying us, his customers with filler material in place of a story will result in fewer books being sold, of both this book and any he may write in the future.A good editor like Lester Del Rey or John Campbell would have pared this 822 page book down to 22 pages, if they were feeling REALLY generous toward the author.

I stopped reading The Wheel of Time after book 8, but I am mildly curious about the ending.

Like the Dragonlance trilogies (Weis & Hickman), or the several excellent Drow miniseries (Salvatore), even the Belgariad (Eddings). The point is to wrap up a story before starting the next.That's some free advice for aspiring authors.

Jordan writes about tea and how to wash silk and extremely boring political intrigue that has nothing to do with the major plots he established in the previous 9 books. I just don't get it. If you write down all of the things he could have written about, its almost as if Jordan purposely picked the most boring possible.Why would he do this ? I think that Jordan is like a miser.

Mr. Jordan has topped that list for 7 years, but until he proves that he actually has a story left to tell he has been banished from the list.If you haven't bought Crossroads of Twilight yet, wait for the paperback. Or even better, check it out from the library, borrow it from a friend, or some other way that won't support the \\"More books, more bucks\\" monstrosity that the Wheel of Time series has become."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Robert Jordan's story was wonderful in the beginning. Unfortunately he has become bogged down in the myriad of details and characters he has created. Way too much attention is spent on the politics of the various situations and not nearly enough on story. It has become obvious that Jordan is milking this story out for all that it is worth.Please go back to telling the tale and not examining every little detail of the Wheel of Time's histories."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"What a colossal waste of time and money. I should have waited until the book was on the bargain table. By now, Jordan should be aware of the fact that he is losing readers in droves. I kept reading and reading and reading and nothing much happened that couldn't have been covered in two chapters in the FINAL installment. Mr. Jordan? Are you there? Finish, already!"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I started reading the series about 6 years ago. Several of the books had already been published. They were fun, intriguing and had a beginning a middle and some sort of conclusion. The last three books have been awful and this one failed to please. Just end it. If not, bring some of these strands together. How many characters have been introduced only to never be heard from again? Enough. I am done with this. Great promise that has turned into nothing."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This may have been the biggest waste of my time I have ever spent. This book went absolutely nowhere and was almost completely void of any intriguing situations. My hope is that Mr. Jordan gets things back together and finishes this series in the way he started it. The last two books have been real let-downs. This book amazingly more than the last."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"As with many of the reviewers, I've been following this series since the beginning. And Robert Jordan did a magnificent job in building momentum from Books 1 to roughly around 6.Unfortunately, where the first half of the series would cover weeks in the story, the last several books will cover mere DAYS or even HOURS - and that's where the problem lies. It moves too S-L-O-W.I've found myself skimming most of the book - something I would NEVER have done with the first six books. There is too much focus on peripheral characters - and not enough momentum with the core characters (when he finally gets to them).There are some nice attention to detail here and there - but overall it seems to be a re-hash of things we have known for the past three books. This wasn't the worst (that would be 'Path of Daggers') but this wasn't on par with his best ('The Dragon Reborn through 'Lord of Chaos')I used to consistently rave about this series to everyone I knew - but the last few books have been terrible disappointments. It's clear that Jordan's goal is to write a fantasy of epic proportions - but it *IS* possible to do so within a ten book (or three, in the case of Tad Williams's wonderful 'Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn' trilogy) series."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I think most fans agree on this but to the few hardcore jordan freaks i just want to bring up some points. This was an excellent book for character development and interaction. You can obviously see that Mr Jordan loves his characters and wants us to love them as well . But as a book it is hard to go through 1400 or so pages of character development.An author could go on and on about their characters to the point of explaining when they go to the bathroom and how they don't get along with their mother in law .These are not useless insights just boring . We all know a coworker who cant seem to tell a simple story in under a few minutes they just drone on and on to the point where you want to chew your own leg off to escape .I respect Mr Jordans ability as a writer and i am a hard core fan but he has to get back to basics of moving a story along so he doesnt water down the excellent world he has created.To make one more example I compare it to tolkien or dickens both good writers but you get sentences like this in their books\\" the emerald green leaf of the maple tree was so green, it was like something really green, i mean you cant understand the depth of the green of this green , green leaf\\"get over it i know what a leaf looks like I do not need that much description of something in my everyday life.Time in the book would be better spent describing strange new things or moving the story along.And as one previewer already said ,by this time things like aiel , Aes sedai are no longer strange to us fanatics.Good Luck Mr Jordan"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"The Wheel of Time was one of the greatest fantasy epics of all time, not rivaling Tolkien--but then what does--but still great fantasy. Then came books seven through ten. To Jordan's credit, major things did happen at the end of seven and nine (another Forsaken dies, saidin is cleansed) but that was about it. Eight was a chore to read, but I almost screamed in frutstration when I finished ten. As everyone else has said, nothing happens, nothing. Jordan could have condensed most of ten into a couple hundred pages, or maybe just the prologue, for book eleven. How did it take him so long to write absolutely nothing.Now, unlike some of the other reviewers, I fully intend, at this point, to finish the series out (assuming Jordan finished writing it), but Jordan should be warned that even the most faithful fan has his or her limit for abuse. When I go back and read the first six books (which I do with great joy each time a new book is about three months from release), it breaks my heart to see how low Jordan's work has been taken. Please, please don't do this to us again."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This book covered nothing and went nowhere with the plot. Most of the events covered in this book happen just before and during the cleansing of the male half of the source and we end up right where we were at the end of Winters Heart. There is no development of Mat or Perrins situations, lots of descriptions of them, but no development. Rand at the end is seen to have surrvived, but there is little or no mention of what effect the cleansing of the male half has had. I really expected better from Robert. This book almost seems like he suddenly discovered that he only had 11 books worth of material and a contract for 12. The only good thing is that I didn't put out the money for this book. The bad thing is that someone who loves me did pay for this."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Up to Book 5 or even 6 this series deserved 5 stars. Since then, Jordan has dwelled too long on describing boring and prosy side plots over several chapters that should have gotten no more than a paragraph at the most! Back to the captivating descriptions and spellbinding narrative of the first books Robert, please!!"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I' m writing this review in the hope to aid Jordan's fan (like myself) entrapped in the serie:Bee better than me stop reading WoT books!CoT goes nowere, it leaves you at the same point of the previous book (or nearly the same to not make difference), it's a 700 pages long waste of time, in my opinion Jordan has lost count of haw many plots has opened and goes on in opening new, without closing any.It's a pity to so review a book of Jordan, but it is only and simply the truth"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Which is exactly what happened in this book, and what pretty much every reviewer has expressed. This series already had too many characters to begin with and now Robert Jordan gives us even more to worry about! And to top that off we get NO resolution to any of the plotlines already going on. This book and Winter's Heart should have been made into one book since their timeframes coincide almost exactly.RJ does seem to be setting up the series for a big finish with this book, but who knows how many more books that will take. I had hoped that we would get some answers in this book about Moiraine, the Forsaken, and what Rand's plans are, but alas, I was sorely disappointed.I will probably keep reading this series, but I hope RJ puts a LOT more effort into his next book, because this one was his worst by far. Books 1-6 each stand on their own as solid stories, but the last four books could be condensed into 2, maybe 3 books. Far too much time is spent describing inanimate objects and reiterating thoughts characters have expressed many times before. Come on, RJ, move the story along, PLEASE!!!"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Ok,ok, huge fantasy fan here. Love Goodkind, Tolkein, and Jordan, but come on Robert. All of your loyal Fans have been waiting for this book to come and and solve some issues, and nothing. Nothing at all happens. Rand barely shows up in the book, and no one ever really talks about him cleansing saidin. biggest thing to happen in the last book, and Cadsuane is the only one who even mentions it. If you're thinking about buying this one, don't, go down to the library, check it out, and read the last two chapters. please Mr Jordan, don't drag this series out to make more money. End it gracefully, and do it like you did the first six books which all of your loyal fans love."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Paging Mr. Jordan... please stand up to your publisher, your editor, or whoever has you over the barrel and return to the writing your ever expanding fanbase fell in love with in the first 5 books. I can't begin to describe the dissapointment I felt with this book. It seems as if Robert Jordan spent the last 2 years vacationing, while spending about a week devoted to writing this latest installment. There is a point in the middle of the book, where he actually takes up 4 PAGES to describe how a bath got too cold. The excitment, intruige and mystery that surrounded the first 5 books is vacant here. No part of the story is moved forward. The only interesting parts of the book involve Mat and Perrin, and that is only about 1/6 of the book. The rest of the book is devoted to vacuous, inane descriptions of some minor character's clothes and hairstyle, or some other silly non-important theme. The story is not moved forward an inch. At this rate, we should expect the series to conclude in 2050, with the 35th volume. At this point it is fairly obvious that the Wheel of Time has been turned into a financial juggernaut rather than an intruiging, well written fantasy. We all desire a Return of the King *snicker*... The King you were in creating the wonderful series that the Wheel of Time started out to be. Paging Mr. Jordan... Paging Mr. Jordan...."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"As an extremely patient, devoted fan of WoT, I have painstakingly spent hours of my time poring over each page of this series... however where my enthusiasm once was is now a lackadaisical glassy-eyed apathy. I cannot fathom how a once-great author could possess the propensity to completely butcher a previously riveting work of art.CoT provides no real depth or development anywhere. I have reread previous books (particularly books 1-6) in the series more than a dozen times, but this series has lost its previous shine and the last few books seem consigned to a fate of collecting dust in the lower reaches of my shelves where I keep my less-than-liked books.... if they even find their way there.As a reader determined to stake it out until the end though I will most likely slog my way through the series' meandering and hope that it reaches a conclusion that will not be robbed of its glory by the torturously long journey required to achieve it.I do hope however that RJ will finish this series off soon and take on new challenges, or just call it quits.... at the moment he is only taking the lives of innocent trees and wasting away in the same capitalistic manner that has come to dominate much of society today."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"You know... I've always considered Robert Jordan &quot;chunky&quot; reading. By that I mean there is always something going on, new plotlines, new twists on old plotlines, new characters...But I finished this book and thought to myself &quot;Was there anything at ALL in there that was worth reading?&quot; For the first time in this series, the answer was &quot;No.&quot;I kind of liked the update where we all found out what everyone was doing when Rand and Nynaeve cleansed the Source, but my God... 300+ pages of it? And even when Jordan had finished treading water he just sank.This is a horribly disappointing book. The only reason it gets two stars is because Jordan has enough talent to make fluff mildly readable. Sadly, we all know he has more talent than this book shows.Note to Mr. Jordan: If you're tired of writing about your world, then just let us know. We'd rather find a new and interesting one than line your pockets."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"After reading the previous 9 books of the series multiple times, recommending this series to several friends, and now after reading this tenth book I have two words for anyone interested in picking up the series: \\"DON'T BOTHER\\". The only thing you will be able to take away from this book is that either RJ is in desperate need of money and is looking to line his pockets or that he has absolutely no clue as to where this series is headed. The first six books of this series were outstanding, seven through nine could be stomached, but ten is a very bad soap opera. Nothing happens in this book and it goes nowhere. Anyone considering picking up the series should wait until RJ finishes it, if he ever does. Otherwise, you could be waiting around for years until he produces another book that in all likelihood would be the same as this one a load of [junk]"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I'd give this stupid book .5 stars if I could. This is the biggest load of garbage Jordan has tried to put on readers since Path of Daggers.NOTHING HAPPENS in this book. At least in the other books, there were some memorable scenes I'd remember when I finished. There aren't ANY of that here. I'm so mad. What is this guy thinking? This series could be so great, there are so many threads he could follow, but instead he throws names around like crazy and ignores the multitude of interesting characters he's already developed.I can sympathize with someone suffering from a bit of writer's block, as it appears Jordan has lost the inspiration that marked the first 4-5 books. However, it doesn't make the book any better to read.A COMPLETE waste of money, but unfortunately you're probably like me- you have the other nine, so you almost feel obligated to own the &quot;complete&quot; collection."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Nothing needs this many books. The history of our own entire planet isn't even this long."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"He's obviously afraid to end this series because we would all see him for the one trick pony that he is. To use an analogy, he's like a one hit wonder band. But he has a luxury that all these one hit wonder bands don't have... he can stretch out his only decent tune over years and years. Imagine if one of these bands could release their only hit song in bits 'n' pieces over the years. I'm sure many of them wish they could. Intro and verse here... two years from now we'll give you the bridge... two years after that we'll give you the chorus... then we'll just repeat and spread out the verses over the next ten years until we're old, fat and rich before wrapping it up. Well guess what, Jordan... you're already old, fat and rich so stick a fork in it already.Look at it this way, if Jordan were truely an inspired and imaginative writer, don't you think he'd have all kinds of ideas for new stories just rattling around in his head that he'd be itchin' to get out there? Obviously not. &quot;Master storyteller&quot; my backside..."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I stopped reading the books some time ago because I got frustrated with how long it took for the new ones to come out. Well..I just started the series again, and am currently on The Lord of Chaos. I came on here to see if book 11 came out and just thought I would see how the reviews were. I must say I was a little startled to see such low ratings until I read the reviews. I'm almost dreading continuing my reading because I already felt like the books were dragging a bit. And now it doesn't look like it will get much better?? Joy... But..being an avid reader and have already been drawn into the series and want to see where everything will go, I will continue to trudge on...Especially if I need help falling asleep at night."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"It is obvious from the large number of reviewers for this book that there are many people out there who have liked this series, and would like it again, if the big bang of events and would cease to stop expanding and start collapsing toward the end. Perhaps the galaxies of this book have expanded too far for them ever to come back again. But, given that so many reviewers express hope that an end is in sight, that the books could surprise and delight us (and not with more new subplots), Mr. Jordan, please hear our plea. We want to enjoy reading your books again."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"When I reached page 498, I realized that Rand had died in book nine. For those of you who are confused, I think Jordan hid Rand's death somewhere after the epilogue in the extensive glossary. I came to this conclusion, because I knew no sane writer would write such a long and boring 500 pages without ONCE including the main character... unless... unless he had some crazy brilliant ulterior motive. It's either that or Jordan needed some quick cash. Now, I don't think I spent all these many hours reading his book just to make him richer, do you?"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"All ground that has already been covered. Absolutly the longest most boring book I've read outside of school work.I'm so far into the series I feel like I can't get out, but I will no longer buy hard cover and the library will have to loan me a copy as I refuse to pay for it."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I started reading the first 50 pages, gave up and will just wait for the final book."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This series is geeting ridiculous. Nothing occured in this book or in the one before it for that matter. Jordan needs to wrap things up in his next book."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I've read the other nine. Agree that Jordon has lost the plot. I'm NOT buying this one. Maybe this will get the point across. If 11 looks good, I'll buy that, read the synopsis and continue on. If not, bye bye book sales Mr. Jordan."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I won't even bother to say the plot goes nowhere, since this has already been stated in detail. But I have to say how tired I am for Jordan's weak excuse for characterization. Angry and irritable = grinding of teeth, anxious = smoothing of skirts, etc. This repetitive use of the same behaviors supposedly describing emotion is tedious and lazy. I read this book in record time because I had to skim it or begin grinding my own teeth!"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I Bought this book from in April 2003. I still haven't finished it at the end of Decmber 2003. It puts me to sleep at night. I'm lucky if I get through one page before I get sleepy. It is THAT BORING!!!!I'm glad he came out with another one though, cause I'm getting close to the end of this one, and I'll still need to get to sleep at night. I mean I'm completely addicted to falling asleep this way, and probably couldn't get to sleep at night without Robert Jordan books! I'm certain the latest book will again..., be more... mundane... meaningless.... detail. Just exactly what I need.I have to assume that the following is true:1: RJ must have signed a contract for so many books at so many pages/words per book.2: He's tired of the story and doesn't have a clue how to tie it altogether, but still has to fill his contract.3: He's giving TOR the bare contract minimum number of pages/words, without a real plot, and hoping they'll get tired of his bull and agree to cancel the contract.I am completely fed up with all the stupid names, and who's doing what and when and where blah blah blah.... BUT...it does work for getting to sleep (heh heh). Even so, I keep finding myself hoping the Dark One escapes and kills them all. At least that would be SOMETHING!Whoever keeps comparing this to Tolkien should have their head examined. Tolkien puts more in one chapter, than RJ does in a complete book! The only problem is, Tolkien keeps me awake at night!"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I started reading this series about 5 months ago. It was really nice to start a long series, where so many of the books were completed and I didn't have to wait for months for a new one to come out. Bought most the books at Half-Price books...very cool. Finally got to the last published book in the series, and had to go to Barnes &amp; Nobles to get it. Finished Crossroads of Twilight yesterday. This is the only book in the series that I felt compelled to write a review.It was horrible.Now, to be fair, I have to say I really enjoyed the first 9. After looking at the reviews, I see I may be alone in that regard. But, being able to read them all back to back, I found they flowed pretty well and I stayed enthusiastic. I know they can be long winded and overly descriptive...but, still had enough going on for me to enjoy them all. Until I got to #10.This book does absolutely nothing. Nothing happens. It's all politics. In each of the main characters little scenerio, myriads of new political characters are introduced. I have completely lost track of who they are. There musta been 20-30 political characters introduced just in ELAYNE's little world of ANDOR. Her succession to the throne, and the politics of it all musta took up 1/3 of the book.Who cares?!Similar thing happened with Egwene. Tons of Aes Sedai politics in her little world, pages and pages...but, not much else. Well, ok...the one big development that happened in this book was Elayne moved the Aes Sedai, and they are now outside the walls of Tar Valon in seige mode. That's it. If you know that little tidbit, you do not have to read this book.Basically nothing happened with Rand. Matt basically hasnt moved much...and Perrin is still frustrated at trying to get Faille.There you have it.This book can be skipped. Something just HAS to happen in the next one...it just has to! You do not have to read this one to enjoy the next one...methinks.But, if your like me...you probably will :)I'll keep reading. This book is the only one that I found boring. I musta skipped as much of this book as I read. I'm sure I'll get the next one. However, if the next book doesn't actually do something... :)"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"As others have, I've been with this series since the beginning and can't seem to break away, even when I know it only gets worse (the story-telling, that is) with each book. Well, I've just finished the Prologue chapter and it only took me a little more than a week to do so, and most of that only when I needed something to read while doing my business on the porcelain throne.Anyways, I just wanted to say that I've been reading the reviews (both for this particular installment of the WoT and the previous books), and wanted to point out that the reviews are more entertaining to read than the books!! I especially like the one that said Jordan's die-hard fans would give the toilet paper he wiped his butt with 5 stars!! Hilarious!! There are more reviews like this out there...just spend a few moments perusing them and you'll start enjoying yourself, too!"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I was 15 when I first started reading the &quot;Wheel of Time Series&quot; and I fell in love with the books and the characters. But little did I know that nearly 12 years later, I would still be reading the series and now hating it. Jordan is an amazing author who's attention to detail made me fall in love with the first few books, but now it's getting ridiculous. Nothing happened in this book! It was worthless and pure boredom. There was no point in having this book in the series. It still leaves me with questions and I'm still left confused and wondering what is going on. It doesn't help that Jordan waits over 2 years to publish each book now either. By the time the next book comes out, I've forgotten so many of the characters and it doesn't help that he introduces so many more new characters in each book either. I find myself thinking who is he/she and what does she have to do with anything? I thought I would love this book because Mat has always been my favorite and I have waited for him to meet the Dauther of the Nine Moons for a long time now, but even that story line didn't keep my interest. I forced myself to read it only because I paid money for the book. Whereas when I read &quot;Eye of the World&quot; 12 years ago, I finished it in 2 days. I think I'm definitely done with Jordan for now. When he finishes the last book in 10 years or so, I may pick it up from the library to read the last chapter because I have a feeling he won't answer any of my questions in any of the other books til then. He writing is now long and drawn out and the description that I once loved now seems useless. I wonder if he gets paid by word? I know I for one feel that this book was a waste of money and don't plan on buying any of the rest of his books."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Blood and Bloody Ashes, this book should be called \\"Crossroads of Tedium!\\" The majority of the book is devoted to the few hours during and after Rand cleansed saidin in the last book, and what everyone in the world is doing at the time - and wearing.Jordan's style is to ignore action in favor long, elaborate scenes before or after the action has taken place. For example, there was a murder in Egwene's camp outside Tar Valon and he devotes like three paragraphs to that, but spends the first 9 pages of the same chapter describing how Egwene heats spiced wine before going to sleep! (That's an exaggeration, but only a slight one.) Each one of Robert Jordan's chapters can be cut by half and no one would miss it.Reading the book was like a vacation in Shadar Logoth -- so painful it's scary. I actually bought a used, unabridged audio book version so I could \\"read\\" it while I drive. It helps, 'cause when I put down the hardcover, I'm not all that anxious to pick it back up. Somewhere in this mess Jordan writes that the Last Battle can come any day now, and while I for one look forward to it, I think that's as honest as an Aes Sedai version of the truth. At this snail's pace, we'll probably read another 6000 pages before we're done.The series has gotten unwieldy. I thought it was me at one point, that I wasn't paying enough attention to what's been going on. But when I did my research to keep up with the book, I discovered that according to one fan-site there are more that 1700 characters. It was then I realized the problem wasn't me. (Think about it: I'm doing research to read a NOVEL!)There are some good scenes, really scary things and some clever uses of magic -- the things that made the series so strong in the first 6 books. However, there's so little of those elements in this book, it just reminds us of the series' former glory.If you like tubs of prose, thimbles of action and almost no storyline, then this book is for you!"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Loved the earlier books - even up through book 9, but this is another matter entirely. We have here a book where nothing of substance happens. Rand first appears on page 524. The rest consists of the following:1) A 2 week step back in time where all the other characters wonder what's up when they sense the huge use of the power by Rand &amp; Nynaeve (from the end of book 9). They all remain ignorant of what going on, and none have the ambition to ask any of their supposed long-time friends/loves.2) Many, many new characters, particularly Aes Sedai, described in extreme detail and then never seen again. Sorry, but this is nothing more than filler.3) Elaine trying to gain the throne with endless meetings, while whining because she can't drink wine and no one will heat up her tea. Does anyone really think Elaine will fail to win the throne? So where is the suspense, and why are there perhaps 100 pages of this and one chapter of Rand?4) Lots of Aes Sedai acting like spoiled children. Is anyone else tired of Lelaine and Romanda? Is there any Aes Sedai in Jordan's world who isn't an arrogant, pushy old battleaxe? No wonder none of these women have friends.5) Perrin wandering around and accomplishing absolutely nothing.6) Ditto Matt.We get no significant character development, no real surprises, no reason to wade through this turkey. If you are still an unreserved Jordan fan after reading this, then you are a fan indeed!So after reading the first 10 books (what, maybe 8000 pages?), I'm done. I'll not be buying any more books in this series, and my advice to anyone considering starting the series is....&quot;don't bother&quot;.

The plot doesn't move forward, and results in the character development and action completely drying up. This book is, I hope, an introduction to the next book which will hopefully be more than a waste of paper. If books 8 and 9 disappointed you, please don't waste your money on this book. If you must read it, find it at your local library. It seems that Jordan has completely abandoned his characters, the plot, and his fans for several hundred pages of running in circles and politics. This book functions better as a doorstop."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Mr Jordan ought to be ashamed of himself. This book (only in the sense that it contains words on paper)does absolutely nothing to move the story. At this rate Rand doesn't have to worry about fighting the Dark Lord in the final battle, he will be dead of boredom. Don't buy this book! Go to the library borrow the book and read evry 50th page, you won't miss a thing. I would suggest to Mr. Jordan that if this his what he has left, do us all a favor and wrap up the story in an article in Reader's Digest. We can read the end while sitting in the bathroom.

The first three books were wonderful with extensive fantasy and new worlds to imagine. Not anymore. By book 7 it was getting monotonous. By book 10, the repetition is torture.This book has absolutely nothing in it. Nothing happens that didn't happen in the first 9 books. The Wise ones are arrogant. The Aile are silent, weird, and have naked slaves. The Aes Sedai plot and scheme and back bite with no action of consequence. On and on and on until it is so repetitious you want to cry. The only big thing that happens in the book (something Rand does) you don't get to see or understand at all.Robert Jordan has to end the series. Write the conclusion. he is like relatives that came for the weekend and stayed 21 days too long. It was fun but it isn't anymore. Jordan is out of creative imagination, low on gas. There is no reason to hear Nyneve pulled her damn hair knot again. Or Elayne loves Rand and wants to wring his neck. 10 volumes of the same things over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over.Jordan needs to finish the series, get to the conclusion.I wont buy these books anymore, I'll just go to the library. They aren't worth owning anymore. I'm never going to read this stuff a second time and wouldn't suggest anyone else even start it."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I have just finished the book and Robert Jordan could not have put a greater effort into filling up space with nothing. I got so bored with his flowery descriptions at points that I started skipping whole paragraphs. Believe me, I didn't miss anything either. At one point it takes him a whole page to describe a table. As far as the plot is concerned, nothing happens. This book could have been much better represented as a 100 page prologue to a book that actually does something. Not worth the money. I refuse to support Jordan anymore. I may go to the library for the next book but only if I am really bored. Don't waste your money on this book."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"RJ started out with a very good story. I agree with what has been said so far. Lets end this before I die. I purchased book 9 on tape so I could listen while driving. It put me to sleep. I hope he knows how to finish a story. I think I'll get the next one from a used book yard sale."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I have been upset that the last few books in this series had about half that content of the first five. THIS book is not even half a book. It is nothing more than a prologue for the next book.After the end of the last book, I was really hoping that the action would pick up. Boy was I wrong! It is one thing to string your readers along to make a few more dollars, but at least give a 680 page book a PLOT!!!!IF I continue with this series, I will be sure to buy the books used. RJ will get no more money from me. He has swindled me for the last time!"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I can't believe how little the plot advances in this book. How long ago did Egwene et al. begin their trek to Tar Valon? I thought the White Tower issue had to be resolved in this book - silly me! How many scenes do we need of Aes Sedai glowering at each other over who ranks highest? And whenever anything important is said, Jordan gives the reaction of each person present, no matter how trivial (glares, shawl wrapping, looking thoughtful, looking sick, or actually being sick, and so on). Yes, Mat gets further along in his relationship with Tuon, but for a group that is supposed to be trying to escape the Seanchan, this party moves at a glacial pace. And then there is Rand, the main hero (perhaps), who barely appears in this book. As for Perrin, it's surprising how he can't manage to catch the Shaido despite the fact that his army can travel. Considering how Jordan summarizes past history as he goes along with each character, you can probably avoid this book, as you will be able to read about it again in the next book."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I could of written something like that in 1 year, and I don't know squat. Although my plot line probably wouldn't line up or be as tedious as that.Only read this because, well lets face it, you probably read the first nine and can't wait to see what's going to happen. And nothing did in this book.Lets only hope it doesn't take him another two years for book 11.cause with they way he's going chances are we won't be alive long enough to see this thing through."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This book was a complete disappointment.

The series is very complex with lots of characters and details and reading the next book as soon as it comes every 2 years is a waste of your time.After reading Path of Daggers and realizing I had forgotten a lot of the details of the previous books brought me to this realization. I like the series and want to read it, but I refuse to subject myself to agonizing game of creeping along a little bit every couple years.

Too many unknown boring characters"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I found this final installment to be like that of a rollercoaster. While some parts where comparatively flat, other parts kept me awake late at night reading. The detail of the characters were captured beautifully and i am more than likely not alone when i say that im greatfull to have been able to read it."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"It seems obvious to me what Robert Jordan and Tor are doing. They are, of course, trying to milk as much money as possible from this series. Think about it for a second. I, for one, really liked the end of Winter's Heart. It was fast paced and interesting; it reminded me a lot of the excitement I had while reading The Eye of The World. After finishing Winter's Heart, I thought to myself that Jordan's finally back on track.Well, guess what? He isn't. The ending in Winter's Heart was just a ploy to get us to buy the next novel. Which, since we were going to buy it anyway, didn't really need to have anything interesting in it at all.So then guess what happens, the next book will be dull, but it will have an exciting 100 pages at the end. Then we'll do the same thing as before: say \\"Great! He fixed himself!\\" But then Jordan will write another Crossroads of Twilight.This must stop! In the name of all that is good and holy it must stop! Take the initiative! Write to Tor and Robert Jordan! Tell them what you think! I know I am!"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"You know that part of a television show before the first commercial that sets up the plot of the rest of the episode? (or tells you what happened last episode?) Well... Imagine tuning into your favorite TV show only to find out that whole show is like that. That is the way this book feels.There is no real story in this book. The first half merely rehashes the old plot without adding much of anything we really need to know. (something a prologue would have done just as well) and only catches to book 9 chronologically (cleansing of Saidin) after page 400.It doesn't get much better in the second half. Maybe five events of any importance occur in the entire book (most of which are listed on the publisher's weekly review above), and none (and I mean NONE) of them are resolved before the end of the book. The two biggest occur in the last two pages of the book, teasers for a book that already had enough of them.In several places, just when events suggest something important is about to happen, the chapters close, picking up later in the book after the events have transpired - if at all.Would it have really given so much away if we knew the contents of that letter? Would it be so hard to stay with Perrin for a few hours to see how the Asha'men really reacted when Rand cleansed saidin? On that same topic, the &quot;good guys&quot; have still not learned the value of communication. One of the greatest events in the history of Randland has just occured, and nobody has made any effort to share the news with other interested parties - I find that entirely impossible to believe.All that being said, I do still have hopes for the future. Even at the pace the story is flowing,, there are important things in the making that can't be kept out of the next book. If Jordan adjusts his focus back to the important events, the next book could possibly make up for this one. Possibly."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"i've had this book for almost two months and haven't quite made it through yet. it's basically a lot of filler. if you like the characters (all 2 billion of them) and the general storyline you'll like this one. especially mat and egwene fans. my big problem with this book is that it never, ever goes anywhere. mat and tuon spend almost half the book flirting, but there relationship never really advances. the same with perrin's search. every single story line goes no where!!but, on the plus side, its still interesting. like all rj books its intense on detail (a lot of people say too much detail, and they're probably right - only about half the detail is in any way important). but if you don't mind the &quot;and then he put his pyjamas on, walked to the bathroom, opened the door, walked to the sink, turned on the faucet and got out his toothbrush&quot; kind of novel its fairly ok. i'm still kind of hoping that all the filler will be somehow relevant later.and to be fair, i can seriously spare the 8 bucks needed for the next book. or, rather, the trip to the library to read it for free!"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Do yourself a favor and do not read this book until installment 11 comes out. As far as I'm concerned, there is only half a story here--I should say half of 5 stories. Nothing momentous happens in this book, and every thread ends in some sort of cliff-hanger. As another reviewer stated, this book felt more like Path of Daggers than any other in the series, only I think it was even more anticlimactic and less satisfying.Part of the problem is that Jordan is still trying to fully develop 5 completely separate plot threads. In earlier stories, it was quite acceptable to have many main characters, since the reader was generally just learning about one or two plot lines from several different perspectives. Now, though, Mat, Perrin, Egwene, Elayne and Rand are all pursuing seperate adventures in their own corner of the world, and each one is given nearly equal importance. In fact, Rand's story is severely neglected in this book, because literally the entire first half is devoted to getting you caught up on what happened to each of the other characters while Rand was doing his thing in Winter's Heart. Given Jordan's verbose writing style, not very much ground is covered with each character's meager share of a 600 page book.The best thing I can say about Crossroads of Twilight is that the seeds have been planted for some exciting storytelling to come. I can only hope that in book 11 those seeds bear fruit. It would help if Jordan could manage to tie together at least some of the plot threads."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This series started out great with the first few books, but at around six or seven it started to go nowhere. The only reason I read Crossroads of Twilight was because the series started out so well and I kept hoping it would get back on track. I am sorry I wasted my time. All it seems to be about now is gossip between the rival female characters."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Soon, night must fall. Hopefully, very soon!This book was so boring, it took me 7 months to read and even when I picked it up, I could only skim it just to get the basic idea and see if anything happens. Unfortunately, nothing happened in this book. It was 672 pages of utter boredom. What a waste of money.Mr. Jordan, finish this series already! By the way, I will never buy one of your books new again. you are no longer worth the money."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Nothing happens in this book. It may be true that Jordan is just setting us up for the next book, but that's what I've thought after the previous 3 books as well, and nothing much has happened. In any case, this book could have been condensed down to two chapters at most."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"What really bothers me about this book is not it's horribly slow pace, nor is it the lack of a plot(even though what little there is doesn't pertain in any way to the overall storyline of the series). My main problem with CRoT is it's late release. Jordan actually stated in an interview that he had the release date pushed back so he could, 'make the book a enjoyable as possible.' Fans of the series waited an extra three to four months for a book that has so little to do with the actual overall theme of the series that it might as well belong to another. Beware potential buyers, much pain lies therein."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"The whole book was a lot of talk about nothing. I thought the last book did nothing, but I was not prepared for how slow this one moved along. I know that the series has been a money maker for Mr. Jordan and his publisher, but the series has to come to an end at some point. Even if there are four more books, the readers are going to be so bored that no one will be buying them. I thought something really great would happen in this book, but in truth it was just a lot of talk and intrigues. If you read the last book, then you don't really need to read this one to know what is happening in the story line. I really hope the next book is much better, like the early ones were."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"To be honest, I have little to say that some of the other reviews I read haven't already said, but because I feel completely bamboozled out of my hard-earned dollars, I wish to vent. This book is such a complete and total waste of time that I can only feel sorry for those of us who have stuck with this increasingly moribund series. How foolish to think that things were going to be different just because something finally happened at the end of the last one. This is by far the worse of the series, and if for any reason some innocent soul is thinking about starting to read this series, for God's sake save that person hours of unnecessary torment. The worse is I'm committed to reading the rest of this having invested this much time, but like others I vow to give no more money to Jordan, and I shall continue to think to myself, &quot;Ah, this is how NOT to move a plot along.&quot; If you want intricate fanstasy plots that move quickly, I suggest everyone read Guy Gavriel Kay immediately."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I have always been a fan of Jordan, but this book is just a let down.

Good thing this book was given to me as a gift."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This book is a waste of time! Nothing happens!!! I wish I could return it! Fantasy Adventure? It's more like an episode of \\"Days of our lives.\\" Robert Jordan's work has taken a downturn for the worst. His last few books in this series have definitely been sub par. This book lacked any type of battle, action, or a plot. It has no start and no end. With over 600 pages of text you would think Jordan could move the plot along, but he didn't. I think he is adding extra books to milk every last dollar out of this series. He has lost me as a fan!"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Unlike the first several books of this series, the last two Robert Jordan Wheel of Time books have provided little or no plot progress,character development, entertainment, or any other redeeming value. I have been reading this series of books for about a decade, and have waited impatiently for each new book to be published. As always, we are stuck in the middle of the story, but now I feel that I will get old and die before the characters finish up the current year in fantasy world.In the beginning, an amazing amount of action, character movement, history, and foreshadowing happened in each fat book. Now, we get to see several groups of characters misperceive an action from a past book and ruminate about what it possibly could mean.... Shakespeare definitely uses the lack of communication more effectively and far, far more efficiently.I'll probably check the next book out of the library, if I remember at that advanced age..... In the mean time - try Terry Goodkind (all the drama, way more action)."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Jordan should not punish longtime readers anymore. How many times does he have to use thesame adjectives to describe the same events? After reading 10 books of WOT i am aware thatAes Sedai have ageless faces and are notoriously sneaky. Do i really need to be remindedagain? Is there that many people who pick up the 10th book in a series and need to have thingsexplained to them? How many times do we have to hear about men and women do notunderstand each other?

All of the bad reviews weren't enough to stop me from buying CoT in hardcover, but it's good to know that I'm not the only one feels cheated by where this series has taken us, or better yet, not taken us.I still remember finishing PoD (back in 1998) with such a sense of outrage at how nothing of any substance happened in 580+ pages, how I then compared the fonts and margins of PoD to previous WoT novels, and even started to build a WoT timeline to chart how many significant events happened in previous books to support my point. Thankfully, I then read some of the other customer reviews and quickly realized that most other readers shared my opinion on Jordan's latest work, and that it wasn't just me. The whole experience was very therapeutic!As far as CoT goes, it is unfortunately more and more of the same. Nothing much of substance happens, although I did enjoy the initial Mat thread. At least he finally got out of Ebou Dar which is an enormous accomplishment based upon Jordan's recent standards! That being said, there is still just way too much annoyingly detailed descriptions of things we already know about, or worse yet, don't even care about. And for those who defend the glacial plot advances, CoT actually manages to go back in time with some storylines, so maybe we should be happy with whatever crumbs of plot advances Jordan throws our way.I hate to say this, since the early WoT books still remain some of my all-time favorites, but a previous review got it right when it said that the only good thing about the recent Jordan novels is reading all of the terrible reader reviews they are generating. For those looking for a good fantasy series, I would suggest Robin Hobb, Steven Brust, Tad Williams or George R.R. Martin."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"In one word, DISAPPOINTING. RJ has stretched the plot so thin, eight (!) different sub-plots going on in parallel, that after you've gone through the 680 pages you realize nothing much has happened! There was more action packed into one chapter in the first few books than the whole of this one. I can't help suspecting that RJ is stretching (milking?)

First though, I shall pause for applause for powering through this, the steepest part yet of a downward slope that Robert Jordan is sending himself down. And don't forget to give a hand for all the others who made it.The last thirds of The Crossroads of Twighlight had all the excitement of the first two, which, expressed in numerical terms, is precisely zero. Nothing happened. There were no events in this book. Take out the constant tedious descriptions of dresses and furnishing, which slow every all ready slow scene down and urge you to skim ahead in a fruitless search for relevance, and the book is reduce to a fifty page supplement to the story. The sea of description never grated before when, to stretch the oceanic analogy, some sort of event would float by.This book lacked any sort of major decision, any building tension (for itself or the continuing story) and it lacked The Dragon Reborn. Except for a small few bits near the end, Rand was never in it, and was only mentioned in a few fleeting thoughts by other characters. This appears to be the growing trend in the books.Chris Neuhahn..."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This book is terrible. Out of 700 some odd pages, maybe 100 were readable. The number of characters has so weighted this series down, I don't know if it can be concluded with 50 books. I have no idea how this series will end up in two books, if that still holds true, other than a nuclear weapon killing everyone.Maybe Jordan should read Goodkind in order to learn how to focus on key, important characters and leave the rest on the editorial scrapheap.The publisher should be ashamed for letting this book out."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"With each new title in this seris i just get more disapointed. i have been waiting eagerly for this book but imagine how suprised i was when upon reading from cover to cover there was almost nothing about Rand, who, the immpression i developed anyway, i had thought was one of the main pivotable charecters. Maybe its because he's one of my favourites that i felt a couple of pages towards tha end of the book really didnt give me my fix/. but i should really have been forewarned as despite the excellent quality of the first books in the wheel of time seris i have noticed, as i have been reading religiously each one as it comes out, that the time between installments is getting longer and the end product much less worth waiting for. I may still read the next book, if it appears this decade, but i don't think i'll be rushing out to pre-order the hardback this time. Instead i think it best to wait til i can get a copy from the library as there are many other titles out there that are more worthwhile to spend my hard earned wages on."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This is just another great installment in the eye of the world series.

Now, after over 20 years, the final book will soon be released which has motivated me to reread the entire thing. Robert Jordan's Crossroads of Twilight (book 10) is consistent with the rest of his epic fantasy world. The plot thickens, the characters have been developed to the point that the reader believes we've actually met them. I would not exactly call this book fast paced, nor any in this series. However, the world Jordan writes about is so full and realistic that I don't want to race to the end, I want to enjoy every last weave and immerse myself in every turning of wheel. There are some developments that are very important to the rest of the series so this one is not to be skipped."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"As a part of the series this is a fine book. Taken on its own, I would agree with many others, there is way too much description of what is going on. In one location it took almost 4 pages to describe a room and a cup.

Alright, alright, I'll give you the fact that not alot happens in this book on the monumental scale. I'll also give you that I was, also, irritated by only one chapter for Rand. That, though, is the extent of the bad.In my opinion, Robert Jordan is a genius. He has managed to create a world with hundreds of charecters, each with thier own ideas and opinions. Each land has customs, laws, and governments all their own. This series is an epic. To get to the events that are going to be in the 11th book smoothly this book had to be written. Otherwise the tenth book would have been 1400 pages long. I mean come on, you've read (probably) all ten books and when a series gets to that length, and is as in depth as this one, you need to understand that, to hit upon all of the charecters, you might have to have a filler book, one to hit all of the charecters before they reunite or something big happens to all of them"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"The first four books of the series were some of the best I have ever read. Books 5-10, however, demonstrate that Jordan has no idea how to advance the plot. It is so complex even he is lost and there is no end in site. The latest book, Crossroads of Twighlight, is simply one of the slowest, most boring reads I have ever endured. What he descibes in 5 pages takes most good writers a paragraph. Some people may label this as &quot;vivid&quot; or building a &quot;rich world&quot; but to me, Jordan is giving us page-filler with no true, significant substance. In all honesty, I wish I could stop reading the series but, like an addict, I can't quit. I have invested more time to this series than I ever did to my studies in school. However, if I have to endure too may more chapters filled with descriptions of the &quot;stout Two Rivers Wool&quot; Nynaeve wears in Telarhanriod, I may just throw in the towell. There is one chapter in the book, approxiumately 20 pages in length, that describes Matt's decision to move Luca's circus away from Illian. That was it, nothing else of importance - 20 pages. Unbelieveable! If Jordan is as good as everyone says he is then he will finish this series in 2 books. My recomendation: Dont read this book until he finishes the series."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Robert Jordan is a great fantasy writer no doubt about it. There were pages in this book that made me feel like I was reading the Dragon Reborn again. The chapters about Matt were at least as good as anything else in the series.

The plot has no progress, instead of action in every scene we get the color of the dress, the place in the room where they sit, the personal history of the cabinet maker who made the chair ... you know where i'm getting to.The name and personal history thoughts and philosophy of yet another character that does nothing to advance the plot is not what I payed for.So for a series with great promise, and strong and interesting main characters, I am a disappointed.In summary of the 800 pages, Rand only shows on page 600 and we get 200 pages of plot.

The worst in the series so far. It took so long to read it felt like the 'Age of Boredom'. No action, no balefire, no Forsaken dead, no weird creature with the thing around its neck.

Don't care about Egwene's wobbly chair, sick of Lelaine, Romanda and Aes Sedai politics, had enough of Luca's Travelling Show and wish Perrin would just get on with rescuing Faille. Rand you say? Who's he? Tarmon Gaidon, it sure felt like it.Will I read Book 11?

It seems that lately Jordan's two or three remaining fans (probably family) are trying to bump up his rating from a dismal 1.5 stars (with 1 being the minimum, this is like getting a .5) with lame reviews. This book was inexplicably lame, unfathomably pointless, and confoundingly pathetic. Is this actually a book, or just 600 pages of filler with about 3 sentences worth reading? Can the big bad Forsaken appear any sillier, weaker, or uninteresting? I doubt it. RJ has hit rock bottom with this latest &quot;offering.&quot; I recall being as disappointed with the last three &quot;novels&quot; and will no longer purchase anything with &quot;Robert Jordan&quot; on the novel. Attempting to foist this drivel on anyone over the age of 8 shows no respect for his (former) readers' intellect and is just plain insulting. RJ, please quit writing bogus 5-star reviews for your book and get back to writing school."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Unlike Jordan's latest literary offering, this review will be short and to the point.I actually avoided reading this series for years because the size of the books was daunting to me and what I picked up as the plot line from skimming through the first book was not something I could get interested in. Last month, I bought books 1 - 4 and devoured them. I was pleasantly surprised. They were really great. So I was lured by that to buy books 5 - 9. At the end, I was merely skimming through the chapters, completely skipping the parts on Egwene and Co., Mat, and even Perrin. I was desparate to read more about Rand. I continued with that feeling in book 10 and I feel completely cheated because there was really nothing in this book to satiate that feeling.Some of the other fans have said that they will continue reading as each book comes out. Me, I've decided to simply wait another seven years and then see if the series is finished. Then I'll pick up whatever books I don't have from a used book store where they won't be as expensive.What a waste of a potenially wonderful series. Mr. Jordan, get to the point already! And please clean up some of these extraneous plot lines."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I have been eagerly awaiting this book since I finished reading Winter's Heart. I was excited to see how cleansed Saidin would be handled. Sadly, the subject barely even came up. Most of the book seemed to be dedicated to describing what people were wearing and what a room looked like. The various plots were advanced only a few weeks in the time frame and even then it was hard to keep track.It appears as if Jordan is running out of inspiration and is just plodding along to meet deadlines. I know he can do better work than this. I hope that he will wait until he has a good product before publishing the next book. As it is, if another one comes out soon, I will probably not buy it and wait until it hits the librariers or used book stores."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Title should read &quot;Crossroads of Twilight: An Epic Waste of Time.&quot; If you just have to read it, pick it up at the Library - don't spend any money on it."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Blah blah blah, aesedi so and so, blah blah blah, asedi such and such blah blah blah.That is what I feel I just read.Robert Jordan has just insulted my intelligence for the last time.

Since then, however, the series has gotten progressively more boring. If Brian Jordans ambition was to see how long he could drag out a story he has succeeded. The earlier tension and plot have been lost and much like Terry Goodkinds' &quot;Wizards 1st Rule&quot;, the &quot;Wheel of Time&quot; seems to have lost its way. Every book, and this one is no exception, introduces a stream of new characters whose purpose in the tale seems ornamental at best.

It is not up to the standard of the first four"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This series hardly promises to be new or unique. Unlike others, I don't care that Jordan rips off Tolkien (trollocs, anyone?). Instead, I'm furious that he has stolen characters straight out of Eddings's Belgariad: the sturdy blacksmith with down-to-earth values, the haughty, blue-clad, imperious sorceress, the vagabond old man storyteller, and even a connection with wolves. The opening of the first book, where Rand suspects some shadowy figure following him is also straight out of Pawn of Prophecy. Why hasn't Eddings sued this poser? Also, the boys vs. girls theme that Eddings began to take a little too far by the 8th book (in the Mallorean) is already overdone obnoxiously by the end of book 1. Surely we can find better authors that don't steal their ideas straight from better sources. Read Eddings and compare for yourself. Jordan is a thief."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I was vacationing in Kenya when I finished \\"Eldest\\" and needed a new book desperately. The only book of interest I found a bookstore in Mombasa was Crossroads of Twilight. For some reason I do not remember, I read all previous 9 books in the Wheel of Time epic (and I use that in the negative sense). So I place the blame squarely on my shoulders for reading such an awful book.Jordan creates a fascinating world, but after Book III, he gets lost in his own story. Honestly, and without exaggeration, there is not ONE plot development in this book. Yes, that's correct: not one thing of importance happens in the 800+ pages. Unfortunately, that has become the norm for Robert Jordan. If you just have to finish this series (I am officially at the \\"I could care less\\" stage), do yourself a favor and skip this book and go on to Book XI."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Ok, sure, Jordan is a great writer blah blah blah...Now that that's out of the way, WHY!?!?!?!? I've been sucked into this series for 10 years. I loved the first 9 so much that I read most of them like 4 times. What do I get for my loyalty? A big steamy turd plopped in my lap. Here's a hint to the rest of you who are reading the series and have yet to get anything out of it: Read the last chapter. Everything you ever need to know for #11 to make sense you'll find there. The rest of it is crap...crap, crap, crap. AUUGGGGHHHHHHHHH!!!"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Book 10 of a series that was only supposed to go for 8 books. One has the feeling that the storyline is being stretched just to sell more books. The story continues to be good, but the author has added so many layers and different subplots that it is beginning to become difficult to keep track of them all (and I enjoy these kind of books). Once you've gotten this far you can't stop now, but with each new book telling less and less story it makes it harder and harder for me to recommend this series."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Never have characters done so little in 680 pages. Not that it matters, because if you are this far in, do you really have a choice but to read it? Still, I would wait until it is in the bargain bin."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Spoiler alert: I'm going to write about the book's plot. Mind you: the entire plot, so skip this if you don't like it be shown before reading.1) Rand is alive and is going insane.2) Mat is going to marry Tuon and is escaping with her after having kidnapped her.3) Faile is still captive under the Shaidos and Perrin is trying to rescue her.4) The whole tea available in Caemlyn has been drunk by Elayne (who is pregnant).5) The Black Ajah does exist.6) Egwene has been captured by someone (more about it in the next book I guess).We already knew about points 1,2,3, 4 and 5 from previous book(s). What a pity point 6 is adding something new to the plot.Sorry for wall of text. I will never be able to be as brief as Mr. Jordan in my descriptions."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"...but not much. I must confess that despite being a strong fan of the early books, I have found that it has gone very lukewarm. I do not believe its quite as bad as most reviewers suggest, but I certainly think it the worst in this series. I do NOT, however, concur with those who are willing to write off the series as a whole. Whilst I rather suspect Mr. Jordan to have been captured by his own talent for overdescription and a desire to show off as much of his creation as possible, I also firmly believe that what one has done once, one can do again.Winter's Heart, the previous installment suggested an increase of intensity - hence I think the prevailing disillusionment with THIS problem child.YES jordan deploys the same hackneyed textual strategies time and again, and seems to have reached some sort of limit (if not a word limit) as a writer - at least as regards the Wheel of Time, for the now. HOWEVER, this doesn't detract from the fact that what was enjoyable or at least tolerable in earlier volumes persists in this volume.I continue to hope for a satisfying resolution to this series, because I enjoyed the earlier instalments so very much.A little less self-indulgence - or a more assertive editor - could straighten this lumbering series pretty easily.Whatever you do, don't let reviewer contempt for the latter half of the Wheel of Time put you off volumes 1-6 (I feel the rot sets in about then). There is much to admire in the earlier works. If you don't want to pay for it, well, then, thats why we have libraries."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"One thing has become plainly evident over the last 2000 pages or so of Jordan's magnum opus: either he's lost his mind, or he's decided to write page after tedious page of filler simply to &quot;filler&quot; his wallter a bit more, or he actually died somewhere in the middle of writing book 7 and, like poor Schussmayr with Mozart 's &quot;Requiem,&quot; it has fallen to some sap on whom history will turn an unforgiving eye to take the strands of genius Jordan laid out and try to bring them to a meaningful conclusion.Given the pace with which this series has been written over the past three books (words like &quot;glacial&quot; and &quot;excruciating&quot; are entirely too forgiving), all three seem plausible.Jordan plainly has vision. Nobody could manage even the first 4000 (top quality) pages of this epic without it. And he has talent, or bored readers would have given up at &quot;Eye of the World&quot; and we wouldn't be here reviewing book 10. But the series has begun to lose all focus and cohesion. It is possible, even likely that Jordan...for all his talents...has simply bitten off more than he can chew (word to the wise: dragging the storylines out won't help, try cutting a few down to size and moving toward a conclusion instead). We are left with a Brobdingnagian tour-de-force that is less tour and almost toothlessly devoid of force.It will take at least two more novels, I think, to bring this to a conclusion, but the suspicious conspiracy theorist/numerologist in me smells a total of thirteen. Thirteen as a number is given repeated emphasis in Jordan's writing, and I have a suspicion that finally, hopefully, blissfully, the series is closer to the end than not."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I've been reading the Wheel of Time series for over a decade!! The author is doing no service to any of the loyal readers by dragging this story painfully ..on and on and on and on ...AND in the meantime writing other books AND a &quot;Prequel&quot; of all things!! I don't care if the good guys all get torturously killed at this point ...just bring it to a CONCLUSION and end my torture!!"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I've been a huge fan of this series and was eagerly anticipating the release of this book-I actually even went to a book signing for it. I'm very disappointed since nothing really happens to advance the story. It sort-of felt like homework to finish it because it's boring and slow paced. Many of the main characters appear only peripherally and I hated the way the book ended. I hope that the next book in this series is better. I won't lie and say that I'll never read another Wheel of Time book again, but it certainly won't be with the same enthusiasm as before."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"After reading approx. half the book so far, I'm asking myself if this series will ever find an ending. I've enjoyed Robert Jordan's writing for years(and still believe he is the best writer of Conan stories), but I also find myself skipping paragraphs of material that goes into overdetailed discriptions of what an Aes Sedai looks like, is wearing, or the millions of other little details he spends half a page each on in this book. It seems that at about book 8 or 9 the series started slowing down, dragging out the story and only giving the reader some excitement in the end. Is Mr. Jordan mad at his readers or just coin operated(hoping to continue selling books simply because the material of the story, if not the writing style, is fascinating). I'm still going to finish the book. But so far, after 300+ pages, I honestly believe I could have skipped those pages and still know whats going on with the story...I keep waiting for something to happen, but it doesn't.It's similar to the feeling you get from going to see one of the new Star Wars movies. You have great expectations, but after watching it, you want someone to take the rights to Star Wars away from George Lucas and give them to someone else that won't ruin what was basically a good story."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"As many others I was disappointed that RJ did not progress the storyline farther then he did in this book. Too many interesting details and conversations are begun and hinted at but not written for us to read, instead we are still reading about trees and the smoothing of clothing. I was pleased with the advancement of Mat and Perrin and would have liked to have read more on Rand since he has been virtually a small character in books 9 &amp; 10. Books 9 &amp; 10 remind me somewhat of The Two Towers in that they are connectors from the beginning of the series when everything is new and dramatic to the end with the final battle. They contain necessary information for those who like details but I would not choose to put other activities on hold to read this book."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I remember back in the day with Eye of the World. That book got me into Fantasy. Now years later, Crossroads of Twilight makes me want to stop reading fantasy. This is by far the most convoluted book I have ever read. The descriptions are long, dialogues between characters few, and action non-existent. I mean what happened to Mr. Jordan. He reminds of another Mr. Jordan who should have retired when he was ahead(Micheal Jordan for anyone who doesn't get he allusion. I won't spoil the book by going into details, but let's just say this might be a book worth renting from the library and skimming, but most definitely not worth buying and reading carefully.I think you time is better spent read George R.

It all goes downhill from there.Books seven-ten are all mediocre (for Jordan standards) and I give them all a 3. Jordan's series started out with fascinating characters and ideas and fairly fast paced plot-filled writing. The Latest books (including crossroads of twilight) are long, boring, and filled with so many characters I can barely keep track of them anymore. I won't buy any more WOT books. I'll wait for the free library version instead of wasting my money."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I have been following the series for several years and I'm beginning to get the feeling that either the author or his publishers are merely milking it for all of the money they can get out of it. It's a good book, but it's part of a series that seems to be neverending. I've even developed a fear that the author will die before he gets a chance to finish the series. I hope my fear is unfounded, as the author is still relatively young (I think--mid-50's). I feel as though, I should wait until he finishes the series and simply start from the beginning and read them again."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"In the 7th through 9th installment of this series, Robert Jordan's writing has been steadily loosing it's momentum, in each successive book less actually happens as the Jordan delves deep into the politics, the backstabbing and the intrigue. Unfortunately, this intrigue is nowhere near as exciting or fulfilling for the reader as it seems to be for Robert Jordan.The good news is that this, the 10th book in the series marks the beginning of the end of the endless intrigue. While the book starts slow, it seems clear that Mr. Jordan is cluing in to his readership's impatience for events to begin rolling again. In the end, the plot actually advances.If you're finding it a bit of slog, I'm writing this after having read Knife of Dreams and the momentum from the end of this novel carries over into the next making it a much better novel than this one.Overall the writing is still excellent if plodding at times, but in terms of the series, you really don't want to miss the second half of this novel."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I finally believe that Robert Jordan is lost to the commercial word and is selling his novels by the word. He needs to get back to the story that has intriged millions for the first 8 novels. His lack of focus and story line in this novel is boring. I could not finish the book. I am absolutely sick of the endless facial and positional posturing of every single encounter and conversation in the book. Four and a half pages to describe climbing a hill... and then did nothing once they got there!"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Before I get started on the meat of the review, I have a quick warning for anyone who might be thinking of starting the series here: don't. Go back and pick up &quot;Eye of the World&quot; and work your way forward. By Book 10, Robert Jordan expects his readers to be familiar with the story and spends minimal time catching people up - even those that may not have read &quot;Winter's Heart&quot; recently.The later books of the &quot;Wheel of Time&quot; series seem to be devolving into a sort of Xeno's Paradox - the closer the series gets to the final battle, the closer Tarmon Gai'don seems, but we never seem to close more than half the remaining distance in any one book. In fact, with this book, we seem to close very little distance at all. The name, &quot;Crossroads of Twilight&quot;, implies that major decisions are made in this book that will affect the course of the series. In fact, major decisions are made - by Mat, by Perrin, by Egwene, by Rand, by Elaida, by Tuon and a few others. Unfortunately, though, the book ends before we see much action that results from any of these decisions.Most of the main characters are present for this installment, breaking a pattern established in the last few books where one of the major characters is left out - or all but left out - of each book. Nynaeve may be the one exception here (she has a brief, nonspeaking scene), but Rand has minimal time in this book as well. He doesn't appear until page 540 (out of 680) and his arc is left to two chapters and the epilogue. In fact, the climactic events of &quot;Winter's Heart&quot; are pushed off to the side for pretty much the entire story. Instead, the focus is primarily on Perrin, Mat and Egwene. Each of them reaches one (or more) crucial decisions that seem to be on the cusp of being borne out at the beginning of the next novel.Then again, we thought that to be the case books ago.If you're a &quot;Wheel of Time&quot; junkie like me, I hardly need to encourage you to get this installment - just be warned that it seems almost a prologue in-and-of itself for the remainder of the series. Also, be warned that you might want to read over &quot;Winter's Heart&quot; again to refamiliarize yourselves with many of the minor characters - especially the Aes Sedai. More are introduced with each book and I, for one, am starting to find it very hard to keep more than eight or ten of them straight. A quick rundown on each in the glossary really wouldn't be such a bad idea. Nonetheless, this book is solid Robert Jordan and in spite of the lack of movement, I was still happy to get my (now every three-year) &quot;Wheel of Time&quot; fix. If you're as big a fan as I am, go pick it up. If you're a little less so, you may want to wait until the paperback comes out. It'll help minimize the time (and possibly disappointment) until Book 11 comes out."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This book was utter crap. Nothing happens in the entire book.

How long before the Wheel of Time finally runs out of Saldyllic varnish and its spokes start to rot with the Cursed Diseases of the Whitecloak? How long before Rand al-Thor and the rest of his wretched, two-dimension ilk burn in the eternal flames as the Wheel of Time crashes into their forlorn planet and explodes in a fiery ball of...um...fire? How long until this extremely tedious and repetitive series comes to close!?Nothing much happens in this book. Some people mumble, some people walk around, and the plot slows to a snail's crawl.

Fanatics will say that it doesn't matter when you look at the big picture of the series. It only takes one mistake to screw up a good thing, and Jordan did a fantastic job ruining his books and has become an embarassment of the genre. This book is the worst of the series only moving the plot on the very last page of the book. I feel sorry for those I recommended this series to before i read the later books.

I don't care about Perrin's shrew of a wife...I want to hear about Rand!!! When is he going to start hanging out with his other \\"girlfriends\\"? When is he going to take control of the Black Tower?

Tolkien's work was long and detailed (loved by some, not by others). Jordans, on the other hand is a tedious waste of paper. Had he disciplined himself to a trilogy, his work might have been tolerable. Unfortunately, he didn't know when to stop. One might have thought that an ex-military man would have had more discipline and foresight.The problem with this series is not that it's long, but that it becomes unoriginal and drawn out. This book stinks of a marketing ploy. The same characters are rehashed in a seemingly never-ending tale.Even half-way in (at which point I must admit I just gave up - only the second time in my life), Jordan had still not moved the plot along. He juggles so many characters and situations, that it takes him about 100 pages to catch up with each &quot;group&quot; of characters, doing exactly ... nothing.It's not really necessary to have so many characters in what ought to be a simple fantasy series. I wonder if Jordan himself is able to keep up with them all. I would not be surprised if he hasn't, as it would explain a lot about the length of this book, and the entire series.It seems to me that Jordan himself knows no end to the story. If he's bored his readers then surely he's bored himself nearly to death.Don't waste your time.."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This book does nothing to advance the wheel of time story whatsoever. But don't take my word for it... read it yourself, go to the library and check it out, read it and then take it back.

You get to read them, and they don't get a penny."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I've had it with this guy. The first 2/3 of this book was nothing but Jordan continuing to expand on irrelevant events and develop on even less relevant characters. About 2/3 of the way through it *finally* looked like it was going to pick up when it started talking about familiar characters and events. I was shocked when I got to the end and nothing of significance had happened! There was absolutely no climax to this thing! It's just one long, boring, shameless attempt by Jordan to turn a story into an ongoing income source.&gt;&gt;&gt; THIS BOOK IS POINTLESS TRASH, IMHO ......perhaps 'well-written' trash, but pure trash nonetheless.Jordan needs to go back and reread his first book if he wants to rediscover how to write. The problem with this plan is that I doubt he has the confidence that he could ever come up with another 'good' series (or at least one that begins well). His cowardice is the clear reason he refuses to move this storyline to a close.I had been purchasing this series brand-new, in hardcover, since the very beginning.

STOP THE MADNESS!"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Well, this has to be the worst book ever passed off as a &quot;novel&quot; in the history of the written language. I find myself not caring about the fate of the main characters. I wonder why Lan would ever love Nynaeve? Does she HAVE redeeming qualities? If she weren't so strong in the power, she'd just be a bxtch. Ditto for pretty much all of the Aes Sedai. And Cadsuane? Her idea of helping the Dragon Reborn is to slap him around, insult him at every turn, and then say she's going to be there to help him learn to laugh again? How? With her sweet demeanor? Her wit? By slapping him around again? The relationships the three main guys have with their women is so pathetic that I'm willing to bet RJ is still a virgin. Where does he get his ideas for how loving couples act? A bad romance novel? The Forsaken? About as scary as a rubber monster in a Japanese film. The women are incredibly similar. Ditto for the men. The only possible exceptions are Moridin and Lanfear, and we don't get much of them. Perhaps even lamer than the fiction are the die-hard fans who think that anyone who disparages their hero (why would you idolize RJ????) must be brain-damaged. These are of the same ilk who believe that his slow, pointless descriptions are actually &quot;building&quot; the story or adding &quot;rich detail.&quot; Um, no. Plot is actually important, folks, and this book in particular lacks that. So in short, completely unbelievable, unsympathetic characters, poorly developed story lines, and a really clunky writing story make this a stinker. I'm sure this would get an even lower rating if I could give it ZERO stars, but the rating continues to be artificially propped up by all the bogus 5-star ratings that RJ must be writing under different aliases when no one is watching.Ugh. Disgusting."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"now the story is bland boring and SLOOOWWWW. all the characters do is sit on thier duffs and chat for chapters on end. absolutely NOTHING is accomplished in this book, nothing. there is no action to speak of. im beginnig to hate how jordan hands us something exciting right at the END of a book, then makes us wait a year for the NEXT book and then wildly disapoints us by making this new \\"plot twist\\" drag on for the entire book with no conclusion in sight. im tired of hearing about the \\"icy stares of aes sedai\\" and the \\"bloody dice\\" and \\"my name is perrin and i can smell this and that.\\" so boring and overdone it makes me want to CRY"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I have gone beyond disappointment and into the realm of being irked. Like others I waited a long time for this latest installment to come out and like the others I was totally disappointed. I concur with the previous writer who said this series started going down hill around book 6.The plot goes nowhere. I'm at a loss to determine if it's Mr Jordan, or his editor that deserve the blame for this. The second time I read the book, I read thru it to determine why I didn't like it and I've figured out why. It appears that Mr Jordan has decided to put 3 to 5 paragraphs of descriptive scenary for every line of dialogue. Don't get me wrong, the vibrant descriptions of the WOT are a key element, but in this case it's over the edge.Maybe he's getting paid by the word. You could have put the entire story down in 1/3 of the space. I'm not buying another one of his works in hardcover, I'll wait until they come out in paperback from here on out."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"To the list of life's mysteries we must add two more: First, what in the WORLD were Jordan and his editors THINKING when they published this book? Sure, the book will make lots of money for them, but at the certain expense of Jordan's legacy and their ultimate profits (a lot of readers, myself included, will never again purchase another Jordan hardback book as long as we live).Secondly, what are the (thankfully few) five star ratings of this book based on? How can a book that simply rehashes numerous Jordan cliches, stereotypes and descriptions be considered worthy of five stars? How can a book that spends pages and pages on the inane thoughts of minor players yet ignores the motivations and thoughts of key characters be considered great?Granted, a writer can do whatever he or she wants to do. No one is forcing us to purchase the books we buy. But when an author begins a series, I think common decency requires an effort on the writer's part to move the story (however slowly) toward a conclusion, because it is only natural for readers to want to know (once they've begun the series) how it will end.In sum, reading this tenth book in the series was like going to a theatre to see the third part of Lord of the Rings, only to find out that the movie was sold out and you had to see another movie instead (and not a particularly good one at that). Naturally you're going to be disappointed. Well, the last four times I've gone to that theatre, I've been shoved into another movie, and I'm beginning to wonder if they will ever let me see that last part."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I do not see why this book was released. The plot is not significantly advanced. The comedy of errors in the 'plot' is grotesque. In volume 9 the male half of the source is cleansed, yet NEVER do any of the Aes Sedai involved notify any others, Nynaeve never notifies her close friends, leaving everyone else in the dark? HUH?!?!Charcters are growing 1 dimensional. Matt has dice rolling in his head. Perrin has Golden eyes. Nynaeve tugs her braid. All the women deny ever being wrong about anything. It is all the men's fault.OK you now have the next 4-5 books save your time waiting and save your money. The series started out great, then pulled defeat from the very jaws of victory."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Almost nothing happens. Large amounts of time are spent rehashing stale character tics, two-dimensional characterizations, absurd gender relations, and the minutiae of everyone's clothing. More and more side characters are brought on stage, the few main characters with any \\"screen\\" time spin their wheels, and the few important things are practically ignored or given a paragraph. We spend pages on Egwene wandering through thecamp, but have throwaway lines about the Windfinders breaking out of Ebou Dar. We spend chapters with Elayne glacially moving towards the throne and Perrin glaciually moving towards Faile, but the cleansing of the Taint gets hardly a mention.Extremely disappointing."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"That's the only explanation that I can find for why I (and assume many others) continue to read this series long after it has crashed and burned. I used to rave about this series and now I feel guilty about having recommended it to my friends. I've put them on a 7000 page death sentence of boredom. And yet, I continue to read the book in a less than 2 weeks. I think it's due to the fact that I wanted to read until something important happened and yet nothing ever did. *Spoilers* Not that there really is anything to spoil. Nothing happens. Egwene still sits outside the White Tower (as she has since book 8 back since we were still worrying about that Y2K thing), Perrin's wife is still held by the Shaido, Mat is still in Seanchen held lands, Rand makes a guest appearence where he does very little, Elayne continues to play politics and is no closer to having the thrown and 1 Forsaken guest appearence thrown in. That's it. The rest of the book is: Wow, that's a major beacon in the West, what could be going on with that beacon, how can it be, everyone is looking to the west at the beacon, we're all worried about the beacon, the beacon stopped what does it mean, the beacon is done and nothing changed, etc. Or a page and a half about how difficult it is to wash and dry silk for the Shaido. Who cares? We all understand that the Aiel make their gai'shain work, do we need to know the exact method they use for cleaning Sevanna's silks? Can you please get on with the book? I think it didn't help that I was re-reading Martin's Game of Thrones in preparation for his April release of Feast for Crows. Now there's a series where nobody can complain about a lack of plot advancement. Although he's only on book 3 and back around book 3 of Jordan's series (I think George Bush Sr. was in office and we were fighting Desert Storm), Jordan's series was still king."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"What a waste of time and money.

This book goes absolutely no where. If you cut out the fluff there would only be about 200 pages in this book. You could then trim that 200 down to about 75 if you left the stuff that was crucial to the ongoing story line in and threw out the rest of the irrelevant plot tweakers. That would have made an excellent prologe to what should have been a brilliantly recieved tenth book.I am honestly begining to wonder if he is just milking all of this for the money. I mean come on 3 years between books, that would be forgiveable if this was a quality book that he took all that time writing but come on!"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Once again Robert Jordan managed to write a book where almost nothing happened. Most writers would have covered book 10 in one, maybe two chapters. I can't help but wonder if he's just trying to drag the series out. I read book one when it first came out and it used to drive me crazy waiting for the next one. The last couple haven't been worth the wait. If this is the way his books are going to be from now on, maybe its time to end the series. If you've been following the series from the begining and have to read the book, check it out from the library. Don't bother buying it."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This is absolutely, beyond a shadow of a doubt, the worst book in the series. Nothing happens to propel the story forward or keep our interest. Nothing. It's the same old garbage. Endless discussions. Endlessly boring. One would have to suspect that Jordan is taking us all for a ride. Stringing us along to make money off of his loyal fans.It's pathetic. Truly pathetic. This is the last time I buy one of his books. I'm done with this series."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Unfortunately, this book did almost nothing to move any of the stories along. The majority of the book revolved around Matt and Perrin, but neither story arc moved much. Perrin is still chasing the Shaido to rescue Faile, and Matt is still travelling with the circus with the Daughter of the Nine Moons. Rand makes a brief appearance after page 500. The one redeeming quality of this book is that he did not start a new story arc.If the story continues at this rate, it will take another 100 books to complete the story. Jordan should actually be ashamed to have published this book. I have given him chance after chance, but I will not buy another of his books until the series is complete."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Having been frustrated with Robert Jordan's previous books in this series that are ploddingly paced, I find reading Crossroads of Twilight like reviewing hundreds of articles on local fashion shows. Jordan seems to think that characters are made vivid by telling us exactly what they are wearing. After 200+ pages of watching character after character parade across Jordan's stage with him announcing in the same monotone what they're wearing, I give up. He has apparently decided that it is better to milk his audience for every penny he can than to produce a great, enduring fantasy classic (which he was well on the way to with the first 3 books).This book finally quenches my thirst for the Wheel of Time, not with satisfaction, but with disillusionment. So long, Robert."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I have just finished the highly anticipated Crossroads of Twilight and I'm still wondering when my anticipation will be met. This book is repetitive, ill-defined, and ultimately boring. Chapters are filled with inane detail and mindless thoughts and dialogue with very little true plot resolution whatsoever. If the entire series was finished this book might be forgiven in light of the overall series, but to wait for years only to read this tripe really ticks me off. The author's lack of creativity and focus in combination with publisher's inept editing and dollar-driven marketing strategy are alienating fans and are killing what used to be the best fantasy series in decades. In truth, if Crossroads of Twilight had been the first book in the Wheel of Time series there never would have been enough of an audience to warrant a second book."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Like a broken record, repeating it over and over again. How many times does a reader need to be reminded that Aes Sedai pierce you with a stare and the world is so complex and so much is happening (Oedipus complex maybe). Oops, I lost the plot somewhere. This story &quot;Crossroads of Winters Heart in Twilight&quot; is the culmination of 3 very bad books. I fear there is no end in sight. Jordan has become entangled in his own web of mistrust, deceit, and perhaps is himself tainted by the source (whiskey that is). I enjoyed this series, for years, eagerly awaiting the next installment. I have lost my interest and am contemplating putting this series to rest, COT has done nothing to change my mind. What started so well, has spun out of control. Maybe next time."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"We are now ten books into this series and everyone is ready for something to happen that will answer some of the questions that Jordan has used to leave us all hanging. Yet, to my utter amazement Jordan chooses to go back in time rather than take the series forward. He goes through the painstaking process of telling us where every character was at the exact moment that Rand cleansed the Source in book 9. There is no development whatsoever in the plot. All of the major characters are doing exactly what they were doing back in book 9. What's Elayne up to these days? Still trying to secure the Lion Throne. How about good old Perrin? Sorry to disappoint you, but he's still chasing Faile and the Shaido. Surely, Egwene unites the Tower? Nope, she's still sitting outside of the Tower where Robert Jordan left her two years ago.

Pages of minor, inconsequential characters' thoughts, descriptions of their clothing, meaningless conversations and other related trivia do not make an engrossing read. Let's face it, fantasy literature requires action, this book lacks it, and was boring. This series desperately needs things to happen. Next one that comes out, I'm going to wait for one of my friends to read it first, and if they tell me nothing happens in it either, I'll skip it even though I've invested alot of time reading 10 prior, long volumes. That's how dull this series is getting."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This book could not have been written by Robert Jordan.

Thats how boring it was."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This book is an exception to the great stories that have appeared in previous WOT books. It's all politics, walking, talking, running, and everybody is pretty much in the same condition as at the end of book 9. The &quot;climax&quot; isn't a climax at all, we are left hanging! After so many books with significant endings, this one is leaves you thinking, &quot;Where's the next chapter, or two?&quot;If you love the WOT series you will not enjoy this book very much. At this point it seems RJ is dragging this thing out for all it's worth instead of giving us any substance. In tempo, it's similar to book 9, without the last two chapters.Wait two years and see if the series is worth keeping up with is my opinion."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I first began reading The Wheel of Time books in eigth grade, and they swept me away like no other author save Tolkein. Jordan's world was developed, practical, realistic, incredibly full in detail, and strangely compelling. I am now a graduate student, and the series is not yet ended. Jordan has produced 10 books, and is seemingly nowhere close to the end of the series. Not only that, each of the last five books seems to be worse than the one before.Now, don't get me wrong--I am aware of the complexities of modern publishing, and I am aware that my tastes as a reader have changed considerably since I first began the series. However, after a reasonable degree of consideration, I cannot escape the conclusion that Jordan is either/or: (1) artificially prolonging the series in the name of profit, or (2) floundering because he truly doesn't know how to get the characters from where they are now to where his vision of the last book says they should be.The evidence in favor of these conclusions is overwhelming. In the last five books, the action has increasingly stalled, the dialogue has become trite and repetitive, and the characters have ceased to develop in any meaningful way. Rand may or may not be crazy, Perrin is confirmed as being OCD when it comes to Faile, and Mat is still getting by on luck. The women are all the same, the Aiel and other 'helper' characters are interchangeable, and the cultural sidenotes that once fleshed out the driving stories have become rote recitations for no other purpose than to fill up space.This is the way things stand in book ten, and it is the way they have stood since book five.However, I do think that Crossroad of Twilight represents the worst of this trend, particularly in light of the fact that the previous book, Winter's Heart, actually firmed up and tried to make some serious plot advancements. Leaving off with saidin cleansed, Rand unconscious, and Mat finally having met his future wife, I felt sure that this book would finally begin to pick up the pace a bit. Instead, Jordan provides a serious disappointment. Although certain plot advancements (Mat and Tuon and the bit with the ghosts) are of interest, for the most part the book reads very slowly. I found myself frequently skipping ahead over large chunks of the book, and only going back later so that I wouldn't feel I had wasted my money.The book not only reads badly, it is also written badly. The dialogue is sloppy. The attention to minute detail (such as the clothes a character is wearing) over personal development is frustrating. Both Jordan and his editor seem to have forgotten how to recognize the beginner's mistakes of overwriting, diffusion of ideas, and lack of characterization. I love the characters not for who they are in the most recent books, but for the promise they provided in the early works. Whereas once I waited eagerly for the next installment in the series, I now find myself simply keeping up out of a morbid curiousity to see when the whole shambling wreck that has become The Wheel of Time will finally shudder to a halt.This book is not quite terrible (sorry, but I have to reserve that for Terry Goodkind's latest stuff), but it is far less than Jordan is capable of producing, and he should be ashamed to have something this slapdash published with his name on the cover. If you're a Wheel of Time junkie, then no doubt you will ignore anything I or anyone else has to say, and you will find a reason to buy and love the book anyway. If you're just mildly curious, send Tor an economic hint that this book fails to live up to even a reasonable degree of expectations:..."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Anyone want to buy my copy of this book? Seriously. The book is like 650 pages long and I don't really know that anything at all happens. The first 300 pages just update you on what everyone else was doing while Rand was cleansing Saidan in Winter's Heart. Hey great, I was wondering what Mat was thinking as that was happening. . Nothing at all is resolved in this book. Maybe nothing will ever be resolved.Essentially the series is now taking place in real time like an episode of 24. The early books covered several weeks or months. A character would leave say Camelyn on his/her way to Ebou Dar at the end of a chapter. At the beginning of the next chapter said character would arrive in Ebou Dar and the plot would take off again. Now the character departs Camelyn and we're treated to a minute by minute depiction of the journey. How the scenery looks, what sort of food is being eaten, is the food greasy, how's the weather? It's mind boggling.And what's up with the characters, especially the Aes Sedai? There have to be dozens of them by now. I have no idea who any of them are. Apparently we're supposed to remember that some were identified as being bad in previous books. Okay, let's think about this. This is book ten which means there are probably a minimum of 6,000 pages of text written in the series thus far. Some of these minor characters pop up for a chapter three books ago and then resurface now and we're supposed to remember them? As if. I even lose track of the Big Three sometimes, especially when they now seem to go whole books without appearing.And there's not an original thought. Perrin is only capable of thinking \`Faile Faile, without Faile I'm nothing.' Mat can't believe he's going to marry the Daughter of the Nine Moons and Rand, well wait Rand doesn't even really make an appearance. WHAT?Jordan is a genius however. He wrote 4 or 5 good books and hooked people in. Now we have to buy these damn things as soon as they come out just to see what's happening. I started reading years ago when I was in high school. I had to wait until I could check the book out from the library or the soft cover came out. Now I'm through grad school and gainfully employed and thus can afford to buy the hardcover the day it's released. More money for Mr. Jordan. Genius.I guess the real complaint is that I just need to get a life. This story is never going to end and I should stop worrying about it. Even the Neverending Story, (you know the movie) must have ended at some point because I'm pretty sure that had a sequel.Well enough of my rant. If you've read the other books you'll buy and read this one just because that's what you do. If you've never read one of these books wait another 15-20 years when we're up to book 17 (tentative title Tuesday, 8:00am - 9:00am) and some things might have been resolved. In the meantime I'll content myself with waiting for book 11 when important issues such as Mat choosing a cloak to wear when the carnival finally packs up and gets moving or Rand selects a new breakfast cereal are resolved.Sheesh."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I've read all of Jordan's Wheel of Time books more then twice. I would give all of them 4+ stars. Until now.R.J. seems to be devolving into one of those self-important people who love to hear themselves speak (or read what they write in this case). All of his last 2 or 3 books suffered from page bloat, in that 100 pages of useless dialogue (not moving the story), hackneyed phrases and yet another new character to take up space (when he can't seem to devote enough to developing some of the main ones). Crossroads does not suffer from bloat, it seems to revel in page bloat. This book could have been cut down to about 50-75 pages and still had it's usual dose of men complaining about women, women thinking men need to be controlled and people knuckling and sniffing.My advice for readers who haven't picked this up yet, but love the series....wait 6 months and get it out of the 5.99 bin.

The total dialogue in this story could have fit in a handful of pages. He seems to be more and more in love with filling the rest with information through self reflection that was given to us in a previous story. In most cases, in more then one at that.Every character in this story spent most of its time thinking about:*Events in previous books.*How Aiel are savage, Andoran/Cairhienin love the Game of Houses etc etc for the 129019th time.This series was charged up and wonderful from 1-6. If I was the cynical sort, I'd say the last four books have been more about lining the pocket then advancing the story. It works too. We were all hooked through those great stories. And we have continued to buy these books in a vain hope that the story will move on.Crossroads is an all time low in how little Mr. Jordan actually moves the story. In fact, 'move' is being generous.Mat's Storyline: Enviornment changes. Nothing new is learned.Perin's Storyline: Nothing new happens but we are thrown a bone near the end to help show us just how determined he is in rescuing his wife.Rand's Storyline: Doesn't even appear in the book until 2/3rds is done. Seeks an alliance. NOTHING is made of how he has removed the taint.It is similar to when Asmodean is killed. Rand doesn't even comment on it. Same here. Remove taint. No one comments on it. Life moves on.You can skip this book and read 11 when it comes out and not miss a single thing.Two stars because despite Mr. Jordan's capitalistic approach, I am still scrambling at his feet in search of any crumbs (story).

NOTHING!!! And that nothing only from the POVs of those WHO CHANNEL SAIDAR!!!!!(...)"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Wherever epic fantasy writers ply their trade, scribbling scenes of magical convergence or enormous battles between steel-clad knights, there are whispers of a dire warning: \\"Remember Crossroads of Twilight.\\" This is a book that has gained a certain infamy in fantasy circles, which even the most ardent Wheel of Time fans are hard-pressed to defend, and serves as an object lesson to every writer of a long, complex series of what can happen if the writing discipline slacks and they lose control of the narrative.Winter's Heart ended with a number of storylines in progress and Crossroads of Twilight picks up on them. Briefly, Mat Cauthon has escaped from Ebou Dar but has inadvertently wound up with Tuon, the Daughter of the Nine Moons, as his prisoner. Perrin's wife Faile is a prisoner of the Shaido Aiel and Perrin and a band of reluctant allies attempt to locate her. The renegade Aes Sedai have Travelled to Tar Valon and besieged the city, but Egwene's reluctance to unleash bloodshed results in a morale-sapping stalemate. Elayne's attempts to secure the Lion Throne continue. Rand al'Thor recovers from the exhaustion caused by the Cleansing of saidin. And that's about it. The only major new storyline is General Rodel Ituralde of Arad Doman organising an offensive against the Seanchan, which is intriguing and is naturally only featured for a few pages and then not mentioned again.Crossroads of Twilight's structure is not very well thought-out. Jordan's intent was to provide a catch-up following each band of characters from where we last saw them in Winter's Heart to the moment of the Cleansing, a major world-shifting event and arguably the biggest moment in the series to date. And if he had done this say in the first 100 pages, or in the prologue, this would have been a good idea as people's misunderstanding of what that event signifies goes on to play a major role in events in the series. The problem is that he takes far too long to pull this off. We only start moving on beyond the Cleansing in the last 50-100 pages or so of the book, and aside from a mildly startling cliffhanger ending to Egwene's storyline, there is no real climax to the book. It just judders to a rather unsatisfying halt. And the great irony is that the Cleansing itself is largely proven irrelevant: most people, when told what it was, flat-out refuse to believe it, making the whole book feel like an exercise in futility.So, we have a 700-page novel in which not much happens. Everyone's storyline crawls forward at an insanely slow pace, with entire chapters featuring little beyond descriptions of forests or characters discussing what has happened earlier in the plot for no discernible reason. There are good moments buried amidst the dross, such as Perrin realising the limits of his morality, the true nature of Shaidar Haran being revealed or Egwene's intelligent plan to resolve the siege of Tar Valon, but getting to them is like wading through treacle. There is no momentum to the story, especially as every couple of chapters we rewind to a point before the Cleansing, move a few days forward, and then rewind again with a different bunch of characters. The bulk of the book takes place only across a few days (whilst The Great Hunt, for example, covered about six months) and progress is torturous.Crossroads of Twilight (*) is by quite some margin the weakest book in the series and one of the most disappointing fantasy novels ever published, considering how good some of the earlier books were. The few decent moments are drowned amidst literally hundreds of pages of empty, pointless prose and padded minutiae. The book is published by Orbit in the UK and Tor in the USA."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I am so glad to those who took such pains to explain in detail why this is such a disappointment and waste of time.

The book was used but in almost perfect condition- I have bought new hardcovers from bookstores that were falling apart more than this one."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"BUT, if you read the whole series in sequence (giving yourself time and not rushing) you'll probably find that RJ, rather than introducing scores of new characters and making the story more complex, is actually TYING THINGS OFF, slowly but surely. Personally, I don't think he'll make it in 12 books, unless the Last Battle breaks out within 5 pages of the prologue of Book 11, and the LB will take at least a book and a half on its own. Anyway, I digress. The primary complaint people have about this book, is really that the series is just taking too long to wrap up. Okay, that's legit, but seriously, CoT was better than WH, and once the series is finished, you people are quickly going to shut up. On the other hand, RJ does need TO WRAP IT THE F#(K up! 13! That's it, that's as many books as I'll pay attention to, Rob! Wrap it up, make the books longer, but I swear by all that's holy I STOP at 13!"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"\\"I started to read this bloody series when I was a teenager. Now I am an old-age pensioner, and the series is going on. When is Jordan going to finish it?\\"\\"The first three books of the series were marvelous, but then the series started to go downhill, as there was less and less action in the succeeding books. Doesn't Jordan understand that in a really good book there MUST be plenty of action. He should read the real master of fantasy, George Martin, and learn from him how to write good books. If Jordan starts to rely on bloodshed, swear words, rape and incest he may still regain his position as top fantasy writer.\\"\\"For many years I did Jordan a great favour, spending 20 hard-earned dollars on his books. But at some moment he started to disappoint me and I thought that, probably, I shouldn't spend my hard-earned money on his books. And then came Crossroads of Wasting-my-Hard-Earned-Money, and now I declare to Jordan and to the whole world that I start to borrow his books from the library and won't spend my hard-earned money on his books. And let him weep because I won't spend my hard-earned money on his books any more.\\"\\"This book is about nothing. Have you read a book about nothing? It's this book, because it is about nothing. Nothing happens in this book, and nobody does anything in it, so it's about nothing. Nothing is the main topic of this book. It's really about nothing.\\"\\"When the series only started Jordan published a new book every year which already was too rare. And now it takes him two years to write a book. I can't understand how Jordan can be so lazy and disrespectful to his fans. Doesn't he understand that we need a new book every other month?\\"\\"He is simply milking that series. A competent writer could have put the events that happened in the last four books in one, and CoT would have been just one chapter in it.\\"\\"I stopped reading this damn series long ago, so I am clever, and you are fools because you are still reading it.\\"\\"Crossroads of Twilight was a piece of manure, and those who liked the book are idiots.\\"\\"Crossroads of Twilight is [censored]. The series is [censored]. Robert Jordan is [censored].\\"Reviews like those above still continue to appear at Amazon, making sure that the book will hardly ever get more than the miserable 1.5 stars it's got so far. Even after 2 years CoT-bashers continue to pour out their anger and frustration. The more stupid and offensive such a review is the more helpful votes it gets, while those few who try to defend the book get lots of unhelpful votes. Well, don't you think it's high time you realized a few simple things?The series is going on as RJ initially planned it many years ago, and it will end in two books with the last scene he had in his mind long before he wrote the first page of the series. He is not milking it, and if it didn't have even one tenth of its current popularity it would be the same. (Well, probably the books would take him longer to write, as the publisher wouldn't be pressing Jordan so hard and he could do more rewriting.)You say that you won't spend your money on his books anymore and will take them from the library or won't read them at all. Well, do you think Jordan should stand on his knees and ask you to give him the last chance? If you like someone's writing, you buy and read his/her books. If you stop liking it, you stop buying and reading them. If for some reason you can't or don't want to buy a book you take it from the library. That's the case with everyone, and a writer need not kiss your feet because you've spent a few dollars on his book. Believe me, if Jordan's next book becomes a #2 bestseller instead of #1 he won't commit suicide. If he wrote only for money, he would more likely still be writing Conan novels. Although I don't think that many of you will fulfill their threat.You say that the last 4 (5,6,7) books in the series were bad. What was wrong with them. Yes, there was less action in them, but after all it's not necessary that someone should be killed, raped or mutilated on every other page to make it a good book. Those of you who think otherwise can always find other authors. Why bother to read Jordan. I agree that sometimes RJ's lengthy descriptions may seem a little boring. But when they are up to the point there's nothing really to complain about, and when they are not- Well, then it's just a small drawback, almost nothing compared to the merits of the series.You say that it takes Jordan too long to write a book. Yes, everyone would like a new book from their favourite author to be released, say, every three months. But, please, understand, that a book takes as long as it takes. And two years is not that much, if we take into account the length and complexity of RJ's books.You complain that RJ decided to write a prequel when the series is not finished. Of course, every Jordan fan, including me, would rather like to see book11 released. But have you ever written one novel (and that's what WoT is) for 20 years. I haven't. As a matter of fact, I was 3 when RJ started to write WoT, so it seems a rather long time, and I'm not surprised that he just needed a break while remaining on the same ground.And finally. I don't want to insult all the people who didn't like CoT. After all, some people may dislike fantasy in general, some may like fantasy, but dislike some authors, for instance Jordan. Some people may like Jordan's writing, but dislike some of his books. It's no reason to make ANY conclusions about their personal qualities and intellectual development as long as they express their attitude reasonably and don't insult Jordan and people who disagree with them. But to those who still support Jordan-bashing hysteria in a way which would be appropriate only for a mentally challenged teenager I say:ENOUGH OF WHINING!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"It seems that a lot of people find the latest of these books quite dull. I believe Robert Jordan has created a world very much like JRR Tolkien. I agree that sometimes it is hard to drag myself through some of the pages but over all it is a very good book with a very good story behind it. I have been reading books since I was old enough to read and I know when to just stop and put a book down. This is not one of them.

I love these books and people speak of them as boring or pointless, but I think they might be missing something. Sure no heavy breath taking action occured, or did it? Were you paying attention? Why did I find myself on edge the whole way through. Paying attention to every word spoken to find such hidden meanings, things the Aes Sedai are known to do. I do beleive we all have just taken another step in the direction of a conclusion. But I also beleive that there are many more steps to take. Robert Jordan please continue and do not listen to those who claim you are writng for Quantity not quality, for I only read quality. I know I am not the only one out there who feels this way. I was shocked to have read how many people thought this book was a waste of time, I do not understand, detail is important in life and in fiction, so please everyone practice your patience, and feel the anticipation for the next book, for I know I do!Late.Noobies, this series may be the best you shall ever read, everyday I find more and more people claiming such."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"OK, so 1902 people have entered a review and it has 1 1/2 stars. I read this book when it first came out, as I have all the books since Eye of the World and simply stated I enjoyed the book. Jordan has slowed down his output and now we're waiting years between books ( remember there was a time that one came out each year ! ). Unlike others who have posted, I want the story to keep goin on and on (some day it will be over and that will be sad). I credit Jordan for taking a needed break and writing a prequel. His writing is slowing down and people are jumping on him, but instead of giving into their wishes to rush the ending he writes a prequel to feed their demands and keeps writing his story his way. Does much happen in book 10, compared to others no, but that's fine with me. I feel like the series is definitely going somewhere and that it is one story.. not ten. It is one big book that he keeps giving us as he completes it, sure he's making money but I wouldn't want to wait another 8 years just to have one book that ends it. I want it as soon as he can get it to me and will pay for each installment as its ready and I will read each book as just the next chapter. I wish everyone could just enjoy what's been written instead of complaining that it's going to slow, but I settle for myself enjoying the whole series and eagerly await book 11,12 and the other prequels."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"When WOT is typically discussed, a major issue addressed is along the lines of, 'when will something happen?', or 'when will some action occur like in the first 3 books?'. Truthfully, there doesn't have to be a Trolloc battle every other chapter for one of RJ's books to be decent. WOT is a book series set up like a discussion of history, which RJ has himself stated; it's not this week's 'bang-and-blam-I-can-barely-follow-what's-happening-on-the-screen-but-I-know-it's-good-'cause-there's-gunfights-and-car-chases' blockbuster action film. The methodical nature of RJ's series (emphasis on series, to be conceptualized on a whole) is that of an author who's not impatient with his own work, nor is he attempting to alter his writing to please everyone except himself. He's writing a series which, like life, has parts of quick-paced events, and parts of meticulous development. The plot of Crossroads of Twlight flows excellently from Winter's Heart, and leads very well towards what is clearly the end of the series. Seemingly obscure minor events, and major events, are culminating towards an end which RJ doesn't want anyone to be able to predict. The themes of 'what is truly good and evil?', the necessity of binding male and female roles, etc., are thoughtfully and articulately discussed, as always. WOT doesn't deserve to be discarded because one's hypothalamus isn't being stimulated enough. If you've invested care, time, and even money into this series, see it through to its completion, and then truly evaluate it for what it is."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"it arived quickly and in a good state. So i am pleased al round with the service and the product."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Many people who have been putting reviews up seem to despise this latest segment of the wheel of time series. I must agree witht them that the book lacks the &quot;pinache&quot;, for lack of a better word, of the first three novels, or for that matter the first six. Also, it does seem to have been rushed to print by a publishing deadline, making it somewhat lacking in plot development. However, I can understand the reasons behind this. Robert Jordan, requiring a new installment, might have felt that there was too much left unsaid by the previous nine and decided to clarify a bit. For any new readers to the series, do not be discouraged by the bad reviews on &quot;Crossroads of Twilight&quot;, since it does allow for some character development and moderate plot development.Since I first began reading this series eight or nine years ago, I have expectantly awaited any new novel with Rand or Perrin. Despite the mediocrity of this last novel, I cannot, nor I feel, can any fan of the series, stop buying the Wheel of Time books. It is my fervent hope that Robert Jordan does not take advantage of this fact, stops milking the series for more than it is worth, and ends the series within two or three more books. That being said, I feel that this series can provide the framework for future works as the &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; did for all following authors."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This series started off with interesting characters, intriguing plots, and action filled (not necessarily violence) pages. The series continued to suck the reader in till about the 6th or 7th book, when stuff was still happening, but you starting to get tired of how wordy Jordan was and how annoying characters (like RAND) started to get. But almost nothing happened in the ninth book, and the tenth was even worse. But, fool that I am, I read the series again and realized that while was relatively little progress made with the Seanchan or the Shaido or any other of the hundreds of conniving enemies, there was a lot of internal issues being taken up, and I began to get the feeling that Jordan was working to set the scene for something big in book 11, Knife of Dreams, rather than just wasting paper like the 9th one. So maybe the next installment of this series will shock us all :)"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Of course there's a lot of dull detail in this book. However, Jordan does add everything for a reason, as he states. I recently re-read the entire series from book 1 through Crossroads and I noticed a few things. A few of the books start off VERY slowly, so I struggled through for the first 100 pages or so. He also recaps a lot. One of the books devotes an entire prologue of about 100 pages to recapping the end of the previous book. Forgive me for not remembering exactly which book. I also paid attention to the details and found seemingly insignificant details from 5 books back popping up and making perfect sense. It seems that the very thing that everybody is complaining about in this book is Jordan't foreshadowing. Plus, nothing really starts to happen until closer to the end of Crossroads. I have faith that the next book will be better. He wrote himself into a rut and now I think he's trying to get out of it. Whenver we read a series, I think we need to think about the author's intent and try to look at the big picture. We come from an impatient society and this series has drawn out for more than a decade. I think a lot of people expected Crossroads to wrap it all up and that'll be the end of it. But if we look at Jordan't big picture, we should hopefully see that there's still some more story and Crossroads is trying to build up to a grande finale. Although it was a weak buildup."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This book wasn;t full of action like the others, but it will eventually be recognized as a bridge between the beginning and the end of the series.

However, this just like the previous 3 or 4 novels is not meant for intense action in the plot. Jordan is moving towards an incredible climax in this series. The best climax in a novel comes after somewhat of a lull in the plot beforehand. If you think that this is just a terrible book with no plot, you know very little about Jordan and his incredible writing ability. Expect the next couple books to be incredible!"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Robert Jordan is an amazing writer. He is one of a few writers who produces works that require something of it's readers. There are few books that I've read that I can carry on a lengthy conversation about with friends. Although reading the series does take time I have found it worth every minute. Other reviewers, those who dislike Jordan's work, seem to take issue with how long his story is taking to tell or how much detail he gives. I find it refreshing to read something that is complex and takes time to develop. As for how much detail he gives - usually there is only a paragraph or two here and there in a chapter that are description rich - which does provide a detailed world and doesn't (or shouldn't anyway) require much time from the reader. One of the most enjoyable aspects of Jordan's style or writing for me is the characters he creates. His books aren't for everyone but it is worth giving it a try."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"In this instant gratifaction, over violence, blood soaked society most people can't releize an incredible read even if it dragged then down an alley and beat then with in an inch of their life.The only way you will not enjoy these books if you are one to only enjoy teenage style slash and hack / over action no plot or charecter development books.With that said.... I have read all but the most recent of this series, (Crossroads) and the plot and charecter detail are astounding, you see exactly what the writer has envisioned this world to be down to typical personal habits, and what they are wearing down to the earings and or lack there of. You see the world unfolded in your mind as you continue to read. As you go from one set of charecters to the next there is some piff but that doesn't last long as the next plot is just as detailed and well written and when that plot the same piff and continue :) They way that he expands make you want to hibernate in a cozy area of your home and devour the book, untill it is done, but glad that your time isn't that free because then you wouldn't be able to string out the world you are living through these books."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Excellent,Every bit of it was interesting, catching and masterful.

True to his previous novels, Jordan has once again out done himself. He has used all ten of these novels to create much aprehension for when the climax of the series comes. Rand, Mat, and Perrin are three characters that all mature throughout the series and grow attached to the heart. Where the story will go from here, only Jordan knows.The one negative comment about this book is that it doesn't advance much in time. Like book 6, this was a book that does a great job of preparing you for the future, and helps create a complex and intriguing plot, but can seem to take a bit of time to get to the exciting parts of the story. All-in-all though, this was a great book to help set the stage for Tarmon Gai'don, bring it on. Thank you Mr. Jordan"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Jordan has a sweet scam going. In addition to pumping out books to a series that will never EVER end, he is also knocking out prologues and prequels. If you do a search on amazon.com for Jordan stuff, you will unearth beauties such as 'Glimmers: The prologue to Crossroads of Twilight' (for a mere $3.50) or 'New Spring: A Wheel of Time Prequel Novel.' Bwahaha! Prior to the release of each book now he actually puts out a separate 'prologue' that people still pay for. And prequels! To a series that hasn't even ended yet! Pretty soon you'll have to pay $2.00 for the privilege of even reviewing one of his books here.Now, of course, all that is missing is the pseudo-religion. Jordan clearly needs to L. Ron Hubbard-ize himself. Once you get tax-exempt status for your bizarre imagin-o-world, the loot really starts rolling in. We can plunk Jordan in an oversized inner tube, let him drift around the Atlantic for a few years, and eventually he'll wash ashore covered in seaweed and extolling the virtues of the Church of Rand, as told by the Chronicles of Perrin the Apostle.

Yes, the author and editor should both be reprimanded for this abomination. Yes, there really should be a zero-star rating for books, because this one clearly EARNED a zero. However, I think that you're all missing one big point with regard to Jordan's \\"writing.\\" The last several books have been horrible, I believe, because he's run out of other people's ideas to, er, borrow. Those of us who read sci-fi and fantasy (most who will read this review fall into this category) know that the basic plot of a young boy of unknown parentage turning out to be the king/emperor/sorceror of whatever is an old one. That same group of readers should also recognize just how many elements from other classic fantasy or sci-fi are present in Jordan's early works. He's clearly \\"borrowed\\" from Frank Herbert, David Eddings, Tolkien, Steve Perry (Matador series), and probably many more. Then he had to do his own writing, and, with no ideas to borrow, wrote a lot of really, really bad descriptive garbage. It seems clear to me that the only way this series will end is for some other author to publish a book that provides some possible ending for Jordan to borrow.And all those zillions of small characters/plot lines that are just filler? Those will NEVER be resolved, so give up on it. The main characters will NEVER grow up. Give up on that, too. They'll never stop whining, complaining, doing stupid, illogical things, etc. In fact, they'll never become sympathetic characters. Give up on it. And the story? This series? Give up on that, too."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This is an excerpt from an interview Dragonmount.com did with Harriet McDougal, Chief Editor at TOR and Robert Jordan's WIFE (which explains a lot if you ask me):DM: From a professional point of view as RJ's editor, how many books do you think the series will end up running?HARRIET: I think twelve.DM: How much influence over that number do you have as an editor do you think?HARRIET: Something approaching zip. It will depend on how many it takes for him to tell the story as he wants/needs to tell it.This made me so unbelievably outraged because it's an outright lie. As Chief Editor at TOR Harriet's JOB is to edit. Period. She controls what goes into print and how much of it. Exactly what does she think an editor does? The editors at TOR turn down over 3,000 manuscripts a year YET Harriet can't manage to get her own husband in line? This smacks hard of unprofessional behavior. I'm sure Harriet has no problem editing other author's work, probably trashing entire chapters as editors are known to do. Yet she continues to humor RJ with a woman's love and blind devotion that her husband can do no wrong. She can't separate business from pleasure. Other authors are forced to make heartwrenching decisions about what to include in their story on a daily basis while Jordan continues to be virtually immune. As authors are forced to decide whether a death scene is particularly crucial RJ is allowed to produce long, boring diatribes of prose, plots and climaxes that lead nowhere, characters that act more like spoiled, indolent brats than true human beings. Why? Because dear old wifey is his editor. Boy, RJ really hit pay dirt when he married her didn't he? He's living every author's dream -- being able to tell his own editor what to do.This is how the interview SHOULD have read if Harriet was acting in a professional manner and not in wife mode:DM: From a professional point of view as RJ's editor, how many books do you think the series will end up running?HARRIET: Twelve. It's a nice even number and I think it's about time the fans of the series had closure.DM: How much influence over that number do you have as an editor do you think?HARRIET: Well as Chief Editor at TOR I obviously have the final say. I do love my husband and I try to give him as much leeway as I can to tell the story he wants to, but in the end I have to do my job and keep the readers happy. My job is to guide and hone any story, getting rid of excess chapters and characters that may not be necessary -- basically cleaning out the clutter -- so that the end result is a fun, clean read, that'll satisfy readers and keep them coming back for more. I'd like to think I do my job well and can separate business from pleasure. Robert knows that it's nothing personal. I do my job and he does his.That is the answer of a strong, capable woman. The type RJ claims he models his female characters after. Characters I, as a strong woman, can not even relate to anymore. After all, no strong woman I know would be willing to share a man with two other females without so much as a mild protest. They'd tell that male he better choose and stick by it. Strong women also wouldn't pout constantly and act like muddleheaded, spoiled teenagers; fall apart at the most crucial times or bumble with important decisions. They also wouldn't make absolutely ludicrous -- yet highly convenient -- mistakes that not only vault logical reasoning but insult a reader's intelligence.I have been a fan of WOT since the very beginning back in 1990. By fan, I mean rabid fan. That was until book 6. By books 7-10 I accepted the ever increasing lull in action, the inconsistencies in character traits, the verbose descriptions of braid tugging, naked women, and embroidered dresses that verged on methodical and a meandering plot that would make the sway of a drunken sailor look straight. \\"So what? It's WOT!\\" I'd say. Then I started reading the interviews with RJ and it soon hit me how utterly pompous and pretentious the man acts. The RAFO answers are the worse! You can almost pin point when \\"Read and Find Out\\" stopped being a tease and became a man with an over bloated sense of self who couldn't be bothered to answer that particular question, didn't know the actual answer, and couldn't even be bothered to be congenial about it anymore. Granted he can't give away all the goods or no one would buy his books but he can at least be humble and pleasant to the people who've made him who he is today.The reason I posted this review is to illustrate exactly how such a disappointing piece of fiction like COT could possibly see the light of day. As everyone else has stated NOTHING HAPPENS IN THIS BOOK! By nothing, I do not refer to the few pitiful excuses for plot advancements that RJ was magnanimous enough to dribble throughout the book (most, I suspect to just keep readers hopes up). I mean, on a whole this book is unnecessary. There is no major plot elements included here that couldn't have been mentioned within 10 pages of the next volume. The fact is RJ couldn't be bothered to continue at the high caliber of epic writing he started this series out with and it seems no one at TOR is bothering to make him. Certainly not his editor/wife. Because of this I no longer can be bothered to line his pockets anymore. I still have my library card and from here on out, as far as the Wheel of Time is concerned, I plan on using it."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Crossroads of Twilight is an embarrasment to the genre of fantasy. It degrades the standard that many fabulous authors have achieved, authors such as JRR Tolkien, George RR Martin, Tad Williams, and Robin Hobb, to name a few. If you want soemthing good and riveting to read, writing that is actually inspired, beautiful, and straightforward, plots that actually develop, and characters that actually have substance, then read the books by some authors who know how to write.Anyone for whom Wheel of Time is the only work of fantasy they have ever read, just put it down and read something else, perhaps one of those books from the grocery store checkout stand. It would vastly more literary value. Anyone who only reads Wheel of Time for their fantasy fix is extremely misguided and should seek prefessional help. And if they have managed to slog through ten books of this crap-mire, then it is very unlikely that they are dyslexic.I would like to make a note on the title of the book. I beleive that 'Crossroads' does not refer to an actual crossroads, but refers to a mistakenly identified strip-mall parking lot, because the book reads more like a parking lot than an acutal road, even if it is a crossroads.Granted, Wheel of Time started out phenominally, but the pace and quality after book four has gone from highway to underused county road, eroded gravel road, no road, and then to a dead stop at a strip-mall parking lot. It's a sad degeneration, but we must face that Jordan (for whom I've lost ALL respect) has forsaken his fans, lost his hold on the story, lost his sanity, or most likely, all of the above, and that this Parking Lot of Twilight is going absolutely NOWHERE and has been going nowhere for the last six books.If you are out for some entertainment, then go read some tax codes."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"What can I say which haven't already been said? Well, this was so horrible that I MUST raise my own voice here!Like so many others I really enjoyed reading the first 6 books, the next 3 slowed untill this last book, when the wheel got stuck in the middle of the road. Now Mr. Jordan has messed up the whole series by telling us what (those brain dead people in WOT) did, when they did it, what they thought, what they drank and ate etc...They never go to toilet? Could be interesting, when one see how Jordan describe things in the smallest details;)I didn't have great expectations about this book, but I was hoping for more than this drivel! There are no progress in COT.Mat, Perrin and Rand are doing (not much though) and thinking exactly the same as they did in the 3 previous books and the whole affair/story (if one can call it that)last only some weeks in the book, even though it felt like eternity!Mat has lost his charm, Rand is still a child and needs help all the time (how is it that Rand became more childish the more he grew up??? Perrin is still wondering around looking for his bloody wife, and the women are now worst than ever. Wonder how Roberts wife look like?I never before skiped pages in a fantasy book, with this book my sanity wouldn't allow otherwise. All goes in circle, all that's been said in those 9 books before....ARE SAID AGAIN! Have U noticed that for every sentence said there are 10 pages of explanation? Annoyed??? It's worst than that!Another thing here which bother me is that some here compare Robot Jordan with J.R.R. Tolkien, on how much complex and much depth WOT has.... HELLO FOLKS!:o Tolkien manage to write Lotr in 3 books! A wonderful story which hasn't seen it's equal yet. In WOT the characters are boring and soooo stale. The 1st books was very promising indeed, but money talks! and so it was that Robot Jordan cannot or will not finish this series. Be warned! -This story/series doesn't move an inch any more and there are no constructive writing... Will be interesting to see how long he can drag this series out!There is no problem for one with a little bit of talent (and now I mean just a little talent) to write a book about world and what the poeple in that world thinks, eat, drink and so on... The problem is that very few master that art to write a good book like that. The only one i can think of is Kafka, and Jordan is definitely not Kafkas equal!I will never read anything written by Robert Jordan ever again, but will be back here to read the reviews;) U folks out there writes much better than Robot Jordan!Let us all hope WOT will finish before they nail Jordans coffin shut...or before he drowns in the pool of money he made!P.S. U are aware of that Jordan doesnt care what he fans/readers thinks about his work???? That says much about a man who makes his living of us!

I do this not as a literary critique, but as a consumer warning. Do not buy this book. Unless you are deeply involved because of the last 9 books, do not read this book. It is a meaningless collection of adjectives without the proper use of verbs. If you must have the information to bridge book 9 to book 11, go to the library.I have just finished listening to the audio version and did not have the luxury of simply skipping over the fashion statements or meaningless sidetracks. It went on and on about nothing. More than once I screamed at my system to: \\"hurry up &amp;$(%*# , get to the point!\\" It was agony. I have never before read a book with as many twists and plots in which not one story line comes to any type of conclusion, or even any transitions, save one exception. That one \\"exception\\" is in the form of a cliff hanger at the end of the book, greedily attempting to bait the reader for the next instalment. Had this been his first book, we would never have heard of Robert Jordan, ... and for good reason.There are flashes of his old writing style, but only when he touches on the boys' story lines. His plot lines still do not flow like they did in the earlier works, but at least I did not find myself screaming at the speakers. When he writes about the girls, it is as though the most important thing is the type of dress they are wearing, down to the description of the color and scale of the decorative embroidery.I have affection for the folks from the Two Rivers. I dearly want to see them through their journey. It is time Mr. Jordan reread his first books in an attempt to get back the source of his magic. Should he fail to recapture the source, the Dark One will have won, and all will be lost."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I won't bother addressing the snivelling bootlickers who defend any blathering prose as \\"deep\\" or \\"far-reaching,\\" as those who cannot recognize horrible prose (like this latest installment) are beyond reform. I would simply like to add that there is absolutely no excuse for the publisher to allow such clearly unedited...garbage to make it to press. Who cares if Jordan has already published lots of stuff? All the more reason to reign in his verbosity and suggest that the plot be central or, at the very least, addressed. This is simply pathetic, and no one in their right mind should purchase it. Perhaps not even libraries."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Well folks, there's just not a lot to say that hasn't been said here already. The best part of this book is coming to the review section on this site. What a pile of pointless, navel-gazing, drawn-out, dull crap. Already smarting from the last two bore-a-thons I bought this one with great trepidation and became increasingly wide eyed when I started to realise that nothing was going to happen in this one. Yeah, yeah I can hear the &quot;what a mature, thoughtful bridge this book plays in the larger series&quot; garbage that is out there. Give me a break. For $25 bucks plus I should at least be able to expect SOMETHING to happen. There's more drama in my kid's daycare class in one day than the 600 plus pages of so-called fantasy I've slogged through here. What TOR should publish is a collection of the reviews on this site! Shape up RJ - as far as I'm concerned I'll wait for the last one and get the bottom line. Stretch it out as long as you want - I'm younger than you are."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I read the book and I really, honestly tried to find something worth 2 or 3 stars. I kept an open mind and reminded myself that it was really just a set up for even greater things to come. In the end I couldn't even justify the single star that I'm required to give.To give this book 1 star is an insult to all the other books that had to earn their 1 star. There was only about 20 pages worth reading in the nearly 700 page book. To think of all the trees that gave their lives for this book to be published. What a waste... what a crying shame of a waste of oxygen producing trees.In all honesty, the part with Alviarin was captivating. However it doesn't make up for the 498 pages that came before it, or the 160 pages that came after.If you've read the other 9 books (and who hasn't, if they read book 10?) just skip to page 499 and read that chapter. For the rest of the book: a) ALL the women are still bra-burning, Julia-Roberts-watching, arms-crossed-under-her-breast-while-she-sniffs-at-all-the-brainless-men feminists. b) all the men still like to be treated like kids by the women. c) on page 677, SOMETHING HAPPENS!! OH MY GOD!! but don't get your hopes up, it's over by 678. d) You can still count the number of chapters Rand gets for himself on one hand. In this case, ONE!! and a two page epilogue for a grand total of 18 pages, even though HE'S ONLY THE MAIN CHARACTER and is perhapes the coolest character in the entire series. e) on page 284 you get a neato map of Caemlyn.In summary, this book reminded me a lot about the movie \\"The Thin Red Line\\" in that you have endless detail and character exploration to a fault. The writer says: \\"Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah, oooo action sequence here, blah blah blah blah blah, oh man I have 670 pages/3 hours of screenplay already! Errrr.. bad stuff happens to a main character, The End, thank you for your money, come again next time!\\""},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"If you're like me in thinking that you could read the last four chapters in book 9 and not miss anything, you'll hate this book. My recommendation is to read the last paragraph of the last two chapters and you will be ready to move to the next book.Even the stories about Mat are not that interesting in this book. All he does is repeat his views about women and how he doesn't understand them for about 300 pages. The dice stop rolling several times supposedly because of decisions he has made? But we are never told what would have been the consequences if he hadn't chosen the way he did to make them stop. We know from the last book he is going to marry her. Not yet.I bet after reading this book, you could tell me 100 different ways that Aes Sedai guard their emotions behind their emotionless faces. I bet you can also tell me 100 different emotional situations where this does not apply. For people who are good at hiding emotions, these women act like girls in their early teens high on sugar or like they were just dumped by their teenage boyfriends. I say all this because of the redundant descriptions of Aes Sedai and then how inconsistent their behavior is with their descriptions.Perrin is still following Shaido. Elayne is still trying to get the throne. Rand has such a short uneventful showing that his important decision is really not very exciting. The Black Ajah do have an interesting twist if you can figure out what chapter that's in, otherwise it's not worth reading straight through to find it.Did I say things were repeated? You get a re-description of how every type of character is portrayed. Aiel, Aes Sedai, Black Ajah, Forsaken, Warders, Run-Of-The Mill Over-Described Politicians, any Major Character, any Minor Major Character, Seanchen, Sea-Folk, Many Nationalities, all of these and more are introduced as if they weren't described in enough detail in any of the last books. And then if you didn't get the point, he reminds you everytime (sometimes multiple times in a single reference) he references one of them what they are like.I almost convinced myself to wait for paperback after the last book. Now I am thoroughly convinced to wait until a friend buys and finishes reading the next paperback and borrow his. Hate to not finish a series but this is getting ridiculous.I forgot to mention. He repeats himself. Oh wait, I already said he repeats himself. Oh, did I tell you he repeats himself? Oh, and he repeats..."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Finally! A book that gives WOT fans what they truly want: Elayne, Elayne, and more Elayne. Elayne sleeping. Elayne bathing. Elayne walking back and forth and thinking: you know, all the stuff that has made WOT great, but here finally focused on to the extent it deserves in this masterpiece of modernist prose. I haven't been this impressed with a book since I finished \\"Ringworld Throne\\". Even the last few books of \\"Sword of Truth\\" can't compare to this. Richard's 5 page long redundant monologues have nothing on Elayne's musing on the state of Andoran affairs as she paces in her room and frets over her dress. So anyways, the reviews on this book are fairly hysterical, and I probably couldn't top them, so instead I think I'll just summarize a few chapters about 1/3 of the way through the book in order to give a prospective reader an idea of what they're getting in to.- In the first of these chapters, Elayne takes a bath. That's pretty much the extent of the action. We're introduced to her 3 maids and given extensive background for each one - obviously, how could the plot progress without backstories for her 3 useless maids? Also, we're given novel insight into Aviendha's reluctance to bathe - because 8 novels telling us that Aiel are uneasy around large quantities of water aren't nearly enough. In fact, there should be a whole chapter devoted to just this topic - perhaps 20-30 pages about how they aren't used to lots of water, because, you know, there is so little of it in the Waste. Also, the Waste is hot. You might not have picked that up - it's ok, don't feel bad, it sometimes takes an astute reader to notice the subtleties of Jordan's writing. Now, you might think 2 chicks taking a bath together could make for a really hot and steamy story. Think again. It's about as exciting as listening to 3 women talk about what clothes are suitable for a pregnant noble woman to wear. Which is another chapter, incidentally.- Next chapter, Elayne considers getting back in the bathtub. It's awesome. To be honest, she did get interrupted in the last chapter by the Sea Folk - perhaps the only characters more annoying than Elayne herself.... Nah, nevermind, no one can match Elayne. Except maybe Faile. Or Nyneave. Or any female character. Not to say every female is exactly the same annoying, whiny, jealous, insecure disaster of a character. Except that they are. Also, Elayne meets some incredibly relevant minor nobles in this chapter. Bonus.- Following this thrill-fest, Elayne meets with her chief clerk, and oh boy does the excitement take off! It's almost too much to bear. Thankfully the tension is broken when some Wise Ones come in, and thus begins the discussion of what types of tea are best for Elayne to drink during her pregnancy. This is perhaps my favorite chapter of the entire series because of the deftly used juxtaposition of the action-packed scene with the first clerk with the somber but intriguing discussion of tea.I could continue, but all this talk of Elayne has me too excited to go on without rereading these sections. Suffice to say, we're treated to many more scintillating scenes with Elayne, some involving her brushing her hair, others about her dietary needs, and still more regarding local Andoran fashion. It's really what makes this book so great. In fact, after WOT is complete, I'm hoping RJ left extensive notes about his planned sequel trilogy called \\"The Adventures of Elayne: the Legend Continues\\". It will document her quest to gather the most annoyingly useless female characters to her royal court while simultaneously castrating every male character that she's forced to have contact with. Will Rand be part of this adventure? Only time will tell, but if he somehow survives the Last Battle I suspect he will kill himself rather than be forced to spend his life with 3 wives who, combined, are infinitely worse than any number of Trollocs. So here's to the future queen of Andor! May she live forever to grace us pages and pages of absolutely pointless text."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"My WoT history. I originally became interested in this series when I moved and was looking for something to read while I acclimated to a new area which was prior to book 9 coming out in hardback. I remember reading the first 2 or 3 books in the series and going out to purchase the remaining ones in paperback, enjoying them so much. As I read further into the series, I found myself grinding my teeth at my haste for buying the latter novels. A fanatical WoT friend got book 9 the day it came out and I had it a week later to read. He was excited but I didn't feel happy with it and was glad I didn't purchase it later in paperback. I never did. I vowed to use the library for the remaining books.Current history. This is my first review. At no time have I been more outraged by an author and fanatical reviewers to start reviewing books, especially this trash.First the author. I do not wish to reiterate other great remarks. Most of them have used the best lines out there, quite funny. I enjoy reading them more than the actual book. I visit here about 1/week for my rip fix. I agree with what other 2 or less star rating reviews have said. I don't own the book, so bear with me. One thing I do remember, there was a minor lord who had about the same name as another character, about a 5 or 6 letter name. Basically, the 2 [v]owels and the other 3 or 4 [c]onsonants were rearranged between the two names. A name like [Cvcvc] or something alone those lines. The series has an overabundance of characters with similar names containing the same letters; combined with the various clothing descriptions the book becomes frustrating. A better glossary is necessary where a minor character introduced would deserve a mention. Some of the major names and phrases aren't listed! I don't want to bother sifting through 9 long books to ultimately find out that this person was the sister to the maid of the general in book whatever and we're expected to remember. I finally searched the internet using keywords \\"wheel of time\\", \\"glossary\\", and \\"characters\\" to find the answers on a reliable website.Second the fanatical reviewers. There are a rare few 5 star rating reviewers that have true reviews about this book and this whole book, and nothing but this book. My review is not about them. My remarks are about the remaining reviewers, who are about as outrageous as the book. It doesn't matter if you started reading with the first book in hardback or book 10 in paperback, we at one time are/were fans of Robert Jordan and his world. We are reviewing this book, book 10 of WoT, \\"Crossroads of Twilight\\". We are NOT reviewing the next potential book, we are NOT reviewing any prior book, and we are NOT reviewing the overall series.To give CoT 5 stars because book 11 or future books will surely rock is ridiculous. Are you psychic? I remember reading something along those lines in the book 9 reviews and book 10 stunk so your ESP is off. To give CoT 5 stars because the first books were great is not a review of CoT, but of the other book. Please leave that review with that book and not inaccurately raise the rating of CoT. To give CoT 5 stars because you love the series but this book wasn't that great is misleading. That is a contradiction...\\"this book wasn't that good and was slow and repetitive, whatever, but the series is great so I'll give it 5 stars\\"...if you give what you are calling a mediocre book 5 stars, how can you truly express a great book? Please be honest about what you are reviewing, CoT, NOT the series. From what I've seen, the lower rating reviews are pretty much honest about what they are reviewing, this book. And stating the series is in decline is reflecting this book since it was horrible.As I said above, I bought the first 8 in paperback. Friend and library supplied the last 2. I will continue to use the library. Fortuntely, a friend helps me get the book early with his connections at the library, and the waiting list was HUGE the last time. A sign that others are wising up.Thank you for your attention to my rambling."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I simply cannot understand what all you people are complaining about! Crossroads of Twilight is possibly the best monitor stand I have ever used. It is far better than medical dictionaries and all those reference books that you never read and are boring as hell. Let's just say it puts them to shame. Before, when I went to read the hilarious Amazon reviews, I sat hunched over to look at my computer screen, hurting my back. But with my new CoT monitor stand, my moniter sits at the proper height, letting me retain a comfortable posture and get even more enjoyment out of reading these wonderful reviews.End sarcasm. This is possibly one of the worst books I have ever tried to read. Honestly, I find books like medical dictionaires far more entertaining. CoT is a disgrace to the literary world and itself. It has disgraced everything from tea, fashion magazines, eBay, bookstore bargain bins, paperweights, doorstops, bathroom magazine stands, the fantasy genre, to moniter stands. So awesomely bad it's awe-inspiring.Here's a summary so you can judge it for yourself: Ummmm . . . Did I just read an eight hundred page book about absolutely nothing, bogged down in a cess pool of useless characters that I really don't care about and a few more that I want to kill personally, and about tea, all kinds of tea, all the ways tea is served, and everything that is used to contain and brew tea, and an intricate description of what tea leaves look like after they had been steeped? Oh, and dresses. You can't forget the dresses.I really love tea (mainly because coffee gives me migraines) and I really hate to see it desecrated so. I now think that Jordan is getting paid (by the word--no!--the letter) by evil Columbian drug/coffee lords who want everyone in the world to hate the very thought of tea so that they will all drink coffee instead (and do drugs to clear their heads of the stupid drivel that is CoT). This is an absolutely ridiculus theory, but seeing the pathetic ridiculus nature of this book, it could very well be a living, breathing conspiracy.I have nothing more to say that has not already been said. And to the hopeless addicts, it is with deep regret (not really) that I inform you that Wheel of Time is dead. So it goes."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I have read the past several books only to discover what new bizarre quirk of writing Jordan can come up with. He does not disappoint.The bad stuff:No plot development whatsoever. None of the main characters accomplish anything.Page after page after endless page is spent describing the most incredibly tedious mundane events... people walking from here to there, people having some tea flavored with honey, people sitting on defective camp chairs, people shopping, people having interminable conversations that provide no useful information either to themselves or to the reader, people contemplating the possibility that they might someday make a decision about something.Lots of people almost do things, don't quite react to something or manage to hide the fact that they feel an emotion.We learn in excruciating detail what every woman wears, including particulars on jewelry, buttons, embroidery, fancy stitching, hair styles, fabrics, baubles, bangles, and bright shiny beads... and fascinatingly in-depth descriptions of local styles from each and every country.Women described as \`well endowed', (about two-thirds of the named female characters), always wear extremely low cut dresses or blouses, from which they are constantly about to \`fall out of'. They never do, though.In my opinion, the endings to all Jordan's books are weak, unsatisfying and confusing. This book doesn't even have an ending. I think one afternoon he just quit writing.The good stuff:A meeting of Aes Sedai degenerates into a violent screeching catfight.I can't think of anything else good."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Although I have been reading this series for lo! these many years since my father sent me the first volume in Tokyo, I have come to the conclusion that Jordan holds his readers in contempt and is merely milking this franchise for what it's worth. As more and more is written about less and less it is, in fact, possible to wonder if these books are written by anyone at all. My theory is that two small algorithms do all the work. The first would be \\"Auto-sedai\\", which is set up to create and describe - at great length - random sedai from a list of interchangeable adjectives. Unfortunately there is a bug in this routine. No literate human, nor any author with respect for his audience, would dare to describe a Sedai as having \\"a not too overly long neck\\". The other programme, I suspect, is the \\"Recursive Descriptor\\". After a few iterations through this we go from \\"cup\\" to \\"porcelain cup\\", \\"blue porcelain cup\\" \\"blue porcelain Sea-folk cup\\" \\"intricate blue porcelain Sea-folk cup\\" ad infinitum et nauseam. From these two sources, a few lines of code, one can imagine Jordan's one page first draft being expanded into a volume thick enough to stun an ox. Unfortunately I am devloping the same contempt for Jordan and his editors that they so blatantly display towards us."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"First of all, I find it amazing that after almost 2000 reviews this book has received a 1 1/2 rating, which is only a half star above the very bottom since Amazon does not allow zero star ratings. This is truly incredible - I can't believe there is a more universally despised book in the history of publishing.Now I'll add my voice to the many other outraged readers. Another thing that amazes me is that people consider Jordan to be a skilled writer. I've always held the belief that he's a total hack. His characters are incredibly one-dimensional, childish morons who never seem to develop at all (Especially the female characters - does Mr. Jordan really have such a low opinion of women? To me he's bordering on misongyny). He bogs down his books with needlessly detailed and repetitive description.That being said, I have enjoyed his books despite these flaws because it is obvious the man has one heck of an imagination. The story of course is not original, having been told thousands of times before, but the world he created and the back story he had for this world were truly unique. It was thrilling to initially explore 'Randland' and learn of its rich history.I am willing to believe Jordan when he tells us he has know the 'last scene of the last chapter' since the very beginning (Let me guess - Rand confronts the Dark One and is successful in imprisoning him again - or am I going too far out on a limb here?), but I have come to the conclusion that his vast imagination has abandoned him, and he has no idea how to get to that envisioned end. How else can you expain the grinding halt to the plot that is the last few books? We're left with psuedo-political posturing and a lot of the main characters walking around talking about their problems. This leaves an incredible infuriating and forgettable book - I finished it just a couple of weeks ago and already it has seeped out of my mind to such an extent that I can't remember what (if anything) of note happened.Perhaps Jordan has bitten off more that he could chew. Perhaps a story of this magnitude, with so many subplots and characters, is impossible to tell without becoming burnt out well before the end. He has, after all, been at this for, what, 15 years or so? Terry Goodkind has similarly killed of what was once a promising epic (although in a completely different way - Goodkind has turned his popular series into a pulpit for espousing his radical right wing political views). If George Martin does likewise I think I'll give up on epic fantasy. Please George don't let us down.As a final word, please, please stop comparing Jordan to Tolkien. Mr. Tolkien is, unfortunately, no longer living, and as such cannot respond to these slurs. I find it incredibly disrespectful of his memory to make such ludicrous claims."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Spending good money on this book is a waste of time. If you must read it wait a few months and get it from the library. I was eagerly waiting to see how Faile would be rescued or how Egwene's Aes Sedai would gain the White Tower or ANYTHING that would have been worth spending the [$$$] I laid down. Nothing happens! Jordan apparently has no idea how the story is going to end so he just write really long descriptive passages that lead nowhere. The scene where Perrin is in the town, that may have ghosts, and is dealing with negotiations for grain is a prime example of writing gone awry. Why weren't the ghosts dealt with or at least expounded upon! The stars of the book are the weevils that seem to get mentioned in every chapter."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"for all its worth, i DO think he has failed to excercise restrain over it. An author does write for the story, but he realy should look and see if all this detail and touching bases with the previous story threads (which we already know) are actualy making for a better story. I don't think so, NONE of the fans i've talked to don't seem to think so, and i wonder if he's gone back to read over his own work.The plot doesn't advance, the characters don't develop.. there's absolutely nothing here. Borrow this book from someone else unfortinate enough to have shelled out money for it, or check it out of the library. If you have a while, read the last couple of chapters. Hopefully either the story will pull mr jordan back towards a story, or someone will point out how glacial he's become. Either way,i am looking forward to the next book, albeit with some trepidation that it too will be this awful"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Jordan should be ashamed of himself. &quot;Crossroads of Twilight&quot; is ten pages of interesting material spun out to 700 pages of dross.

However, he should have finished the Wheel of Time series long ago, and gone on to something else."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I have followed this series since the beginning, and I felt ripped off by the lack of action and movement that occured. I thought that the book had basically been written to make a few more bucks out of the people foolish enough to keep reading them. There are perephial characters added that may be pertainent to the ending, however, do nothing to advance the current story, and at the end of the book all of the characters are pretty much where they were at the beginning. I hardly think there is much that couldn't just have gone straight into the next book, and would suggest that unless you get this book free, or very inexpensively, to skip it, and hope the next one has more movement towards the conclusion of the story."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I'm sad to say I agree with most of the other posters: this book sets a new low in furthering the story. Basically we have the same stuff of the previous few novels---which is to say everyone playing everyone else off against each other in excruciating detail. The lone three page exception is when Rand and Loial are reunited and seem genuinely happy to see each other. This book is wordy too: I think it could have been trimmed down to 150 pages without much loss.I too was frustrated that Rand makes only a brief appearance, 500+ pages in, and little to nothing happens in the book. In fact, the book ends just as something seems to start happening to resolve the Aes Sedai conflict. If Book 11 were published next month this might be okay, but really, I have a hard time feeling good about reading this and waiting three years for another installment. I don't necessarily want the series to wrap up instantly, but I would like some progress made in the story.Many people feel George Lucas is increasingly self-indulgent with his Star Wars movies. Jordan is the same way with WoT, which is too bad, because it has great potential."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"After more than one year of waiting, I started reading this book with the usual expectation I reserve for the &quot;eye of the world series&quot;. Unfortunately it seems that Robert Jordan thinks he can make us go to the bookstore and buy the continuation of the continuation forever. He has made the series a money machine, and is not willing to advance to a conclusion. In Crossroads of twilight nothing happens. There is already so many characters and parallel plots that it takes the first 5/6pages to review them, and then he uses the following 1/6 to introduce more alternative plots. After ten books, I would feel comfortable if we advanced towards a conclusion, and concentrated on the main plot. Is this going to go on forever?The only positive thing I can say about the book is that the characters and Jordan's writing style have become so familiar that the book is as easy to read as a comic."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"So many of the reviews state that this is the worst book in the WOT series. I would tend to disagree, this is possibley the worst book ever published. If Jordan would have presented a book of this calibre to publishers 14 years ago, he would still be working his day job.C-O-T is a 700 page recap of the final 50 pages of Winters Heart, light... it is borring, but I must admit - the last two pages of the book did move the plot along quite nicely.I would recommend that any interested reader go to the library, read the last chapter and not waste time with the filler called C-O-T.One other observation about the series. I don't think Jordan has the slightest grasp of interactions between men and women. Jordan would have us beleive that men are so stupid that we can not understand anything women do and women truly spend the entire day thinking of wardrobes and how angry men make them.At least I didn't have to read another \\"good Two Rivers Woolen\\" in this book since Ninieve was left out completely.Finally, Mr. Jordan, your over exagerated bright pink and lavender dress with elaberately embroidered bodice with bright yellow ruffles at the end of the sleeves, so unlike the dresses worn by the other great authers, is slightly askew from the form normally worn by those who occupy the lands of Charleston, SC. (see how my run-on description of Mr. Jordans dress adds nothing to the review, much like 700 pages of his book)I have also contemplated that Robert Jordan no longer writes the tomes of W-O-T. I have the feeling that I am reading a cheap romance novel that his wife or mother writes under his pen name. Possible?"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"As much as I have enjoyed Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series, Ihave got to be honest. The latest book in the series, \\"Crossroadsof Twilight\\" is awful. Jordan has shown a remarkable talent forwriting page after page of absolutely nothing. So little actuallyhappens in this book that you could skip it entirely.For fans of Jordan, this book has to be very frustrating. TheWheel of Time began as a fast-paced adventure about good versusevil in a land full of magic and intrigue. There were brilliantplot twists and interesting people constantly in motion.Unfortunately, by the 11th book in the series things have groundto a halt. In Crossroads, no one does anything and Jordan spendspages with repetitive descriptions and meaningless conversationsabout nothing. I have to give Jordan some credit, I doubt thereare many writers alive that could fill hundreds of pages with noplot movement at all. That's a skill, but not one that I want tosee again.So what actually happened? (Spoiler warning, sort of) Well, whenwe left Matt and his group of fugitives from the Seachan, theywere fleeing from the city of Ebou Dar. Hundreds of pages later,still fleeing. When we last saw Elayne, she and friends weretrying to gather support for her claim to the throne of Andor.Yep, she's still at it. At the conclusion of the book 10, Egweneand the rebel Aes Sedai were about to attack the White Tower. Atthe end of Cross Roads, Egwene and the rebel Aes Sedai were aboutto attack the White Tower.As for Rand, the Dragon Reborn and the main protagonist for theentire series, he barely makes it into this novel and spends theentire time in a remote part of Tear doing very little. If hewere an actor he'd be screaming for more lines. In short, nothinghappens.In the end, I have invested so much time and energy in this seriesI can't really let it go. But, if Jordan produces another booklike Crossroads, I might find away."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I have been reading Robert Jordan since 1991. The last few books have been very disappointing. This book was all fluff and no substance. It is time to either end this series or just publish no more books."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Very boring and disappointing book.

Enough said by others, would give it a 1/2 star instead of 1 star, because it did have a couple of chapters on Matt."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Its just a 700+ page prologue. You can skip this one and not miss anything of the total story."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"...or maybe the author has finally succumbed to that voice in his head-- the one that babbles endlessly about the minutia of politics and decision anguish. One thing is clear, this is not a work worthy of the author of the early books in the series.I could almost believe that book nine was just way too long, and the part that was chopped out by Jordan's editor became book ten. Or maybe Jordan's suffered a head injury, or started taking drugs, or stopped. Could be he's just busy with those martial arts action books he supposedly writes under another name. Whatever.I enjoy Jordan's descriptions of camp and military life, as I'm sure some readers enjoy those of court life, politics, Aes Sedai scheming, and so forth. There's plenty of all that in this book. From my perspective, though, each novel in a series of this sort does need exciting action, and substantial progress in the plot (and in most of the subplots--which, by the way, should probably number no more than five or six). If you're hunting for action or progress, don't waste your arrows on this book; it's a hollow decoy in those respects.My advice: use your money to support another author, preferably one who's still hungry enough to earn your business. Then check back here when the next Jordan book is released. Maybe by then he'll have cleansed the taint from his half of the one true source of his success- a relationship with readers who can distinguish between the light of a powerful storyline and the darkness of pointless prose."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I am one of the most avid readers of the wheel of time series but enough is enough!I have had the patience to wait for this book for two years and what do we get...this garbage!

More importantly, I get increasingly frustrated that the &quot;good guys/gals&quot; cannot seem to add 2+2 and come up with 4... I know they can't be perfect (or we would have no story), but do they always have to be so clueless?As many others have observed, George R.R.

As everyone's said already, nothing happens, and I've come to believe nothing ever will.I've given Jordan the benefit of the doubt from Lord of Chaos onward, and he does it to me again. I thought he was back on track - even if just a little with Winter's Heart - but no, he's definitely not. I'm seriously considering quitting the series, and I'd warn anyone who's dissatisfied to maybe stay away from this book if you think you'd be swayed to quit.... trust me... you won't miss much."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Ok, HOW long did we wait for book 10? 2 YEARS? This book went almost no where. Jordan is filling pages and pages with pure fluff. Having waited for this book for that entire time, I feel like I just got my chain yanked. Aside from a few major decisions being made, Jordan spends his words describing filthy clothing, and or just TALKING about clothing clean or not, for a great percentage of the book. Lots of describing scenery, and background, but little on plot devlopment and progression. I am very dissappointed with this book and it is starting to color my overall perceptions of the series. I hope he gets back to what he gave us in the first few installments, and I will likely ready whatever he may produce in the WOT in the future, but I won't be anticipating it or holding my breath."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I love the Wheel of Time. I've been waiting for this book for a long time. I've read the whole series many times... this book was a serious disappointment to me.Nothing happens.Then... it happens again.680 pages go by and it happens many times.I'm disappointed. Not a single plot was resolved in this book. Not even a minor plot. Only marginal hints were given as to what is to come and most of them completely ambiguous. All the major plots ended at high points where one more chapter could have given some closure. This would be fine if there was only 1 minute of commercials until it starts up again. Now we have to wait 2 years.I would never have thought of giving a Wheel of Time book below 4 stars until I read this book. I have no desire to reread it. That, for me, is a strange feeling. If the series doesn't get better I am dropping it while I still think of it as a good fnatasy series."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Okay, a lot of people are upset about the slow pace of this book. I can understand that. The thing I believe that readers need to keep in mind is that this episode is nothing but a cliffhanger. Does anyone remember how the entire country was driven crazy wondering who shot J.R.? This book is setting up for some major stuff to start happening. Mat is being set up for a major event in his romance with Tuon, such as it is. Rand has cleansed the true source, and the only ones who know it are the Ashaman, whom everyone is convinced are just a bunch of madmen who are very dangerous. Not only that, we are waiting for a major event within the Ashaman, Logain and Taim will most likely have a showdown for control of the Ashaman. Perrin is going nuts over his wife, and he means to go after the Shaido. Lets not forget about Elayne and the siege of Caemlyn. These things have all been set up in earlier books, and sure, we would like quick resolution, but the art to a good climax is a good build up. There is just so much major stuff on the edge of a knife blade and this book does a beautiful job of setting us up for book 11. I believe book 11 will be heralded as the best book of the series. I recommend anyone who is a fan of this series to read this book, if you don't you will be lost when the next installment is released. The end is coming and it is coming fast, this book is just the calm before the storm. Heed my words, oh ye of little faith, for the final battle is on the brink."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Dear Robert Jordan, You know as well as anyone that the sales of each new book in this series only increases. I am 100% certain this will be true of Book 11 when it comes out. Do not listen to these whining infants who sound more annoying than Nyneave tugging her braid. They will all buy the next book when it comes out. They are simply products of the MTV generation that can't wait 5 seconds without getting what they want. No attention span. They are simply taking out their lack of PATIENCE with negative reviews. The young Marty McFly in Back to the Future 2 comes to mind when he whines \\"Is it done yet?\\" because his mommy takes a whole 5 seconds to make a pizza. Go head and take the series to book 14 (or longer) I enjoy it so I really don't want it to EVER end. Don't change your writing style for these morons. I actually think books 9 & 10 are BETTER than the first six (books 2 & 3 were the least best in the series). I prefer social interaction and political intrigue over \\"they charged down the hill and killed some trollocs, again\\" I'd prefer to hear them talk while sitting around a campfire than just more \\"Perrin swings his axe and kills a trolloc\\" Go ahead and take 3 years between books if that is what you need to keep the quality good.

That should tell you that it's just another great book of the series.That cleared, I have to say I was disappointed since the book barely advanced a few days from book nine. It simply kept setting up the story for a good end (at least I hope so). If you were not too impressed with the other books in the series that were more about preparing for something to happen later, you wont be too happy about this one. I expected more action since the last one seems to set it all up for a good book. Instead the reader gets more preparations.I have to say that it's still an entertaining continuation of the series and I didn't put it down until I finished it. I might be biased since I love the series and its story with all the sub stories and different characters. I can't wait for the development that the book seems to be building up to. I regret that it might be another year before that happens. Maybe I should have waited until almost the end of the year to read it. :o) (Yeah, right)Mat is probably becoming one of my favorite characters of all time. I wish I were like him. \\"...And follow Mat wherever he goes to dance with Jack of the Shadows...\\"I gave it the four stars because it left me wanting but still entertained me.

There are a thousand, or so, negative reviews of Crossroads of Twilight, and, having just finished the book, I had to wonder if the collective &quot;we&quot; had read the same book. Here it is in a nutshell: anyone who's reading CoT is best apprised to insure that the first nine books are read first. Assuredly, *not* doing that would force this book into a literary abyss.Now to my point, before reading Crossroads of Twilight, I did reread, in order, all the previous 9 books. #10, to the authors intent, flows as a good wine into a beckoning chalice. Surely, those who favor titanic &quot;Falme&quot; like scenes will not find their sanction here. Nor fans of Rand, per se. But Perrin, Egwene and Elayne shine... and... Light... Mat! He shines as the morning sun on a brisk spring morning.This book does, indeed, go through the nuances of each of the aforementioned characters. I suppose many people don't like that. I suppose there's a little Mack Bolan fan in me as well. To the point of this book, though, I found that the more--effort-- I expended in reading it the more I was rewarded. Make no bones about it, save for Mat, this is a thick book to read (and I'm not talking about the length).But, in major storms, such as hurricanes, many of us know, an &quot;eye&quot; passes over at roughly after some modicum of the storm has moved. It can be at the midpoint, earlier or later. Regardless, that eye allows for a brief respite, yet is coupled with the foreknowledge that another storm side is on its way. That the often cloudless clear blue skies belie the end. No, we realize, they harbinge it.So too with Crossroads of Twilight and the Wheel of Time series.

While I agree that its pace is slower than most of the other books, I don't see that as a problem. Life is like that, some days are slower than others. At the end of reading this book, I found that I had enjoyed the time spent once again in Mr. Jordan's world.To all of the negative reviewers out there I say, \\"Let's see you write something better.\\" Probably less than 1% of them have ever had a book published if that many.

Robert Jordan doesn't need to pull out a forsaken at the end to have killed off anymore. His writing has gotten better.I really like it how Robert Jordan has slowed down the pace. I would not want a month to pass in every chapter.The Lord of the Rings took 11 years to complete and that was only 3 small books. We are lucky to have such a talented writer pumping out huge books in only two years.There is really so much that happens in this book you will want to read it again. My only complaint is that it was too short. Let's hope the next one is 1,000 pages.This book might not be for young people who's attention deficit brains have grown up on 3D video games and need something flashing in their eyes every 1.5 seconds to stay interested."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I felt it necessary, having just finished the book today, to write in defense of this piece after so many poor reviews. It is true that it does not move with breakneck speed, but it does cover quite a lot of ground on all the characters; them being spread out across the world as they are, it would be impossible to write a good book 10 otherwise.Crossroads of Twilight was very well written, and very engaging. The attention to detail is distracting to readers lacking patience from watching too many in-your-face and quick scene changing movies, but once you become immersed in the text and lose yourself, the details paint the world for you, and it makes it that much harder to put the book down.I dare say many of the poor reviews have come from people that have been conditioned by today's fast-paced culture and are irritated at not being able to slow themselves down and truly read the story. I highly recommend this book to all; in fact I highly recommend all 10 books of the World of Time series. This is truly the best series I have ever read. Perhaps those who prefer comic books and cartoons would prefer something lighter with less layers, but for serious readers, these books are a must."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This book seems to have gotten many poor reviews because it lacks any major conclusions at the end. There are a number of good points about this book that deserve to be addressed, though. For one thing, most of the book is spent with major characters. This contrasts sharply with Jordan's typical weakness: his tendancy to get caught up in minor story-lines. Secondly, while no major plot-lines are RESOLVED, many are ADVANCED significantly. The third point is that Mat and Tuon are going to make a very interesting couple, and their interactions in this book are highly worthy of reading. Finally, Crossroads of Twilight is the latest chapter in the most deeply developed and intricately concieved fantasy epic ever written. While this newest volume is not the greatest gem in the series, it is nonetheless a worthy addition to this wonderful saga."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"10.

While some still have a fetish for reading the author's hyperinflated prose, the rest of us are just gawking in disbelief.Seriously, even after going through the hundreds of 1-star reviews for this book before reading it, I was still surprised at how bad it is. Nothing happens, literally. 800 pages of people talking, thinking, pondering, and scheming without them actually doing anything. Jordan drags out to 800 pages what hundreds of better authors would cover in far less than 100. If you want to get the most out of this book, turn to the last page of chapter 30 and read it. As mentioned by other reviewers, this is the only page that advances the plot.

Jordan needs an editor who isnt his wife.BADLY. Enough already with the whole Perrin whining about his wife being capture. 250 pages of it without ever actually resolving it is MORE than enough. Mat was enjoyable but come on almost a hundred pages and all he basically did was complain that he had to get married. And the Elayne business. Gods she has turned into my worst nightmare. 1. She is stupid. 2. SHe is hormonal 3. She is arrogant and snooty. Do I have to read 200 pages per book about how inept of a ruler she is and how everything is Rands fault (in her eyes) but she still oves him anyway and cant live without him...can I VOMIT now.At least the last book redeemed itself at the end by having something interesting happen. This book doesnt even have that saving grace. The one item that looked like it MIGHT turn interesting just piddled into nothing. I mean FINALLY LOGAIN MEETS RAND...and nothing. Rand yells and Logain tells him to watch out for Taim and Rand says he knows...eh no big deal. I mean here is something that we have been waiting for and it snothing..a toss away. I guess he was too into Elaynes morning sickness to really spend any time on Rand and Logain meeting. A meandering pile of psychobable nonsense. It used to be that Jordan would give his character personality by adding in little quips like \\"Rand always knows how to handle women...he would know what to do\\" Or Nynaeve tugging on her braid.But apparently that isnt enough anymore. Apparently after 250 pages of Perrin whining so much about Faile that I just want her to die so that we can get on with the story Jordan still doesnt think he has gotten across the message that Perrin is a whiny baby who needs someones boot on his back side telling him to grow up and be a man.Everything in the book now is nothing more than reflection of how the characters FEEL about something or what they are THINKING about something. NOTHING HAPPENS.I swear if I have to read one more three page description of what someone is wearing I am gonna pull my hair out. And I am assuming that next book he is really gonna go all out and the intro wind blowing will last a whole chapter maybe. How many things a wind can blow over and bounce off of before he gets on with the story is amazing. I never get enough of it. Please bounce the wind off a few more things next time Jordan its facinating really.The only reason I even read the books anymore is because I want to know what happens in the end.

His last effort is pathetic."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I really can't remember the last time I have been so dissapointed in a fantasy series. The Wheel of Time started off great, got a little convoluted in books 5-6-7, and now seems to be nothing more than a money making machine for the author and publishing house. I know other readers have echoed this sentiment before, but: this entire book could have been summarized in about 50 pages, and I would have enjoyed it MUCH MORE that way.I mean, the main character of the series (Rand) doesn't even appear until the VERY end. Some of the previously &quot;important&quot; characters do not even have a line of dialogue. Lan? Nynaeve? Oh, there's Lan practicing his swordfighting, and Nynaeve sitting on a bench watching... The Forsaken? I think one of them is mentioned and given about 10 pages to work with. The Dark One? Nothing. NOTHING?!?But back to more important things like what type of tea Egwene is drinking today as opposed to yesterday, and how bad her headache is, and what type of clothing her maid has laid out for her to wear this morning, and describing the Ajahs for the thousandth time in excrutiating detail. It's utterly ridiculous. Now there are so many minor characters that he spends 20-30 pages writing about, I have serious trouble just keeping track of who is who. He is trying to write about 5 different stories at once at this point, and as a result NOTHING happens in any of the varous storylines. There are no monumentous events in this book, none. I'm not kidding. No clashing armies, no awesome displays of magic, no huge turn of events at the end. Some interesting things happen the prologue that have nothing to do with the rest of the book. Maybe he put in the prologue to book 11 by mistake? At least half the book is spent describing what each person in the room is wearing, what they are eating and drinking, and what their facial expression is. Why do I care about that stuff? Oh, that's right, I DON'T.And now, sadly, I don't care about this series anymore."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Often times in on-line discussions in which he has participated, in interviews, and in commentaries, Robert Jordan has been asked detailed plot questions by devoted fans (like me) concerned about where the \\"Wheel of Time\\" series is going, or what will happen to one or more of the major characters in books to come.

How much of this stuff is a total rip-off?7. Do any of these characters behave socially in a realistic manner (e.g. like any person you've ever met)?8. Do you REALLY consider people bickering over hierarchy or whose plan is best (not that any are ever chosen) or what men/women are ALL like to be \\"plot advancement\\"?9. Do you find the Forsaken to be even REMOTELY clever OR frightening?10. Do you have any idea what people's plans are? Are we given any substantial insight on Rand's plan to defeat evil, Egwene's plan to get herself stupidly captured, Nynaeve's plan to annoy the enemy into submission, Cadsuane's plan to teach Rand by being rude and beotchy, any of the Forsaken's grand plans, Fain's goals, Lan's interest in a plan to rescue Moiraine, Perrin's plan to do something besides just follow the Shaido, Verin's plans or interests, and soul-enslaved Forsaken's plan to undo said enslavement.....Basically, this book doesn't answer any of these questions in a satisfactory way. We're left not knowing and not really caring about anyone. Consider the big chunk of the text: Elayne being pregnant (as if no one in the history of the world hasn't been???? Why is this so delicate?) and trying to elimiate potential rivals. All she does is meet with young reps of some houses, complain about being knocked up, moon over Rand, and....nothing else. And it takes a million pages.Ditto for Egwene's bumbling. How many pages wasted in many different books on women bickering and trying to control one another, and she ends up doing WHAT at the end? Makes no sense.Finally, ask yourself, WHY BOTHER? Why not move on to fiction that actually makes sense, is populated with realistic, likeable (or at least fear-inspiring) characters, and advances in plot at more than a snail's pace every SIX years!Just quit. Jordan's awful. His editor should not be allowed to edit anything longer than a two-word sentence. Tor should be ashamed of what it produces, and we should all know that the best way to get some hack to end his series is to STOP BUYING HIS CRAPPY BOOKS."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Q: Mr. Jordan, you've come in for a lot a criticism that your current book does not advance on the major development that concluded the last installment. How do answer your critics?RJ: Yes, well, we all know that book 47, The Dragon Relieved, contained a major plot twist -Q: You mean Rand urinating?RJ: That's right. But as an author, you can never just build directly onto a moment of such consequence. I have a duty to the reader to provide full context for how a significant event like this one impacts the world as a whole. Every move that the Dragon Reborn makes has the ability to affect every other character, and in turn, each character's response to the Dragon Reborn's every action is crucial for a full understanding of how his leadership is perceived.Q: Still, a lot of people have pointed out that you could have achieved the same result with a more succinct prologue rather than dedicating an entire novel to such a short span of time. Do you agree?RJ: Certainly not. Perhaps if it had been a shorter piss I may have been able to accommodate such an approach but that would not have been realistic. I must stay true to the world that I have created and Rand did drink a lot of spiced wine -Q: That was back in book 44 if I'm not mistaken?RJ: Um . . . book 43 is where most of the actual imbibing that resulted in this urination took place. Book 44 was dedicated to the uncomfortable feeling that ensued.Q: Ah, yes, I'm terribly sorry.RJ: Perfectly understandable. That was almost 3000 pages ago and much has happened in between so I will forgive your indiscretion . . . once.Q: Yes, well, um . . . you really believe the 17 second time frame was essential then?RJ: Absolutely. When you drink that much liquid in such a short period of time anything less would be unacceptable. And let's not forget that those 17 seconds do not stand by themselves either. The thoughts, feelings, and emotions of the other characters during that 17-second pee are incredibly crucial to the future progression of the story. There are over 1900 major characters that I must account for including 900 soldiers, 500 Aed Sedai, 300 Ash'aman, 100 village councilors, 48 farmers, 37 blacksmiths, 18 millers, 10 brewers, 4 tanners, and a cobbler. I'm actually amazed that I was able to resolve the entire timeframe in just one book. Although, to be fair, if I had to level any criticism against myself it would be the fact that only one cobbler has been elevated to the status of a major character. There are a lot of people walking great distances in The Wheel of Time and it's not entirely accurate to have only one cobbler servicing their footwear.Q: Footwear which incidentally is described in more detail in a WOT companion book entitled \\"Fashions of the Wheel\\" which is published by TOR's Pointless division and is now available for purchase.RJ: That's right. My readers are ever hungry for more details. A lot of descriptions of boots, soles, laces (that sort of thing) that I deemed essential to the main story were removed at the insistence of my publishers. Apparently they would not have been able to print some of the novels as one volume given the current printing/binding technology and thus the companion book was born. I must say that it is a thrilling read, though, and I urge all of my fans to purchase it. It's filled with information that you will not want to miss.Q: Mr. Jordan, back to your earlier comment. I don't believe I've ever heard you offer any self criticism before so as we wrap up, I would like to thank you on behalf of our audience for your honesty.RJ: I said if I had to pick something. It's not specifically a criticism -Q: But you said -RJ: I know what I said! It's just a note really; a minor observation. Expect it to be rectified in later volumes.Q: Well, there you have it ladies and gentlemen. You heard it hear first - Mr. Jordan will be introducing more cobblers into his massively pop . . . um . . . well, massive Wheel of Time saga. I know I can't wait. It should be very interesting. Thank you for your time, Mr. Jordan. Would you like to offer any hints on the upcoming installment to your devoted readers before we say goodbye?RJ: No. Read and find out.Q: I couldn't help but notice (since it comprised 48 chapters) that Elayne drank an awful lot of tea herself in book 37. Might we see that plot line picked up again soon with a similarly exciting outcome as The Dragon Relieved?RJ: RAFO.Q: Yes, well, perhaps that will be expanded upon in a midquel (a term copyrighted by Mr. Jordan to include a book written that takes place between two already completed and supposedly sequential books in a series). I can't thank you enough for you time. Good day."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I am glad I have a library card. I will be renting the rest of the series, and using my existing Hard Cover books for kindling come this winter. I regret the wasted time and money I have already allowed to be sucked from me by Robert Jordan through the black hole which is \\"The Wheel of Time.\\"I found &quot;Crossroads of Twilight&quot; to be like reading what a comatose person must feel. People talk and interact and stuff happens *around* you, but nothing really happens *to* you; you are left with little more than an unorganized blur of gray wash spread across your mind, and hours of your personal life gone into the mist never to return. God, to have those precious hours back. If only it were possible.Mr. Jordan has a degree in quantum physics, so perhaps he can devote himself to finding a way to give back the hours wasted on his pointless series to all of his (ex) fans. That would at least be useful!I also found out that Mr. Jordan (not his real name) writes under 4 pen-names. That explains why his \\"Wheel of Time\\" is taking so long; in between twiddling his thumbs, writing pointless prequels, and being rude to fans at book signings (I've witnessed it first hand), Mr. Jordan is also working on other books - most notably, his Romance Novels full of whiney women, whipped men, and drawn-out pointless storylines. Sound familiar? (Not to mention the fact that he is married to his editor. That explains a lot.)Fair well, Mr. Jordan, or what-ever you want to be called. I'll not give you another penny. I find it shameful that I've already given you so much already.For writing a book where nothing happens and we see the supposedly \\"main character\\" for all of 15 pages, I give this book 1 star. I expect Mr. Jordan to send me a personal \\"thank-you\\" card, as I am being very generous."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Greetings allI used to be a big fan of Robert Jordans work but no more. After putting up with the last few lacklustre books and convincing myself that things would improve my patience finally snapped upon completing Crossroads of Twilight. I don't know how Jordans editor could actually let him release what for me has to rate as the worse piece of literary work I've read in a very long time.Crossroads of Twilight is a book that goes nowhere anytime soon, its more a mismash of plots that don't really add anything new to the overall story. The lack of progression to Jordans epic is truely painful to endure at times and the conclusion to the book is so lacklustre and such a bolt out of the blue that I was left wondering if the other 400 or so pages that contained all the interesting parts of the novel had fallen out of my copy. I'm not sure if I'm old fashioned when it comes to books in the sense that I actually like them to have some semblance of a beggining, middle and end or at least the very slightest hint of a conclusion. Jordans latest novel may yet be one part of a greater story but thats no reason why that individual chapter cannot have its own theme and dare I say its own sense of resolution relative purely to it. For him to have to write a 700 page book after 9 others which does nothing other than to set the stage for another shows a considerable lack of skill on his part. The flaws in Jordans writing are becoming gaping chasms.It is however not just the lack of movement in the overall story that is becoming increasingly infuriating. Jordans characters seem to be regressing rather than developing. While early on in the series they were interesting they now seem extremly 1-dimensional. Their individual character traits have simply ceased to intrigue me, they now just irritate, like the story itself they have become very worn indeed. This is particually evident in Jordans female characters and their seemingly pathological hatred of all things male. While at first this made for interesting byplay between the characters it rapidly lost its lustre after reading almost 8000 pages of it.The plot itself, while stalling in book 10 is now starting to creak under its own weight. In order to justify characters doing things Jordan is having to invent increasingly stupid reasons to push the story in the direction he wants. Primarily this takes the form of characters simply not communicating with each other but its becomes increasingly hard to believe this when most of Jordans main players can instantly travel anywhere in Randland or hold meetings in the world of dreams. In fact one of the original strengths of the Wheel of Time, its level of depth and detail has now become its biggest problem. Jordan has so fleshed out his world and so clearly set the limits for what the characters can do, particually with regards to magic that its hard to understand why the characters make life so difficult for themselves given the resources made available to them.In short all I can say is DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK. Skip it and go right to book 11. The most damning thing I can say is that I've been more entertained reading the negative reviews the book itself has garned than the book itself. One almost wonders wether Jordan is creating a new form of novel where the readers reaction to it will be more eagerly anticipated than the work itself.yours Bennett Oppel"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I think many prior reviews have shared similar criticisms of this book and this series.

In book 10, the heavy-handed Jordan spins prose that provide little character development, little plot development, little suspense, and little action.The book begins with a confusing hundred-page checklist of the goings on of a number of minor characters that Jordan doesn't intend to deal with in Book 10 (and that frankly, seem well-enough forgotten) with little aid from Jordan to the reader on exactly who this character is and what they were supposed to be doing. The reader is lead to feel that, okay, if we're flying this fast through all the characters that I don't remember, it must be because Jordan is saving pages for considerable action once we get into the heart of the book.Unfortunately, the reader is treated instead to a parade of major characters involved in (a) moving or (b) having arrived where they are going, waiting around and wringing their hands in indecision.The actions of the characters during these drawn-out movements and uninteresting decision-making processes add little to our understanding of the characters or their motivations, but rather seem aimed at upholding the increasingly diminutive series status quo through ceaseless repetition. Too many times, we are reminded of &quot;an ageless Aes Sedai smoothing her skirts and putting on an outward mask of calm&quot; or of the fell harbinger of &quot;the dice rattling in Matt's head&quot; or of Perrin &quot;not liking the smell&quot; of something.Crossroads at Twighlight is, quite frankly, drudgery, and if this is the best that Jordan can do, then stop the Wheel, I want to get off!"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"3.5 stars. The events in the beginning of this book, told from Mat, Perrin, and Elayne's perspective, occur simultaneously with the ending scene of the previous book, Winter's Heart. The last several books, beginning with A Crown of Swords, have slowed down time-wise considerably with events occurring a few days to a week after the conclusion of a prior book. Therefore, the plot also slows down, and it is still winter in the WOT world. Probably 2 years since everything unfolded in the first book, The Eye of the World.Now, that said, what did I think of this book? I agree with many others that the plot slows to a crawl in this book. In fact, not much action occurs, not much plot development takes place (of what has been introduced already in the series) in Crossroads of Twilight.However, that doesn't meant there isn't anything going on in this book. There are several plot threads introduced that cause interest and speculation** (**Note: I will discuss this further at the end of the review). As there are only 2 books left, (well, possibly 3 books if the final book is split into 2 volumes, but as B. Sanderson is currently at work on the final book, I can't say for sure), you can be sure that major plot-lines will be tied up in the next book or the final book. I look at the 10th book, Crossroads of Twilight, as the lull before the storm.Everything seems boring and you can't see anything big happening that's obvious, but what new developments *does* occur is behind the scenes. It's subtle, and you have to be patient, as this book provides more clues about various characters. Sure, I love action-filled scenes as much as the next reader, but the political intrigues and twists are a big part of this world and its characters. Depicting such matters can be slow-moving, as all the players have to be set up on the chess board in such a way that will come together at the end.If you've reached this book and haven't realized by now that this was one of Jordan's intentions for this world (that people, even when they *know* the end could be coming, they're still looking out for # 1), well I'm saying it now.LOL. The scheming, changed loyalties, questionable motives, the insular nature of people to mention a few, are all what make this fictional world fascinating to read about. For example, something called \\"The Game of Houses\\" (manipulation, plotting, and scheming of noble houses) is played to a large extent in one country, Cairhien, but to a smaller extent everywhere else as well. Saying one thing, meaning another, all in subtle tones. At one point or another, *every* character in this series has engaged in some form of manipulation and scheming, and hiding of a secret or two. Every character has a secret. Every character is more than he or she appears on the surface.The twists and turns are intentional on the author's part, and in order to get from point A to C, you'll have to navigate the murky waters of point B to get there. That's how I view this book, it's set up and geared toward major stuff going down later on, so that is what I meant when I said this book is like the lull before the storm.A brief summary of where the previous book, Winter's Heart, left off: An incredible feat was struck against the Shadow, with Rand and Nynaeve cleansing the Dark One's taint from saidin and the Forsaken unable to prevent this from happening, slinking away in defeat. Mat sneaks out of Seanchan-controlled Ebou Dar with his group, which includes the kidnapped heir to the Seanchan throne, Tuon (who also happens to be his future wife, not that he's pleased about that!), Perrin is on the rampage to locate his wife Faile held by the Shaido, and Elayne is in Camelyn securing her claim on the Lion Throne.In Crossroads of Twilight most of the chapters are devoted to Perrin, Elayne, Mat, and Egwene with little of Rand (there are brief chapters told from his perspective). Winter's Heart leaves you on a cliff-hanger, after all that happened, you expect Rand to be in the front and center as you learned in Winter's Heart there were Darkfriends in the Black Tower, and that his second-in-command, Taim, in charge of the Black Tower could be a Darkfriend as he ordered Asha'man to kill Rand in book 8, The Path of Daggers. Not to mention, the fact Rand cleansed saidin.With the other characters, Perrin is still searching for Faile, Elayne is still trying to secure the throne of Andor for herself, Egwene is still on the march with her army and trying to figure out how to get control of the White Tower and Tar Valon, and Mat has escaped from Ebou Dar and is hiding out at a traveling circus (this group will be familiar, as Nynaeve & Elayne hid in this group in book 5, Fires of Heaven).**Despite the fact there weren't any forward developments of the plot in each of the character perspectives, I still enjoyed this book. While it's not the best book in the series, there were several plot-lines that caused me to wonder what will happen next. I love figuring out puzzles, trying to understand what the answer to various character motives, basically, what is the agenda or goal here?For instance, a new character is introduced in the prologue chapter (he was given a brief scene in a prior book, but I didn't find importance in this character at the time), and it made me wonder what role he will or might play in the future. Another character seen before, Logain, another false Dragon, is seen planning \\"something\\" and I'm very curious to know where that plot thread will go. One of Rand's generals, Bashere, seems to have something going on the side, a secret that maybe Rand doesn't even know and makes me question his loyalties to Rand when I didn't before. He seemed to be solidly with Rand, but now it seems up in the air how loyal he is to Rand.Those are just a few unanswered questions, new ones that have cropped up, so I don't think this book is the bust that so many are making it out to be. Yes, compared to earlier books (The Shadow Rising or The Fires of Heaven), the book is *very* slow-moving but I do think it was needed. It is the book that sets up what will come in the later books. So while the book can drag in some places, overall I enjoyed the book. One more book to go, Knife of Dreams, and then it's a long wait for the final book to be published!"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"The main problem with this book is that nothing important happened. If I'm not mistaken, this book starts a couple days before book 9 ends, and only a month or so passes. If you haven't read it yet, don't bother. Wait for book 11, and then read book 10 + 11 and something will (probably) happen.Everyone who's read this already knows about how Jordan spends too much time describing everything, so I won't talk about it. I think book 10 was mildly interesting at best the first time I read it, and when I reread the series I skipped almost all of it.I think the main reason I don't like this book is that most of it is spent on Elayne, Perrin, and Egwene, who are boring characters in my opinion. Well, that's not exactly right; the situations they are in are boring. I just can't make myself care about Egwene's power struggles with her insignificant rebel Aes Sedai, or the games between the Andoran houses (I can't remember their names), and Perrin might be interesting if he ever did anything.Another problem with this book is that the main character (as much as there is a main character) isn't mentioned for about the first five hundred pages. Rand literally does NOTHING this whole book.On the other hand, I also really liked the parts about the Seanchan (even the long descriptions of the skull cup), just because I find them interesting. I think Mat is hilarious and the sections with Tuon were awesome.I think that if the book was about two hundred pages longer, there would be far fewer complaints. A lot of things ALMOST happen in this book. This bodes well for book 11, so long as characters aren't ignored.I don't think RJ is totally stupid though, and that makes me worried. He probably had a good reason to end where he did, which makes me afraid that there are hundreds more pages to go before anything worth reading occurs.Book 11 will either resolve a lot of things or it will end up going into totally aggravating digressions. My biggest worry is that Suroth and Semirhage will get a collar on Rand in the next book, and all of the book will be spent on Rand being really upset and trying to break free (AKA Box & Dumai Wells). This would bring nothing new to the story, and I hope Jordan doesn't waste our time with it. I would much prefer it if Arath and Suroth just trip down some stairs and Rand says \\"Well, I guess I'll just come back later when this Daughter of the Nine Moons is around. Maybe I'll go have a chat with Egwene and Elayne.\\""},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"It looks like some fans were dissapointed with this latest Jordan release, but I, a wheel of time fan since the early 90's loved it. The series, which seems to borrow a bit from Tolkien, eastern mythology, and aurthurian legend, is fascinating, well written, and dispite comparison to the above catagories, very original. the character developement is extreme and in depth and if you like the characters the only bad part is it might be half a book before you hear from them again. the first few books of the series were really riviting and after that the pace slowed to a bit of a crawl in later books. this release picks up the pace some, but not to the speed of the original. however the story, in my mind, is still being well developed, and if it does at times try the reader's patience a bit, it always delivers for me. especially with the depth of the main characters. if you dont like certain characters they could become annoying especially with their various repetative habbits, but for me these are very few characters. i think this book is as good as the first few, even though slower paced. i am saddened by the rumor that there will only be a few more books in the series before it is finished but i don't doubt Jordan will continue to do a good job. for those who can't stand the slowness or the depth of some of this series there is plenty else to read in the world, but i for one love this series and recomend it to fantasy fans who like something a little bit more interesting than the typical fantasy deal. i would say the reading level is middle ground, maybe a little higher. well written but not quite the extreme semi-formal linguistic adventure that some such as Tolkien have produced."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I gave this book three stars because it is well written. Many fans would like to see the action that has taken place in previous books, which is sorely lacking in this book. This book focuses on mental warfare rather than physical, and as such it is a well written book. However, this book sets the stage for many events that absolutely must happen in the next book otherwise Mr. Jordan is sure to lose a good number of fans. The other problem is that towards the beginning of the series, books were coming out twice a year, and now they come out every two years. That is a long time to wait, and when people get left hanging at the end of a book they do not want to have to wait two years to continue. By that time most of us have forgotten all of the subtle little plots and twists. I hope that Mr. Jordan plans on writing some sort of review of the previous ten books before releasing an eleventh. One more thing, someone else needs to edit these books prior to publication. I hate stopping midsentence to try to piece together what the author is trying to say."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I've heard a lot of talk how Crossroads of Twilight was no good. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?!? It should be obvious that COT is building toward the last book: Lews Therin had the hundred companions, and now Rand will have the power of a bonded white and black tower behind him for the last battle (not to mention a cleansed saidin). This all building from all the way back in book 6!(4 if you count the Great Sa'angreal) I think people forget that this series isn't like Goodkind's -here's another adventure- format, but like an intricate 10,000 page novel."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"While the book may be slow to some readers, it instead builds the charecters up into real people, rather then some heros, where stuff just &quot;happens&quot; without any explanation why. Good read, and can't wait for the next one"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"It seems most people have written a bad review for this book, I saw things a little bit different so here goes:Firstly, I do agree the lack of closure in the book is a bit aggravating, and some of the details were a bit pointless; although I see good in the first and believe we should expect the second. A person cannot write the perfect book, that is why there are editors, however it seems to me a common known fact that editors tend to forget their jobs when writers become overly popular, allowing a free hand to get tedius.As for a lack of closure, my god how many times is perrin and faile going to be broken up with a miracle rescue to save one of them? I expect no less considering if they kill her off after all these hardships I'd be as aggravated as nearly any of the main characters dying, too many hardships have happened to them for there not to be a happy ending. Not to mention I am certainly hoping it isn't following the recent pattern of heroes dying in the end for a 'good' twist at the end...it's no better then the million stories that had the fantasy ending, atleast we were happy w/a happy ending...I see alot of good in the fact that there is no closure for this reason: I read the 10 books over the last 6 weeks, so the firsts are fresh in my mind, was I the only one bored out of his mind with the first one? However the first one set up for some very heated action and incredible books. Now the 10th seems an awfully lot to me like an EXTREME setup for a rushing ending. Think about just how many small events are coming to a close, ALL at the same time; the 10th book has closed nothing but brought every single event short of the final one to a climax, ready to burst. for those thinking about quitting after this book, you suffered through the setup, might as well try to enjoy the next book or two because I think this story is going to end with a mind tingling bang. The seanchan are looking to leash rand, but the male a'dam allows as much control over the wearer as the wearer has over the man, perrin suddenly might end up with 15,000 trained soldiers to attack the shaido and rescue lady fail, as well as get rid of these nuances(who seem to grow to ten times the number of other aiel everytime I read another page?) padan fain still hasn't been dealt with, as well as several forsaken, the ash'aman are obviously going to erupt much like the white tower did, rand is getting sick everytime he touches the source, is this a sign of a near extreme increase in power perhaps? after all the mighty dragon reborn is only slightly stronger then any other single ash'amon yet lews therin raised a mountain upon his death with saidan?I could go on forever and probably should edit this so you don't have to read so much, but, take it for what it's worth and I hope it gives some a little hope.Over all I thought this book was enjoyable like every other, if a little more tedius with the details. Personally I just like to live the moment in a fantasy world and hope for the best(and of course think up a thousand of my own endings while waiting for the 11th book to come out)Thanks if you read this,Mike"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"In the interval between the publication of Book 9 and 10 in this series, I decided to re-read the entire series. With the time lag between books, I had forgotten some of the details. And I discovered that seemingly insignificant details in earlier books took on new meaning within the context of subsequent books, especially as I've tried to track the cast of darkfriends and Forsaken. I really enjoyed re-reading the earlier books! When reading the most recent addition to the series, I admit to feeling a little disappointed that almost none of the problems introduced and developed in previous volumes have been resolved. For example, will Perrin's search to be reunited with Faille ever end?? He's becoming a little pathetic (though it is a nice change to have a male character so defined by a woman). Will Elayne ever figure out who's who in terms of darkfriends--and will she ever win the throne? What kind of marriage can Mat expect with Tuon (assuming that ever comes off??). But for those who claimed, \\"no action in this volume\\"--how about what's new in Egwene's life? Another small complaint, for those (like me) curious about how Rand had survived his ordeal from Book 9--turn to the 16 pages in Chapter 24 and then to the epilogue (2 pages), and you'll have all the answer that this volume provides. In spite of all this, I think Robert Jordan's prose is enjoyable to read--he still creates vivid images as he's describing the cast of thousands and what they are up to and where they are doing it. If I was new to Robert Jordan and considering reading this series, I'd wait until it's completed (I'm guessing 2007?) and then sit down with all of it..."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I was really suprised at how much I liked this novel after reading many of the posted reviews. Jordan did an excellent job with what he wrote. I found it all interesting and most of it exciting. My only complaints are that he did not deal much with Rand, and he never delevoped the plot of any other character very far. I have to agree with others that the next book is going to be very good. His last two novels are a return to his earlier novels, in that, I am enjoying his novels again.What happens. The prologue seems like it contains hundreds of new plots, but really only a few. Mat and those with him leave Ebou Dar and journey north. Mat and Tuon's relationship begins to grow. Elayne is attempting to secure the throne, although little of the novel deals with her. Egwene has begun her siege of Tar Valon and is forming wrong conclusions about Rand. I think most of the novel actually deals with Perrin and his efforts to rescue his wife. He finds the camp of seventy thousand Shaido where his wife is being held. Logain and Bashere join Rand in Tear.My overall opinion is this is a good novel by itself. If Jordan can get his next novel out in a year, it will be a great novel, because it is a crossroads. The series has gained something that wasn't there before. I am anticipating his next novel again."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Another in a long line of so-so books. they all have moments, I'll give you that. Just enough to keep me coming back for more. I will finish this series. I will! I will! I will! Though sometimes it's like going to your grandmother's house, fun at times but you'd rather not if you dont have too. A new author, Brian S, Pratt of The Unsuspecting Mage gave me what Mr. Jordan has been lacking in the last few of his novels. Action. There's none of this page after page of descriptions, he let's the reader's imagination fill in most of it. Mr. Jordan has lost track of what a reader wants, escapism, excitement, and most of all action! Maybe he should take a lesson from this newcomer and revitalize what was once a great series."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"is the one source really the Energizer bunny? it would seem so. i found myself skimming through many pages of boring drivel trying to get to the next important passage that would represent an advancement of the plot.does RJ read these reviews? i hope so. after 300 pages, the only time i've noticed the source used was to iron the skirts of an aes sedai. how terribly boring. most of the book seems to focus on neurotic women and their power struggles. i'm skipping the next books which will also be about nothing, and i'll buy the conclusion, which will be in about 20 years."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I got turned on to Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series about 7 years ago. At that time the first 6 volumes had already been published so I was able to read them through, one after the other, and was thoroughly hooked. But in the end I finished the 6th book (Lord of Chaos) and then had to wait eagerly like everyone else for book number seven to come out. When at last it did I went out and bought it immediately and dug into it, eager to see what happened next.Had Jordan been on the stock market, his stock would have been high and climbing with all of his first 6 books. But then came number 7 (A Crown of Swords) and his stock took a big drop. A great plot suddenly came to a virtual standstill (\\"glacial movement\\" is what Publishers Weekly calls it). I was disappointed. Almost nothing had happened to move the story ahead, but it did seem that Jordan had set the stage for the next book to make great strides towards the stories conclusion. So again I waited. For 2 years.When The Path of Daggers finally hit the bookstores, I again rushed out to buy the book; convinced that the plot would soar ahead and hold my interest like the earlier books had. I forced myself to read the 591 pages of the book. When I finished I felt cheated. Twice in a row, the plot barely moved. It was obvious that Jordan had stopped writing and was now just selling books. I told myself - and a few others - that I wasn't going to buy or read any more of his books until the final book had been written.But 2 years later when Winter's Heart came out curiosity got the better of me and again I ran out and bought the book. At last it seemed that Robert Jordan had heard the message of his disgruntled fans: a major milestone was reached in the story line and my fictitious Jordan stock rebounded. Jordan was back and I couldn't wait for book ten.I finished book ten, Crossroads of Twilight, a few days ago. I read 672 pages before anything happened: one event in the last 8 pages of the book that leaves you hanging (undoubtedly for another 1 to 2 years). Rand himself, the Dragon Reborn, makes only a few, brief, guest appearances in the book. Nynaeve doesn't enter into the story at all. She is seen once watching her warder sparing with other warders and is mentioned by others in passing. She doesn't appear otherwise and never utters a word.I'm not sure yet whether I should feel cheated again, or just bored."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Somewhere in the middle of Lords of Chaos, George RR Martin, Robin Hobb, Tad Williams and 10 other great writers (13 in total) captured the real Robert Jordan and had him stilled. This made him vomit. Also he started spending a great deal of time in Telawhateverthenameis where his dress kept changing to a low-cut affair that caused him to continually pull on his newly grown braid."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Robert Jordan is still not over the 7th Book Itch. Unlike fellow Charlestonian, Citadel Grad, and author Pat Conroy; RJ is evidently spending too much time walking the beaches of Kiawah and staring at his fish. Absolutely minimal action and no real plot development. I have read all the books in this series, and feel incredibly let down by this lazy apparently last minute effort. To add insult to injury, we are to wait 2+ years for more disappointment? Oh Goody. A tough critique from a loyal fan Mr. Jordan, because we all deserve better than this."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"And maybe worse.Absolutely nothing of interest happens. For hundreds of pages. Just lots of skirt smoothing, and hair fussing. Oh yeah, and there are weevils in the grain.I should stop here. Robert Jordan has used up all of the extra letters out there."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I'm sure there are people out there that will say this book is awe inspiring, ground breaking, essential to the overall storyline and moving!But I'm sure these are the sort of people who sit on park benches for hours and marvel at how ants move up and down a foot path.This book was a total waste of time, I'm sure RJ is sitting back with all the money he made from this laughing at how people would spend money on this book! I'm almost through book 11 as well and I can't see any improvement!The pace is too slow, it takes him 3 chapters to state a simple plot line (which could have been captured in just as much imagination in under 1 page) and then decides that we didn't fully understand the previous 3 chapters and decides to throw in another to make sure we didn't miss anything...I felt like slitting my wrists, at least that would have been more exciting that the dribble in this book.At this rate it will be another 10 books before anything of substance occur - maybe RJ is applying as a screen writer to Days of Our Lives! He is line for getting the job with this sort of stuff..I will wait for a review stating something good has happened in one of his books before I decide to read anything of his again...You can be sure you won't miss anything of significance if you don't read this and the next book."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I started to read this series and I loved it. I liked it up to about book 7 -8 and nine was not that bad but with the tenth one I am very disappointed. It was a whole book of about nothing really that would be considered a book. If Robert Jordan condensed it, it would make a good couple of chapters but to have a whole book devoted to the little amount that happened. I gave it one star because of a few interesting points in the book about the characters but thats it. I have not read the next book and I probable won't until the series is done. The reviews I read for that are less then encouraging. it's sad because Robert Jordan had a great thing with many fans and he is letting most of them down. I really want to find out what happens at the end but I wanted to still like the characters like i did in previous books but according to reviews a lot of the main characters are now intolerable to read. I think I can say this for a lot of people that I am very disappointed in how this great series has become something that people almost dred reading but do to find out what happens. That is not what a book should be like."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I have to say that I am extremely torn. For years, a good friend of mine has been reading the series, waiting the months and sometimes years between volumes in the series, all the while saying how great it was. Finally, I was convinced and started to read the series, having the good fortune of the first 9 books out in paperback and the 10th on the way.What can I say but, WOW!! The series started off great! I count the first 4.5 books among the best I've ever read. However, the slide started in the middle of book 5 for me. I'm not saying that they aren't good, they are still quality books, and I would recommend them, however, by the time we finally reach book 10, books 8 & 9 being almost totally dedicated to plot development, I was ready for more action, and some plot advancement. Needless to say the book fell far short of the mark. I can understand plot developement, and can appreciate most of the detail put into the book, but really, do we need detailed descriptions on every dress in a wardrobe, as well as those left behind?? NO!!!There have been so many plots and subplots and side-plots and extraneous characters and characters introduced soley to be killed off that Mr. Jordan should have no problem finishing the series in two quality, action packed books that hold to the standard that he started the series with.If you read this review, be warned: Book 10 is very SLOW!!! Do not go into this book expecting great action through and through, or you will be sorely disappointed. Keep in mind, however, that this book will become important in the grand scheme of the series, but it is VERY SLOW!Mr. Jordan, PLEASE bring us back to the great writing that you started the series with and finally bring an end to this epic series!"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"like many nostalgic WOT fans, i remember way back when, as a young man, i delved into the depths of the WOT series. Since i've read the first 3 books much has changed. Book 10 is so bland i sometimes forgot i was reading at all. Why can't RJ focus on issues we care about?! Where have the exciting shadowspawn battles gone? Why do we need these (for lack of a better word) STUPID sub-plots? I don't care about the Sun Throne, the Athan' Mierre bargains, or the Kin. I want to hear about Rand, Mat and Perrin, or is it too much to ask for some material about the main characters in a book. In book 10 Mat and Rand dont show up for hundreds of pages! Remember Rand cleansing saidin? remember finishing book 9 and going wow! Guess what? saidin isnt cleansed for 300 or so pages into the book, and even after i didn't hear one character sound happy. And Mat and Tuon?! don't get me started on this fake rushed romance. they fight, they play stones and.....they're married. Just like that. I hate writing angry reviews, cause im normally a mellow guy, but any fan who has invested time into this series should be feeling cheated. Don't buy this book. Instead wait till book 11 comes out, (hopefully by then the bargain with the sea-folk will come to a thrilling meaningful conclusion)then just take em out of the library. PLain and simple RJ just keeps the words rolling, cause more books means more money$$$$$."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"The last five books in this series have strung us along with no real resolution to any of the multitude of conflicts set up in the earlier volumes. They where essentially filler, seminglly written for no other purpose than to pad out a story that didn't need any padding. Finally in Crossroad some of the major issues get resolved. The taint on Sadin and rands lovelife issues. But in doing so Jordan delivers the ultimate slap in the face by having all of this occour between the last book and this one. After slogging through the muck of the previous volumes I finally get to the stuff I wanna hear about and instead I'm told it already occoured and all I get is vauge referenses to it and brief occasional flashbacks. Now that's the ultimate insult. I bought this book against my better judgement and now it turns out my better judgement was correct. Just as a side note, the Wheel of Time was origanally intended to be a six volume series. It should of stayed that way. Everything of consequence from book five to eleven could fit in one book with room to spare."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Robert Jordan probably think that the readers are going to buy his book just because the words &quot;Wheel Of Time&quot; are written on it, because there is no other reason to read this book.HELLO ROBERT! the detailes are very important but where is the story?Maybe the next one will be better ( this one is so bad and it's not going to be a big problem to write a better one) but i don'tsuggest you to spend your time on it , you won't miss anything and you alredy spent enogh time on reding this review."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"After reading it, I wonder if it can be called a book. To me it read like just part of a single chapter.As for the characters, as I read the series, I almost can see the strings that leads from Jordan's hand to each of the them. That makes them feel rather artificial and forced into certain molds."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I read the series from beginning to almost-end in 2007... still waiting for AMoL. I had read the reviews about Crossroads so I figured it would probably crawl.WRONG!This is definitely, without a doubt, less boring than some of the previous books. I know it's hard to believe that from all the negative reviews, but sometimes negative reviews are more about being funny than being honest. And then people get on a bandwagon, and the result is Crossroads getting a bad rap. This book has some really funny reviews here at Amazon, especially early on. I think the initial reviews were negative because they were people who had been waiting on the book. It's different if you're reading the series through, this book falls in nicely with the series and is definitely enjoyable.One of things I do from time to time, throughout the series, is gloss over paragraphs that describe some inconsequential things in great detail. Though, sometimes it really adds to the story, he can really paint a picture of exactly what he's seeing, so it's not always a bad thing. If you're in a hurry, you shouldn't be reading a series anyway.Anyway, again, this book is good. Don't skip it thinking some snippets in reviews will suffice. They don't. You MUST read it, it's seriously a 4-star book or better. The reviews here are funny, but this book is well done and better than some of the others in the series. The middle ones seem more boring and drawn out, but they're not \\"bad\\" either.Anyway, here's some lines from more than 5 years ago:-Well, I've just finished the Prologue chapter and it only took me a little more than a week to do so, and most of that only when I needed something to read while doing my business on the porcelain throne.-Read it only if you have sleeping problems.-But little did I know that nearly 12 years later, I would still be reading the series and now hating it.-I thought I was lucky when I found this book in a thrift store and priced at one dollar. I was wrong. It was overpriced. I want my 5+ hours I spent slogging thru to the end back!-RJ must have contracted Alzheimers because his books have deteriorated horribly. You suck RJ.-Trees died to make the paper for this book. Their sacrifice was in vain.-I wish I hadn't spent my money on this exercise in futility.-That's right folks, this is a 670+ page novel about nothing, and I don't mean this in a good 'Seinfeld' way. TRULY, in this book nothing happens.-I think anyone who gives this book top rating are the absolute die hard fans of Jordan that would give the toilet paper he wipes his but with a 5 star rating.-Why isn't there a zero star rating?-I managed to enjoy this book, and I will teach you the secret. First, borrow it. If you pay even one dollar for this thing, you will feel dirty and used.-get this book if you've run out of valium.-I know its not nice to kick a man when he's down, but RJ really does deserve it.-I actually bought a used, unabridged audio book version so I could \\"read\\" it while I drive. It helps, 'cause when I put down the hardcover, I'm not all that anxious to pick it back up-Glaciers move more quickly than the last five books of this once-promising series.-I'll not be buying any more books in this series, and my advice to anyone considering starting the series is....\\"don't bother\\". In the end it's just a \\"Waste Of Time\\"."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"The Wheel of Time has become the Waste of Time. I have been a complete fan of Jordan's books - waiting breathlessly for them to be released. I intentionally saved this book to read as my reward for completing my graduate degree (and finally having the time to read). Boy was I disappointed. Jordan has taken this story line and made it so convoluted it is practically impossible to follow the plot. The foreward momentum seems to have stopped, and with all of the time bewteen books - you very nearly have to re-read the series just to figure out what is happening.While I will not abandon this series entirely - I will not purchase another book until the series is complete. Then I will wait to see how it ends before deciding to purchase. At least you can read this free from the library - because unless things change - it is unlikely Jordan will get another dollar of my hard-earned money."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"After reading other reviews, I was glad to see that I am not alone in thinking that this book did nothing for me. Robert Jordan has created this amazing world with such compelling characters. But there are so many sub-plots and useless descriptive (fill) narratives that in 600 pages you get maybe 20 pages of real plot advancement for thirty disconnected storylines. There is absolutely no sense of progression in this book, and no real climzx for the volume.This book is nothing more than 600 pages of what everyone is wearing before they got to book eleven.It will be a shame that this epic series may never see an end. The way I see it, either the elderly Jordan will pass on, or I will waiting for the next volume."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I had to force myself to read this book.

I'm not sure. Nothing new happened. Nothing was concluded. We ended up spending ... for a hardback book full of filler.

Howerver this book was a HUGE let down. I'm still trying to figure out how this book adds to the over all story line. I mean nothing happened! there are a few parts that were intersting, such as finding out how Mat will mary the Daughter of the Nine Moons, and Egwene being capured. Other than that the book was lacking of any plot climax what so ever, no wait, it was lacking plot period. I recomend reading it when it comes to your local library and hope the next book will make up for this one."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I have heard that some authors read the Amazon.com customer reviews of their work. I hope Jordan is one of them. I concur with just about everything that appears in the reviews here.I could not read this book. I tried, but didn't get much past the prologue. I was bored to tears. So, I waited a couple of extra months until the audio version was released, and listened to it, instead. I managed to get through it, barely. I wanted to write this review when I was half-way through the book, but thought \\"No, I'll be fair and finish it first.\\" I didn't need to be fair, my suspicions were correct. Nothing happens in this book until the last paragraph. By that time, you're so ticked off that you don't really care. The best thing about this book is its title. Everybody is at a Crossroads, and needs to do something, say something, or go somewhere. But nobody does.Mr. Jordan, please! Two more books only: the first to resolve the multi-party conflict of Aes Sedai, Rand, Seanchan, Whitecloaks, Borderland armies, etc.; and the second to fight the Forsaken and the Dark One.Some reviewers are talking about the great set up for the next book. That's what a prologue is supposed to do, give you some set up for the book you're about to read. Instead we must pay 20-30 bucks for a 700 page prologue for the next novel.Here's a question . . . now that the taint is gone, do the male Forsaken really need to hold onto their allegiance?"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"With Eye of the World, Jordan laid the foundation for an epic fantasy/adventure that I have thouroghly enjoyed- until now. Reading this book is almost painful! I find myself skimming page after page and the only thing I missed was the tedious description of what each sister was wearing. The chapters concerning the females have become especially bad. How many times do we have to hear the same scenarios over and over again? Characters that were once interesting have become flat. Adventures that were once fast-paced have become a stagnant mess! I know Jordan can do better than this. The proof is on my bookshelf. In my opinion, The Shadow Rising and Lord of Chaos is some of the best fantasy fiction ever written, but it's time to bring this series to a long-overdue end. I can only hope that Jordan will write a conclusion worthy of his earlier work. After reading Crossroads of Twilight, though, I have little hope."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I love all the books in the series but vol 10 was boring beyond belief.

Geez, I would never guess it's even the same author."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"People reading this should realize that I used to love Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time. I would spend hours discussing the nuances of the plot with my closest friends, I could quote most of the prophecies, and I wrote my high school senior thesis on the clever ways he links in archetypes of tales of all cultures. I've tried to keep loving this series, even though it's been all downhill since A Crown of Swords. But this book is really the last straw. I didn't buy this book, I borrowed it from a friend, and I'm glad I did. The plot is awful! Slow, boring, and I had to force myself through the inertia to finish reading it. Contrast this with when a new Wheel of Time book came out back in the &quot;good old days&quot; when I would get the book during the day and read it all day and into the night without stopping... The plot touches on each of the major characters, as well as many minor ones, and that's part of the problem. They're practically all separated, and each get just one 3-5 chapter look before we cut away to another character's story, and a few of them are lucky enough to get a second look at the end. If you think that makes for slow story advancement, you are understating. NOTHING HAPPENS IN THIS BOOK! The common thread in the first part of the book is the characters trying to understand what Rand did at the end of the last book (which by the end of the book, it seems that nobody knows what is going on all the same). The same politics continue with scant changes. The same quests meander on with no conclusion. A romance advances a little. That's about it. I will not buy this book, I will not buy the next book, I don't think I will even read the next book. Robert Jordan has either truly just started pumping out books indefinitely for money, or he has entirely lost control of his story. Either way, this series, which I once loved, which once was my favorite, is dead."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Just read the last chapter and you'll be ready for the next book.

This is one of the worst books I have ever read. Mr. Jordan and the publisher should be ashamed of themselves for even sending it to be printed.

In either case I am through reading this story."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I personaly thought books 4,5, and 6 of this series were the worst. This one takes the cake. Out of 800+ pages of writing (paperback), there is probably, and I'm being generous, 100 pages of new stuff. Out of the new stuff there is more excitement watching a snail crawl. Just skip this book in the series and find someone who was silly enough to finish this one they can describe everything that happened with in 5 minutes and prqay to the Dark One that the next book is better. If you don't believe me, go ahead and read it. I hope you enjoy an 800+ page review of what has happened in the last 9 books.To Mr. Robert Jordan,Did you read this after you wrote it? I would've burned it and started over again. Did your imagination have a lapse? There is almost nothing new happening in this book. Just let it go and finish the series.

A lot of the negativity from reviewers started at book 7. I actually loved that book. Sure, it was a step down from book 6 (what might be my favorite in the series), but it was still absolutely superb, and many things happened, and the new pieces of the plot were actually interesting. The Path of Daggers is my 2nd least favorite (even though it contained one of my favorite scenes when Rand lost control and Bashere had to drag him down to get him to heel). Winter's Heart had some heart (pun intended) and gave a small glimpse of the foundation this series was based on (though still not quite the caliber of 1-7), but this tenth book is literature folly. I feel molested by Jordan. I'll finish the series just because I've already dedicated this much time to it, but I am beyond disappointed. Reading the latest books is no longer an enjoyment, but a chore, hoping and praying that the end will be worth it. Still yet, for those who feel the same way, this book really could still be skipped... if you must, read the last 1/4 of the book, as it is the only half-decent (and I say half-decent sparingly) part of the book.Just adding my 2 cents to keep the ratings for this book DOWN. One SMALL star. Read the rest of the negative reviews, as they are much more entertaining than the book."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Soon, night must fall. Hopefully, very soon!This book was so boring, it took me 7 months to read and even when I picked it up, I could only skim it just to get the basic idea and see if anything happens. Unfortunately, nothing happened in this book. It was 672 pages of utter boredom. What a waste of money.Mr. Jordan, finish this series already! By the way, I will never buy one of your books new again. you are no longer worth the money."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I wish there had been an option for no star and I am certainly glad I waited to get this 700 page waste of time from the library rather than buying it. Jordan is going slower and slower in his plot advancement. What am I saying, there is no advancement at all. The only thing happening of note was Egwenes problem at the very end. That's it. The rest of the book discusses hemlines, dress styles, who is jealous of who, and the whole book moves maybe 2 weeks of no one doing anything. I read it, just because I waited 10 weeks to get it available at the library. The only time I have been this let down by hopeful anticipation, was after watching Joe Millionaire. Both a waste of time."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Crossroads of Twilight is somewhat and argubly the weakest part of the series. It was poorly edited - in truth, the book was released one month after the script was completed and lack of revisions and edits. However, there were several purposes:1. Getting the characters together before the storm.2. To tie up some loose ends before heading towards the end.The story is usually divided into 5 parts as to show the main characters story - Perrin, Elayne, Rand, Matt and Egwene. The title alone describes of the legends of the Dark Hunt and its consequences, but then no one was caught in the midst of the realities of the Hunt - being in the dawn and sunset thing.Most of the character stories were still in the hanging - with no significant changes and resolves. The Perrin story arc was the worst of all - he only appears in the first act of the story and one of the last chapters of the book. However, the Elayne story arc was the best of all - she has the resolve thing - an instinct never shown in the other main characters. Since WOT is about Rand and his story, not much is shown of Rand -something that makes the book weak than its previous and excellent Winter's Heart.If for the sake of continuity, well you can get it, otherwise, it's going to be a dull thing to read.[Reviewed by Melvin, from Malaysia]"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I started to read RJ in high school, I finished high school, went to college, got married, had a kid went to grad school and RJ is still not done. You know what I said in 1999 that I was done with the series and I am still glad I gave it up back then."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This book gets two stars because any Robert Jordan book gets two stars automatically. Despite the way events turn in this book, or fail to turn, and despite how the author dwells on particular ideas, and discusses them at great length, Robert Jordan is a smart author: he knows what barley smells like; he knows what people should expect of wildlife; he knows how horses behave; most of all, he knows how men and women behave, both young and old. Jordan is the most believable writer of unbelievable stories I have encountered. I simply have not found more appealing, more accessible, and more humanistic writing. Jordan's writing is often touching, and can be quite moving, but most often it is believable, even though he is writing about an artificial world. Quite simply, I love Jordan's writing.However, you will notice I'm giving this book the lowest possible rating. This book explains to me the often heard Jordan-bashing phrase \\"the later books really suck.\\" I think the other \\"later books,\\" are taking a lot of heat for this book. Winter's Heart was an excellent book: highly moving, great action, and big, important scenes. Winter's Heart is right up there with The Shadow Rising for me. Unfortunately, people are not only extrapolating from Crossroads of Twilight to the rest of the latter trilogy, they are really exaggerating the amount of \\"suckiness.\\" Plainly this book does not suck. It doesn't suck first of all because it's Jordan's work, and secondly it doesn't suck because although it is hard to get through, everything in it happens in the service of the characters and as part of the story. I don't think, as some other reviewers have said, that Jordan made a mistake with this book, or anything of the sort. On the other hand, this is definitely the worst book of the series; a series I love, and not a bad book. That is, it's worst out of the best fantasy books I've read. It's kind of like saying The Hobbit is Tolkien's worst: that doesn't mean you shouldn't read it. Crossroads of Twilight definitely doesn't suck.Now to some specifics: the first two-thirds of this book takes place during the thrilling conclusion of Winter's Heart. Rather than picking things up a few weeks later as he has done in every other book except A Crown of Swords, Jordan backtracked and kept us on the day. This is weird, and has some implications. First of all, as I mentioned, this is not typical Jordan style. Maybe he wanted to do something really different, and maybe the events in Winter's Heart deserved more examination, however it only comes off as strange. I must admit I'm often confused by Jordan's working of details, but I'm not often confused by the sequence of events (except that weird flashback on the Caemlyn Road in The Eye of the World). The biggest implication of this is that Rand is barely in this book. Rand is in one chapter and the epilogue. Since Nynaeve, my favorite character, is with him, she is barely mentioned. Now, true to form, the way she is mentioned is done superbly and fits her perfectly. However, I really like Nynaeve, and I also really like Logain, so I would rather have seen more development of his story line. Nevertheless, I don't want to question the Creator (Jordan) so I will rationalize this treatment by saying that it means something to the bigger picture of the story as a whole. I just hope there's more of these characters in Knife of Dreams.Another implication is that one huge chapter is devoted to the point of view of some totally minor characters, the nobles besieging Caemlyn; I couldn't figure out what this chapter was doing in the book, I just did know where it was going. I thought \\"these people must be Darkfriends or something, this just doesn't fit in otherwise.\\" The other possibility is that their actions are tied in to what Rand did in Caemlyn before Elayne arrived, and I've just forgotten who they were, or what they said at the time they were talking to Rand.Then there's the ending: Mat's story has a big climax in it, although it seems to happen rather quickly, and I couldn't tell if it was really the end. I definitely found this passage moving, however I am wondering how it changes things really. It does bring in more of the denial inherent in the Seanchan, and a few other humanistic factors that Jordan deals with well. Then there's the real ending, the conclusion with Egwene's story line. Egwene's story line is the best rendered in the book, right above that of Mat and Perrin. However, some have claimed this book ends with a whimper, and on the contrary it ends with a cliffhanger. A major twist happens in the siege of Tar Valon, and that's it: the end. There's a short epilogue and we're done.Another implication of the backtracking timing is that none of the male channelers even comment on the cleansing of the source. Rand notices it, as do the Aes Sedai that have bonded some of the Ashaman. However, we see nothing from Logain's point of view, nor even Jahar Narishma, Fager Neald or any other minor Ashaman. The male Forsaken are totally absent. This is almost expected after the beating they took at Shadar Logoth. I found the subtlety of this aspect a bit disappointing: the Ashaman should be jumping up and down and throwing lightning bolts for fun!Now to some good things about this book: Everything really picks up after night falls on the day Rand and Nynaeve cleanse the source. Perrin's storyline contains some very compelling material, and I was really moved by it. As I mentioned, Egwene's story line is very well done, and as she is another favorite of mine, especially her growth as a woman through all her trials, I really enjoyed all the attention she got, after we only saw glimpses of her in Winter's Heart. There is a particularly telling dream sequence with Egwene; always entertaining, but Jordan also reminds us that she is a woman as well as a woman of great importance. This is something that Jordan does really well: beyond all of what the characters do, or their importance in the history of the world, the war against darkness and all that, he always reminds us that they are human. Egwene is a very powerful woman in public, and in private she still wants Gawyn's body, and bad!Another awesome part of this book is seeing Elaida smack the hell out of Alviarin. I started to feel sorry for Elaida at some point; on second thought, I have always felt sorry for Elaida because she's blinded by her vanity. Then Shaidar Haran bats cleanup for Elaida: now that's satisfying. I have been waiting for Alviarin to get smacked from The Shadow Rising. Almost as satisfying as when Shaidar Haran turns the screws on Moghedien. Being evil just doesn't seem to work out for anyone!All in all, you should definitely read this book. You may be disappointed by some of the choices Jordan made, but all artists deal with that at some point. They aren't ever going to please everyone, and they are going to take chances and that has consequences. Not every artist can be Picasso, churning out three Picassos before breakfast. You definitely should not resist reading the entire series just because of this book. If you do that you will be missing out on an entirely good series with hundreds of thousands of words worth of good storytelling. Do not make that mistake, as some reviewers have suggested. To think that you would miss out on The Great Hunt, The Shadow Rising, Lord of Chaos, and Winter's Heart, just because of this book is just ridiculous. Don't do that. Read, and enjoy."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Thick with plot and hope for the next book. It does not have the hack and slash that the average reader looks for in a book but it does a great job of playing the literary anti-climax of Winters Heart. This book takes the series to the next level which no action scene could. It doesn't answer any questions but sets up the next two or three books. If you are into hack and slash then you will not like this book. If you want to stop and find out who is where in the series then you will enjoy this book. Not even if it takes another 14 years for the series to be complete I will get each book on the first day!"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I for one thought it was a good book. It didn't have the action of the other books, but it did continue the story. It may look like not a lot happened, but it was definitly a book to setup for more. It definitly continued in the same style as the other books. (both in the good and not so) but overall, I enjoyed it very much."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I think the key to reading this series (well, in particular the last 4-5 books) is to just read without expections and the desire to see a particular thing happen. Just let yourself be led by the author. It may seem &quot;superfluous&quot;, but some really interesting and vital things happen throughout."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I consider this book to be the worst so far in the series. Robert Jordan could have written what was in this book in about 5 pages but he took 700 pages it to do it. Also one of the main reasons I read this series is because no matter how slow the book is you can always expect something really cool to happen in the last 20 or so pages of the book. That was not the case in Crossroads of Twilight, the last 20 pages were just as boring as the rest of the book. If you have read the every book in this series as I have I'm sure this review won't change your mind but you should at least wait for it to come out in paperback before buying it. Lets hope that Jordan can actully put some action in to book 11."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I must admit I've never read any of the Waste Of Time books and don't intend to. Robert Jordon seems to be an exceptionally cruel, not to mention verbose, writer. To string out his story to 10+ novels in order to fleece his readers and to pad this last book with uneeded and tedious descriptions of clothing/etc. is inexcusable. My sympathies go out to those readers who were hooked early on and who waited patiently for each new release. However, I give the reviews 5 stars. I had nothing to do at work today and reading your reviews kept me smiling for hours. Thanks! I've never been so entertained by reading other folks reviews before. There's quite a dramatic tale here of addiction, and joy, anger, disappointment, despair, and resignation, all told with a liberal dash of humor from multiple perspectives. A tale of a writer who either won't finish his series because it's a cash-cow or because he doesn't know how to bring his ever expanding story to a logical conclusion. So he (desperately?) fills the pages of his latest book with endless description which has nothing to do with the plot. Is he a cruel trickster, or a victim of his own creation? I think Jordan's WOT books have inadvertently created a new and non-linear literary artform: collective criticism. Fun stuff."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Wheel of Time is arguably my favorite series (other than Harry Potter.)

I truly hope to finish this story before I die of old age! I just know I will buy the next book, I'm just too addicted. This book was the most boring yet. All the action happens behind the scenes and no fighting to speak of. Is their a war for the survival of goodness going on or not? Mr. Jordan your fans are begging you to quit milking this series and finish it in the next book.

This was by far the worst book of the series. At least in PoD we had the battle with the Seanchan.I doubt I'll waste the money for another purchase til I am 100% positive that the Last Battle has been fought and decided.RJ needs to get back to his roots and style of the early books.To bad there isn't a no star selection or better yet a negetive selection for the rating."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"The last few reviews hit the nail on the head. Way, way, way too slow. Way too many unneeded details. Volume 10 is more of a 500 page status alert covering a few moments than a novel. It seems the last four books cover about a day or two each.Robert, if you are out there, ignore your editor, we really don't need to be brought up to speed on every character, what they look like, what their affiliation is, etc. in each book. I got to page 350 before any new information was added. Don't worry about new readers. Nobody starts a huge series on volume 10. If they do, tough. Just get on with the story as if it was the next chapter in the book please. Escape fantasy should not be a pain in the butt to read.I am still a huge fan. I got at least 20 people hooked on your series over the years, even people who hate fantasy/sci fi. But let me tell you, this is ridiculous. New readers: beware the epic version of the neverending story. If Jordan can somehow pull this together and end it in book 11, all is well and good. Otherwise the only ones reading this stuff will be the few who got hooked a while back and need to fulfill all of our herculean efforts up to date.Mr. Jordan, keep up the good work, but just get things moving please."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Like many WOT fans, I have followed this series for many years. I still think that books 1-5 are as good as fantasy novels get. However, since book 5, readers have been exposed to endless dribble and nonexistent plot advancement. In this book, readers get to well over 400 pages and realize that the timeline is still at the point where Winter's Heart ended. I've endured all I can. I will not be buying book 11. It has become abundantly clear that Mr. Jordan intends to milk this series for all that it is worth. I don't believe that an end is in sight, unlike some. There are far too many unresolved issues to work through in one or two books. If anyone doubts this, tell me what was resolved in the 680 pages of book 10. What was once one of the most action packed series in the fantasy genre is now unquestionably the genre's biggest dud. The only physical conflict in the first 500 pages occurs between a very minor character (one of Elayne's soldiers) and someone readers don't know. I firmly believe that money is the only concern here. Jordan understands the following that his first 5 masterpieces created. Each book now shots immediately to number one on the bestseller list as soon as it is released. What a huge cash cow!! Jordan has no intention of giving that up by bringing this series to a decent end. Again, look at books 1-5 and tell me that Jordan can't do better than he has since The Fires of Heaven. Obviously he can. He just hasn't cared. Well his poor efforts and lack of plot advancement has caused him to lose one reader, and I think many more will soon follow. If you haven't bought this book, don't. If you are considering the WOT series, I would advise against it, and you can't imagine how it pains me to say that. Still, there are many good fantasy books and series out there, and other writers seem to have the integrity to consider more than there own financial well being."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"All right, enough is enough. Am I the only one who thinks that this last book is just a sad attempt to draw the story out even further? How much longer can this series go on? Let's break the book down. Perrin spends the whole time trying to find his wife and rescue her. Which obviously isn't going to happen any time soon. Mat babysits the Daughter of the Nine Moons and starts to think that maybe he really does want to marry her. Rand doesn't even appear til two-thirds of the way through the book. Nynaeve is casually mentioned once as being a silly girl head over heels. Elayne still isn't crowned Queen, we saw almost no sign of the Forsaken. Egwene plays her games with the Aes Sedai, but at least she appears to be doing something.When I started to read these books, I loved them. The first 6 were filled with action. The 7th started to slow down a bit, but the last three have just dragged on. The only reason I even read this book is because I've put so much time into reading this series that it would be a waste not to. The way it's going though, it'll take another book just to get close to Tarmon Gai'don and another to get through it. I don't even know if I'll bother reading the others. Which is a shame because I really do enjoy the first books. If these last books weren't so filled with description of every tiny detail, maybe something would actually get done."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Didnt we just cleanse the taint?? If you havent read WH, then you arent going to learn from this installment. Arguablely one of the biggest and most important progressions in the entire series, and the story doesnt have one person actually talk about it (except for a brief scene with a single Aes Sedai thinking to herself).I enjoyed the second section with mat. I really wanted Perrin to do something other than learn the wolf smell for a darkhound. and I really wanted to know what anyone, literally anyone! thought about the cleansing. Guess narrative on that little detail would have pushed the more important aspects of the story, like more reflection on the strange pattern in the Hall. Didnt Suian notice already? didn't RJ mention it several times more this time around? And can Egwene do anything anymore besides tell people to 'investigate'? how about some of the new power struggles in the Hall after the decleration of war?Oh well, I never could say no to bad fantasy. C'mon RJ give me some more!!"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Answer: Crossroads of Twilight.What happened Rob? Was it the rack?

WTF? You could very easily just read the final chapter to be prepared for the next book...or not read it at all honestly. The last 4-5 books have descended to Dickensian indirectness without the associated skills as a wordsmith. We get 700+ pages of blathering idiocy, unrealistic (God help him if they're based on someone he knows)women who are all witches with a capital B and no plot progression. Do you remember the cleansing of Saidin? Doesn't seem like any of the characters do. You'd think it would be a pivotal event or something. Egads this book is horrible!I actually wrote a review of this book that wasn't posted because, my guess, of the incessant cursing in it.The first five books are very interesting and well written.

Or the much needed editor has finally lost the battle and Mr. Jordan is now roaming free to leave every word ever typed to the press. Or whatever... Is it too much to ask for ANYTHING to happen in 600 pages? Anything at all? The pathetic \\"too be continued\\" end is on the same level as the Jason movies.

In fact, this installment carries the story timeline only one to two weeks from when Book 9 ended.Because very little time has elapsed from when we last read how Rand and Nynaeve cleansed saidin, you can imagine that not much plot advancement is possible. However, it is within these very few days that significant choices and changes are presented to each of the supporting characters, as alluded to by the book's title. Each person has come to a crossroad in their lives, with twilight suggesting an impending dawn of Light or eternal darkness.This doesn't refute any of the comments that describe how R. Jordan repeats himself on the various cultures and traditions that are already cannon to avid readers. Also, the appearance of several new characters adds more complexity, since the list of major and minor characters is already more than 100 at this point. However, when the series is completed, readers may realzie that CoT is a necessary pause to recoup the storyline and redirect the characters towards the much anticipated finale."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I still love this series, but I have to be honest that this book (#10) is the one that tends to drag on with very little resolution to the major storyline.

I am anxiously waiting the paperback release of Knife of Dreams (Book #11) to continue the journey. And I have every confidence in a satisfying conclusion."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"A fantastic book, spinechillingly surprising in some sections. The story is unfurlling and always keeping the reader in suspense throughout the book. The title, Crossroads of Twilight suggest a turning point in the story and this is apparent later in the book with the book finishing on a dark opressive note. Unfortunatly the book is undone by the lack of plot movement, the characters run around doing things to fill the pages but no result is gained in the story overall. The book is basically a bridge between the 9th book and the 12th book.The story itself is wonderful and the reader soon loses themself in the magesty and depth of the story telling but is brought up short by a rather confusing ,muddled and abrupt ending. As for Rand and Nyneave, I feel that they were delibratly left out of the story to keep the reader hooked untill they can read the next book. Call it addictive marketing stratagy.As for the next book, I eagerly await its pubication. I wish Robert Jorden would hurry up, I really want to know what happens next!!!Its a Bridge between the 9th and 12th book, still a good bridge though and its a must buy for anyone who has been following the Wheel Of Time series.

To them I say stick it out! While it might make for an unsatisfying read for those looking for immediate resolutions, this is the book Jordan needed to write to allign plots and people for the mad dash to the end.While the reviews are correct in saying that nothing monumental happens, that isn't to say that there isn't plot development. The past 2 books really began a consolidation, and I think this books pulls together strings that will be drawn into a knot of excitement for the last two books. Many have complained that Jordan is milking the series for all its worth (and I don't deny that it could have been shorter if done differently, but when all is said and done, would it be as satisfying as this will be?), but I think Jordan does want this to end. I think this should be the final major set up book. Jordan has set this book up so that all his main characters (Rand, Mat, &amp; Perrin at least) should be meeting up in the next book. I think that many/all the major political plot lines will be largely wrapped up in book 11, with book 12 being the final battle.This book essentially is &quot;marking time&quot;, however the things that do happen (the implications of what Egwene does, for both the fight with the White Tower as well as at the last battle, are stunning), the hints given, and thinking through what he has intentionally left untouched (why is Padin Fain mentioned in the glossory? Hmm...think about that one!), has me quivering with anticipation for what comes next."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I think it may have hit us why only a few people get mentioned per book before, he has split up so many story lines that it's not even funny. it's time for him to bring the boys back together, and reduce the differnt story lines again.

I almost want to reread the last 4 books so I can understand a little of what it is I have just read. I have little time or desire to do that however.So in summary, I would suggest it be added to your collection.

Taking place at almost precisely the same time as Rand's epic battle to cleanse saidin of the Dark Lord's taint at Shadar Logoth, we open with Roelde Ituralde finally bringing the Taraboners et al together to strike at the Seanchan. Meanwhile, most of the saidin/saidar aware world can spot the beacon that is Rand miles away that shines throughout most of the novel. As with most times when people relise that they are out of their depths, they ignore it, though we spend a great deal of time with Elayne as she prepares for the twin births of Rand's children whilst negotiating her way through murky Andorian and Windfinder politics with Birgitte and Aviendha at her side. On the other side of the snowy world, Perrin keeps a loose rein on the insane Masema, tracks down the renegade Shaido sept and prepares to infiltrate the camp to rescue his wife, Faile. Over to the East, Mat continues on his travelling circus way with the ever enigmatic Tuon, his potential Seanchan Daughter of he Nine Moons bride. Near Tar Valon, Egwene struggles to deal with the politics of being Amyrlin seat and comes up with several new policies that has the austere Aes Sedai squabbling in a heated senatorial-esque display of petulance - nevertheless, negotiations are opened with the Black Tower. By the end of it all, Rand is still healing up after cleansing saidin, though feeling a trifle sick throughout and at the end Egwene ends up kidnapped.Admittedly, after volume nine this one doesn't particularly go anywhere, but it does set up quite a few new points for the next ones. A world without a tainted saidin should prove very interesting. What makes Jordan such a delight for me is the length of this series. Many times throughout my reading life I have ended an excellent series wishing for more, wanting it not to end. Sometimes the author recognizes this and we get the next generation which tends to fall somewhat short, Eddings being a good example of this. Whilst Jordan may have a dozen different reasons for not ending the series, what it has done (and I cannot fault the series for it is the pioneer), for one reader at least, by keeping the tale rolling (albeit at a snails pace) is keep the magic of the Wheel of Time alive."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Too many complaints about the length and depth of Jordan's series. This book deepens the plot, expands the charachters roles, raises the level of anticipation and suspension. I can't imagine why anyone that has been reading the series would want it to end!?! Yes, many parts seem overly drawn out and Jordan is overly descriptive, but once again, I couldn't put it down. I can't wait for book 11 to come out."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I'm not quite finished with the Crossroads of Twilight, but I think that it may be the best in the series? Why? In the last nine books, Robert Jordan has painstakingly (to say the least) created a very detailed and complex world with a rigid social structure, and protagonists faced with increasingly insurmountable difficulties. In this book, unable to deal with these conflicts by conventional means, they are force to into alliances and strategies which up until now were unheard of the in the old order. Jordan is not interested in easy, facile solutions to plots and subplots that have been superficially handled by other authors. For example, Edgar Rice Burroughs answer to the \\"Lost the girl, get the girl back\\" hackneyed plot is to chase her down, swing into action, single handedly defeat all the enemies and rescue her at the end. Perrin, Rand, and Egwene, are all forced to make unheard of and dangerous decisions as a result of the dilemmas with which they are confronted, and as a result will change the structure of the society they live in forever.Don't sell this book short."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"For just over 26 months, the world waited for the next installment of Jordan's Wheel of Time (WOT) series. The world that Jordan created, fondly named Randland by fans, has enthralled millions of readers including myself from the first page of \\"Eye of the World\\" (ISBN: 0312850093). Now in its tenth volume, the Wheel of Time story continues to expand in its complexity and arduous amounts of frivolous and comical descriptions (i.e., Finely detailed descriptions of every single article of dress!!!).The simple fact is that \\"Crossroads of Twilight\\" exists to lay the foundation for major plot advances promised in future WOT revelations. Nearly two-thirds of the book is spent in individual character reflections of previous happenings in Randland. While these reflections are important, I find the writing to be tedious and often boring. Never upon an initial reading have I felt the desire to skim pages in such an alarming rate!The sad revelation I have in reference to this book is that most of the book easily could have been written in a very short time. As stated, two-thirds of the book deals with previous happenings!!! Jordan is a far superior writer than this, and it is my hope that in the books to come that he will capture the wonder that he had in the development of the first few books in the series.While these facts will not stop true fans from buying this book and suffering through the endless pages of nonsense (including me!), it is my recommendation that if you can wait a bit longer (probably another 24 months!!!) then I would pick up COT off the bargain bin and possibly buy the next installment, which should have considerably more advances in the plots and sub-plots."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Just download a summary instead of reading this book. All the characters just sit around and whine about the cold and how obnoxious men/women are. Right at the end one of the main characters does something totally stupid and out of character, and that's about the only interesting thing. So either download a summary, or skip the first 600 pages. I'm not kidding. You've been warned."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I really only have a couple of things to say. One - if R. Jordan would spend less time detailing the type of spices they add to wine served in worked silver goblets inlaid with ornate jewels, etc, less time detailing the type of clothing worn by the characters, less time mentioning how many women like to \\"smooth their skirts\\" when they were upset, we would probably only have 8 books in the series to this point and they might not have completely lost the potential that they once had.Talk about milking it for every penny. He should be ashamed of himself. Book 10 and we are really no further ahead than we were at the end of book 7. Boring. Boring. Boring!!! Two - the characters are what make the books stand out- Unfortunately, they have become secondary to the desire to have Book 27 in the Wheel of Time."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"The reviews complaining of how tedious and boring the plot development succeeds in being in a book that actually manages to be published are heaping more praise on this book than it deserves.

I'll I can say is that I've purchased and read the hardcover versions of every previous novel in the series despite the fact that book 6 or 7 was the last one I felt was really a fun read. After CoT I sold my RJ books to the local used bookstore and vowed never to buy another RJ book (though I can imagine airport scenarios which would cause me to forsake this). There was a time when I honestly thought he was one of the best fantasy writers out there. Now the best I could say of RJ is that if you are suffering from insomnia or some similar affliction and have already read G.R.R. Martin's books multiple times there are worse authors in the fantasy genre you could waste your time reading."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Here's how this one works. At the end of Book 9, some big stuff happened with Rand (no details in case you haven't read 9). This book is all about what the other characters were doing while Rand was doing his thing in Book 9. Here's the problem: There are about 5 chapters dedicated to what each main character was doing and how they learned about Rand's big day, and 1 dedicated to new action. And none dedicated to folks like the Children of the Light or Morgase. In short NOTHING HAPPENS, not even much politics. It's like a 700 page epiologue for Book 9. We don't even get to find out more about what was going on in Book 10's 95 page preface . . .Very disappointed. Hope George R.R. Martin can avoid this with his series . . ."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I was personally very disappointed by Crossroads of Twilight. It seems increasingly evident that Robert Jordan and his publishers only have a profit in mind when writing this series. There was absolutely nothing of interest in the latest book and I would not recommend this book to anyone. I &quot;was&quot; a diehard Wheel of Time fan, but now I am very disenchanted. For anyone who is interested, George Martin's series is a much better read and it is obvious he cares more for the quality of his work, than the expected profits from who knows how many more sequels Jordan and his money grubbing publishers wish to make."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Robert Jordan will be the end of me. I started this series back in early college when it first came out and loved it. As it matured it got a bit more complex. The last few books have become dreadfully complex.In Crossroads of Twilight I was sure he would have to resolve some of the issues. May be have mat &amp; Perrin join up, Rand and the Ashamen, the Seanchan defeated - something. But nope. While his writing still keeps you very in touch with the character; it does go into so much needless detail. Enough already! We know Mat, Perrin and Rand don't know jack about women! Stop spending a chapter in each book reminding us!I felt the uptick in this book was he spent at least a few minutes with each major character. In the last 3 seemed like he would concentrate on 3 or 4, this one hits all 6-8 pretty well.Unfortunately so many of the names are similar it is now starting to get difficult to follow. (As if it weren't already).Jordan does set up some major changes for the next book, I just hope he actually does so. Last thing I want is book 11 to me more set up and book 12 to sum it all up in the last chapter (see S. King novels).Like a bad relationship. You warn others not to get involved, but once your in you can't seem to break away.Not the best by any means, but better than the last few."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"i was very disappointed with this book. After barely being able to put the earlier books down, this one made me go to sleep. All setup for the next volume, it seams to have been written just to make money. What I mean is that this books only purpose was to make all the fans purchase this book, make Jordan money and make fans wait for years until the book gets back to a decent story line. It seams like an army has been sitting next to the White Tower for 2 years now. All setup."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Two years is a long time to wait to see how much embroidery and lace Matt has come to like on his clothes. \\"Glacial\\" as one review suggests isn't even the word for the pace of the last two books. When RJ (or whoever) actually does advance any story line he does it in less than a paragraph, or, as a teaser. I truly enjoy this series, and if it never concluded that would be fine with me, but lets have a story. Before you buy this one, re-read the other nine, then re-read them again. There will be less time to brood between book 10 and book 11. The rest of us will just have to keep reading the Song of Ice and Fire series to keep ourselves occupied."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Jordan once again amazes me with his attention to detail. tWoT has been going on for such a long time and has spawned so many threads that it reminds me of mouldy bread. If you peer into it you will be amazed at the intricate webs being woven but move your eye and you've lost your place. This is a book that doesn't add much to tWoT epic, it clarifies a few bits and pieces and attempts to tie up some loose ends i.e the Daughter of Nine Moons but in a very ponderous manner. Perhaps tWoT needs some axle grease to speed things up? Let's hope the next book lives up to expectations."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"...to a point.Re: More setup for what is sure to be an excellent conclusion, January 15, 2003 - Reviewer: Ben from St. Bonifacious, MN United StatesIn the grand scheme of the WoT epic, book 10 has it's place as a setup of things to come. But given the long waiting time between books, I can't in good conscience give it any more then a 3 rating. It reads like the first half of a complete book, setup, setup, and more setup, but no resolutions.I wouldn't recommend buying this book until Book 11 comes out (although it is a must read if you plan on continuing your tour of the Wheel of Time). I firmly believe the two books will compliment each other well, or at least that is my hope. However, I think this series is going at least 12, there is much too much going on for it to be resolved in one or even two books. Not at the pace that's been set.Word to the wise - keep a journal! You need one just to keep track of everyone who makes an appearence. When something or other happens to one of the supporting cast (good or bad), those folks are really just names, with no emotional attachment to what happens other then a brief &quot;oh&quot;."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This book was the biggest disappointment I have ever read. After waiting eagerly for this book for so long I am disgusted by how big of a let down this book was.Why?Nothing Happens. Continuing the grand trend shown in the last several books in this series noting happens in this book, no major conflicts, no momentus events, nothing but talk abouty things we already know from previous books. There as so many different characters now, each getting one or 2 chapters devoted to them, that it will take several more books just to get one of them to walk to the grocery store.If you are really into story develpoment and dont mind nothing happening, by all means buy this book. But, if like me you enjoy to read an actual story, not just the setup for another book (which will probably be another setup for the next......), and want something to happen in a book skip this piece of trash!"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"That was the worst book in the series. I sat there hoping that there would be at least one battle, there wasn't a single one. I can summarize the book very easily, Rand cleanses the source and that is all.

Talk about a waste of a book."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I have followed this series since the early times when something was happening. I am still wondering what happened in this volume. The protagonist was again ignored and what looked like some truly great movement from the last volume came to a complete halt. I will continue reading this series unless I die of old age. Consider that the next volume will not be out until 2 to 3 years from now and you will see that the author had better get serious about the movement of the plot or he won't ever finish it."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I'm saying nothing bad about the length of the books or the series. It's just so long winded. It like listening to an old man talking about the old days. You know their might be something good in their but it's full of so much gunk that it's hard to get anything out of it. I've read the whole series so far and I can only remember the 1st book. Adding new storylines and charecters is all fine, but he doesn't finish up the arcs. Theres so much going on that it's easy to get lost and confuse people together. Hopefully this book can regain the charm the series had at first. Maybe because back then it focused on Rand and didn't jump from character to character. I'm hopeing the series ends soon, I'm almost reading now just because I've invested so much time into it already."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I'm a big fa of the series but the lack of action was distracting from the plot."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Don't get me wrong, I love this series, and will continue to read, but, come one!

Robert Jordan writes books on a scale seldom (read as never) seen these days. His characters are fascinating and complex, and his plot lines are seldom formulaic and often surprising. That being said, I was a bit disappointed by this book. When writing with such depth, you have to spend a considerable amount of time on each sub-plot while advancing the central plot as well. The cleansing of Saiden happened in the last book and doesn't end in this one until half way through, so the central plot doesn't advance much, sadly neither do many of the subplots. I wish he had spent half the book on advancing the sub- and main plots of the book, and focused the other half on really taking one plot line forward to (at least some) resolution. I am still preordering the next book. . . but find myself wishing for the simpler times of the first book. Robert, if you are out there it is time to bring these folks back together and tie up some of the dozen odd loose strings, hopefully before the end of the world."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I personally found this book to be a let-down, when compared to the rest of the series. One of the reasons that I like reading this series is because of the great character, and plot developments that is has; he can make me really feel like I'm right there in the story; this book didn't seem to have much of either of those to me.This book lived up to it's title, in that almost every character really did experience some sort of crossroads in their life, some marking point that later in the series you can say &quot;Wow, I know why they did that, it was explained to me in book 10.&quot;. The biggest problem was that, I don't think, it really needed 672 pages to get to those points.The most exciting part of this story in my opinion was when Perrin was dealing with the grain sellers - and that's really as exciting as it sounds.Summery:Some plot and character development - just not much.No real action.Could be a lead into a great finish, or a sign that Robert Jordan has lost interest in the series.I will purchase the last book in the series, even if it is just to finish out my collection.Don't buy this book if you want tons and tons of action and much development, just wait for book 11 (and hope it's better)I will give this book three stars, just because it did advance the plot some, and he did a great job describing everything; I gave book nine (Winters Heart) five stars."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I waited for this book to come out in paperback so that it would look right with all the others from the series that I bought.

Why change a winning formula? It was clear from the feedback from books seven and eight that readers were getting fed up with trawling through over complicated and elongated plots that go nowhere fast. It's us readers that put money in your pocket, so why do our comments get completely ignored? We've made it clear that we've been getting impatient with the series for THREE YEARS!

Virtually all of the key characters end up in the same place they were at the end of book 9, or else a couple hundred miles away, with nothing happening in between. It's boring. Very boring.What other author would ever dream of writing a 700 page book and not bringing the main character in until page 548?? The other characters are ok, don't get me wrong, especially Perrin and Mat. But I'd prefer them to be doing SOMETHING, ANYTHING other than wandering around, scowling, and talking to themselves.

Tor needs to realize that it is profoundly disappointing customers to the degree that, should Mr. Jordan produce another truly interesting work, all of us who were won during the early days of &quot;Wheel of Time&quot; might no longer care.The Times was correct to say that Jordan dominated &quot;the world that Tolkien began to reveal&quot; in the first, truly wonderful novels in this series. Jordan, apparently with Tor's approval, has created a crossroads for himself with Crossroads of Twilight. Travelers who do not know their way will pause at a crossroads and consider their options. Jordan's (and Tor's) options are to give up and go into the twilight, never resolving the story, or to produce a novel worthy of the mantle presented by the Times: publish something as good as _The_Return_of_the_King_.Your readers wait and hope you will succeed."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"What a disappointment this series has become. The first three books were so gripping and fast-paced. Glaciers evidence more action and change than this novel. At the end of the novel, nothing has happened.

Mat is still traveling around with the the Princess of the Nine Moons, still railing against his seemingly fated destiny to have her as his wife. Rand? He is hardly seen at all, but like all the rest does nothing. Guess cleansing the male side of the source plain wore him out. Robert Jordan needs to pick up the pace and draw this series to an end.

And is it just me, or is the misogyny running even more rampant as the books continue? I would hate to think that all women are as smug, manipulative and haughty as Jordan makes them out to be.

I'll do you a favor and write a conclusion in your name.Wind blows. Five new cities are introduced. Elayne has a baby. Rand dies to defeat the enemy. Various people are happy/sad/relieved. They express this through sniffing/braid tugging/pretending not to care/calling him a woolhead. Everyone is wearing clothes (I'll let the reader's imagination fill them in). The Wheel of Time continues to turn/another Age is ushered in (The Age of Fashion Shows/Gender Wars/Detailed Scenery).Gee, forgot to add bits about Perrin, Faile, Nyneave, Egwene, and Mat--well, ok: Perrin saves Faile and they live happily ever after (calling each other names, etc.). Egwene begins to rebuild the Aes Sedai with men and women members--there is unrest, but the start is promising. Nyneave and Lan live happily ever after--maybe they start rebuilding his kingdom together. Mat and Tuon live happily ever after--maybe they outlaw collars (except the one Tuon puts on Mat).Now, that wasn't so hard, was it?Seriously, I like Robert Jordan's writing style, I liked his characters before they became caricatures, I liked his plot when there was one. I'll even read the others when they come out because I AM curious to find out what happens (&amp;amp;quot;His blood on the rocks of Shayol Ghul&amp;amp;quot; (or however you spell it) COULD mean just blood, or Elayne's kid, and maybe some of the more irritating characters will be killed off in the final battle). But, please. Tell us about your main character. Try not to turn any more characters into sad stick drawings of what they were. Stop repeating yourself. Finish ONE plotline. ANY plotline! I'm not picky. Even Deus Ex Machina would suffice at this point. And write out that last scene you know so perfectly--for the sake of your fans. Just in case, because you might get murdered by those same fans before you can finish; even if you don't, it seems increasingly likely that you will die of old age before you wrap up your main plot."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I'm glad to see all the bad reviews for this book.

I've pretty much forgotten anything that has happened in the early books, and now all I remember is how painfully slow things happen. I expect Jordan to die before he finishes the series, leaving everyone hanging. And to make it worse, he releases a prequel to the series before he's even finished it? I refuse to buy any more of his books until (at least) he finishes the series.

Anderson, which is conceivably the worst book ever written."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"After ten years, several readings of each book in the series, and countless hours waiting for each new installment, I am beginning to think the Wheel of Time series is at the crossroads of wasted time! The first few books clipped along at an exciting pace revealing a world of wonders and imagination. However, with the exception of Winter's Heart, the reading the last few books has been the equivalent of grating nails slowly across chalkboard. Nothing happens in CoT except the movement of pieces on Jordan's colossal, intricate chess board of a series.On another note, the quality of the books is abhorrent, and I mean the actual paper, glue, and cardboard physical construction. Hours after purchase, I saw the binding creaking and coming appart. Other books have cracked bindings, and the covers have curves; I don't handle them that much. In addition, there are glaring grammatical errors in the writing: words repeated, the wrong article used, etc. There seemed to be one mistake every 50 pages.If you skip this book, you will not be lost the next."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Sorry to jump on the bandwagon, but Mr.Jordan, please get a new editor! Crossroads of Twilight resolves nothing, adds new characters and complexity to an already overburden story line, and repeats the cycle of endless misery for Rand and his companions. Not even one \\"attaboy\\" for cleansing saidin? Faile no closer to being rescued? Nynaeve and Lan ignored? No change in the siege of the White Tower? If this keeps up, the last book will consist of nothing but the resolution of all the outstanding cliff-hangers! It would be a great benefit to readers to close some of the open story lines and perhaps even provide some long overdue happiness to some of the main characters. The Eye of the World is becoming dull. I pre-ordered this book, but am hoping I can maintain the discipline to wait for the next one to come out in paperback. Less expensive; less disappointment."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I am a first generation WoT fan, having picked up the first book shortly after it was released, and like many of you have hung in there with this series based on the initial superb story telling and truly remarkable characters. However, these books have become increasingly more tiring, more plodding, and more cumbersome. I am now at the point where I find myself deciding if it will even be worth finishing the series. I simply can't take any more meaningless descriptions of clothing, landscape, weather, etc. It all feels like filler. Gone are the amazing battle scenes and incredible action sequences. Gone is the depth of the characters and the real struggles between them. It has turned into an attempt to see how many characters and plot twists can be juggled and it no longer goes anywhere.Someone above said that this book does a nice job of setting up for some action in the next book. I'm sorry, but 700 pages of set-up is weak, especially by Robert Jordan standards. I find myself wondering who he really is as a writer. Is he the genius of the earlier books bogged down in an over-ambitious tale, or is he a writer who lacks vision but managed to write some great works early on?I will probably hang in there til the end, having committed so much time to this series. But, I miss the days of anxiously awaiting the latest Jordan book, hardly able to wait to see what he came up with next. Now I almost dread the latest one as it only seems to bring more boring reading and more going nowhere. It has turned from careful, joyous reading, to hurry-up and finish.Not good - not good at all."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"A shocking disappointment. While Winter's Heart seemed to get the series back on track, this volume moves the plot barely at all. While Glimmers, the prologue available this summer, seemed to presage the lack of any plot development; I hoped it was not to be. However, some 400 pages in to CROSSROADS, when a chapter was spent introducing us to some minor and hitherto unknown Andorian nobles, I realized that my hopes were in vain. Nothing happens, and we learn new or interesting about anyone. The harshest indictment I can make of Crossroads of twilight is that there is no reason to read it. Mr. Jordan said he wanted people to finish his series and say \\"boy that was fun.\\" I wish someone would tell him that at the amusement park, people go to enjoy the rides, not waiting in line for the rides to begin. This book is like waiting in those lines."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I have been a long time Robert Jordan fan, and have eagerly awaited the release of each new book. Like many other readers, I have been sorely disappointed that the Wheel of Time series has ground down to such a slow pace. In the latest book, the Crossroads of Twilight, the pace of the book slowed down to record new lows. I had read previous reviews before I read the book and came in with low expectations. I anticipated that Jordan would do a lot of setup, and not a whole lot of action. Unfortunately, it fell short of even my low expectations.I was shocked to discovery that _nothing_ happens. There is over seven hundred pages and there is not a real plot development anywhere in sight. Instead of listening to the fans clamoring for Jordan to narrow down the story lines so that he could advance the plot, Jordan opens up new story lines with different characters.And despite the long wait, some chapters seemed rushed and surprisingly poorly written. Frankly, I was at a loss to figure out what was going on during the chapters discussing the forces besieging Camelyn. I used to be able to keep all the characters straight, but no longer.I was also deeply frustrated by Jordan's inability to get the point even where there is a plot development. At one point in the book, there is an announcement that the Sisters who were sent out to examine the massive use of saidar have returned to give their report. Jordan indulges in five to ten pages of discussion of the process of seating the various Aes Sedai.In short, this book is only for diehard Robert Jordan fans only. If you are a casual reader of science fiction and fantasy, don't waste your time or money."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"CoT doesn't even deserve one bloody star! I am an outraged fan, insulted and a fool for buying this book. The only thing good about this is, hopefully, RJ will actually decide that enough money is enough and he doesn't have to milk it to death. That and Matt and Tuon. That's about it. Two years for this. Unbelivable. Don't buy it or better yet, write your own ending(s)or put yourself in a cryogenic freeze until 2150 when book number 80 is released, \\"The Absolute Definative Next to the Last Battle. Really. Part IV\\" by Robert Jordan XXII. Detailed findings of geology in relation to Shayol Ghul and the Breaking.

Really."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I was smart enough to stop reading after the 7th book, when I suddenly contracted Narcolepsy and was advised by my doctor to stop reading Robert Jordan. My doctor had several other similiar cases and all were cured by this remedy. So no, I didn't read the book, but I can tell by several other reviews that it is another piece of crap, written solely for the purpose of making money. For a series to start out so great and promising, its downfall has been highly disappointing. It is comparable to the last two Star War's episodes which were also crap put out to make money. I despise authors like Robert Jordan and Piers Anthony who prefer quantity to quality. Unfortunately, I think this disease might be spreading after the similiar downfall of Terry Goodkind's Sword of Truth series.If you want to read exceptional fantasy, read Stephen R Donaldson or George R R Martin, if you like books that appeal to 10 year olds, keep reading Jordan."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"WHAT WAS ROBERT JORDAN THINKING?Thanks for wasting my time, Mr. Jordan. For all the pages you could have at least advanced the plot."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Years ago this was said to be a 10 book series. I entered the picture when book five was just written. I found the books to be of the highest quality, but I found that waiting a year and a half for each book difficult. I couldn't remember all of the details. So after reading book seven I decided to wait and purchase all of the ten books and then reread them. Now it appears that Mr. Jordan is not limiting the series to ten books. I am dismayed. Am I supposed to purchase an unlimited number of books before the story is told? I think not!"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Yes, the book sucked. The last few books were equally disappointing. Yet, I did pre-order the next book. Forgive me. I'm weak."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Everyone else has expounded on it to no end, but I'd like a bit of tooth tossing myself. How both, or even one, the author and publisher, decide that any of the books 7-10(being kind, because 5 got iffy, and 6 was the real downhill start) were printable is beyond me.Use to be it was something as simple as Nyenave(sp) tugging on her darn braid 50 times a chapter that got me steamed. Now it's main plots that have me fixin to burn Jordan himself with some balefire. Maybe if I use a light touch, we can drag him back to book 6 again, and see of the daggers are more than just a title, and perhaps the thrusts of a great book.After all tht ridiculous houey about cleansing Saidin, stupid bowl of winds, daughter of the 37 million moons, what more do we know? Rand still can barely hold the source, and everyone else is just about 3 baby steps further down the plot than 3-4 books ago. Add to that the 3 damn years between books, and even I, a 'used to be' great follower of the series, can no longer keep track of who is doing what.What does the stupid review say? Publisher's saying how great it is to have new characters...?!?! Give me a break! Let's kill off some of this main cast, boil some blood, consolidate the plot, KILL of EVERY main character that has a name the least bit similar to another main character!!!! , argh!I've always been someone who wants to buy a book, have and to hold, build my library, re-read, et cetra! However, unless some freak event occurs where RJ releases a 2k page novel to bring it all back in line, which I would actually read if he was able to get it together again, it's library rental or bust for me from now on.So, forgive me everyone who I recommended this series so highly too 7 years ago, but trust that I'm suffering along with you, as I can't quite let go, but I can darn sure endeavor to keep my coins from furthering this sadistic, and very scarey to say, L.Ron Hubbard like, never ending string of worsening tangling of words... I'm sorry."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I have been absolutely glued to the entire series until book 10.Books 1-9, I give 5 stars each, but book 10, Robert seems to have written while on vacation. His mind was out to lunch. I think this is a case of author getting too greedy. The series was originally only supposed to be 6 books. He seems to want to milk this series for all it's worth, and this time he went completely overboard. The only remotely exciting thing that happens in this book occures in about 2 sentences, within 2 pages from the end of the book. If he doesn't come up with an absolutely spectacular book 11, I will be forced to abandon the series for lack of interest. I have been reading Sci-Fi for 40 years, and this comes close to the worst read ever, for an advanced series book!"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"The previous reviewer beat me to the punch by asking: \\"Why was this book written?\\" In the end, it seems like one of two things must be true: Mr Jordan has no more of an idea where his characters are going than they do - or he's milking it. Maybe both are true. I would have been happier to give Mr. Jordan another year to get something done properly, than to see this done. (Those professional reviewers who gave it such glowing reviews were paid too much, at any price.) He's had a wonderful thing going here, and I think he's ruining it.Not only did the book leave the reader in just about the same place as where he/she started (in 680 pages, ) but there was technical (editorial) problems all the way through it: it was obvious the published/editor did not do THEIR job. There was remnants of sentance changes, duplicated words, missing words, words out of position in the sentance, and entire sentances that seemed totally disconnected from the paragraphs they were in. I suspect Mr. Jordan's draft was simply published without edit. HE is allowed errors - his publisher is NOT.This book started with a PROLOGUE, filled with characters and plots that lasted a full 94 PAGES... uhuh... you are 94 pages into the book before you get to chapter 1! In that prologue - called \\"Glimmers Of The Patern,\\" you are given hints that something serious is going to happen in the book. 'The Wolf' has plans, and plans within plans...' and so on... But I can't see that any of those glimmers actually went anywhere in the book. You are introduced to a few new characters who - as far as I can see - never showed up again. Anywhere. Nor did the plans. Perhaps they'll show up in book 11 - but how can anyone remember that and pull it all together! This 94 page book-within-a-book even left me confused about those things I thought I did remember, from book 9.The main character - Rand - the so-called \\"Dragon Reborn\\" - the guy around whom this entire story is supposed to be centered.. had maybe 40 pages of the entire book (give or take a bit.) In those pages he seemed sometimes weak, sometimes angry, a bit indecisive and questioning. This is a man who just reshaped one of the primary energies of the world, to save the male users of 'the Source' from going mad. But he's still talking to a dead man in his head, and questioning his own sanity. At the end of this book, no one else actually seems certain that he's accomplished what he claimed. Every man would certainly know it! The Aes Sedai investigated the area where that great power was used, but then seemed to discount him as the source of it. Well, don't you think the major event of book nine should have had something more than a few casual comments in book ten?At the end of book 9, Faile was kidnapped; in book ten, she's still captive. Elayne is still trying to become Queen. She is spending her time \\"Traveling\\" to small villages to get support, while an army of contenders beseiges her city in an attempt to take the thrown away from her... and while she can't use her power to get the thrown, she can use it to Travel and bring food into the city to thwart the seige... (Guess I missed something there.) Egwene is still battling the White Tower - and she has mysterious plans too - but we never see them: At the end of Book 10, she's captive too. The Seanchen settlers are moving across the land and - gee - it seems they aren't so bad after all; most people are justing going back to business and seem content. Matt still plans to get married to a Seanchen princess-type.. after a hundred pages or so, his bride-to-be actually complimented him by pinning on one of his flowery gifts - a real achievement there. But at the end of book nine, he'd kidnapped this 'princess' and needed to escape; at the end of book ten, he still held her and still needed to escape...At the end of book nine, I thought we were moving toward a conclusion to this story. At the end of book ten, I feel we're further away from a conclusion than we were before.Let's put things into perspective. Mr. Jordan's writing has changed as each book has come out. Each has gotten slower, more descriptive, more drawn out. Until now, each book centered on a specific, critical event which could be seen as being important to the \\"final battle.\\" This book managed to avoid even the obvious topics any reader could have expected to find. If Mr. Jordan had been writing about these same events with the lively style of book one, this book would have been (maybe) 50 pages. His style has evolved from a lively, fantasy-style story teller into something closer to a classical Russian author - with descriptive text, detail and a pace of events beyond that of \\"War and Peace.\\" I think he's gotten too wrapped up in WHAT he's writing, and has forgotten WHO he's writing for.If I LIVE long enough to see book 11, I'll just buy a used copy - I'm sure there will be plenty of them, in great shape.My advice - WAIT FOR BOOK 11. If Mr. Jordan manages to pull all this stuff together in a meaningful way in book 11, buy them both and read them at the same time. It's the only way you'll remember all this stuff and the only way this stuff will have any value to you."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"With book 9 being such a disappointment and not progressing the storyline, I had high hopes that book 10 would get back to resolving some of the ongoing plots. I was very disappointed after reading this book, however. There are too many plots now and NOTHING seems to progress. You're bounced back and forth between them all and it's not until you reach the end of the book that you realize that nothing has been resolved."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Robert jordan, for the last several books in his Wheel of Time series, seems to be writing little more then filler. Very good filler, but filler just the same. Like so many others, I went out and bought it, and will probably go out and buy the next one. As said by several other brave souls who have reviewed this book, the plot doesn't seem to move as far forward as its size might imply.One major reason I picked up the book was to discover what had happened Nyneave and Rand after they cleansed Saidin. You find out only that they are both alive, very little else.In addition the other subplots, including the one involving Perrin's attempts to save his wife Faile from the clutches of the Shaido, and Mat trying to escape Seanchan controled lands, have yet to find any sort of resolution. Egwene leading the armies against the forces of Tar Valon, ended the novel in a rather unexpected, but no less maddening twist.However, there were some very good parts of the book as well. I quite enjoyed Elayne's continuing fight to claim the throne of Andor. I look forward to the next installment to see how that plotline terns out.Hopefully soon there will be some resolution to some of the plotlines."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Simply put, more exciting events take place in the prologue thatn the rest of the novel.After ten installments, it is easy to take a look back at the series. The first four novels could be said to follow the pattern laid out by Tolkien. The same old story of ordinary people in extraordinary circumstances undergoing terrific trials to save the world from nearly invincible evil forces. But who cared if the formula was rehased Tolkien? The books were EXCITING. I remember staying up until my eyes closed of their own accord just to finish one more chapter. We fell in love with the main characters and were on the edge of our seats waiting to see what trials awaited around the next corner.Now it's different. Now all the immediacy is gone. All the characters seem to sit around waiting for the last battle to come to them. We have gone from a race against time, to a race against boredom. To make matters worse, Mr. Jordan's writing speed seems to echo the pace of his novels. Instead of one action packed rollercoaster ride every year, we are forced to wait two and sometimes three years for the next installment.The other main attribute of the first four novels I loved dearly was the detail. Jordan was able to paint a complete picture of people places and events in my mind. It was almost like I could see exactly what he was thinking as he laid the words on paper.Unfortunately this amount of detail has now backfired on us. For example, in this latest installment, Perrin's secretary Balwer tells Perrin he has something important to say. We are then forced to read four pages describing how Perrin's camp is laid out before we find out what is so important. Is this completely necessary? And the list of characters has grown so large, that even afer reading the same installment multiple times, I can scarcely keep everyone straight. I would love for someone to actually sit down and count the number of Aes Sedia named and intricately described throught the course of this story. Are they all necessary? I think not.I have personally waited over a decade and spent hundred of dollars to find out what happens at the end. And if the sytle of the first books carried over to the rest, I would dread the ending of the story. But Crossroads of Twilight was the last straw. I am no longer the WoT fan I used to be. Oh, I will still read future installments, but only to justify the time I have previously spent on this series, and not for love of a captivating story."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Nine YEARS ago I stopped reading the \\"Wheel of time\\" series because I was getting seriously annoyed about the time it took Jordan to finish this work.

There is a lot of fluff that is totally pointless except to waste paper."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Is it bad that I now keep a highlighter in my hand as I read the WoT books? I go through and highlight every time someone gets their coat, cloak, shawl, dress, skirts, or stole described, is tall for a Cairhienen, is short for an Aiel, fingers their weapon, or adjusts anything. No joke, in one of the books one of the characters stops herself in mid-thought to ask herself \\"Who cares about dresses?\\" Even better than describing someone's coat, I just read a passage where he said someone wasn't wearing a coat! Hardly a page goes by that I don't have a passage to highlight. I'm actually re-reading the series just to see if it's really as bad as I've complained...and it looks like it is. I hear 11 is good. I sure hope so."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I will try not to restate what so many others have typed about this book. They are pretty much correct when they state that other than Egwene's capture and some semi-entertaining lines of dialouge between Tuon and Mat, nothing of any consequence happens in this book at all. That, and Egwene's capture was so disingenious that its head-shakingly silly (yes I invented a word) :)Even Path of Daggers (which was almost as bad of a read at first) made more sense after Winter's Heart came out. What was apparent there was that both PoD and WH should have been one book, although PoD still would only rate two stars even if it hadn't left out Mat. This book served no purpose but to get the publishers off of Jordan's back and I write this after having read Knife of Dreams. One really could skip straight from WH to KoD with barely a pause for anything missed.In short, its an utter waste of time and some unfortunate tree's life. Skip this one if you value your time, or your sanity. :)"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Well after reading the 10th installment of WOT, it is time to rebel: let's stop buying the wheel of time series.

You could take the last three books (including this one), get rid of a 1000+ pages of fluff (Crossroads is 90% fluff and 10% content in my opinon) and have a book at the caliber of the originals.

How is it there are more characters added with each book, but the number of pages seems to be decreasing (I have not actually checked this, just a feeling).My next dissapoint came when I quickly scanned the book to see who all was in it (something I can't stop myself from doing). Mat get's his piece, a little for Perrin, a bit of Elayne, don't forget Egwene, and oh yeah Rand. Throw in a couple of chapters of the bad guys, and wrap it all up with a quick finish in the last hundred pages. This did not bode well for any real development. (plus I had read the editorial review by this point and was not optimistic)Next I find that we have actually taken a step backwards from Winter's Heart, and get to progress with each character through the ending of the last book. Grrrreat...Finally, by the time I finally reached Rand's part somewhere in the late four hundreds early fives (I don't have the book here to verify, cut me some slack)I was sick of it. By this point all the nasty reviews where up. All the RJ fans swearing to never buy or read him again. I was ready to light my torch and join in with the lynching...But then I pushed on and started in on the last section. And suddenly I found myself unable to put it down. Could it be that RJ could still keep me up reading when I needed to be sleeping?So as I finally closed the book I found that I was strangely satisfied. There I said it, I enjoyed the book. That does not mean I don't still wish he had actually went a little farther with this book. He has really set up the next book.

The book starts with Perrin going after the Aiel who have his wife, and ends the same way. Its that way with pretty much everything in this book. I still am looking forward to the next book. At least this is much better than what has happened for me with many other series I have started, and just left by authors such as Goodkind, Rosenberg, Modesitt...

All of the plots of equal importance while Rand's story has taken something of the back seat for the time being. If you will recall, during many of the other books, it has mentioned that without all of his friends stuggling through their own individual hardships, he will fail. Rand has always been a main character, more of a central character than the rest, but never THE main character. Although this book is quite tedious, there is still much of the neverending political intrigue which has been prevelant in Jordans writing since the begining. I enjoyed the book, but am begining to wonder if much of the unnecessary fluff was put in to help Mr. Jordan's growing addiction to the almighty dollar."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"For the first 6-7 books of this series, I was mesmerized, enthralled, riveted, and enchanted. Robert Jordan has created a world which feels real, has its own mythology and culture, and manages to bring the reader in so that they feel like a part of this world, rather than leaving them feeling mystified. Unfortunately, by about book 8 or 9, it starts to feel like we've stayed a little too long at this party... and book 10 is just more of the same. If you're looking for something huge or exciting to happen... go back to book 6. Don't read this one. I will continue to read this series to the end, just because I have invested so much time in the first part of the series... but I don't have to like it. Too much politics, too much yapping, not enough cool things happening.

Too bad becauseI did enjoy the first few books of the series.This looks like one of those series where, if you read the first book, and the last book, you get the entire story.I browsed the book at the bookstore and decided not to buy it."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Usually i can read for hours on end....but with this book i just get bored. I don't care whats happening with Elayne or Perrin. Yet I read about Perrin worrying about his wife and Elayne taking a bath for pages and pages.All I want to read about is Mat and Rand. I find myself looking through the pages ahead to see how long there is until i get to the good stuff. The book needs more excitement."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I once loved Wheel of Time. But around book 6 or 7, it became clear that Jordan has stopped telling a story. I haven't bothered to read more than the (90 page!) prologue of this one and leaf through the rest... bookstores are good for browsing. From the many angry reviews here, I can see that book 10 does not restart the story any more than book 8 or 9 did. So - if you MUST read it, wait for a used paperback copy to show up. I'm going to skip the next ten WoT books."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"The biggest disappointment in WOT series. If you have not read it, then don't.If you still want to read it then go to a book store, read the last flap and that's just what the whole book is about.Nothing happens here, the characters just go on musing, thinking and Jorden goes on descibing the weather.It was the first book of the series in which I skipped pages after pages then got bored even doing that and just read the last chapter to know if anything happens. It doesn't.The book is like an illogical movie you are watching and wondering how did this happen, how did that happen? The earlier well built characters start behaving \\"uncharacterstically\\", including Rand..... I have learned one thing by this book. I will not buy the 11th book without reading the reviews."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Yawn!!! Will this series ever get to the ending. I have honestly gotten very tired of the never ending story concept. I will not be reading any more of the series until all of the books are out, and even then I may just skip to the last one just to make sure it actually ends."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"As mentioned by previous reviewers this book really drags and only the memory of the first books and hopes that maybe the next chapter will be better keep the dedicated reader slugging it out in the trenches. To make matters worse, not only is the plot slow, you are constantly slowed in the actual reading of the book by the multitude of proof errors. Very frustrating."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Please tell me if someone out there really believes that Mr. Robert Jordon does not have the whole manuscript in triplicate snug at home... I did enjoy these books, however I am about fed up with the 2-3 year gap between books! Almost half the series goes nowhere! Yes this is important info., yes I need to know this. Great. Why couldn't they put two of those go nowhere books together. I guess they wouldn't get 20 bucks a pop from all of us suckers who wait anxiously in hopes of not being disapointed, yet again. I find myself struggling to rember the last books and ambigious references to events in them. Normally I would re-read the series, but I find myself wondering why I would possibly want to waste the time when I could go read Anne Mcaffrey or someone else. I did enjoy this series in the begining, now it's a matter of seeing this thing through to the end... I hope that will change!!"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I am truly getting very discouraged by this whole series. I spent half the year rereading this series in the hopes that something will finally happen. And nothing did! The synopsis on the cover sheet does a better job of telling what happens without having to read through 680 pages of fluff! I think Mr. Jordan needs to get back to the early books where he wasn't afraid to kill a few people. He keeps introducing characters but none of them ever go away and each successive books has to tell what happened with these other characters. I refuse to read the rest of the series until I know for sure the series is over"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"After a LONG wait, I was very excited when I received my new book - Crossroads of Twilight. The last 9 books kept me spellbound with the story that so many have followed. I read on and nothing happened. Maybe I'm just spoiled. I was used to each book having Giant discoveries and battles with climactic endings. This book took it's readers nowhere. Nothing happened to help the good guys triumph, the bad guys did nothing either. All it does is lead us into the next book. The climax? I don't remember there being one. Do not waste your money unless you just want to follow the story. Even then, wait for paperback!!!"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"These reviews pretty much reflect my opinion as well. There were way too many times he jumped to the point of view of characters that nobody even cares about, then to top it off doesn't develop the the theme. There is absolutley no plot progression. Nothing about the cleansing of saidin, or anyone even realizing it's been done. Rand has a whole 10 pages. Mat gets a whole 30 miles from Ebou Dar &amp; Perrin gets no closer to Faile. The women are still brainless twits. The biggest thing that happened to Elayne was a bath, &amp; Egwene hasn't even begun a seige on Tar Valon. Basically this seems as an attempt to make a little more money without producing anything of quality. The descriptions about things nobody cares about comprises about 90% of the book, there is no action, there is noplot advancement. I've got to say I'm ready to start waiting for my library to carry these books. They've been going downhill for 5 years now &amp; this may be the straw that broke the camels back!"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"As I turned page after page, I kept thinking, &quot;Ok, it's a slow, building intro, it'll get good soon.&quot; Imagine my surprise when I turned a page and I was suddenly at the back cardboard binding! Actually, that particular page had more texture than the other 600."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Just what i needed another wheel of time book that goes nowhere and goes there very slowly. What a complete waste of my time to have read this book. I will save you the trouble of reading it by saying you will know no more at the end then you do now."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Unless you are totally masachist skip this book and wait for book 11. Nothing, absolutly, nothing happens in this book that you will even notice if you dont read it. I assume there was a reason for Jordan to write a book contianing no additional plot or events but have not yet been able to deduce why. The fact that it took him over 2 years to write 700 pages where you basically learn where people were at the time of Rands cleansing of the taint is very depressing. The entire book could have and should have been one chapter in book number 11. Very Sad, almost like Jordan is now on cruise control."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Book 10, as many other reviews have state, goes nowhere. There is little or no forward movement. Maybe this book is meant to be a turning point, however, I found that with all of the conspiricies, plot points and characterizations, there seems to be too much going on to take it all into account when trying to finally tie up this book. I am willing to bet that 1/2 of the content that was discussed in this book will not be utilized in the coming novels.The story is a good one, but almost 700 pages without any significant action does not make a good read. I read it in two days because I skipped over many paragraphs. There is only so many times, you need to hear about a particular trait of a character. Robert Jordan uses far too many characters and spends too much time on developing them instead of focusing on the main characters. It was dissapointing and I am probably not going to buy any more of his novels.If he reads these comments, he needs to really get out of his ditch and start putting this great story to good use. I didn't love the book, I didn't even like it. The only reason I read it was to find out if anything happens at the end to make it worth it, like the end of Book 9. I was dissapointed."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This series is the equivalent of watching paint dry. I would also give books six through whatever minus five stars. Quit wasting time and money and read A Song of Fire and Ice."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Buy this one at your library's used book sale. Don't spend more than a buck. That's all it's worth."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"For another fantasy series, this book would be a great offering. For The Wheel of Time, it's not. Jordan seems to have switched away from the fast paced action oriented bent of the first several novels, in favor of a slower style, marked by political intrigue. There's nothing wrong with this per se, it's just frustrating when compared to the earlier novels.Jordan spends a lot of time telling us what the characters are thinking and how they're feeling. Far less time is devoted to what they're doing. As a result, nothing really happens in the novel: Mat is still fleeing Ebou Dar, Perrin's quest continues and the White Tower is still rent. Nevertheless, there are some intriguing hints that may portend momentous happenings in future novels. Among them are the reunion of the White Tower and the reunion of the ancient Aes Sedai.However, despite those hints, \\"Crossroads of Twilight\\" too often seems like filler. The ending is suspenseful, but after almost 700 pages, the reader is left wondering why it took so long to get to the point."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I'm torn. I'm one of the readers who have made a 10-year committment to this series. I understand that Jordan, one of the most talented writers to come out of fantasy in a long time, needs to put the characters in certain places, is all of this excruciating detail absolutely necessary? I mean, the plot has to advance here at some point. Some editing is definitely necessary.That being said, I'm really enjoying some of the psychology going on here. I like how each little group is trying to deal with the massive emanations of the One Power. I also like the plotlines of Perrin and Mat. That being said, I don't know exactly how necessary it is to tell me every time what Egwyne's choices of dresses are today. I'd probably give it two and a half stars, if I could."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I've been reading Mr. Jordan's books since day one and I can't believe that the author who wrote the first four books wrote this one.Not one single thing was accomplished in this book except to increase the publishers coffers. When I closed the back cover I wondered why I had waited two years to read it. Mr. Jordan automatically gets a two stars due to the richness of his world. Resolving nothing with his plotlines plus adding a cliffhanger at the end just increased my frustration with the direction this series has been going in.If this was Jordan's first book, I would have never have continued reading the series."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I really, really, REALLY wanted to like this book and desperately hoped some of the previous plot lines would be resolved. Alas, this is not to be and we the fans have been milked out of 20 more dollars and two years of our lives. Given enough time, a monkey in front of a typewriter will by sheer chance reproduce one of Shakespear's great works and that is what I'm reminded of here, although what we're getting is certainly not Shakespear quality."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I WAS a die hard Robert Jordan fan. His first four books in the Wheel of Time series were masterpieces: great writing, thought out story arc, new ideas in the science fiction/fantasy realm, foreshadowing everywhere. I remember the anticipation before a new book in the series came out, to see what was going to happen next.Now I do not care any more. Starting with books 5 and 6, things started slipping. As the series became widely popular, the editing went by the wayside. Endless new characters, new plot threads, no conclusions to old plot threads, major milestones just suddenly happening in the last chapter of the books, seeming to be tacked on just to have something happen.This series started out to be a masterpiece, now, its a sad legacy to what might have been. Aren't the folks at Tor taking notice?"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Its sad that the end of a story is all twilight and fizzle, the first books and story was engrossing and whetted my mind. The need to end this saga by either starting four new books with the main players or just finishing the damn story and let the story end. I feel the author will die and we will never end this \\"wheel\\", but by the way he responds, maybe he is dead."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This is the worst of all the Wheel of Time books I have ever read and doesn't deserve to be published. Is Jordan or the Publisher after our money now, as the book was full of nothing, no story, no content, nothing, even the main character held 1 chapter at most to be honest? Jordan cannot be compared to Tolkien, as he was able to condense pages into words, and limit story lines and characters to keep the reader interested.Well, thats my moan about the book complete."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"700 pages, thousands upon thousands of words, numerous characters, and various plots all get summed up nicely in this title.The book we have waited two years for was a dissappointment. To sum it up, nothing happens. The main story was not advanced in the slightest, it seemes that Jordan decided to use this book to let us know that he could milk this series for as much money as he wanted, and we would still buy into it no matter how mediocre it is getting.Sub plots were tied up, characters with little play in previous books get much more time on stage, yet... the book advances the storyline perhaps a week.We would have been better served by Jordan waiting another two years to put out a book that was worth the time it takes to read it."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Rather than advance the story, Robert Jordan has instead chosen to step back, take a breath, and try to pull some loose threads together before marching to the conclusion of his epic fantasy series. Fans of the series should not expect a lot to happen here, and may be disapointed with how little of the ultimate plot is actually resolved.For new fans of the series, don't start here, as Jordan spends absolutely no time bringing those new to the series up to speed. While this is to be expected in the 10th book of a complex and long running series, even hardcore fans may find themselves googling a character name here and there.I cannot give this book high marks, because the author spends the first 3rd of the book retelling the prior book's storyline from various other character prespectives. While the momentous conclusion of the prior book must have resonated in Randland, the choice to rehash that storyline leaves us with much repetition in Crossroads, which, while intersting, does little to advance the story.It appears that this series, which has been spinning wheels for a number of installments, may be slipping a little further. The next installment is due lat fall, so perhaps the author will finally get this series back on track. Until then, I would recommend returning to the first 5 books in the series, which represent the best that Jordan has given us thus far."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"FIRST OFF LET ME SAY THAT I LOVE JORDAN'S WRITING STYLE AND FEEL THAT HE IS ONE OF THE BEST FANTASY WRITER'S TODAY, BUT I WAS SADLY DISAPOINTED WHEN I FINISHED THE 10TH BOOK.

In the last book, not a whole lot happened and the writing was not what I had come to expect from Jordan, but I figured that it was just because he was having trouble stretching it to 10 books. I waited with very little patience for this one, ordering it 6 months before it was supposed to come out in November, only to find upon reading it, it was just more of the same. Oh, the writings is much better that book 9 but I WAS EXPECTING THE LAST BOOK! This one only continues the plots in the previous books and sets up even MORE plot twists than before! I rarely pay for a hardcover book. Next time, I think I will wait for the softcover to get out before buying.

This is good as it means we're killing off Jordan's cashcow (wheel of time...the wheel keeps turning: that's because Jordan doesn't know how to put on the brake with his out of control nonsence!)...maybe a couple more flops and some big time money lost will convince Tor to give Jordan a foot in the pants and get him motivated (or at least get rid of him and replace him with somebody that can write!Seriously...this wheel of time thing is just getting worse (god help us what the NEXT installment - after the prequel- will bring!

Rand barely appears. Too many characters do appear in the book whose names I've long forgotten. The end is nowhere in sight, excepting that I think \\"Crossroads\\" has finally pushed me over the brink of giving up on the series.On a brighter note, I have begun to re-read The Eye of the World and am greatly enjoying it.

The entire book of 675 pages spans but a month in &quot;real-time&quot; and advances the entire series not a bit. Save your money and skip this book, you'll miss nothing in the entire series. In fact, the galatial pace of the last three books makes me doubtful that this series will every come to an end. Not only is the pace slow, it is becoming ever slower.Instead, this book's many pages are devoted to various political intrigues, and endless profusion of proper names, and rich descriptions of everybody's attire. Personally, I'd much rather know what is going on in Rand's mind than a detailed description of every outfit he dons.Bottom line - I'm sorry I wasted the time reading it."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This book does nothing to advance anything. There is no excitement. In fact, other than a very brief chase for Mat and something happening to Egwene on the last page, you literally spend 700 pages suffering.

If you haven't bought this book, don't."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Well, first of all one thing is obvious: The book doesn't advance the storyline. One may conclude, that if you had to miss one book out of the series, this one would be it. But what's more important: Jordan seems to start repeating himself. Some chapters contain large chunks of already well established conflicts, sentiments, etc. Who want's to read about the constant bickering between Romanda and Lelaine a tenth time? And who wants a retelling of old plots just for the sake of reference? Sorry, but my memory is still intact! But what's really annoying: These boring bits and pieces tend to creep into new lines of thought, thereby disrupting those threads. Or he achieves the same by his describing some place, some people, some costumes, etc. en detail where he oughtn't. Sometimes one may skip about a page without missing a thing. Moreover, the author doesn't heed the advice Fielding gave back in 1750: If a part of the story isn't worth telling - don't tell it! Or at least, don't tell it in about 400 pages! Regrettably, Jordan devotes large parts of this book to rather insignificant incidents or characters.On the other hand: Whenever Jordan decides to tell scenes without artificial restraints he can still do a good job.My conclusion: With &quot;Crossroads of Twilight&quot; Jordan has tried to build up some steam after the climax of &quot;Winter's Heart&quot;.

And, the Rebel Aes Sedai still haven't realized that they have a devastating weapon available in the \\"Travelling Gates,\\" that cannot only get them into the Tower, but, decimate any opposition...with a terrible slaughter.Interesting, but, unfilling, as a course in my regular diet of Robert Jordan magic.Well, guess I'll just have to read the other Nine Volumes again, to fill the empty years ahead, until the next Chapter in the Saga appears magically...several months of postponements beyond the published release date.Hate that, ya know?Gordon"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Just like the old lady on that Wendy's commercial from years ago, I am wondering where the beef is in the burger.

In fact, many important things happen that are making me long for the story to continue. However, I think that everything that happens could easily have been pushed into abou 300 pages.I know that Robert Jordan will never read this, but if he were, I would offer one piece of advice: get a new editor. Your wife loves you too much to cut out what needs to be cut out. Either that, or Moridin is controlling her.I can't count how many times somebody would ask a question, and a page and a half later the response would come. In the meantime, we'd get a long description of the history of that character, followed by a long description of the wall coverings, followed by the details of each character's clothing. WE DON'T NEED ALL OF THAT!!!!!A few amusing things I've noticed. In previous books, all female characters seemed to be beautiful, and all male characters were either expressionless, or sour-faced. It seems in this book, Jordan tried to overcome that, but did so in a rather predictable way. If you read it, count how many people had a scar running across their face that had taken out an eye.Also, unlike previous volumes, there is very little mention of women spanking each other. I'm glad for that; I was starting to wonder if Jordan had a fetish for that...Overall, the book does a great job of setting the stage for the next book, and catches us up on what's been going on while Rand and Nynaeve are carving circular chunks out of the earth. But it reads like the first half of a Tom Clancy novel (all buildup, with no release), and there is no plot arc at all. So I was surprised when I finished. I couldn't believe the book was over - not because I was that enthralled, but because it was that anticlimactic.Well, there are those who will disagree. But that's my opinion."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I used to love Robert Jordan and the Wheel of Time series, but then after around Book 8, the plots and characters started becoming a bit absurd! Crossroads of Twilight is no exception. It is so slow and tedious, that I ended up skipping most of it and was more sad than disappointed, because it seems that Mr. Jordan is trying to squeeze out as many books he can from this story and is losing the whole texture and plot that he started with and his fans grew to love. His style of writing is still as good as it always was, but I am getting tired of this storyline - its just taking too long! Also the addition of so many new characters and sub-stories, detracts from the old ones we love and want to know more about - most of whom never played much in this book. Too much time and prose is given to people and things that we really dont need to know about!I am someone who believes in reading all the publications in a series, but with this one - I can honestly say that if you skip 10 and go straight to 11, you wont miss much, because nothing much happens really!Come on Mr. Jordan ... give us the same writing that we all fell in love with 10 books ago!!

The addition of new subplots and the continuing developement of plot lines in book 9 and 10 are starting to make this series drag...after completing this book I was a little dissapointed in the lack of overall progress the main characters made. The book should really be 9.5 - maybe two years from now we will have some dramatic development within the story - Robert, keep it up, but all the extra detail is taking away from the enjoyment of the series."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"But What. The. Frick. I'm all for rising action and tensions, but literally nothing worthy of note happens.

As long as the next book gets better."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"After picking up a little in Books 7 and 9, Jordan's epic bogs down yet again in an even-numbered book. I would go so far as to name this the worst book in the series, although Book 6 (Lord of Chaos) was more annoying. The title of my review is a direct quote from the book, and never was a more fitting quote found within a book to describe itself.Once again, nothing happens in the book. All the threads that were active at the beginning of the book are still active at the end. Faile is still captive of the Shaido (and Perrin is still on her trail). This is the most interesting thread of the book, as he at least catches up to the Shaido and hunts prisoners to question. Rand returns from the climax of the last book - having cleansed the True Source of the Dark One's taint - and spends a few chapters trying to decide what to do. These chapters are mostly dominated by the increasingly annoying Cadsuane, his Aes Sedai advisor. Egwene's thread returns after a book's hiatus, but we may as well have done without for all the progress she's made. And Elayne continues to gather support for her claim to the throne of Andor.Of the Big 7 main characters, Nynaeve doesn't appear at all. Rand, Egwene, Elayne, Perrin are mentioned above. Morraine is still dead. Mat's thread is probably the one that advances the most, mainly involved with his courting the woman he knows he's destined to marry - Tuon, the kidnapped Daughter of the Nine Moons and hier to the Seanchan throne.But let's face it, we can't go this far and not go farther! Thus, read the book - there's light at the end of the tunnel as there's only two more books to go (one unpublished, being finished by a \\"ghost\\" writer from Jordan's notes he left before passing away)."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This was in my opinion the worst book of the series. The book felt long while reading it and overall nothing really occurred to give any direction to the plot, it became a feeling of is it over yet while I was reading it.

This is a weak book in what was initially a strong series. It is the nervous twitch of the series, the ruffling skirt smoothed.I suggest those who have not yet read this book to give it a pass, and the next one as well. When Jordan releases the twelfth, then pick up all three and read them as a trilogy.Those who really need a Jordan fix could always begin the whole series again. I have, twice. Otherwise, make friends with your librarian."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"now i feel like i'm only reading the wheel of time books out of duty. i started the series when i was in grade eight and now i'm doing my PhD!!! in grade eight i was primarily interested in fantasy and sci-fi and now i'm primarily interested in good literature (including good sci-fi). but i still read this series because i feel like it's my responsibility to finish. grade 8, grade 9-13 (the now extinct thirteenth grade), 4 years in a BA, 2 years in a Masters, almost one year (so far) in a PhD program = 15 years of reading this series! argh!! talk about drawing a story out. usually when i get to the next book (considering the long waits between some of them) i have to spend the first few chapters trying to remember everything that went on in the last million pages or so. and Crossroads of Twilight was no exception.i was hoping that this book, being the tenth, would signal the end of the series so i could just be finished with the whole affair (as i said, it's out of duty now--i've started so i have to finish). Jordan's proving that he's only a one-trick pony. &quot;anyone,&quot; said Oscar Wilde once, &quot;can write a three-volume novel [or, in Jordan's case, a 10+ volume novel]. All it takes is a complete ignorance of Art and Life.&quot; i think Jordan's stretching the wheel of time out because he has no other ideas worth writing about. and now he's succeeded in turning is only good idea into wan, banal pulp."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"While I am an avid reader of Jordan's books, I've got to say this author seems to be milking this cow for all its worth. This book is over 600 pages with a story that could have been written in maybe 10. He should be ashamed of himself. He seems only interested in printing these books to make money, say nothing drag out the series and he'll make more money with each book. What's wrong with him!!In this book he repeats everything over again which he has said in the last 9 books. Worse, there's no story only detailed descriptions of places, it's like watching a movie with vivid landscapes, but the actors saying and doing nothing. Even worse is the constant addition of new characters who have minor roles, who Jordan feels compelled to tell us every little detail about how they look and what they are wearing, who cares ... stick with the main characters and the main story. ..."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"True disappointment - even though expectations were lowered by the glacial pace of the previous two or three books, this was a let-down. I agree with the reviewer that states Jordan needs a good editor - more than that, he needs an editor that is not afraid to put their foot down and strip out all the fluff and padding that exists in the past several volumes.Bottom line - bought it, read it and then promptly returned it. Not worth the price of a hardback - I'll probably purchase the mass market paperback when it comes out, just to have the collection up to date. Then again, I may not."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"About halfway through Crossroads of Twilight it occured to me that although Robert Jordan may have had the ending for this series in mind for many years, he has no idea how to get there. Crossroads of Twilight is a book fraught with a writer's insecurity on how to proceed. There were horizontal moves across the board for all the major players but no conclusion to any of their many subplots. After ten books, he still sees fit to bombard us with more bit players (in the case of the Aes Sedai in fact, I've given up trying to remember who's who) at the expense of progressing with the lead character's plots -- which he appears to be doing almost begrudingly. Rand, the chief protagonist is featured in a paltry 2 chapters, with the bulk of the rest of the book focusing on the ever exciting issues of Elayne mired in the bureaucracy of trying to maintain her crown, Perrin still looking for his obnoxious wife Faile at the expense of the strength of many soldiers -- many of whom could be usefully engaged in the fight against the shadow, Mat touring with circusfolk, and Egwene's prolonged assault on the tower (which she's been trying to push forward for a few books now). Truth be told, Egwene's storyline was somewhat interesting, but just like all the others there was no resolution to it. For every door and mystery solved in this book (and &quot;solved&quot; is a rather strong word. Perhaps it is more appropriate to say, &quot;almost brought to the point of completiton with no sense of closure&quot;), another 3 doors opened thereby broadening the scope of a series that has lost perspective for many novels now. Oh yeah, this book also had the least amount of Foresaken-related material of all the books, which is something nearly every avid WOT fan looks forward to. If you get rid of the fluff in this book (and the prologue altogether) you could have a nice 100 page novelet and not have missed anything that the 600+ book had. The page-count in Jordan's books are getting smaller and the fonts are getting bigger. And, as in most of his recent work , absolutely nothing is getting resolved in COT. All of these factors contribute to my belief that he has no intenetion of finishing the series any time soon, and is more than content to milk fans of their hard-earned money with uninspired drivel for a long time to come. I guess as a fan I always have a choice as to whether or not I'll buy the next in the series, and based on this latest uninspired entry, I think I know what my decision will be."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Two years of expectant waiting and Robert Jordan produces something less than mundane! This book must be the worst so far. I miss the plot intrigues, crisp narrative and action of the earlier books in the series where we flitted from character to character, each time being left on a cliff edge.The entire contents of this book could have been confined to two chapters. There has been virtually no plot advancement; Mat is STILL in Ebou Dar with Tuon, Perrin is STILL hunting Faile, Elayne is STILL trying to win the Lion Throne, the battle for Tar Valon has STILL to take place.Robert Jordan should re-read the first few books of the series to see why they were so popular.

I wish I could return it but it was a gift from someone who knows of my love of the story. I'll keep my copy only as a reminder that someone cares enough about me to buy it.

I read it in one sitting! I could barely struggle through 100 pages of Crossroads of Twilight at a time without falling asleep. This entire book could be compressed to one page and the plot would not suffer."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I think Jordan's creative talent may have peaked and burnt out around book 6 of this series. Books one through five were each moving faster than the last until that climactic battle at Dumai's Wells, and a whole lot of nothing has happened since. Each book AFTER the Lord of Chaos has had less happening than the last, including Crossroads of Twilight.A tip to the author: sometimes plotlines have to END!! Don't keep adding new subplots if you won't culminate others, or your readers will get bored and leave. Yes, it's a whole \\"age lace\\" you're trying to get down here, but creative decision or not the whole point is entertainment, and one more ...like this one and I won't be reading anything else you write. Ever. I've seen writers burn out before and I'm not willing to keep paying good money for time-wasting junk like this book.By about 2/3rds through, I was waiting for just ONE issue to be resolved. One major change. One event to happen that has been hinted at for the past five or six books. And I was disappointed. Pages and pages of description of marching orders, camp layouts, the dresses worn by uncounted hordes of equally noxious women, and other paper-filling trivia, but nothing HAPPENED! As another reviewer stated, any more \\"setup\\" work and the whole story will collapse under its own weight. I for one am done with waiting for the important events to start happening again. I want entertainment, not just time-filler, and if the next book doesn't deliver then I'm done with this series as well. Unfortunately. It started out so well."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I can't believe I waited for this for two years. Enough for me, I'm finished with this series.

This installment is slow, hard to get into, and just plain boring. In my opinion, nothing of great importance has happened for several books now in the Wheel of Time saga. I feel like the author is writing book after book simply to sell more books, rather than to add to the development of the story. Come on, if Tolkien can do it in three, why are authors such as Jordan taking 10+ books to develop an inferior story."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I wish Mr. Jordan never wrote this book really. The first 6 books were great, the 7th book was fine but it had to grow on me. The 8th book did not have a great ending at all, but it grew on me too. The 9th book was not that great, but it still had a dynamite conclusion which gave us hope the story would start going at a reasonable pace again. This did not happen. I understand that Mr. Jordan wants to get the little plots a lot of time, but this book was not well written at all. A book should hold your attention from page one and give you a conclusion that is satisfying and wanting more. If this wasn't the WoT series, I would feel I had nothing to look forward to in the future. If he keeps writing books like this, I surely don't. My major complaints are:1. Time slowing to a crawl since Dumai wells.2. Way too many subplots. Some are fine, I was interested in Ideralde in this book, but he gave it almost no face time. Some just touch on characters that deserve no face time like the Grey woman (cant remember her name).3. Some of the main story plots are running in place, especially since book 8. Perrin's story and Egwene's stories are really in the trenches. The sad thing is, they were both very promising and may end well, but for now they are driving me nuts. 3 books+ to tell them. They were interesting last in book 8.4. Rand's story just went NOWHERE in this book. After the end of book 9, it was cruel of the author to not do more with Rand.5. Elayne needs killing :) Ok I am not being fair, but her storyline is weak, and I never liked her anyway, hehe.6. Worst of all, the pacing and selection of stories just stunk in this book. With different mixing and slightly more movement on at least one story, this might have been a different book.Ok, I liked Mat's story somewhat, but it was still weak. Mat's a fun character and I like Tuon, so hopefully that story will move a bit more in the books ahead.In conclusion, I will continue to read his books. Why? I am too invested in them to give up now, but unless things change, I will start going paperback, then library for my next fix. My advice to Mr. Jordan is get a objective author who isn't afraid to say no. You need it, badly."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This is really too bad. The first six or seven in this series were phenominal. The eighth &amp; ninth were getting dull but I assumed Jordan was ready to start bringing together the hundreds of characters and subplots together. Instead he releases this book full of nearly 700 pages of nothing happening. What happened to all the great battles that the earlier books used so well?I am so dissappointed with this book. After reading book nine, I was disappointed, but hopeful. Now I am dissappointed and have no desire to finish this series. It had so much potential, and Jordan has let a potential masterpiece turn into a boring, dry and uneventful story."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"What the heck? This book goes no where as others have pointed out. Jordan needs to have the story stick with the multitude of characters from the awesome first five books and STOP introducing new ones with every new book!!! Who cares one whit about Amyrilla and her party of stupid followers whos oppose Elayne? Jordan introduces them in one chapter, spends an eternity describing them, and then NEVER talks of them again. What the hells the point in this?? Stick with Rand, Matt, and Perrin and the girls. I don't care about poor Falion's plight. I am only half way through this book and wish I hadn't wasted my money.

Unlike Rjs writing style, which I used to like extremely well, I will try to be concise and succinct.For a book that has around 700 pages, very little is happening. When I say very little, I mean, EXTREMELY SMALL. Nothing happens in the major plot line of Rand vs. the Shadow. Limited steps forward are made on Perrin's and Mat's romantic subplots, which are of variable interest, reader to reader. Predominantly, the book is one long transitional paragraph, designed to carry us from the moments after Rand and Nynaeve cleansed Saidin, to whatever is going to happen next. Otherwise, this is a bunch of busywork, moving characters around who aren't important, and having them do things that are less so. The main characters are starting to take actions that are illogical in the extreme, and blaming it on womanly things. That sounds harsh, but that's the way it came across to me. Things that the women in the books were taking for granted two books ago, are now being forgotten, items of information that are crucial to everyone's knowing are somehow overlooked in conversations.There are sections where it feels as if RJ is trying his hand at suspense writing, and he shouldn't have. Should I say more? In truth, though I know that anyone who's read the first NINE of these, probably has to read the tenth, go about it expecting little. THat way, you won't be as disappointed."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Like so many of the faithful RJ fans, I eagerly awaited the release of COT, the 10th book in the series and had done reading it within 2 days of purchase.

I have invested so many hours on the previous nine and I usually don't give up easily. Crossroads did the trick, however, with countless long passages of little or no action whatsoever. I want to scream when I'm reading those endless chapters of Aes Sedai characters gossiping with one another! The central character in the drama, Rand, did not even appear until page 540! I blame Robert Jordan for abandoning the fans of an amazing series (up to Book 6 at least) and the editors and publishers for not caring about what kind of pulp they put out on the shelves. Please stop the comparisons to Tolkien as Jordan missed that boat about 2000 turgid pages ago."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I am (was?) a huge fan of the Wheel of Time series. I first read Eye of the World back in junior high, and it was my entry book to the fantasy genre. For this reason, it disheartens me to give this book such a poor review. I agree with the sentiments that many have already put forward -- Robert Jordan has lost control of his series, and Crossroads of Twilight emphasizes that fact.Firstly, this book goes nowhere. In all seriousness, I could sum up everything that happened in this book in two short paragraphs. The story focuses mainly around Mat, Perrin, Egwene, and Elayne. Nynaeve is mentioned perhaps three times, and Rand has an extremely short two chapters. While the plotlines that surround the first four characters are interesting, by the end of the book, they're in the *exact* same position they were in the beginning of the book. Why should it take Robert Jordan three years to write a 680-page novel to simply tell us, &quot;Yeah, not much happens.&quot;The pages are filled with useless over-description. While Robert Jordan is the &quot;king of descriptions,&quot; in the beginning of the series, he was able to masterfully balance his descriptions with action, with plot advancements, with interesting stories. As the series has gone on, though, the series has tipped massively in favor of description, and not much else. Robert Jordan does not need to tell me what every Aes Sedai in the room is wearing, where their silk came from, what country the brocade pattern is from, and what the Aes Sedai had for breakfast. This is useless fluff that does nothing to advance the story. If what they're wearing affects the story, then by all means describe it to the very last stitch. I found myself skimming through or skipping entirely many paragraphs that started with the dreaded, &quot;Her dress was...&quot; And I hardly *ever* skim through books.While many people are saying that this book is simply a setup for the next book, I'd like to remind them that that's what people said about the last two books. While I think this book was better written than Winter's Heart (don't get me started on how rushed the last chapter [and what should have been one of the most important and fleshed out chapters in the whole series!] in that book was,) and while the book did keep my attention and keep me reading, I found myself disappointed at the end. When I read the last words of the book, I closed it, and instead of that feeling of satisfaction, I was left with a stale and dry feeling of, &quot;But nothing happened!&quot;In short, if you're a fan of the Wheel of Time series, I'd suggest holding off to buy this book. Wait until it's in paperback. Even better, buy it a month before book 11 is going to come out (2005? 2006?) because that way, you'll be able to read its 680-page prologue. In the meantime, if you haven't yet, give George R. R. Martin's &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot; series a try. I guarantee that you won't be disappointed when you close the book after reading the last words in the last chapter."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I must like to suffer, because I hurried down and bought this book that can't keep me reading for more than fifteen minutes.

Apparently, the key to love in Rand-land is to annoy the heck out of someone until they realize that it must be love. See for example Nynaeve's relationship with Lan, Szechuan Sianche's love with crusty-old-general-guy, Rand's relationship with all women, etc., etc., etc. It's scary to think that Cadsuane's vile behavior might turn into a love affair with Rand. That's RJ's pattern of character development, anyway.Cadsuane: (Smacks Rand)Rand: What did you do that for?Cadsuane: (Smacks Rand again) Because I have to teach you!Rand: Huh?Cadsuane: (Smack!) This is for your own good!Rand: Duh?Cadsuane: You MUST learn what I have to teach you before you face the Dark One! (Smacks him again)Rand: O.K.! Just stop hitting me! What is it you're going to teach me?Cadsuane: (Smacks him again) A real lord won't just give up when someone starts smacking him! And I have no clue what I'm supposed to teach you (Smack!) because Jordan has no clue! But in the meantime I'll smack you around because that is how people realistically behave! (Smack)Rand: (choosing not to simply put a barrier of air between his cheeks and Cadsuane's hand) Huh? Duh!In the next scene, Rand and Cadsuane are in bed with Rand's three wives and lots of random Aiel women, all of whom sniff at each other and say, \\"I told you so!\\" We are all left wondering what the meaning of this might be. When readers ask RJ what the point of all that was he sniffs and says, \\"I learned to read with the INCIDENTAL aid of my brother! I don't need to explain! I graduated from the Citadel! I have a beard and a cane!\\""},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I must admit that I too fell under the spell of The Wheel of Time way back when I was looking for some new and interesting fantasy to read. I saw the first 5 books in the store and got so caught up in Eye of the World that I immediately bought all 5. Much to my chagrin, I didn't realise that the series was not yet finished. But at least the story was engaging and RJ could be forgiven to a few long-winded descriptions of this and that, because I was caught up in the plot. \\" few more books like this will certainly be worth it\\" I said to myself.However after Crown of Swords, I must say that the series took a depressingly bad turn. Not much more can be said about the horrible writing that hasn't already been said by thousands of others. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for RJ, as he continually shows his lack of creative writing skills with each passing volume full of unnecessary pages of filler, description, worthless prose, and scant plot development. I eventually gave up on Winter's Heart and haven't regretted it, nor looked back, since.A quote I found I think fairly sums up the writing \\"talents\\" of Mr. Robert Jordan. \\"That it is good to avoid (adjectives) is one of the few points on which the sages of writing agree. Thus Voltaire: \\"The adjective is the enemy of the noun, though it agrees with it in number and gender.\\" Thus Twain: \\"When you catch an adjective, kill it.\\" And thus William Zinsser: \\"Most adjectives are ... unnecessary. Like adverbs, they are sprinkled into sentences by writers who don't stop to think that the concept is already in the noun.\\" Writers frequently pull out the adjectives when they either haven't, or are afraid they haven't, provided sufficient data -- specific nouns and active verbs -- to get their ideas across. So if you point out that the jaw of every male in the room dropped when a woman walked in, it's neither necessary nor helpful to describe her as \\"beautiful.\\"Readers who regard Jordan's books as being a vibrant world full of rich descriptions need to consider the above quote. A vivid world does not need to be described ad nauseum by a talented writer. A writer who had talent could describe in 2 words what it takes RJ 2 chapters to pile on. He is a hack who is getting obscenely rich off the mentally challenged masses who need to be told the dress sizes of every minor Aes Sedai in the room in excruciating detail."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"So there I was in the bookstore, when my eyes fell on this little jewel - fortunately a paperback version. Since it had been quite a while since I bought and read #5-#9, the state the series was in had disappeared to some forgotten corner of my mind, which resulted in my purchasing CoT in a Pavlovian reflex. This was well over 1 year ago. I did finish the book and it's every bit as horrible, boring and completely uninteresting as the 2000 or so bad reviews state. I've re-read books 1-3 just to see if my tastes had changed or CoT was just bad - the latter is the case.I was going to write about the interchangeable characters, tea and spiced wine, furniture, clothing, nagging women, whining men, stupidity and lack of communication as sole characteristics, but why bother? Let me just say that this book is the bastard offspring of an Ikea catalogue and a fashion magazine, inheriting the intricate character development of the former, the intriguing plot of the latter and the pictures of neither.It does have one redeeming quality though, making it earn the 1 star Amazon forces me to give it: the reviews. There's well over 2000 of them and there are some true gems in there. Reading them costs considerably less time and provides more entertainment than reading CoT. I actually have re-visited the page a couple of times since I read the book (back then there were 1700 reviews or so), just to entertain myself with the latest additions. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Simply put he doesn't care what we think. This is nothing more than a means to make money and get on the #1 bestseller list. At a local book signing I saw him basically humiliate a young college student who had bought all 10 of the books that night. This young man put money in his pocket yet was asked if he was deaf or stupid at one point.Enough is enough for me. No more WoT. No more cash for the author. The story no longer matters since it was left behind and lost in the details a long time ago. 15 years is more than enough time to complete this \\"work of art\\".If anyone wants to read a good series that is well worth the time I would suggest R.A. Salvatore's Drow Elf series. Chronologically you should read Homeland first. Yes it's a D&D; book. Read it and you'll understand why I recommend it.Even better, go out and find The Chronicles of Amber by Roger Zelazny. Here is a perfect example of how to create a world and tell a story.As far as The Wheel of Time is concerned I am done. The only new thing that I've seen was a prequel that was originally published in Legends. Of course Mr. Jordan had to add some more detail and sell it to anyone that was naive enough to purchase it as a separate book. Why not? Publish it twice, get paid twice. After having met the author I don't think he cares what we think. Just look at these reviews and then look at what was last published.New Spring? Nope. Doesn't really capture what we're seeing here. Maybe a Barren Well would have been a better title. Obviously, Mr. Jordan has gone to the well one time to many and has now come up dry."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"There is an old saying, fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me. Well, what do you say when you have been fooled at least 5 times by the same author?I kept turning the pages thinking, something must happen sometime! And the characters! Suspension of disbelief? No sane person in any world would make the decisions the characters here do. It is just becoming unbelievable (as if magic were believable in the first place) and I find myself just wishing someone would simply nuke the white tower and get it over with. I mean, who cares anymore?Is Mr. Jordan simply milking us for more money? Seems like this was the topic of conversation with the last novel.Well, I've been fooled again..."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Mat does not marry Tuon. Perrin does not rescue Faile or Alliandre or Morgase, Rand does not do anything. Elayne does not gain the Rose Throne. Egwene does not re-unite the White Tower. Elaida does not defeat the rebels. No darkfriends are unmasked. No black ajah are unmasked. Morraine does not come back from wherever she has been for the last 8 books. Savanne does not get what is coming to her. No Forsaken are unmasked. Mazrim Taim's plans do not become clear. Logain's plans do not become clear. The Seanchan don't gain victory/defeat on any front. The Great Lord does not break free. Gawain does not join Egwene. I could go on.What does happen in this novel? Elayne drinks lots of watery tea. Egwene has lots of headaches, Rand lies in bed with Min and wishes he were dead. Loail explains again why he is not ready to settle down. Aviendha wanders around in the buff again. Mat continues to not understand women. Aes Sedai and the Sea Folk, and the Kin continue to argue with one another about every little thing. We continue to get a fashion review of what every woman is wearing, and how much bosom she is showing (typically a great deal). That's about it.Crossroads of Twilight is not a stand-alone novel. If one has not read the first 9 books in the series, there is no hope of understanding anything that is going on in this one. This novel, however, does absolutely nothing to advance the plot of the overall series. After 10 books and 9000 pages, it would be nice if at least one or two plotlines began to be wrapped up, and we could go on to something, anything, else.My advice: If you have a few hours and a few dollars to waste, read Crossroads of Twilight. If not, skip this one, and hope the next one is better."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Bought the book. Waste of money except that a complete series is worth more than one with a book missing.I kept wondering (as others have it seems) why the characters can't get together every now and then (in a sort of WOT teleconference) to strategize, compare notes, or just complain to each other? The strongest part of the early WOT books was the interplay between these friends. Jordan has ripped them apart from each other (for no other reason than to sell more books it seems). And in the process he has obscured them by cluttering up the book with pointless details. We no longer know what is in their hearts. We used to know how Rand felt, and what he was thinking. We could see inside him. Now it seems that Jordan thinks we are Darkfriends as he won't let even us inside Rand's head.Jordan has not replaced what he took away from us when he relegated our heroes to players in the ensemble. We don't get to know any others in depth. Are there no other heroes in the Lands of whom we should know? Seems not. We can't see into their hearts.It seems Jordan has lost his way. There were six seals on the Dark One's tomb. That makes six books plus one more to tie it all together. Now we are book ten with more than a thousand characters? These are serious symptoms of an author with a writer's problem-- the opposite of writer's block it would seem.Anyway. As many others have said, you can skip this book without missing a thing. I read the first couple hundred pages, skipped to end and never felt like reading the in-between.And since I'm complaining, I might also add that I mourn the loss of Moiraine. Surely in the infinite possibility of fantasy fiction, she isn't really dead . . ."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This is the worst book of the series. The plot evolved little - if at all. Initially this series was going to cover 8 to 10 books. Jordan needs to wrap it up. He can always do a sequel (or even better - a prequel). If the first book had been written at this pace, I would have never read the second."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I must agree with the majority of the other reviews here. The first several books were well-paced, and the various different plots and subplots actually kept the action moving and the story progressing. I enjoyed seeing the characters grow and could not wait to read the next chapter, the next book.Now I can barely make myself wade through the paralyzing suckiness of page upon page of dresses and tea and supposedly supermagical genius women acting like vapid high-school freshmen. Seriously, I can't stand the whole Aes Sedai thing anymore.What happened? The last three books have been almost nothing but childish Aes Sedai snapping at each other (and/or at men in general) for dozens of pages at a time. In the beginning of the series I found the man/woman conflict in the world intriguing, but at this point I kind of hope all the Aes Sedai are annihilated in an Old-School, Old-Testament style beat-down of Biblical proportions (and I don't care by who). Or I would love to see Logain and a legion of Asha'man come in and Compel them all to become Hooters waitresses or something.I'm starting to dread each Aes Sedai chapter because the characters all pretty much act the same and only the names change. Another thing I've been wondering - why would any man in his right mind ever desire or consent to become a Warder? What's in it for them? To be ordered around and manipulated all the time? To be a Green's boy toy? I mean, I understand in Lan's case; he has an explanatory backstory, but what about the others? Do they get a nice pension plan and comprehensive dental or something? What's the upside for all the BS they have to put up with? Would anyone even want to be in the same room as the average Aes Sedai, let alone be mentally and emotionally attached to them for life? If you knew people in the real world who acted like the Aes Sedai do in the books would you be friends with them or even give them the time of day? I just don't find them sympathetic at all anymore.And how about that punk Gawyn? Any remorse at all over murdering all his old teachers? Oh well, just hook up with Egwene and all is forgiven. Yay! Can't wait for that plot point to come eventually. The whole Cadsuane thing? Someone tell me again why she is necessary? Or how she is different from any of the other magic women - except she's even more of the same?I have too many frustrations with the plot at this point and don't want to devolve into a rant (any more than I have already, anyway). I don't know about all of you, but from now on I'm rooting for the Seanchan. Turn all these whining teaswilling fairy chicks into damane, stomp some order into these squabbling kingdoms, get Rand to deal with the Forsaken and the Dark One and everyone lives happily ever after."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I've spent the last 10 minutes reading the reviews posted prior to mine and I've got say I agree. Last time I checked, the main storylines/characters were Rand, Mat, Perrin and Egwene. Rand hardly appears until the end - Mat's bogged down in a confusing/annoying courtship ritual - Perrin's grain-buying excursion reminds us of better, more productive writing, but the whole thing remains unexplained. (WHAT IS UP WITH SO HARBOR?! I don't understand how description of the Hall's dresses warrants pages and pages but we don't deserve a clear picture of the 'Night of the Living Dead'.)Finally, Egwene and her frustrating gaggle of harpies do absolutely nothing except reminisce about their days in the Tower until the last page. THEY CAN TRAVEL AND THEY'RE JUST SITTING THERE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE RIVER!!Speaking of travelling... everybody's wondering about this 'Forsaken weapon'. Why not open a small gateway, stick your head through and ask someone close to Rand for an update. After all, Egwene and Rand GREW UP TOGETHER!! But I guess that would only make the book shorter and Jordan would have to fill it with other inane maunderings. I've been reading Jordan's work since before WoT. He was one of the best authors to take up the Conan mantle and his series started breathtakingly. Now, I just find myself wishing that he would just grow up and stop talking about dresses.Personally, I believe Jordan has developed a specific form of writer's block. He claims to have known the final scene since 1984 but I don't think he knows how to bridge the gap between now and that scene, so he trundles along scratching his head and dipping his pen and jotting down whatever comes to mind. (Either that or he's overcome with an insane desire to become a fashion designer) His claim that he's writing the series for himself is a convenient 'out'. I just think when you're putting food on your table with our money, you should start considering your fans and how your disregard portrays you in a bad light.Also, I don't blame TOR. If I had someone that's made me this much money, I'd play the blind/deaf/dumb monkey too. I'll give him the second star for throwing in some Logain stuff and for Faile getting beaten and tied up, but that's pushing it...If you're looking for a fantastic series, pick up George R.R. Martin's &quot;A Game of Thrones&quot; (ISBN: 0553573403). As for me, I'll probably keep struggling through Jordan until he gets to his almighty &quot;final scene&quot;."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Now, I will be the first to say that I loved these books all the way up until 7. Path of Daggers was kinda slow, and Winter's Heart was monotony for the first 500 pages, though it ended well, which I don't mind. As another reviewer said, I'm not slow, I'm university educated and I don't mind detail in a storyline.This book, however, runs into the L. Ron Hubbard level of detail. There isn't even anything redeeming at the end of this one...its just monotony from cover to cover. NOTHING happens. It is all plot update...which again, wouldn't have been bad if it just covered a few chapters. But this is 680 pages of it.Do I care if this series ever ends? No, not really...overall, I love the series. The end of this book is supposedly Tarmon Gaidon, the 'Ultimate Battle of Good Vs. Evil' but I don't think that's really realistic (Yeah, I know its a fantasy series). Can evil ever be truly defeated? Can you kill a god? I don't think so, but do look forward to this series as it grows.So no, I don't really want this series to end anytime soon...but I do want there to actually be something worth buying the book for. Otherwise I'm just going to do what I'm going to do with this book...buy it at the discount bin in a few years time.Wake up, Mr. Jordan (a pen name, I know). Your employers are calling, and we are not happy with your current performance.P.S. What the heck was up with waiting 2 years for this drivel? Did your computer break?

It fills in details from Winter's Heart (hence the title of the review) but moves the overall story not at all.

Having found a formula that guarantees him a large payout every two years Mr. Jordan seems loathe bring his series to a conclusion. At this point I doubt if he can get it done in 15 books which of course means we will all still be here in a decade.So, what's a reader to do? We all have far too much time and energy invested in the series to simply pass the next installment by. Do what I did. Save your money and simply check the book out from the local library. Maybe Mr. Jordan will get the point, but I doubt it."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I started to read this serries two years ago and when I first started to read it I thought it was one of the best fantasy series that I had ever gotten into. The first five books were truly great. Sadly the series went down hill from book six and has hit rock bottom with the latest instalment. The wheel of time has always suffered from unrealistic character development and interaction. But this flaw was always overshadowed with a deep plot, a intersting fantasy world and exelent action scenes. None of which can aply to this book. Litearlly nothing happened in this book. Perrin didn't save Flaile. A relationship wasn't developed between Matt and Toun. Elaine didn't secure here right to the throne nore did Egween end the civil war in the tower. And Rand did absulutly nothing. Nether did any of the badguys do anything. I feel like Jordan put the book out to scam money out of his fans. If this product is what he feels is good enough from his fans then I am no longer one of them. He will not get another dime from me nor will I recomend this series to anyone."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I gave this two stars ONLY because it is The Wheel of Time and I dearly love the characters and the world that Robert Jordan has created. But this book does absolutely nothing. There is nothing in here that is exciting or new. As other reviewers have noted, none of the characters do anything that move the story forward. Mat is still wishing he were at tavern with a plump girl on his knee, Perrin is still a once-noble blacksmith who can't think about anything but his wife - ever, Elayne is still not really doing anything but hanging out with Birgitte and Aviendha, and Egwene just has a headache. This is starting to make me feel as if Jordan is only after our money. I can picture him sitting at a computer somewhere, typing words without even thinking about them, and cackling madly as his bank account grows. He's hooked us and now he is stringing us along. I suspect he has been doing that for two or three books now, but the Crossroads of Twilight make it completely obvious. If you are a diehard Jordan fan, then read it - it's a good way to spend that hour before you go to bed (as you will have no trouble getting to sleep), but if you are all ready tired of this series then don't bother - this book will only irritate you."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"The book stinks!!! Nothing happens, time seems to have stopped. Makes me wonder why I have read it. A total waste of time, paper and money!!! The plot is boring. No battles have occured. Nothing! With Perrin whinning all the time and Egwene doing absolutely nothing!) the only interesting scene was the conversation between Rand/LT and Logain. The only good thing that happened was the appearance of Loial. Also the attack of the windfinders should have been discribed. It would have made the book much better. So I think there is no need to read the book at alll - just wait for the next book to come (if there is a next book). I really hope for a better book. CoT is worse than PoD.

Nothing so far.Well the best suggestion I can make is to wait till book 11 comes out then get both book 10 and 11. So that way you avoid that sick depressing feeling of having to wait another 3 years till book 11 comes out. Save yourself the heartache."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This one should have been called &quot;Crossroads of PMS.&quot; Everyone in it spends most of their time irritated, annoyed, peeved, frustrated, cross, vexed, deviled, and disturbed with everyone else in the novel. Once in a great while a character actually crosses the threshhold into outright anger, but they usually beat that impulse down, reminding themselves that getting angry would only serve to move the plot forward, something Jordan is bound and determined not to do at any cost.Can anyone doubt that at this point that Jordan is simply milking the series for every nickel he can? It has stopped being a series and is now a franchise. Unfortunately, that's not the way it was conceived from the beginning. At the beginning, we were promised a story that would stretch across all the novels. Stories have beginnings, middles, and ENDS. So Jordan is now locked into a middle of a story he doesn't want to end, because then the checks stop rolling in, too.I bought it, and read it, because the early novels hooked me and I can't let go. But each novel, while mildly satisfying, also leaves me feeling irritated, annoyed, peeved, frustrated, cross, vexed, deviled, and disturbed -- and yes, sometimes outright angry. It annoys me that Jordan is cheating me, and that I'm letting him cheat me.I'm 364 pages into the novel, and so far, NOTHING HAS HAPPENED. I mean that literally, NOTHING. The plot has not moved forward one jot. Everything is still EXACTLY where it was at the end of the previous novel. I have had 364 pages of people bitching at each other, or thinking about bitching at each other, but no one has actually done anything.I've lost track, how many filler novels have there been in this series? Four? Five? Jordan still won't say how many are left. Since we were dumb enough to buy this one, he'll probably try again. And keep trying until sales start to slip, and then maybe he'll move the plot a bit to bring folks back.So, I'll read the next one, too, whenever it comes out. 2005? 2006? Who knows? But at this rate, the series' Final Battle may not arrive any sooner than our own."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Negative number ratings are needed for books this bad. Can you say milk the cash cow? Shame, yes shame! on TOR and the editors for letting this book go to press. I enjoyed the first 3-4 books in the series but believe WoT went markedly downhill since then. The latest installment is by far the worst yet. Snails move faster than Crossroads at twilight. The 100 page prologue bores to tears, and the rest of the book is not much better. Rand does not make an appearance until 2/3rds of the way through the book, sticks around for about 5 minutes of reading, then vanishes again. 10 books and Jordan isn't even bothering to wrap up any of his dozens of major plots and instead opens up still more minor plots? CoT seems to spend more time on what women are wearing than it does on plot advancement. With so little to say, why did this book need to be written or published? What a waste of trees! Do yourself a favor...read George Martin's trilogy instead (Song of Fire and Ice)..or just put a blindfold on and pick any book off the fantasy shelf. You might be happier.

You have the known openings, where your first moves are dictated by a set of finite rules. You have the middle game, where most of the game's interesting and unorthodox plot twists are executed. And finally, you have the exciting endgame where only the major pieces are left to determine the outcome.If I had to guess, I would say Mr. Jordan is not a chess player.CoT is a 680 page prologue. Don't be fooled by the 80 page prologue at the onset. No, it goes much further than that. I found it frustrating to realize that 10 pages from the end, the story had moved on only a fraction of its potential.Mr. Jordan seems to be stuck in the middle game, where instead of simplifying and removing pieces from his board, he has introduced new players and new story lines, clogging the board and limiting the moves of the pieces we want to see.I have been a fan of the WoT series for sometime now, having raced through the first 5 books in a little less than a year. I will continue to buy the books until the end. I have come too far to quit now. Anyone who is reading the tenth book is probably of the same opinion.However, in the vain hope that someone associated with the creation of these books might be reading...&quot;Simplify, Mr. Jordan.

The first 500 pages of the book refer to events prior to the end of Winters Heart. It covers the minutiae of characters I couldn't even remember (and didn't want to remember), and fails to even introduce Rand until the final few hundred pages. For the first time in my life I felt justified in skipping pages in a book.Characters I've previously admired seemed to lose their hold on reality. For example, Elayne decides not to use Rand's troops to cement her hold over Andor, strangely seeming to believe she has the time to sit in Caemlyn and wait for the nobility to recognise her (whilst the world outside falls apart). Egwene finally gets to the White Tower and then decides not to actually invade it due to a crisis of confidence. The author then uses an obvious trick to get her captured in Tar Valon, clearly setting up a final justification for the invasion. It would have been far more meaningful if Egwene had forced the invasion through an adult decision, as in the prior books, rather than a last minute coincidence. Such determination would have nicely paralleled Rand's own leadership experiences.This kind of filler material would be understandable if the author was releasing installments every few months, but for a two year wait it is not acceptable to me. Having read every prior novel and followed the series avidly in the past, this book will be the last one I'll bother to read."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This book has got to be the worst of the series to date.

However, the latest installment simple does not live up to the high standards set in previous books. If you have read the first nine books, then by all means continue on, because you know what to expect. Mr. Jordan has managed to take a 200 page story and fill over 600 pages.This installment appears to be happening at the same time as the last chapter in the last book. Since the event only took one chapter in the last book, I understand why this book drags so much. Mat and Egwene do not accomplish anything in this book. Both play large parts, but in the end do nothing of importance. Mr. Jordan seems to have set the stage for something momentous to happen in his next book. However, the last book was supposed to have set events to allow for something exciting to happen in this book.My fear is that someone has decided that there is too much money to be made with this series, and it will never end. Each book will become more monotonous than the last, and accomplishing only the smallest amount. If this latest installment is any indication, then my fear is starting to come true."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"First off, don't get me wrong...I love the WoT series-I have since I read the first pages of Eye of the World. I have read the whole series at least ten times, and I have come to care for the characters in different ways..well except for a few, not mentioning any names Egw...never mind. That's not the point. Like many of the other reviewers, I too have been getting a little annoyed with the last books. Book 7 was pretty good, Book 8 was just plain bad. My hopes came back with 9..the pace did pick up, a lot of surprising things happened...and then book 10...I was so excited...from all of the hype, I had hoped it would be the beginning of the end....Hardly...how could a book be so long and not accomplish anything? First off, Rand, the Dragon Reborn mind you (i'm sorry, but if you don't know that one by now, read the first one) had, what, three pages? *~minor Spoiler~* Rand cleansed saidin, and yet, Jordan hardly goes into it at all... When is he going to stop acting like a walking piece of ice? When is he going to have to deal with Lewis Therin? So, he is thinking of a deal with the Seanchan...big deal...what about the battle between the Asha'man? What about the remaining forsaken? Moridin? Paidin Fain? When is he going to run into Tam? He might not be the most likable character anymore, but he still is THE main character...And Mat...I had desperately hoped (DON'T READ IF YOU HAVEN'T FINISHED BOOK 5) that he and Tom would finally deal with the snakes and foxes and get Moraine back...Oddly enough, I actually miss her character..I must admit, I enjoyed his interactions with Tuon though...Perrin...I'm sorry, but his character is just becoming annoying.. we know he loves Faile, but all he does is mope around scratching his beard wishing to free Faile...I'm sorry, but he could be doing more important things with his time than that...I could rant all day about it: Egwene's plot line has moved a little (although I still don't like her...how can she be dumb enough not to wonder about Halima?) Elayne did nothing...the Aes Sedai in the White Tower have not accomplished much...ARGH!I'm sorry Mr. Jordan, but enough is enough...I love your series to death, but if you don't like writing it anymore, why not end it before you lose all of your fans? Please?"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"When it comes right down to it, Robert Jordan has made a choice. After writing the first 6 books of his series, Jordan realised that he had many loyal fans who would buy his next book(s) regardless of their content. Robert Jordan made a choice, between being remembered as the author of a great fast moving series of books that's main purpose was to please the fans, or, he could draw the series out as looong as he possible could, milking every dime he could from his loyal sheep. He chose the latter."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This is possibly the most pointless book I've ever read. It is 700 pages of eloquently written tripe that could have easily been compressed into 3 chapters at most. There is no action whatsoever and it somehow manages to end up in nearly the same place as the last book."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"As someone who eagerly awaited - and bought - Crossroads of Twilight, it'd be an understatement to say how disapppointed I was. Unfortunately what made Jordan such an engaging writer and the series so addictive - the vision, the attention to detail, the rich character profiles - is fast becoming his downfall. He seems to have become lost in the minutiae and is veering away from the central elements of the plot. The fault lies as much with the Editor as the writer; both are responsible for making a book readable."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"The question is will this ever end? No one but Mr. Jordan knows for sure but we can only hope he decides to put this sick animal down soon.I will admit I read this book expecting very little. It lived down to my expectations. The past few volumes in this series have been mediocre at best, awful at their worst. In the beginning WOT was a marvelous concept, strong characters and an interesting story line, a great combination. But now the main characters (of which there are far to many of) have their own individual subplots that devolve into more sub-subplots, the entire series has become fractured, convoluted, complicated and, well, boring. Trying to track and maintain interest in each of these independent story lines is a chore. I found myself skipping 10 to 20 pages at a time just because I had no interest in the drivel he wrote.They say the two hardest parts of a story to write are the beginning and the end. While he did a fair job of the first it is obvious he has still to learn the second.My advice is unless you have invested untold hours reading the first nine in the series pass this puppy up. If you have and feel the need to continue then don't buy this book, check it out from the library. Even if you have read the first nine you can still pass on this one and still be comfortable in reading the end of series, whenever that will be, this volume has no value added."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"So this book doesn't have a lot of the hack and slash, but it is worth reading. This book brings a lot of things together and ties up a few loose ends left in the other books. So no there isn't a lot of blood and killing, and at the times the book may slow down, but the way it is written is amazing. You just don't know what is going to happen on the next page and that feeling is worth it by itself. Great book."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Had been following the Wheel Of Time Series since the first book back in 1990.. One thing about Jordan's writing is that it's all about setting things up.. so that you can imagine what was the situation like and the scenario of the places involves.. One thing that I agree with this book story line is that it tries to cool down from the last book climax on cleansing the saidin.. it's a huge thing.. so we have to know the impact of that to the rest of the world.. If Jordan make it all in a paragraph to let in some new climax stuff.. we wouldn't have know what's in Egwene's mind, what did the Ashaman thinks.. are they afraid with sensing that someone far away are using the one power so much they could sense it thousand of miles away.. It's a good setup for the next scene.. the ending is good.. I never like Egwene anyway.. hahhahahabut thinking about the next book probably came out in another 2 years.. the wait are frustrating.."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"You'd think that after all this time reading these books, you people would learn that there is more going on here than meets the eye. I'm not denying that he is a little wordy here and there, and the descriptions of dresses, etc. can get a little tedious, but there's much more to it than that. With some of the reviews I've been seeing of this book, I'm starting to wonder how many of you actually read it. Because if you have, anyone who gave this book either one or two stars obviously has no appreciation whatsoever for good stories. If you guys want shallow action and violence, there's plenty of stuff out there that has that. If you want a story that actually has some thought in it, and you don't mind using your brain once in a while, this series is unbelievable.Warning: There are a few spoilers ahead...Looking beneath the surface, there is quite a lot going on to advance the plot (no matter what all these people say, it's true), and there are a few things blatantly obvious. I mean, if you can't see the significance of Egwene turning the chains in front of the harbors of Tar Valon into Cuendillar, thus enabling the siege, you obviously haven't been really reading these books lately (which is more than looking at the words, by the way), and that's probably why you can't appreciate them. Furthermore, Egwene getting captured after this has an incredible number of possible results, all of which are very interesting. Will she be caught starving in the siege too? What kind of punishment will the Aes Sedai there come up with for the rebellion? I could use the entire review to name them and still not be done. I won't even get into the things beneath the surface, or you would be reading for hours, and then there really wouldn't be any point in reading the book. I will give you just one more thing to think about, though: Rand is supposed to meet the Daughter of the Nine Moons, but she is with Mat. Suroth is definitely up to something, and it sounds like it could be bad for Rand.And if everything that happened in this book isn't enough for you, it leaves promise for innumerable unbelievable events in Book 11. So don't listen to the fools whining about Jordan's verbosity, they are just missing out on amazing writing, and are trying to get you to do the same. It's actually kind of ironic; for everything they say in their reviews, they have a larger proportion of \\"fluff\\" in their writing than Jordan does, and that's exactly what they're criticizing him for. I think that's the biggest sign of all that people giving this book bad reviews have no clue what they're talking about.But if you really want to know about it, you should read it yourself, and make sure you don't make the same mistake all these other people are."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Jordan needs to get on with the series. He's been dragging this one out for far too long. You can skip the book and just assume the the characters moved about 1/2 on the books's map and that's it. The entire part about Nate's mom was totally unbelivable.Hopefully the next one explains things with a little more detail."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Ok folks,I'll admit the last couple of books have been a tad slow, but I have grown to honestly like these characters. It's kind of like getting a really long family letter every year or two. Jordan I believe also warned everyone that this would be a long tale simply by the words he uses to begin and end each tale about the wheel of time. I do not have a book in front of me and have forgotten the exact quote. You have to give authors credit for even writting one novel let alone a series of 10 thus far...I don't know anyone that after that many books would be fresh every chapter."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"It is a typical robert jordan book.

This book has quite a lot of plot. The plot, however, is of a different nature than that of the first few books. Specifically, much of it consists of the characters in the different subplots making decisions... very important (and surprising) decisions. Also, there is some actual action. However, since there are so many subplots, each plot is not advanced that much.As might be expected, some of this book deals with the results of Rand's cleansing of saidin. (This event, in the last book, was superbly narrated. The writing created the perfect sense of what was happening.) Also, contrary to what I have read, the positive impact of what Rand did is present. It is only referred to once, though not explictly. Naturally, very few know or guess what was being done or who was doing it. This results in one of the book's important plot elements.The best thing about this book is that it reveals and hints at something very sinister going on. There are about four or perhaps five separate things mentioned throughout the book that point towards it. Three of them are of a very similar nature and are clearly related. It is unclear what is going on, which, of course, is what makes it so sinister.While the series has had some rough parts, it is still good."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"The Wheel of Time series should adorn any serious fantasy reader's shelf, like a gem encrusted into a dull crown. I have read the works of Ronald Tolkien, George Martain, Tad Williams, Terry Goodkind, Bob Salvatore, Weis & Hickman and Greenwood to name just a minute few. Jordan is up there and though he does tend to drag things on way too much, it is his way of recapitulating the monstrosity of his epic, into a smaller scope so that he may wind down his story in a subtle, climatic fall.No matter, this series is one of the most renown and talked about in the genre. If Jordan were to hurry it up a bit, throw in some Martain and Salvatore, lose the Tolkien he would be the master...

I await the next installment"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Maybe the 4- and 5-star reviewers are right, and those of us who couldn't stomach this book are just too impatient and shallow in wanting more plot advancement after a mere 10 books. I'm sure we'll see it in book 11. In fact, based on the important &quot;crossroads&quot; Jordan has brought us to in book 10, I'll make the following optimistic predictions of things to come:1. Elayne's mother (um, what was her name again?) is reunited with her daughter, and sneaks Elayne some spicy food and real tea. Elayne immediately goes into labor, which continues throughout the book.2. In a hopping rage over this, Birgitte splits the inseams of her breeches, and decides she looks good in a dress after all. Finding a whole new world of fashion opening before her, she hangs up her bow and picks up a needle.3. The bond between Nynaeve and Lan continues to strengthen. People notice Lan tugging on his right earlobe with increasing frequency, which makes them suspect it is becoming longer than the left one. Min tries to read his aura, to see if it's true.4. Egwene learns that her kidnappers are a secretive sect of Aes Sedai who have discovered the powerful ter'angreal known as &quot;tai'lannol&quot;, and that she is to be the subject of their experiments with it.5. Rand realizes he is a masochist at heart, and throws over Aviendha, Min and Elayne for Cadsuane, just so he can experience their suffering along with his own. Between this heartbreak and Elayne's labor pains, Aviendha grinds her teeth to little nubs.6. Faile is rescued, only to discover she is allergic to canines. Perrin, in a fit of grief, looks for a low-cost spay/neuter program.7. Mat and Tuon develop a &quot;George and Gracie&quot;-type routine for Valan Luca's Grand Traveling Show. They are finally captured by a Seanchan captain who sees a billboard for &quot;Nine Moons Over Pair-a-dice&quot; and grows suspicious.On second thought, I think I'll skip book 11."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This, well, I can't call it an installment, can I? This turgid, plodding, festering Charlie Foxtrot (if you don't know what that is, google it) of a doorstop may be a prime cause of creeping senility in America today. About halfway through it, I shat my pants and forgot who I was for several hours; I was found slathering myself in olive oil in the tub, drinking spiced tea and smoothing my terrycloth towel (embroidered with red thread, in lines of three) clutching my soap-on-a-rope like a Ter-angreal.Before I go on, I'd like to introduce you to my history of \\"poor choices in book selection\\" I once purchased (this was a long time ago!) a book solely based on the recommendation of Anne Mccaffrey on the book's dust jacket. I liked her work; ergo, this book must be good, as she recommended it! Oh, how wrong, wrong I was. I cannot remember the title, but the cover had a submersible dinosaur-type creature on the cover. It was about a planet settled by a colony ship propelled by a solar sail. Once landfall was made on this mostly-water planet, the solar sail was cut up to make one-man gliders - the only way the islands people could communicate with each other, as those crafty dinosaurs would sink all boats sent to sea.That book was bad. Painfully bad. But as I had paid hard-earned money, I FORCED myself to read it, ripping each read page from the book as I finished it, and throwing it away. I did not think I would ever have such a similar experience. Until now.I'm guessing Mr. Jordan shredded some pages from all of his first books in a Cuisinart, chewed them up, swallowed, and then regurgitated them in a sweaty spasmodic fit of creative vomiting into a steaming pile on his drawing-room floor. He then simply rearranged the paste, stuffed it into an envelope and mailed it off for publication. I cannot believe it was edited - no human mind could survive this Bataan death march of \\"litter-ature.\\"If you haven't read it, but feel you must, find a willing and desperate third world peasant to outsource the job to - don't worry if he can't read English, as I'm not sure Mr. Jordan is writing in English anymore.

Or perhaps your hireling is now the village shaman, haven taken to insane gibbering, fits of palsy, and random bouts of self-mutilation. I can foresee a new religion spreading across the Far East, as gibbering lunatics, clutching their holy hardcover talisman, the Crossroads of Twilight tightly to their chests, march erratically through barren wastelands.

I tried selling it on Ebay for $00.01, but received no bidders. You owe me another $00.35 for my listing fee, Jordan!I've grown to hate, hate, hate every character in this series with the possible exception of Matt. I hope they all die - the Wheel of Time runs them all down in a fit of Saidin inspired road rage. Mr. Jordan long ago lost his touch with \\"the True Source\\" and has become tainted with the Forsaken lure of a massive, ever-expanding bank account. Just look at his photo on the dust jacket. What kind of assclown wears a cowboy hat? It barely worked for Louis L'amour, and he at least had a reason to wear one. I'd like to see Jordan's next book have a photo of him wearing a helmet like those \\"exceptional\\" kids wear. This book is the ultimate in the short-bus schlock school of writing.Check it out from the local library, then throw it away. Or get it from the local Salvation Army store - they give them away to everyone who walks in the door. Or try to.In summary, get drunk and go make angry love to a cactus. Or a rabid porcupine.

It has cliffhangers that could be resolved but are not, it focuses on interpersonal conflicts to the point of losing the greater scope of the real battle, in a way it reminds me of the great Sirius Sybernetics Corp created by Douglas Adams in that the books great flaws are somewhat obscured by its shear number of small flaws. The plot advances not one whit from the previous book. The Climax of the previous book takes place halfway through this one and while it is speculated about, nobody ever bothers to discover what happened and those that do know have done nothing to get the news out despite the ability to Travel anywhere in the blink of an eye. Useful and Logical military thought is time and again discarded in favor of political conivence, and even clever strategies are undertaken in the most foolish manner to create false conflicts and cliffhangers that seemed forced and that would shame a serial novelist let alone an author who publishes at two and a half year intervals. Evil goes undetected despite overwhelming evidence and opportunity to see it, and the main hero has a cameo in his own book. Of course I am ten books into this series so I have to own this one, lately it has taken Jordan Three books to get the quailty that you got in one for the first five, so for all the potential readers out there I suggest that you wait for four years and read this one in context with the next two, that way it will not leave you frustrated for a couple years until you get to read the action half of this book spread out over the next two. The plot lines no longer intertwine and the characters no longer relate with each other, the entire world hangs by a thread and not a single person takes a single effective step in the entire book, there is no resolution and there is no satisfaction only grim waiting for Crossroads of Twilight II or whatever it will be called comes out after two years or so.

Because I'm a stupid ass author who doesn't know WHEN TO USE EVEN THE TINIEST BIT OF MODERATION.\\"That, right there, must be what goes through Robert Jordan's head when he writes. At least, it's what goes through my head when I listen to his drivel. GRARGH!Anyway, like I said before, I suggest that Robert Jordan just scrap it all and become a fashion designer. He obviously has an affinity for taking clothing entirely too seriously. Just think of it: some sultry woman with an exotic accent could read passages of his book to techno music while half-skeletal supermodels strut down the runway in his \\"Wheel of Time\\" clothing collection. I can totally see it."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"It's amazing, Jordan can spend years writing a book that we all hope is bringing to a close the end of an age. Yet through the first 400 pages we discover simply what everyone was up to when Rand and Nynaeve were cleansing the male source. And the remaining 300 pages, a few political issues. No threads concluded, no threads even advanced. Skip to book 11 and you probably won't even miss what happened in book 10."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Well I finally buckled down and and actually read this book and I have a few comments:Long ago someone told me that you should always start your criticsm with a little praise to make it go down better.Here goes. The sections of CoT that had Mat in them were pretty entertaining. Tuon is, suprisingly, a relatively unique woman and is not quite as annoying as almost all of the other women in this series. I can only assume it is because she talks rarely and we don't know what she is thinking.Now for the criticism. I could reiterate what everyone else said. I could complain about the minor character proliferation and the tedium of hearing about bad tea in virtually every plotline of the book (except Mat's - a sign of his quality no doubt). I could complain about the fact that nothing of any note happened and the fact the an event I was waiting for since book 6 - Logain meeting Rand - was given less time then Perrin buying grain. I could complain that all of the characters act like idiots - Rand, do you really want hundreds of channeling men supporting Mazrim Taim against you?; Egwene, is it really a good idea to wander around alone near a place you are besieging?; Elayne, could you just conquer Caemlyn and collect Carhien already?But instead I am going to mention some points I haven't seen so far in any of the other reviews.1. Why, when RJ treated us to so many scenes of channelers-with-their-mouths-hanging-open-at-at-the-huge-amount-of-channeling, did we NEVER see any of the Asha Mans' reactions to using saidin and finding it clean?!!! We get Rand, but I would have preferred hearing from an AM who didn't expect it. Surely that would have been interesting!2. Why do we constantly have tertiary characters eclipsing the main character's roles? Nynaeve, best Healer ever and most powerful AS for the Light a vital aid in the Last Battle? Now we get Sumeko who is way better at healing and Alivia and Sharina who are so much more powerful. Why would I care about these utterly uninteresting people who I barely know and don't want to know when I have invested 10 books of time in Nynaeve?!?!?!?!3. Ter-angreal and heartstone - no one has made it in like for ever. Or wait no, now we have it being made. Hardly worth mentioning.4. A while ago it used to be interesting when RJ focused on a minor character or seemingly uninteresting point. All of the WoTers would gather and wonder what makes that particular random person interesting and what it means to the larger plot. (Remember Fain?) Now we all just assume that it is yet another example of RJ getting distracted from the original story.A few requests, RJ:1. Can you please stop giving so many roles of vital importance to people we haven't heard of until like book 9? It just increases the impression that you are bored of your original characters and have no idea where you are going with the story.2. Can you kill Cadsuane before she teaches anyone anything? All of my hatred of Aes Sedai and bossy stupid women is now concentrated on her.3. Can you PLEASE stop it with the Shaido? I DON'T CARE. And no one else does either.4. If you aren't going to make the women in the series more likeable or realistic could you at least make them justified on occasion? My God - is there a single time when a woman in the series leaps to a unpleasant conclusion about a man correctly?"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Well, you might all think im crazy, but i really dont see whats wrong with this book. Sure, there might be more details than are strictly necessary, but there is still a lot going on, its just not right out in the open. If you just read into what it's saying more and think about the big picture, theres as much going on as in the others. Also, i dont see how you can even think there was nothing going on in eight and nine, they were two of the most important books in the series, with many very important developements. Frankly, i think book ten is about the same, just at a slightly slower pace.So, i guess what im saying is that i think youre crazy to think its no good anymore. If its been changing in quality at all its for the better. I would definitely recommend that anyone who likes fantasy and complicated stories should read the whole series. This story may be complicated, and it might not be easy to see all thats going on, but thats the best part of it. A series with everything in the open is the kind thats really boring. Anyway if ive been rambling, sorry. The point is, this book is a lot better than you guys say."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I liked the book very much.

Yes, the positions of people didn't change much. Yes, the ending was anti-climactic. I personally was highly disappointed with the ending when I first read it. I also cried out \\"NOTHING HAPPENED!!!!! ONLY ONE PERSON MOVED!!!!\\" (Hence 4 stars.)However, if you read the series as a whole this book, to me, isn't meant to be a stand-alone book. Not every book in a huge series like this needs to be life-altering. I think of this book as a part of the whole and can't wait for the next one to be released. (I just hope it's action packed!)If you've read the rest of the series but you're worried about being \\"bored\\" and annoyed with this book, I suggest you get over it and pick it up anyway. If you've already read this book and hated it, I suggest you read it again with the mindset of \\"so that explains what they're doing\\"."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"If you don't like the book(s); don't READ THEM.

The book is an amazing piece which only gets better when you reread the whole series because you notice every detail robert jordan gives you in the books before it. This book is literature, he has created a whole new world and if you cant find that interesting then maybe you should stick to Harry Potter style which is , he went to the store and got a wand.

Some of my favorite characters has very little or no lines and it gives the feel of being made for the next book that will come out. Generally it is great for people wanting a little escape from this world yet the pace is way too slow for my liking (covering 4 weeks of WoT time). Great for hardcore WoT fans yet casual readers might feel it boring.

Frankly this is what RJ's Book 10 of WOT deserves. Call me all sorts of a fool, but I started with Book 1 and have read NOTHING ELSE but this series, one after the other. I have now finished Book 10 and am humbly grateful that there is no Book 11 to even half tempt me with: &quot;Surely it's going to start FINISHING soon&quot;. Rand will never fight the final battle, Elayne is only just pregnant so it will take at least another three books to bring her to term, the internal politics of Tar Valon and the Tower have the Aes Sedai characters so blind-sided they are literally disappearing up their own backsides and as for the rest of the characters ... please, enough! I have also come to detest RJ's endless descriptions of what women can do with their eyes - flay a man's skin, drill holes through them, chill, frost, bake, burn etc - ad nauseum. WOT started off a pretty decent yarn a long, long time ago (in ages past) now it's just a penny dreadful with the women spending most of their time &quot;planting their fists on their hips&quot;, &quot;glaring&quot; &quot;opening their mouths&quot; [only to shut them again] and &quot;smoothing their skirts&quot;. WOT stops here for me. I'm disappointed in myself that I have spent nearly a year reading this drivel. Enough.

Stop describing clothing and get to the point!I felt cheated and will not buy the next book until it is out in paperback...or maybe (god forbid) I'll just borrow it from the library and save the money."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Jordan has dragged this story line so far and introduced so many damn characters that this book is akin to a blithering fools ravings. He's got so many stories going that by my count the entire book takes up less than two weeks worth of time. TWO WEEKS in 600 pages! He had captured my imagination with the early books but now I'm sick of struggling through the last three books every time he switches a story to try to find the names of the people he is describing and why they are important. Worse, I'm tired of seeing similar Aes Sedai names and trying to remember why they are important instead of hearing about their damn dresses.The man can describe things like a minstrel, but that is all he does in this book. He describes bread and grain and mud and snow and cold, meanwhile the main characters don't do ANYTHING! BOO HISS!"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Now apart from any complaints about fractured storylines and glacial pace of the books I find that RJ's concept of magic has grown more and more ludicrous as the books progressed. Take the Aes Sedai for example. These women study often for at least ten or twenty years before achieving the shawl. Yet these three gits(you know who I'm talking about) acquired the shawl in about one year without any real training in the tower. To top it off they are far more competent than the Aes Sedai. Why should any woman have to go to the tower? RJ takes away the mysteriousness of the Aes Sedai and makes it seem like no great achievement.For three thousand years women have studied terangreal and could never figure out how to make one of their own. Along comes the stupid up herself Elayne and makes one of her own. RJ makes the white tower appear to be foolish and incompetent.Egwene can now make cuendillar after a bit of direction from Moghedien. Even Mog couldn't make it with all the knowledge of the age of legends behind her. What makes egwene so special?Worst of all is Nynaeve. Being able to heal stilling? Ridiculous!Again, none of the forsaken were able to accomplish this with all their knowledge put together! RJ had the potential to make a tragic character in Siuan and Leanne. Instead these idiots are now sniffing, bickering Aes Sedai like all the rest.So RJ can't kill characters and he can't let characters suffer even a little bit. But he is able to let us, the readers suffer from this trash he calls writing. I for one am done with this ridiculous farce of a series."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Okay, first off the good:****SPOILERS IN MY REVIEW*******(Don't read if you haven't read the book)Good: I guess I just have kind of a demented mind or something, because I particularly enjoyed all the torture that Faile has been put through. I liked it when Perrin got pissed and cut off the Aiel's hand. I enjoyed Egwene getting captured since she is such a stupid woman and totally deserved it. I like the few times that Matt has put the daughter of the nine moons in her place, but unfortunately she gets her way far too often.Bad: I hate Elayne and everything involving her stupid crown, realm, people, nobles, blah blah blah blah.....I think that Rand should just take the crown for himself and have Elayne as the head of his Harem. I mean, he's already got 3 women! He could have even more if he wanted...who know's? By the end of the series he could have one for each day of the week! It's really annoying that RJ continues to add more characters to the story that I have absolutely no interest in. It's also annoying that the first half of the book involved people \\"talking\\"(not actually doing anything) about how they \\"felt\\" about Rand and Nynaeve's power burst(cleansing Saidin)from book 9. They didn't even know that is what they did. They just felt the \\"power\\" and were confused about it. Does it really take hundreds of pages to explain that?Finally, the UGLY: I don't skip ANYTHING when I read books, because I'm too worried about missing any tiny little important detail. Because of this I was rewarded with the special treat of reading about the colors, designs, and histories involved with thousands of different types of clothing. I am not exaggerating when I say that approximately 90% of the book was filled with clothing descriptions. I don't even know any WOMEN who care this much about clothes...not even my WIFE! Also, I really hate all the simpering, sniffing, skirt smoothing, tea sipping, teeth gritting, hot/cold ignoring, stuck-up Aes Sedai! I would love to see the Black Tower destroy the White Tower or at least collar all the sisters like slaves.I have to finish this series since I've devoted so much time already. However, if you haven't started-DON'T!Read Terry Goodkind's \\"Sword of Truth\\" series instead! It has become my all time favorite series after reading this book.

Two books back I would have been sitting on the fence...but now I'm more and more convinced that these books are just being churned out to line JR and his publishers pockets.About 700 pages of this book (hardback) could have been tossed out without any loss to the overall plot. It's *that* full of filler. I'm tired of reading two pages dissertations every time a woman adjusts and article of clothing (and trust me, not 5 pages go by without this happening...if the characters spent as much time fighting the bad guys as they do wanking around we'd be done and back in Two Rivers, eating pie and talking about old times by now).

However, as an avid consumer of fiction, I believe that I am somewhat qualified to comment on the 'Wheel of Time' debacle.The first five or six books were fantastic. Plot threads were opened, existing conflicts were worked up to fever pitch, and everything hummed along at a comfortable pace. I will finish your series, if _you_ ever decide to, on the strength of the promise in these groundbreaking pieces of art.Since then, the vitality of your story has been continually eroded, for motives which are as yet unclear. The latest novel crossed a very special line for me, beyond which I start skipping pages. Surely this is not your intention?In the interest of resolving the situation, I suggest the following. Put down the pen, have a beer (trust me, I can wait), and then give book 10 an honest read. If you can't figure out where you went wrong, get in your late model Rolls, drive down to the Millionaire Paper Wasters Club, and ask David Eddings to tell you.Kindest regardsKeith Smith"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I was out of work on disability this summer with a back injury that kept me in bed for weeks. After reading everything in the house, I was thrilled that book 10 was here and that it was so many pages since I had so much time on my hands. $40 and days later I ended the book feeling totally violated.Robert Jordan has truly reached a new low. If I had turned a piece of crap like this to a creative writing professor I would still be reeling from the hit to my GPA. This is truly the worse piece of fantasy fiction I have had the displeasure of slogging through.I mean, did he even READ this book? Clearly the editor didn't. RJ has become another bitter hack milking his cash cow for all its worth. After reading the review about his behavior at the book signing, its clear he's another Stephen King.

I couldn't make it through Path of Daggers because it seemed to me to be too much like the 7th book -- BORING. After reading the reviews of the 8th book, 9th book, and now this 10th book in the series, I see I've made the right choice. All I can say is, for those of you who feel like you have too much time invested in this series to quit reading, you are wrong. Think of it like investing in a stock where the price keeps falling and falling with no end in sight. Would you continue pumping money into that stock just because you've already lost a ton? NO! That's called &quot;throwing good money after bad,&quot; and it's the same thing you're doing with your time by continuing to let Jordan rip you off with these books.Just stop buying them. Don't reward him for his complacency and laziness. Read George R.R. Martin's Game of Thrones series or something (anything!) else. Heap your financial rewards on an author who cares about his readers. Jordan clearly no longer does and doesn't deserve any of our money."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"How can Robert Jordan write 700+ pages and have each of his characters in virtually the same position they were in at the beginning?With all the other Wheel of Time books, I got to a point where I couldn't put it down. With this one, I got to a point where I couldn't wait to get it over so I could read the next Aubrey/Maturin novel on my shelf.The novel goes on and on and on amid endless discussions and reflections by all the characters about what a tight spot they're in--which they are--and at the end, they're in the same tight spots. NOTHING of significance has occurred! A reader could skip this book entirely (and what a time-saver that would be), go from &quot;Winter's Heart&quot; to whatever the sequel to &quot;Crossroads&quot; will be, and not miss a thing.All the little details of Jordan's rich world began to look like meaningless filler; I became very conscious of how frequently the Aes Sedai twitch/smooth/adjust their shawls, and of how the Ilianer accent do be coming out when an Ilianer character do be stressed. The fact that nothing actually happens in this volume, combined with the fact that the next Wheel of Time book is a prequel to &quot;Eye of the World&quot;, makes me wonder if Jordan has just run dry."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"If you're considering buying this book, I want to look down at the bottom of this page and note the number of customer reviews. Everything, I'm going to say has already probably been said by them, but I will continue on out of ego. What drove so many people to their keyboards? Simply, rage. I know that's the case with me anyways, dear readers. I wasted an entire summer on these books hoping desperately that their former glory would somehow blaze back into life. Sadly, I was mistaken. Reading these novels now is just like drinking microwaved coffee.I'm sure Jordan has never read Hemingway. The former may look like the latter, but old rough and tough Ernest wouldn't waste time describing dresses when, I don't know, he could be instilling artistic value into the prose. What about Jordans characterizations, though, you ask? (You're probably not asking that,but just go along with it.) Well, and this may be shocking, Jordan's world happens to be filled by personality dopplegangers. It's as if every woman's genetic code was locked into the same sequence for all eternity. Oh, sure they may look different (it's mostly because of the dresses, I think), but they all possess the exact same persona that is, basically, Jordan's botched attempt at a strong woman. I cannot take another exclamation of \\"Men!\\" I guess that's some sort of mantra that let's you know they're REAL strong women. It must be far more effective than actually instilling them with depth of character and the ability to triumph in adverse circumstances. Then there are his male characters, who are either jerks or, in Perrin's case, lesser jerks who you hate anyways.But, the most greivous sin Jordan committs here is the utter stagnation of the plot. Nothing happens. Most of its an intricate dance of braid pulling and smoothing of skirts. Rand is barely in it. Which, doesn't really matter, it's not as if he's been doing anything great for the past couple books. Tuon is terribly uninteresting, because, well, I've seen her many times before. She's just part of Jordan's mad scheme to make sure every character's paired up and in everlasting love. Which brings me to a point. Why must Rand have three girlfriends? If that is not the most teenage boy-oriented plot device ever employed. And guess what, ones blonde, ones a rehead, and the other's a brunette. Just thinking about it makes me want to cast down modern literature.Run from this novel."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This series has introduced so many characters, mysteries, and plot-lines that it is just too much to keep track of without some sort of chart and database. Crossroads of Twilight just added more. Robert Jordan just isn't creative enough to keep all these new plot points interesting. In the end this magnified all of Jordan's other flaws. The book just irritated me. The endless descriptions of clothing. The smoothing of skirts or gritting of teeth (the only two ways women in Jordan's world show emotion). How every woman is incredibly manipulative and thinks all men are idiots that should just stay out of the way. A good book should stir up certain emotions in the reader, but annoyance is not one of them.Many of the reviews defending this book say that it creates more mysteries and more political intrigue. The problem is that WoT does not need more mystery and political intrigue. As I read this book, many chapters ended with some sort of mystery or cliff-hanger, but I no longer cared. Jordan said in 700 pages what could have been said in 100. How this book made it past the editor is a mystery to me."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I have been reading this series loyally since I first picked up Eye of the World six years ago(1998). I loved it and all of the books up to A Path of Daggers. Winter's Heart was tough. That was the book where i started to feel that jordan had lost his way. The only reason I say that it is average is that something happened in the END! Yet, i feel that i should not have to say that about a Robert Jordan book. I was hoping this was just slight slip up on the path to a bright and glorious series. I wish I had realized that Jordan was setting me up for an immense disappointment. Crossroads of Twilight ( the one book in the series i had to purchase in hardcover, i will never forgive myself) is literary feces. It reeked of boredom and little plot movement. The sad part is that i could tell this as soon as i read the Prologue and First Chapter. It was impossible to read beyond that. I honestly believe that Jordan is either trying to make more money by selling filler or that he simply has lost his creative passion, spark, etc. I recommend Crossroads of Twilight for the blind, the stupid, the foolish, and/or the fanatical(who take blindness, stupidity, foolishness to the levels of income Jordan makes writing this....filler). After all, it is only these types that will continue to purchase filler/literary feces. The best thing to do is to teach Jordan a valuable lesson about greed and not buy the rest of the series. I am offended, angered and very disappointed by this recent offering Jordan calls a book.However, for those of you interested in a series and author who is leagues above Jordan in writing ability and integrity, I recommend A Song of Fire and Ice series by the great George R. R. Martin. Martin takes his time writing his books. He explains that he does this to ensure the reader receives a polished literary gem of the utmost quality(not a direct quote but the general idea he is trying to convey to demanding readers). So stop buying and reading Jordan and start reading something WORTH YOUR TIME AND MONEY!"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Unlike many people, I will not say this is the worst book I've ever read. I've been in school too many years for that. However, I will say that it is a disturbing continuation of a trend Jordan clearly began with The Path of Daggers.For those who maybe lost track of the series, you'll remember that the first five books are generally noted to be great. Heck, I'll even say the first seven books were great. I had no problems with the series to that point.Then came The Path of Daggers. The problem with that book was that it was somewhat inconsequential. Example (spoiler), to my recollection, the Aes Sedai army moved through gates to the country surrounding Dragonmount to begin their siege of Tar Valon at the end of The Path of Daggers (cf. p. 670). In Winter's Heart, they appeared to be back in Murandy (cf. p. 578). Not to mention that at the end of Crown of Swords, Mat was under a pile of rubble, under which he remained until the middle of Winter's Heart.Winter's Heart stands out amongst the last three books in that it is the one book in which something actually takes place.I think that the major problem that most people will have with Crossroads of Twilight is that nothing happens (not entirely true, a couple of &quot;oooh&quot; events do take place). That is to say that there is no climax to this book at all. When you turn the last page and find a glossary following, there is a good chance you will ask aloud, &quot;Where's the rest of the story?&quot;In the end, herein is the major problem of this book above all others: there is no climax for any of the major storylines. A better title for this book would likely be &quot;A Day in the Life of.&quot; That is what it comes out to: each storyline progresses minutely, building up to something that hopefully will come in the next book, but very little advancement is made in any of them (except in one or two storylines). You could well read the teaser about this book and have someone catch you up for a minute or two before the next book and be ready to go. And therein is the tragedy of this book.It also bears noting that the story begun in the prologue (which was sold on the internet in e-book form before the actual release of the book) is entirely dropped after the prologue ends. The book completely fails to continue that story.Jordan lost in the last three books (with a slight exception in WH) what made him so good in the first seven books: a sense of purpose and a story that actually moved. When the next book comes out, I think it will be apparent to many that this book could have been condensed a bit and slapped on to the next one. Crossroads of Twilight was a disappointment."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Okay...I admit I stopped reading this series at about book 7, I think. I couldn't remember the plot from one book to the next anymore and it finally got to the point that I just didn't care. After throwing that book across the room at the end and having a small tantrum, I was through. Jordan has a very narrow way of seeing people and his characters simply NEVER develop. There were elements that left me gnashing my teeth through Book 1 (the braid pulling and the gender issues for example). The reason I continued to read was because there WERE redeeming plot devices and ideas that made it worth overcoming the character shortfalls. Those reasons died on the vine, with the originality gone all we have left are the annoying character defects. Frankly, I have had much more fun reading about people coming to these same conclusions then I ever did by reading Mr. Jordans books themselves. Maybe Amazon could make a selection of the top 100 rips and publish them...it'd be far more entertaining than this series WAS.I think it is very sad that people say that because I don't &quot;appreciate&quot; Jordan's &quot;nuance&quot; that I would be more entertained by hack and slash novels....hahaha keep kidding yourselves. Just wait and see exactly how much nuance you can handle. I hope someday we ALL grow up and realize that Jordan's characters never will."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I think RJ has gone crazy. The first 5 books were literally fantastic, complex yes but absolutely spell binding. The next 4 were good but not the very best, still enjoyable. This last book though could be better used as a door stop or cindeling for a fire that would last for a few hours. I usually read these books through at least two or three times, but I couldn't even finish glancing through this one. It reads like this &quot;It is so hard being a princes and pregnant.cry.cry.cry, I think I'll have some tea. Not to much honey in the tea though. I shouldn't make it so sweet..I like sweet tea though...ooo I am so sad...If only I knew what happened yesterday really far away...O this tea is perfect not too sweet or bitter...I think I'll have a cookie with my tea...but not a sweet cookie&quot; I think that with a 18 pack of jolt cola and a free night I could write a novel that people would really enjoy. Things would happen, people would do things, webs would be woven, it would not just restate what everone already knew from 2 dozen different angles. I really hope the next book is better and I mean in the first 200 pages or so because I cant read another book like this. If it is good any new readers and just skip over this novel and pick up in the next one because it is a 600 page prologue where nothing takes place. RJ needs to go back to eigth grade lit, and remember that a novel needs: characters, and setting, and o yes a PLOT and ACTION and some kind of CLIMAX and RESOLUTION."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"At the outset of Jordan's famed Wheel of Time series, I thought it was good. Yet one aspect of the series has annoyed me to no end. Every book in the series has, either on the cover or just inside, the clearly erroneous statement from some reviewer: &quot;Jordan has come to dominate the world Tolkien began to reveal.&quot;This most recent installment only reinforces what all of us knew from the first; Tolkien has and still dominates that very world that Tolkien came to reveal. I am sick of hearing comparisons. Robert Jordan is an author who thinks of something and writes it down for a relatively small audience and evidently pays little attention to editing and proofreading. Lately, it seems he is stretching his ideas for the sake of his own finances. He is rehashing the same literary machines used by sci fi and fantasy authors throughout the twentieth century. Tolkien spent nearly his entire life constructing a mythology based on language and influenced in part by his experience fighting one of the most terrible of European wars. His book has been read more than any other book in the twentieth century save THE BIBLE. His prose is impeccable, the result of countless revisions and the knowledge that comes with being a doctor of the English language. The book has been received by the world and he has entered the annals of human history as one of its great authors.Jordan is destined for no such greatness. His first few books are good, but limited to the realm of fantasy, destined to enjoy status as cult classics. His most recent installments, this one especially, have eliminated any hope of comparing him to Tolkien or any of the truly great authors, genre notwithstanding.Altogether, Jordan has a pretty good fantasy series, but don't expect to see anyone call him the author of the century, however long the wheel of time turns."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Book 10 in TWoT is irrelevant. Only a single chapter follows Rand Al'Thor, and he is present only briefly in one of the remaining 29 chapters.Through the 7,000-odd pages of books one through nine, a central factor in the storyline is that the male half of the One Power is tainted, turning any man who uses it insane. After nine books of building this up, and leaving readers hanging with Rand attempting to cleanse the male half of the power at the end of book nine, Jordan dedicates only a single sentence, in chapter 24 no less, to the results of Rand's efforts and this central theme of the series.Jordan has the audacity of failing to continue existing storylines while introduces even more storylines. How many more books should we expect to resolve these new story lines, when 10 books have not resolved the existing sub-plots?This series is a failure. It started out wonderfully, with a rich world to explore and an engaging main character. Unfortunately the main character has been pushed aside in an ever increasing midden heap of irrelevant details, sub-plots, and un-interesting supporting characters who are given more time in each subsequent book than the main characters.I will not buy another book in this series or from Robert Jordan, nor will I recommend it to others. I have been cheated."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This is the first time I've ever found the phrase 'You can't judge a book by its cover' to be literally true. I am convinced that whatever lingering action now contained in Jordan's books (and usually appearing within 10 pages of the end) is inserted simply so the artist has something to put on the cover of the book. Why? Because if the cover of each book accurately reflected what has become the endless norm of Jordan's tomes, namely a bunch of uptight Aes Sedai on a shopping trip or sitting around in a room tugging on various bodyparts like braids or earlobes (and not even one another's, which might be mildy amusing or intriguing), NO ONE WOULD BUY IT.Scroll up a bit and take a look at the cover of 'Crossroads of Twilight'. Click on it for a larger view. At first blush, it seems to suggest something is actually happening..perhaps Matt is actually reacting to an enemy, that the party has been ambushed by Forsaken in the wild, that they must battle or struggle or at least do something not involving petticoats. But no. Never happens. Ironically enough, now I think all the cover represents is the series itself, at bay in a sea of savagely angry ex-fans. As it should be.One could make a pretty good argument that there is fraud, or false advertising, or some form of bait-and-switch involved in the increasingly hilarious disconnect between the cover of the book and its tedious, U.N. General Assembly Transcript-like contents, or one could simply stop caring at all. Judging by the other reviews, think most folks have already decided."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I agree it's very wordy compared to the prior WOTs. Jordan uses much more very vivid, explicite and descriptive prose. I found it helped when I slowed my reading speed, and taste and chew every sentence, and try to visualize the scenes. Even then some paragraphs and scenes go on too long and are repetative, sort of like a Mojo JoJo speech (powerpuff girls reference). If you try to read quickly, it is definitely not a satisfying read at all.I'm still immersed in the WOT world, and will patiently wait for the next one. I do hope Jordan goes back to his original writing style and pace though. I don't want to wait 10 more years for this grand epic to come to a close..."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I recall spending a great deal of time grinning maniacally while I read Crossroads of Twilight. The world is meshing together in a beautiful pattern of twisted plot threads slowly pulling tighter to reveal a pattern. If you can't handle being required to think on your own, you might not want to read this book. Or the series. Otherwise, settle in for another glorious volume of tangled intrigue, plotting, webs of deception, and Moridin. Anybody who says the latest books lack interesting content has obviously overlooked Moridin, who is quite possibly the most amusing character, apart from Mat. If you think Jordan has lost his touch, then look elsewhere, but don't spoil it for someone else just because you think you could do a better job."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I must say that I am totally pleased with how the series is going. And that I am also a little peeved by all the people bashing the book. Thus I decided to write this review. So as for how the books are going, I love details and Robert Jordan inundates me with them. I am almost overwhelmed by them at first, but when I continue reading, they make sense, and if I miss a detail, it is not the end of the world. The latest book in the series follows this. There is plenty of action, just spaced out in the book. And the detail too is relevant, not just meaningless. I don't really know what to say, except that I love the series and want Robert Jordan to continue the way he is going, and if you get too frustrated with the series, try to sit back and picture the book as a puzzle. Only half the pieces are on the table, but it is enough to give you an idea what is going to happen, but there are also many odd shaped pieces that don't seem to have a home anywhere in the puzzle. So instead of getting frustrated with the pieces that don't fit, try to guess where they might fit, or where the story might go next. If you are looking for a good site to visit where exactly this happens, there are tons of them if you look. And my final words are for story reading in general and the series. When I am reading a good book, the world it takes place in, be it a fantasy world, Israel during WWII, or a world much like our own, totally envelops me. While I am reading that book, I eat, sleep, and breath the plot. And when I finish, I am happy to be done and to have a resolution to the story, but in a way I am also disappointed to have my world that I have lived in for the last few days vanish. This is not the case with the Wheel of Time. I read the book in a day or two, but the series never quits. At times, I will even go back over and re-read some of the books to pick up possible details I might have missed, and every detail added to my imaginary world makes it that much more realistic, and enjoyable. So I'm not saying that you have to make The Wheel of Time your life to enjoy it, you just have to recognize the ability it takes to creat a world so fantastic and yet so realistic, and enjoy the books for what they are; A road to a different world, away from the mundane life."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"The overall rating of this novel..... is a two. I don't understand why people are so ignorant. So this is nearly seven hundred pages of setting up events for the next installment; It is needed. People have gotten so used to the action in the first eight novels that they don't understand that to truly create an intricate novel you must have to scheming, the spying, the ideas, and the emotions that flow through the characters at any given point. I for one enjoy being able to sit down and read a novel that makes me think without immediately getting caught up in a battle."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"O.K. I pumped it up to five stars because I have a difference of opinion. It is easy to dismiss one or two books within a ten book series. I look at this series as a large web that Jordan describes in the book. Most of this book is set-up. I was disappointed like many in the lack of action but I see this as a contiuation to one giant story and not just one book. Call it a boring chapter. All books have them. I believe this series will have a great ending but I don't see it happening for at least three books. Too many characters and too many unanswered questions still remain...too many loose threads. You will buy this book regardless of any review if you have read the previous nine books."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"It is indeed true that this book is quite detailed, and that the plot does move somewhat slowly. However, the series should be viewed as one gargantuan novel, and all novels have slower parts. These &quot;slower parts&quot; normally lead up to an exciting climax, and the stage that Jordan set in Book 10 will make for Book 11 very exciting indeed. Readers who first pick up The Eye of the World should have known that the series they chose to read would be a long, rather detailed one. Indeed, it is very much like an epic. While much of it is filled with detail, it presents a literary feast for those willing to truly enjoy it, and observe it as a piece of literature rather than a quick read."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Ok, so there was no &quot;action&quot; in this book. I am astounded at Robert Jordans talent! It must be incredibly difficult to write a book that contains lost of dialogue and ALOT of thoughts, and still keep people reading! I loved the feeling of &quot;everything is coming to a head really soon!&quot;Thank you Robert Jordan for the wonderful book, and the inspiration!"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Although many people are bashing this book, I find it to be one of the best in the series. Many seem to think that nothing important happened in this book, but that is far from the truth. In Crossroads of Twilight, Robert Jordan brings to the reader the current situations of all the major characters in the story. Even though this takes 3/4 of the novel, it is necessary to bring the reader up to speed, and is also quite good. The last part of the book is fantastic, although it ends on quite a cliffhanger. It shows that Jordan is finally heading toward the Last Battle. Everything in the series is finally coming together. I, for one, cannot wait until the next book. Jordan has not lost his knack for writing, as some seem to think. This book will definitely attest to that."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I overall really enjoyed this book it helped pick up a series that had kind of been gettin g boring for me. In this book Jordan mainly advances the subplots of the story i kinda liked that becuase i thought the subplots really needed to have more time spent on them. The only thing i did not like about this book was Elayne's POV her chapters seemed to just drag on and by the end i wanted to never read another page about elayne. Other then that though i really enjoyed this book."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Although many of you have given this less than stunning reviews, I will be the one to come forward and give a good review to a book that I, honestly, loved more than any book in this series since the sixth book (just about when you could justifiably ask what is happening to the books).Many noted that it advanced nothing but (and I will give a spoiler warning for the next few sentences) Perrin is right there, about to take the Aeil, Matt is about to marry the Daughter of the Nine Moons, Rand has sent a peace treaty to the Senchean to gain alleigence for the upcoming Last Battle (and Matt's amrriage will most likely seal this deal), the rebel Ai'sedi are at Tar Valon and Egwene is inside the White Tower (granted as a captive). All of this sets up for a VERY exciting eleventh book and a FINAL twelveth book (Jordan said the series will end at 12, but he said the same at book 3. I'm going to trust him on this though as the books actually seem to be wrapping up).Others say it is boring. I will give you that to an extent. It is boring during parts if you are not prepared, but I found it not only palatable, but also a book I couldn't put down at times (an experience I had not gotten since book five). Honestly, the prolouge was the best I've read, ever, in any of the books. Call me crazy, but it set up the story well with a blend of excitement and interesting information fleshing out the world Jordan has created even more than it already was (especially in how politics work, which I found almost mesmorising).How did I gain such excitement out of a truely bland book (I will admit it is nothing compared to the first five of the series). The way I did it was simply abstinence. I stopped reading it for about 8 months then read synopsis of the first 9 books, which got me jazzed up enough to almost convince me to read all the books again. I then read to book, which I saw in a new light. The 8 and 9 books were mind numbingly boring, but after reading their synopsis I realized just how much I loved reading the whole story, I remembered all the details I had forgotten and facts the synopsis didn't cover I remembered acutely.Sure it is a stretch, having to read synopsis of all the books just to gain joy out of the tenth seems a cheat on Jordan's part, shouldn't the book be good in and of itself? Yes. But that doesn't make this book bad. The tenth was a filler, but the eleventh was a bridge (just like Tolkein's The Two Towers, ultimatley boring, but it set up the best one of them all), and this is why I'm convinced that the next book will be one of the best of the series, and the one after to be the last. And I will be sad, like a true fan should be, not relieved, and definitely I won't abandon it in its final stretch. In a marathon only the beginning and end are ever exciting, just getting started fast, and ending fast. The rest is just running. I'm convinced this series in turing onto the home stretch."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"No matter how quickly or how slowly Jordan wraps up this series, there is no excuse for this exercise in inaction. There are, maybe, 6 pages of enjoyable reading in this tome, of which, possibly 2 advance the plot. This is far worse than 6, 7, or 8 in the series - something I thought, and hoped, I would never write.If you've read the prior nine, then you may want to wait for this to be remaindered, or read it softbound. You could probably learn everything you need to know from the book in 5 minutes on line (which isn't much).Otherwise, frankly, it isn't worth your time unless you graduated at the top of an Evelyn Wood Speed-Reading Class. One can only hope that if Jordan does decided to wrap this up soon, that he will deliver at least two decent novels to end the series, and make amends with the public that has supported him over the years."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Wow, what a poor excuse for a novel and WoT book. Terrible, slow, boring, horrendous...I really hope Jordan kills this series soon and gets back to his earlier writing style asap."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"It was an excercise in spelling strings of words that, while were syntactically correct, amounted to a negligible amount more than vaccum in deep space. Does it matter how many books in the beginning of the series I cherished, how I spent hours upon hours relishing the PLOT and the UNIQUE characters, how excited I got with cataclysmic EVENTS and sudden INSIGHTS on character DEVELOPMENT, or how the multi-layered plot lines almost DANCED in their PROGRESSION?In the end this is the singly most shameful release of a fiction book I have ever come across. I will not buy the next one until I get a chance to read it from the library."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"As an ardent fan who re-reads the series at least once a year this was a very disappointing volume.Much of the text summarizes historical info - a waste for anyone who has read the series. Perhaps the series is getting too long?Also, very little happens. I believe Jordan is a victim of multiple plot lines - we get chunks of info about Mat, then Perrin, then Elayne, and then Egwene before a little update on Rand. There is no connection - it is like pieces of 5 books slapped together.My suggestion - merge people together so you can cover some ground or put out separate books.I will get the next volume - I hope I am not disappointed again."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"What the heck was Robert Jordan smoking?! Half the book is going over what exactly happened during a moment during the previous book. Only one new plotline is introduced. This could have been cut waaaaaaaaaay down and made into part of the previous book. Seriously, this is only recommended for utter WoT junkies. Wait for the paperback."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"If I could give this book a zero, I would have. It is incrediblethat Jordan could not conclude even one of several possible adventures, i.e. Matt and Tuon, Queen of Andor, battle for the White tower, etc. Instead, we are treated to insignificant snippets of the (now) zillion story threads. OK...I didn't expect the last battle. But I did expect something and got zip."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Well, I have read, and re-read the WoT series a few times, and I enjoy picking out little details that I had missed the 1st time through. Unlike many readers, I had no complaint about how the series may, or may not have dragged in the last few books. But this time around it was just too much. I can understand that the WoT is in reality just one massive book, but the details that just went on and on in Crossroads of Twilight made my mind numb. Where in other WoT books I've read with a hunger because Im enjoying the story, this time I found myself just skimming the pages in hopes that something/anything, of interest happening. Im sorry, but RJ blew it this time, if I have to wait 1/2 of forever for the next book in the line, odds are I wont buy it. Hopefully Jordan and his publisher will understand they let out a disaster, and will get the next book out rapidly to try to salvage the WoT."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"As many before me have stated, the book has failed to capitalize on the promise of the previous few books. Jordan has spun such a tangled web that it takes many hundreds of pages to advance the plot minimally. Yes,things appear to be wrapping up, and I'm still excited that the finale (whever it might come) will be spectacular, but the only reason to read the book is to get that much closer to the end (which I hope will come soon!)"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"What is most surprising is that some people gave it 2-5 stars when it deserves less than zero. The WOT series was never that good in the first place. And you wonder why the fantasy genre never gets respected."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Someone once said \\"old generals never die, they just fade away.\\"When I first began reading the Wheel of Time series, I thought that Robert Jordan was in the process of writing one of the best fantasy stories ever written. However, with book ten of the series, I've come to the conclusion; this is a potentially great story that instead of coming to a climax is just going to fade away. Even though I want to know how the story ends, is it worth the effort to keep plowing through thick books that make little, if any, progress towards resolution.Couldn't the author tie up at least one dangling plot line in a 680 page book? Instead, the author continues to add tensions, conflicts, characters, and unresolved plotlines with every book in the series. At this point, unless you have a very good memory, the reader almost needs a synopsis of the previous nine books before every chapter. In fact, it occasionally appears that even the author has forgotten.Robert Jordan has the potential of being a great writer. I'm distressed that he has permitted himself to become bogged down with side plots and peripheral characters. I really do want to know how he resolves the story of Rand, Mat, and Perrin. I'm just afraid that \\"Crossroads\\" in the title may be an indication that it is going to take him ten more books to finish it."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Well here we have it folks, another typical &quot;Crossroads of Twilight&quot; defender:PREVIOUS REVIEWER: &quot;If people out there don't like reading the books, and haven't liked reading them for a while, well, isn't there quite an obvious solution to your problem?&quot;We continue to read the books (even though a lot of us &quot;haven't liked reading them for a while&quot;) because we liked the first several novels in the series. We know that even though the last several books have been of distinctly lower quality we remember that they used to be better and because of this we believe (or are at least trying to believe!) that there's a chance that they can be better again. It angers a lot of people when they see something that had such potential decline due to less than honorable motives (ie., a drawn out series to milk loyal fans for their money).PREVIOUS REVIEWER: &quot;Instead of clogging up review sites with your petty sneering, stop reading the books and leave the reviews to the people that would be probably looking to buy the book...&quot;What are review sites for? Why are we given the option of 1 or 2 stars as well as 3, 4 or 5? Are review sites only supposed to be for good reviews? Why do people VISIT review sites to begin with? To reassure themselves with false hopes so that they can spend their hard-earned cash on a book of poor quality written by a man who is more interested now in milking his loyal fans rather than loyalty towards his fans themselves?PREVIOUS REVIEWER: &quot;When you read The Wheel Of Time...You read it for an INTRICATE TAPESTRY OF SUBTLE TWISTS AND TRUNS (&quot;turns&quot;?) that WEAVE TOGETHER into gradually larger and larger patterns...As the STORIES GROW IN SCOPE, they deserve the length that Robert Jordan gives them...The pace of these books allows the story, and the characters, to have some INTEGRITY - look it up in the dictionary, because you won't find it within yourself.&quot; (The caps are my emphasis).Hmmm: INTRICATE TAPESTRY OF SUBTLE TWISTS AND TURNS...sorry, but after reading this book , I don't see anything at all intricate or subtle...all I see is a huge mass of needless, mind-numbing detail. The first several books were great because the description provided in them added to a new world that we wanted to know more about. What is added to Randland in this volume?The STORIES GROW IN SCOPE and WEAVE TOGETHER...I hate to contradict you gain, but the stories don't grow at all in this book and certainly nothing weaves together: quite the opposite. More and more pointless characters are introduced and the myriad plot lines are all the unresolved. I don't see any WEAVING TOGETHER of anything whatsoever.And the characters having INTEGRITY? Come on! They characters are all one-dimenional bores! When you get right down to it, there are only two kinds of characters in this huge, sprawling epic: males and females, the males being clueless indecisive fools and the females being whiney obnoxious...I'll refrain from using any of the many colorful metaphores that come to mind.Anyway, to wrap this up, I would like to say that I'd like to know the previous reviewers' ideas of SUBTLE TWISTS AND TURNS, of WEAVING TOGETHER, of STORIES with SCOPE and characters with INTEGRITY. Perhaps he could have provided us with some examples from &quot;Crossroads of Twilight&quot;. Oh wait, I forgot!

He wrote a very interesting book. It was long. It was fast-paced. It was captivating, and it kept readers in suspense until the thrilling conclusion. Then he wrote a sequel, which was as good. Then he wrote another sequel, and another, and another, each longer. They stopped interesting readers, who kept on, hoping only (in my case, anyway) to see Rand die a horrible, whiny death.The plotline is still fascinating, and all the different facets of the world have the detail reminiscent of Tolkien (as they should, since it's very, very based on Tolkien. Or so I think, innyhoo). It should be good, but it isn't. It drags. And drags. And drags, leaving a slimy trail of clothing descriptions in its wake. We do not want to hear about silks and jarring color schemes! We do not want to know the details of every single performance of magic done by the Aes Sedai or how many balls Mat juggles or just how Perrin is looking for Faile or bloody how Rand is demeaning women in a new way! We just want the plotline to get up from the ditch it has fallen in, look around, realize it's been sleeping for the past two, three books and get a move on!Stop transcribing every word every character speaks. Stop with the stupid descriptions of what the women are wearing and how shameful it makes them feel (or whatever, but shameful seems to be the most often used). And even if you are going to describe them, choose colors that go together well--this means blue and green do not go next to each other. Innyhoo, if Robert Jordan chooses to pick himself up, dust himself off, and keep us hanging on his every word like we did with the first five or six books (even then it was beginning to slow, though) he should realize he needs to pick up the pace.And stop with all the obscure Celtic references.

So much so that when compared side by side to that of a \\"normal\\" brain, i gasped at the difference.

Jordan himself must have two seperate heads just to store all that detail in. Mensa here i come!Then another thought occured to me that shattered the icy calm of the void: The doctors said that this part of the brain grew because of NECESSARY detail. That leaves me with only one conclusion: If cab drivers in London NEED all the detail that causes their brains to swell, then the inverse must also be true; filling the brain with useless detail must in turn SHRINK it. If after reading Crossroads of Twilight i have even a raisen left in my skull, i'll consider it a victory. TOO MUCH DETAIL that does nothing for the story. It is NOT \\"rich\\" storytelling to embelish every single page with line upon line of fashion, food and mood descriptions while relegating important plot advancements to a paragraph or two. That is called fleecing the sheep. And like sheep, we're stupid enough to keep reading to find out, one day, what actually happens at the end.My advice to anyone who loves fantasy:If you must read this series, become a cabbie in London to fight off the effects of the brain shrinkage. It's what i've chosen to do."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"That pretty much says it all. If i said in a paragraph everything that happened in this book, i would get an F from any English teacher for rambling. I'm a big fan, but the books lately have just started to drag, and this book is the worst of them all. The series just has too many charachters running around taking up space. and in this book, he didn't even get to all of them. We need a thinning of the ranks. Personally, my top candidate is Elayne(I'm so sick of her smoothing her bloody skirts and whining about Rand). I understand the need for different perspectives; i happen to be a big fan of that style. But why is the main charachter of a series, who also happens to be arguably the most powerful man in the world, relegated to less pages than a spy/assassin?And the book was just filled with charachters whining. Mat whining about getting married, Perrin whining about his wife, Elayne whining about everyone from Rand to Sea Folk to her tea, Faile whing about Perrin, Egwene whining about Aes Sedai, etc.. Finally, Rand comes on and in five pages makes the most sweeping decision of the plot and...everyone starts whining again.What a dissappointment. Well, at lest i won't have to buy any toilet paper for a while."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"My wife thought to surprise me on my birthday by waking me up (this is last year, but in the spirit of RJ, I'm just now getting around to writing it up) with a copy of CoT. We immediately went back to B&amp;N returned it, and went to Walmart to buy me a sledge and wedge, which I have been happily using the past year to split wood. I tried dropped all of the WoT novels off at Goodwill, but (much like spare pcs) they dont accept them anymore because they have too many copies."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"The reviews - even reviews by the blindly devoted - are an order of magnitude more entertaining than this book. Luckily, I got my copy from the public library. Pick your explanation:(1) Author senility.(2) Author greed.(3) Author cynicism.(4) Editorial incompetence.(5) RJ is dead and some hack is writing this drivel.(6) It's a marketing experiment - how low can you go?(7) RJ's painted himself into a corner and can't get out.Can you imagine a new author taking this . . . opus . . . to a publisher and trying to sell it?Don't bother with this one. Join me in hoping for an end."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Mat doesn't marry the Daughter of the Nine Moons, Egwene doesn't retake the White Tower, Perrin doesn't rescue Faile, Elayne doesn't become queen, Nynaeve *still* doesn't mature and Rand doesn't do anything. The Forsaken are totally ineffective, the Black Ajah are inept, Aes Sedai in general act like a pack of dysfunctional little girls, the Sea Folk continue their incessant whining, and nobody seems to have even noticed that the taint was removed from saidar in the previous book. It only takes 680 pages for all this to not happen. I wonder how much longer Jordan is going to milk this. For Shai'tan's sake, finish the series!"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I don't want to rehash everything everyone else has already written. I have a couple of new things to say, but I just need to vent first. I wanted to love this book. I wanted to want this book to not suck. But it did.The most insulting thing about this entire series boils down to one fact and its implications: Jordan's characters make absolutely no sense in the long run.First of all, if our world had people like these in power, these idiots would have run us all into the ground from lack of communication and intelligent action. Jordan is so caught up in writing political drama/fattening his wallet by stretching out with endless, pointless dialogue that he writes his characters into doing things that would make no sense to any rational creature. Why would Egwene and Rand not communicate better? Why would any number of other characters in this book not comunicate better? The Black Tower and White Tower, the &quot;Shadow&quot; and the &quot;Light&quot;... how the heck can rational people possibly be so utterly clueless and idiotic as to know so little about their enemies/allies? How could an institution like the White Tower exist with the &quot;Black Ajah&quot; within it, and nothing having been done for three thousand years until some 18 year girl takes over and stuff just miraculously starts to happen? We would all be doomed if these kind of idiots had hold of our political and social institutions. They make idiotic decisions on half-information when they could simply step into a black hole, travel to ***anywhere in the world***, and simply ask someone what happened, in cases too numerous to cite.Furthermore, Jordan stabs his own characters in the back by writing them into making idiotic decisions, not making the right decisions, and just doing stupid, idiotic things. The travesty is that instead of staying true to the nature of any of the characters, and thus providing a truly masterful painting of a world, he uses his characters in ways that contradict their respective natures as he has written them. Not only does this point to the stupidity and lack of writing skill on Jordan's behalf, the reader (and the characters themselves, it they were real) would lose all respect for these people. This is the worst case I have ever read of an author ***betraying his own characters***.For these two reasons, any reader who does not feel utterly scandalized and patronized should just go soak his/her head in some icewater. I was angry that Robert Jordan patronized me, and almost even angrier that he insults his own characters by writing them into irrational and otherwise just plain stupid actions in order to further a plot that, as many of the previous reviewers have already written, is driving even his most avid readers (read: self, formally) into fits of frothy-mouthed insanity. If you're not angry, if you don't want to punch RJ in the face and demand your 20-30$ back for the last 3 entirely wasteful books, then you should never trust your taste in literature ever again.Go read some Don DeLillo, or Truman Capote, or even Maxim magazine. You will learn more about human nature and writing than you could ever possibly hope to learn by reading this series to its conclusion in what looks to be 30 years and 18 books."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"This is the worst entry yet in a series that is rapidly becoming the biggest joke of the sci-fi/fantasy world. I'm writing this as a review. The purpose of a review is to alert potential readers if a book is horrible or to say that it's worth buying.Having reminded some of the reviewers below what a review is, I'll continue with some specifics to back up my opinion.This book does NOT advance plot, tie up the millions of loose (or pointless) former plot threadlings, or make me want to read more. There are hundreds of pages of people doing very little more than they were in the previous book. Sure, Mat and Tuon move on a little, but not much. Perrin moves closer to Faile, but not much. Elayne makes a little progress on her power-bid, but not much. It's frustrating to read something that 1)does not develop the characters--these characters are still one-dimensional and don't grow 2)does not make significant advances in the plot--don't tell me the illogical and totally stupid/out-of-character action Egwene takes in the last 2 pages is well done 3)does not let us in on any of the millenia-long plotting and planning of the Forsaken--what are these people doing to become top dog? what are their goals/schemes? we never really know. 4)leaves us hanging about the ONLY major plot advance Jordan's made in 4 books/8 years: cleansing of saidin. I mean, seriously. 5)does not \\"deepen\\" the story--it's more like a collection of poorly written short-stories about the \\"other\\" characters. If you think about it, this book is really NOT about the WoT story, but is the kind of thing fan-fic forums are for. Except that the fans write better fiction. See, for example, the many 1-star reviews below.Finally, to argue that those who post negative reviews are \\"unworthy\\" or \\"unintelligent\\" or should \\"shut up\\" have completely missed the point of a review and also reveal their inability to write a good review. If you truly think this is great writing, be prepared to back it up with insight and examples, not \\"I liked it\\" or insults. For example, if you think the relationships between the men/women--about 80% of this book--are worth reading, tell us why. I'd love to see some super-fan defend the horrible writing that Jordan thinks of as romance. Please tell us why it makes sense for Lan to love Nynaeve. Or what it is about Min/Elayne/Aviendha that Rand likes? Or what they see in him? Go ahead. Write an actual review. This stuff is as revealing, deep, and surprising as a Scooby Doo episode--the ones with Scrappy Doo."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"The first six books in this series were great fun -- the kind of books I would stay up until 5AM to finish. I thought they were a fine example of an author keeping control of an increasingly complex world and plot. The seventh book slowed down considerably, and in the eighth and ninth, the roller coaster had turned into a chess game (with no time clock). I've felt that Jordan has lost control of his plot -- he no longer seems to see what is important in moving the story along. Pages and pages are spent on minute details, while interesting threads are lost, and overall the action has stagnated. I was hoping that the last chapter of book 9 was a sign of things to come. It wasn't.Practically nothing happens in this book, and it takes 672 pages to not happen. Not a single major plot element is resolved (and many are totally ignored -- this book is all about side adventures and has very little to do with the main conflict).I had seen some of the bad reviews, but felt compelled to read the book because of my &quot;investment&quot; of having read the previous nine. Resist this feeling. You can completely skip this one and lose nothing as far as knowing what is going on for the next book (you won't remember anything that happened in Crossroads of Twilight in two years when the next book is out anyway).I know, I know, it's build-up to the grand finale (which I now fear is several slow-moving books away). Build-up is fine, but it needs to be interesting and this isn't."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Some people have said that this book focuses on developing the characters rather than action, but all Jordan really gives us is trite navel gazing and the endless regurgitation of his limited array of character traits and descriptive phrasings (aparently all Aes Sedai share one collective hive-mind consisting mostly of icy stares and dress-smoothing). Nothing at all happens, you could probably just read the last few pages and get the same effect. I'm probably not going to finish the series after this, I can't blame Jordan for milking the series for a bit of money, but this offering of mostly filler is just plain insulting."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Ok i realize that i am a wool-headed male and that many women will be sniffing with disapproval and tugging on their braids but these things must be said. I ,like many, loved the other books, yea i know some of the later ones sucked a bit but they had some plot development. *takes a sip of tea sweetened with a bit too much honey from his blue seafolk porcelain cup*I believe Mr. Jordan has some underlying issues with his mother or possibly some other strong female figure in his life, because it is obvious that he is intent on ramming down our throats that all men are children that must be sniffed at and fussed and yadda yadda yadda,,,,blah blah blah.*smoothes skirts which did not need smoothing, while trying to maintain icy Aes Sedai dignity*some reviewers gave this 5 stars and are entitled to their opinion, but i find it odd that they feel the need to immediately go on the offensive and attack those of us that disliked it as not having the foresight to appreciate rich writing and build up.Look jack-holes if i want to entertain myself with tea, dresses, and infuriating women characters I'll watch some Martha Stewart. That being said i have a few main gripes with WoT in general.- I know Cadsuane is supposed to teach them something, but she could teach it to them with no legs which i would cut off with the power about the 20th time she slapped me.- Nothing against actual women, but these women in Jordan's mind need to get some nose spray to stop all the sniffing and short haircuts to stop all the braid pulling.- Rand....stop being a homo and accept it that women are probably going to continue dying, hopefully Nynaeve, and Cadsuane first.-I think the forms with the swords are retarded, i seem to recall Rand thinking to himself in one of the books that size and strength didnt really matter with the sword, sometimes speed did.............riiiight, who would you rather have a sword fight with, Shaq or a member of the Lollipop Guild?- Lastly, I know the Aiel grow up fighting or whatever and i know that Jordan graduated from the Citadel, but really, Aiel use short spears, wear NO armor, have small shields made out of hide, HIDE!, and they dominate men on horseback, wearing platemail, using steel tipped lances and swords. who are trained to mow down people on foot, honestly, i have no military training so someone please explain it to me.Mr. Jordan, please get on with it, you have enough money im sure to keep yourself in cowboy hats, canes, and overbearing obnoxious women for the rest of your days, put us out of our misery."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"If you seriously follow the series, you might want to skip this one all together. It is definitely not up to par with the other books. It fact in reading this book, one gets the feeling that the only reason for this one was to draw the series out even more. Seriously, after two years of waiting I was expecting something more.Jordan's writing is redundant, dull, and expected. Dont be surprised if you find yourself only reading the quotations. You aren't the only one."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I tried to read this book. But even though I did get through the whole sorry thing, I don't know what I read...These books have been getting longer and more boring since around Book #6 or so when it became obvious that Jordan was no longer writing to tell a story. Apparently he's now just writing for money. If he gets paid per page, he's richer than Bill Gates. Too bad since this whole thing started out so good.A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away... I'd been seeing the WOT books in the bookstores for a long time and I like big, thick books. One day when there was nothing new out by my favorite authors, I decided to join the band and bought the first book, Eye of the World. It was great! So I ran out and got the second book... and the third... Unfortunately I didn't notice that Jordan hadn't finished the blasted thing. I knew there were (at that time) eight books out and geez, I must have figured that 8 1000+ page books MUST be all there are. How long can you drag a story out, anyway? Jordan seems able to do this -- forever. The books began to bog down and the &quot;action&quot; slowed to almost nonexistant. The gang never got any closer to the final battle, their problems were never resolved, and their relationships became murkier but didn't advance. Jordan began taking chapters rather than a few choice words to relate something. I agree with the reviewer who noted that Jordan used to be able to say &quot;They walked to the next town&quot; but now it takes many, many words to say the same thing. How sad to go from storyteller to hack.I did what I thought was the smart thing and got book #9 out of the library. When book #10 came out, I didn't bother to even do that. A friend gave me book #10 when it came out in paperback. I tried to read it, I really did. But it had been too long between books. I skimmed through it but I didn't remember all the minor characters and plot-lines. All I now remember is that Nyneve (or however it's spelt!) pulls her braid all the time and that all the women smooth their gowns constantly. That's pretty sad -- over 10,000 pages and that's all I really remember.And now Jordan is pre-milking his cash cow by writing a &quot;prequel&quot;. I'm no english major but isn't it customary to finish a story before writing a &quot;prequel&quot;? Honestly, if there are still people out there who believe Robert Jordan is writing for the love of storytelling and that he isn't a money-grubbing tree-killing hack, let me know -- I have a bridge or two to sell you."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Garbage! This book should be used for kindling only. Your entertainment dollars would be put to better use purchasing a book describing mildew growing on bathroom tiles. I believe the pretentious Mr. Jordan has begun to think of himself in terms of Mellville, Dumas, and Tolstoy which is reflected in his writing. However, he lacks the talent for tying together plot lines, he introduces an endless cast of irrelevant characters and has a penchant for endless, repetitious descriptions of meaningless activities.I have the feeling that either Mr. Jordan is suffering from severe &quot;writer's block&quot; and delivered this book to his editor only to meet his publishing deadline or is producing these books only to become wealthy at the expense of his readers. Either way, if brevity is indeed the soul of wit, Mr. Jordan is a moron."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"10 years of my life I have been reading this accursed series for, and now rue the day that I first picked up Book 1. It all started with so much promise - gripping action, tightly woven plot threads, interesting character, and just enough of a well-developed world to hold your attention. And now it has come to this - Jordan's latest torturous offering in what has become a lifeless saga. Book 10 amounts to little more than RJ self-pleasuring himself with his own convoluted verbosity, while marvelling at his guile in convincing us all to buy what is effectively 700 pages of blank paper.Maybe he is dead, and all this is ghost-written. I hope he is, because it'll probably be a better fate for him then that the fans will dish out when he inevitably ruins the finale of this series (Book 12? Book 19? Book 81? Shoot me, shoot me now...)Don't buy \\"Crossroads\\"...nothing happens! Don't even buy \\"Path of Daggers\\"...nothing happens there either. For that matter, don't start reading WoT...it will not enrich your life!And as for me...I'm too far in, and will see it through, for closure if nothing else. Don't cry for me, I'm already dead..."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"You would have to be crazy to read this. I mourn for the wood pulp sacrificed to bring this blight into the world. Jordan substitutes character development with repetitive behavior, and story with excruciating, irrelevant detail. Reading without a point. If you feel you have to read this sort of thing, then read Marcel Proust - - you can spend the rest of your life on it, and people will actually respect you for it."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"I have read every book in this series. Even though the first couple of books were good to very good, this one was so painfully awful that I wish I had never read any of them. If you have read the other nine books in the series do not read this one. It will severely taint your view of Robert Jordan.There have been only a handful of books or movies that I have not finished, this being one of them. I got within twenty pages of finishing the book and I just stopped. It was that bad.There has never been a fantasy book that has spent so many pages on how people were dressed. Robert Jordan should of held a fashion show rather then waste his readers time by expecting them to read this garbage."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Someone please wake me up...I started reading this a month ago and I am only 200 pages in. As a school teacher, I had a real problem with reading at night. I read quickly, but I am one of those unfortunate souls who is incapable of stopping reading once having begun. That, thanks to the 10th installment of The Wheel of Time series, has been cured...I'm snoring within 10 minutes of opening the book. What amazes me is considering the investment...here in Canada, these novels sell for $50 each. This means I have invested $500 into a set of novels that may possibly never end...It is time for Jordan to either knock a couple spokes out of the wheel of time, or add three more wheels, pop into 4X4, and make something happen. The wheel of time might keep turning, but I will be waiting for paper back tracks from now on. With this book in particular, however, Jordan has found the best cure for insomnia since sleeping pills."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Now I have been a huge fan of the WOT series. Books 1-6 were absolutely awesome. After \\"Lord of Chaos\\" the series started to die down. \\"Crown of Swords\\" was an ok addition, \\"Path of Daggers\\" started the slow movement of the plot, \\"Winters Heart\\" almost brought the story to a standstill, but with this new addition \\"Crossroads of Twilight\\" RJ has brought the WOT series to an all time low. This book contained 678 pages of pointless detail. The highpoints in this book as far as im concerned were Mat's brief encounters with the Daughter of the Nine Moons, and Rands VERY brief appearances. To summarize you could read about three chapters of this book and still know enough not to be lost when the next one comes out. And since RJ is taking his sweet time releasing these you can expect the next one some time in 2007!!!"},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"While I'm a huge fan of this series I must say I wasn't very happy with this book. After the long wait (as always) I was hoping to see how the story would advance from the ending of the last book. Well, it didn't, not much at least. With the characters as spread out as they are just catching up with each took up the entire book and then nothing really happened to any of them, just more of what they were doing at the end of the last book. There was a lot hinted at that could happen in the next book but that's about all this book was filled with, hints of what was to come.Being the fan I am of this series I know I'll be out there buying the next book, but not with the same hope that I had for this one."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Anybody who buys this book must be masochistic. The last book was a joke on the faithful readers who invested much time and money on this series(i.e. 200 pages on Egwene getting the Nobles permission to travel w/ her army--what a bore!). That was enough to convince me that Jordan has lost touch with reality."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"At the beginning of WoT I thought it was one of the best series ever. After Crossroads, I don't even recommend this series to my friends anymore. I was what could be called a die hard Jordan fan, but this book was just plain boring. Nothing happens but a bunch of one dimensional characters whining about their problems. When reading the previous books in the WoT, I couldn't put them down, I read each one in a single sitting. Not so with Crossroads, I looked for excuses to put the book down. I don't really care for page after page of descriptions of what rooms look like, or what people are wearing, and I especially don't like pages and pages of Perin moaning about Faile and how 'nothing else matters but her' or how everything is always the men's fault and only women really know how to do thing properly. Why even have men in the story at all? DId Jordan die and have his wife publish under his name?Of course none of this matters, Jordan will continue to make money off all of us. After 10 books, almost none of us can stop now. I have been reading since I was 15 and am now 28, but I don't think I really care anymore. For those of you who will defend this [book] by saying 'he is setting up the story' he has been setting it up for 4 books now, I don't think I can take anymore setting up. For those of you who haven't started this series yet, Don't. There is a reason why the best authors rarely have more than 3 books in a series (and almost never more than 6).Well thus begins another 2 year wait. I just hope there [is something worth waiting for] at the end of it."},{"Title":"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","review":"Most of the other reviews I've read have restored some of my faith in human intelligence and literary savvy, and I am in full agreement with the consensus; this novel reeks of the self-indulgence of its author and offers very little to anyone but an incredibly narrow niche of readers with a penchant for underdeveloped, overly complex plots. This book labors over minutia that adds almost nothing to the story line, and the number of characters that are introduced or re-introduced is simply prohibitive. Brevity is the soul of wit, Mr. Jordan, and a better author could have (or perhaps should have?) compressed this book into 150 pages without losing any plot depth or detail that actually enhances the novel as a whole.
