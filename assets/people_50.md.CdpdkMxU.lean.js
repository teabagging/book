(Orion, 1976)With Albert Uderzo resurrecting the Asterix series and the Bush-bashing reportedly to be found in Asterix and the Falling Sky, much has been made of the apolitical nature of the first thirty-two books in the series. I'm not terribly sure what these commentators are reading, but it certainly isn't the same books I am. Obelix and Co., especially, wears its politically-sensitive heart on its sleeve.As we all know by now, the Romans simply can't conquer this last tribe of Gauls, so one of Caesar's advisors, fresh out of business school, proposes a new strategy: get them working for Rome, and they'll become subjects pretty much by default. Caesar agrees to give it a try, so the adviser goes to Gaul and puts Obelix to work making menhirs (of course), which the Romans pay top, and ever-increasing, dollar for. The plan works like a charm, with all the other inhabitants of our favorite Gaulish village also getting involved, either as helpers or as Obelix's new competitors in the menhir market, until things start getting out of control in Rome...It'd probably be harder to find a more anti-capitalist tract than this. Which I suppose, capitalist that I am, I should find offensive. I was more amused by the fact that what Goscinny actually lambastes here is the collapse to be found in governmental control of capitalism, not capitalism itself. In the end, the book is just as likable as everything else Asterix and Obelix, and just as worth reading. ***"},{"Title":"Asterix Obelix and Co.","review":"Originally done as a comic in a french childrens' magazine, the Adventures of Asterix the Gaul have grown beyond that small framework and can be enjoyed by peoples around the world. the idea is that in the world of 55BC all Gaul has been conquored by the Romans, except for one small village which holds out against the invaders. The source of their survival is a magic potion brewed by the village Druid which gives the drinker superhuman strength. The gauls are not waging a war with the Romans, they just go about their lives and after being thumped a few times, the local Romans are more than happy to let them do it.In this adventure the Romans plan to force the Gauls into the Roman world by getting them hooked on the economy. The Romans will buy what the Gauls produce but at higher than market prices addicting the Gauls to the profits to be had under pax romana.The only problem is that the only thing the Gauls manufactuer are Menhirs-giant standing boulders. At first the Roman plan seems to work as the Gauls get caught up in mass marketing but the plan becomes a drain on the Roman treasury as the stones have little practical use and, being made of stone, have a loooong shelf life.What follows is a lesson on economics, the risk of following fads and the importance of just doing what you really want to do."},{"Title":"Asterix Obelix and Co.","review":"A young bureaucrat, Preposterus, has given Julius Caesar a new idea how to conquer the Gauls in Asterix's village. Make them greedy; if they focus all their time and energy on making money, they will become weaker, and ultimately unable to fight back against the Romans.THE NEXT PARAGRAPH CONTAINS SPOILERSPreposterus travels to the village and start buying menhirs from Obelix, who in turn employ others to hunt boar for him. He also employs people to help him make menhirs to increase productivity. Before long, other villagers start making menhirs, competing with Oblix. But Preposterus' has been given unlimited funds and buy them all. But when he's called back to Rome, Caesar is furious: What's he supposed to do with all the menhirs? Buying them all at very high prices has almost ruined his economy? The solution: Start a marketing campaign.SPOILERS END HEREUnlike some other Asterix books, \\"Obelix and Co.\\" is no epic adventure. Our heroes don't travel to any exotic locations. Most of the story is set inside the village and the Roman Totorum, and a subplot is set in Rome. But it's a clever satire about commercialism, and very funny. Much of this may be lost on very young readers so this is one Asterix adventure that may appeal more to adults than to Children.

In the catalogue introduction, I wrote that the term \\"Narrative Art\\" was coined by John Gibson for the title of an exhibition at his gallery in New York in 1974. Hutchinson was one of several artists, including Bill Beckley, Jean Le Gac, and Roger Welch, who were introducing language into aspects of visual art, not merely as another collage element, but as a medium independent of the visual image. Hutchinson's typical practice, then and now, combines image and text emblematically so that the separate mediums interact to make a total statement about art and life. Generally he uses his own photographs and his own written anecdotal descriptions as documentations of an action in a specific time and place that was intended consciously to be a work of art. His texts provide parabolic commentary on the action, but they do not depend on the photographs for their context or their sense of completeness. In this new book, Hutchinson presents his mature self in an elegant summary. The book, beautifully produced, reproduces touchstone images, but they jump to life in their accumulated orchestration.When Hutchinson throws a rope on a lawn, it is with the purpose of finding an accidental line where he will plant the flowers that materialize into his works of art. The unseen, presented through documentations of its existence, becomes mysteriously animated as an idea greater than the forms that represent it; and what is ultimately called the work of art is an entire cycle of creative process, including destruction, rather than any one of its states, however finished. It seems natural that Hutchinson often works in series and that he incorporates fundamental systems in science and language--cosmic, atomic, chemical, numerical, and alphabetical--while relishing the power of a system to blindly organize random information. Such a rule of system is what makes the Conceptual artist successful in terms that are somewhat strictly defined. From an airplane, on a clear day, any volcano might look beautiful, but knowlegede that Hutchinson has walked the sterile rim and scattered bread--moistening it, and covering it with plastic to grow mold--alters what you see."},{"Title":"Thrown Rope","review":"This is a great chronicle of some of the many wonderful works by this cutting edge conceptual artist.

A photographer who has documented many endangered lands, he seeks out the wounded places on the earth. In clearcut forests, beaches clogged with litter, a stretch of the Columbia River that faces the Hanford Nuclear Plant, and other places, he gathers waste left by human presence and recreates it, then and there, as art. His book, written with humor and playfulness, a naturalist's attention to detail and a philosopher's sense of the broader picture, tells the stories of these places and the works that arose from them.Like the artist Andy Goldsworthy, Daniel Dancer's work uses the elements of a place and arranges them in the context of that place. Both make three-dimensional art that is meant to be ephemeral. Ultimately, however, Goldsworthy's pieces are exquisite creations that are only about themselves. Dancer's work, on the other hand, springs not only from a particular place but also from the ways that humans have interacted with that place. These fascinating works involve the artist himself and us, the witnesses/readers not only in the sorrowful reality of What Is, but in the attitude that transformation is possible. They invite us to bring attentive presence to beautiful, damaged places and to find what is sacred and meaningful everywhere."},{"Title":"Shards & Circles: Artistic Adventures in Spirit and Ecology","review":"A view of the world in alignment. For those who have always felt at odds with this culture, and this place in time, who see the world through different eyes.Daniel Dancer has so beautifully articulated so many of my own thoughts and perceptions. If you are a lover of beauty and life, and you feel connected deep down to the rhythms and patterns of the natural world, you will feel the same way. As I read, I kept having this feeling that we were of one mind. Page after page, Dancers words triggered sacred memories of deep impressions that live inside me, from my own experiences. It's comforting to know that there is someone else who sees and feels the world the way I do. Dancer is possessed of a rare strength of spirit, and a huge loving heart. In this book, he shares his soul, and the depths of his insight with the world.The work he is doing, is an elegant merging of awakening consciousness, creating real community, and Art-making, all in the context of a humble reverence for nature.Simply put . . . well, it's brilliantin deep respect, dancingwater (artist/ educator)"},{"Title":"Shards & Circles: Artistic Adventures in Spirit and Ecology","review":"This book changed my life.I read it nearly 3 years ago and still it is impacting me. Page by glorious page, insights flooded me and tears welled in my eyes over and over. I was astounded at what I was reading...the earthy brilliance and heartful awareness that was given as beauty to the unsuspecting and open mouths of the spiritually hungry. Most certainly this author must be gifted, to have his feet rooted so sweetly in this wild earth while still capable to having the vast perspective of a soaring bird. This is rare.Something spilled from this book into me, telling a story beneath the stories, which, in themselves were mind-opening and beauty provoking. What I heard underneath it all was a story of a man curious enough in mystery and keen in his vision to dive into a world seldom seen...a world that is calling desperately for our attention now...an invisible, Holy world that feeds on beauty, ceremony and tears. To allow this powerful understanding in, opens hearts and breaks into long held patterning. It can change the world. I am forever grateful that this book is here to feed us through perilous times with it's luscious and cohesive expanse."},{"Title":"Shards & Circles: Artistic Adventures in Spirit and Ecology","review":"Anyone who has been moved by David Abram's \\"Spell of the Sensuous,\\" is sure to feel the same about this gem by environmental artist Daniel Dancer. Here ecopsychology is demonstrated - vividly, authentically - rather than simply being talked about. Dancer's stories of immersing himself in landscapes, and then assembling found objects into art forms as gifts, as expressions, as spontaneous shamanic undertakings invites readers to reflect not only on their own ways of communing with the vibrancy and brokenness of the natural world but also of how we all can deepen the ways in which we open our hearts to the healing powers of nature.It has been several months since I read \\"Shards and Circles\\", and yet without even opening the book, powerful images come to mind - vignettes of stories I shall never forget. I remember how, in contrast to Dancer's usual style of composing his art in the same episode in which his encounter with objects begins, one story reveals that it took him several years of returning to a particular place before he was moved to express a resolution to the mystery initially posed to him by a half-burned shard of paper. The psychological cleansing that came for him by waiting was powerful and suggests to me possibilities for my own recurring visits to special spots.I was brought to tears by a chapter in which the power of place and simple acts of releasing feathers with his young children in a ritualistic manner gave Dancer a chance to transform the pain of divorce and home-leaving into an intimate moment of wonder and bonding that his children, surely, will never forget.Finally, I applaud the author for presenting his stories so truthfully that even his mis-steps became learning experiences for this reader. Sparely, beautifully written, Daniel Dancer's words are windows of possibility for wounded souls in a wounded world."},{"Title":"Indian fights and fighters (His American fights and fighters series.

All of the engagements are studied in detail and Brady had the great fortune to get first-hand accounts of the fighting from soldiers in the field during those hostilities. Brady's work is a pleasant read with a swift narrative and the love of his work is present on every page. The tone of Brady's book seems to suggests sympathy for the Indian plight because of the U.S. government's unfair posture that backed the Sioux and Cheyenne into a corner with no choice but to defend their homeland and hunting grounds. However, Brady is writing history from the white man's point of view and his bias creeps into his book on occasion. There are several pages of interesting correspondence between Brady and officers of the Seventh Cavalry regarding Custer's orders from General Terry and the letter and spirit of those orders. Great history and writing from the Reverend Brady."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"This is a great book. Reading it takes more effort than most novels require, but every ounce of effort (snd sweat) is well worth it. If you ar e avoiding this book because of its difficulty, don't. It's attainable. If you are having problems I highly recommend buying a copy of the audio version and reading along with it. This is probably the only book for which I would recommend the audio edition, Ulysses was meant to be read aloud. Other usefull books to have handy are Gilbert's book and Gifford's book. Gilbert is the standard, basic interpretation of Ulysses, and Gifford's Annotated lets you in on all of the obscure references in the novel. Gifford elucidates references to other literature and the more obscure references to Irish &quot;current events&quot; and such. Finally, I would stay away from the Gabler edition of Ulysses. The general consensus is that for every 4 errors Gabler fixed, he introduced 6 more. The 1961 edition (published by Vintage) is more standard."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"Having tried and read many sections of this one, but never from beginning to end, plus having read innumerable reviews, and browsed thru all kinds of analyses of it, I can only conclude that it is generally way over-rated..Think of all the near-unknown great books by authors who are hardly recognized, who have written mythological, historical \\"Days in the Life\\" Novels..OK, so Molly gets excited at the end, and we witness a shaving scene in the beginning, with everything in between. Even as a fairly knowledgable literacy person, it is about impossible to read this without a reference guide. All in all simply very over-rated..However, PORTRAIT OF THE ARTIST is a beautifully done book, truly worthy of its lofty reputation, so my suggestion is to read PORTRAIT , plus the stories first, and if frustrated by this one, simply move to something else! There are literally thousands and thousands to choose from!"},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"I would have to say that I have easily read close to 1,000 books in my lifetime. I would also easily have to say that I have never read a book that was as incomprehensible as Ulysses. I really do not believe that one has to have cliffnotes or any type of 'helpers' to read and understand a book. Yet, I firmly believe that Ulysses should be accompanied by several texts explaining page by page what you just read. It was so disjointed and difficult to comprehend that I was beginning to question my sanity in even attempting to sift through it and find a plot. I would not recommend it to anyone and I feel sorry for English majors who are forced to read it. I chose to read it and would not make that choice a second time."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"I see that this printing is out of stock. May it stay so. Ulysses is the most beautiful book I have ever encountered and I would urge everyone to become familiar with it and add to their familiarity for as long as they live. That being said, the magnum opus of scholarly works this book has (and will continue to have) added is such that much of it constitutes a forever living and growing part of Ulysses itself. As such, some consistency in pagination is crucial as there is a long established convention of referring to specific lines, words etc ... that is employed by any and every Joyce scholar on the planet. Past reprints and revisions of Ulysses have either maintained the original pagination or indicated in marginalia a mapping to the original. Why Penguin would completely obliterate this (and by extension make the cannon of Joyce scholarship almost unusable) is beyond me. If you want to read Ulysses and have no opportunity to benefit from the insight of others (including those that Joyce worked with on this) then get this book and try to enjoy it in a bubble. Otherwise, it would behoove you to get a printing that respects this book and the reader for what they are."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"Perhaps the British were right to repress the Irish: give them a little freedom, and this is what they do. Every redblooded fellow, of course, has appreciated an analogous phenomenon in Catholic coeds, but here, we had hoped, the subject might be literature, and more than rampant effusiveness might be expected.Don't get me wrong; I don't despise length or density. My favorite book as a kid was _Moby Dick_. I have read _Anatomy of Melancholy_ cover to cover (once: phew). My favorite novel now is _Magic Mountain_. And every several years I reread Boswell. Neither do I mind a little murk: my favorite McCarthy is _Sutree_ in preference to the one about the pretty ponies. I don't mind a degree of exigetical tussle in my reading either. I have been a English teacher for thirty years, so I have ruined more literature by careful analysis than any other cowpoke in the saloon, I reckon.Some here - preening with professorial preciosity, I think - have opined that those who do not appreciate this work, crippled by an unsophisticated need for plot, cling and suckle, eyes closed, to silly old books telling tales suited to their larval sensibilities. Well, plot or not, dull is dull, I say. Plot may be many things - a string for beads, and armature for papier-mache, a rational basis for irrational digression - or it may be absent; but the notion that playing around with plot is so terribly nouveau, and therefore so incumbent on those who would be literarily hip, is preposterous. Think of Sterne, Rabelais, Melville.Some fool even asserted that it is brilliant for a book to be tedious, for life is so, and thus a book as militantly tedious as this is true to life in a way that an interesting book could never be. What desperate rationalization is this?The first time - age 19 - that I tried to read this book, I failed to finish it. I made the attempt because it is a book \\"one\\" reads. I was \\"one\\" back then, had not yet become myself. In the end, such motivation did not sustain me. I slipped beneath the waves, drowning in a welter of Anglo-Saxon phonemes.The second time, I was a teacher, and was thinking of teaching it. I had just finished reading Will and Ariel Durant's _Story of Civilization_, so my reading muscles were unusually fit, and so I prevailed.This book is clever, sure, but that is just not enough. I love games with words, but such delightful shenanigans work best in shorter forms - in poems - or as divertissements or instruments of nuance in longer works, in the service of some literary enterprise worthy unto itself, such as telling a story. That's my view, and I'm sticking to it, since there is so very much else to read, and life is so very short."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"I adore James Joyce, but I must report that in this free Kindle version, the chants / songs / quotations are missing!

I own several editions of ULYSSES includingother first edition facsimile editions but this one is by far the most comfortable and readable. While it isn't as visually impressive as the Easton Press edition of the 1922 Paris text, which retained the design and Mattise illustrations of the 1935 Limited Editions Club version, it is rather more practical. The binding is incredible. This book will open flat and stay open on any page, making it an absolute pleasure to read effortlessly. The page size is the same as the first edition and retains the wonderful generous margin size. This edition is remarkable for the understated elegance of its appearance. The cover is bound in beautiful blue buckram that reproduces the look of the original paper wraps of the Shakespeare and Company edition. It contains the original title page/colophon as well as the charming message from Sylvia Beech. Signiture numbers are also present. All of the wonderful and odd typos (including a few upside down letters, a result of the original typesetting process) are present and the feeling is like going back in time and experiencing the greatest novel ever written just as those first readers in 1922 did. When I first took the book out of the box my initial reaction was that it was overpriced but once I started reading it, the magnificent, exceptional quality of the book became quickly apparent. I started reading and finished it in three days, the quickest I've ever gotten through ULYSSES. Reading this edition is such a pleasure that I really didn't want to put it down. The price of the book may seem a little high but I assure you, if you love ULYSSES then you are certain to treasure this spectacular edition. I will never need to buy another reading copy of ULYSSES again. The book is so strong and sturdy that it shows virtually NO sign of wear after the first reading. The binding is strong and tight and superior to just about anything else I have seen in this price range. I am so grateful to Orchisis Press for producing this incredible edition. I love it."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"If you loved what you heard from Norton and Riordan but want to know more about the literary bones and puzzles in Joyce's Ulysses, I highly recommend the course \\"Joyce's Ulysses\\" taught by James A.W.

The Heffernan lectures will greatly increase your understanding of the work."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"Unfortunate that the reviewers listed seem to be reviewing the book rather than this particular edition. The reviews apply to Ulysses rather than the 1922 edition."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"James Joyce's Ulysses closely parallels the events of Homer's The Odyssey, but this journey is far more surreal than Homer could have ever dreamt. The story is set in one day, and mostly follows the principal character Leopold Bloom going through the day.Ulysses does not follow typical conventions of literature, and therein lies its beauty and its freedom. The text is littered with puns and seemingly nonsensical and comical language, one of the highlights being the section written as a play in which all manner of chaos takes place. This text may at first appear to be senseless but perseverence will reward those who would spend time examining its language, which is often made up of multiple words, each constituent part of which relates to a wider topic. This is, in a sense, a scholalry text, as it is so much more than a story, and you need to have the willingness to at least attempt to understand the broader referential context, much of which I am also working on. If that seems like too much hard work, then I doubt Ulysses would provide much enjoyment to you, although that's not to say it can't be read without additional knowledge. It does help to know some of the things going on in Joyce's mind and the history/culture of his beloved Ireland.The version being reviewed here is by Orchises Press, which is a fantastic reproduction of the very first edition of Ulysses printed by Shakespeare and Company. The binding is quite tight and the print quality superb. There is also plenty of space for literary scholars to scribble notes. As it is a sturdy edition, this is built to last. There is no introduction to the text or any essays, and some may prefer this. For first time readers, it can be better to read the text without any preconceptions, just like people who would have read it when it was first published. The cloth cover on this edition, as others have commented, appears a little greener than the original, but most surviving originals have aged to appear exactly like this anyway. As it so closely resembles a vintage copy, it is a very exciting prospect to read Ulysses in the same way its principal adoptors did in the early 1920s. As it is not a vintage copy, you do not need to worry about being ever so careful. Of course, it is still expensive and it is best to treat it with care, but if you had a 1922 copy, you would probably keep it in a cabinet, trying not to disturb its delicate state. For owners of the original who would love to read their vintage copy, but too afraid to, this may be a great solution. Ordering this from the UK from Amazon, it took about three weeks to arrive here from the US, and it was a really terrific moment when it arrived, removing the clingfilm and starting reading it. It is, as a side note, quite a shame that UK readers do not favour hardback editions of books. It is quite difficult to buy new editions of classic books on hardback, unless of course, you turn to the second hand market. It is just a shame that the UK does not seem to appreciate premeire hardback editions of classic texts. oh well...In many ways the Orchises Press version suits both collectors and serious readers. Of course, it is more expensive than the paperback version, and recommended only to real enthusiasts. For me, this is a definitive edition because literary essays, introductions and annotations mean very little to me, as I like to derive my own impressions by reading and do my own research on specific things. As an MA Comparative Literature student interested in Joyce, I feel this edition can be used for serious research without the supplementary scholarly material because it leaves you free to have just the text and your impressions.If this edition proves too dear, I believe the Modern Library (or was it Everyman's Luibrary) have an edition currently in print and should be available to order from most retail bookstores. I saw a copy in my local Borders for 13.99, and if you are considering getting a decent hardback edition, perhaps you could go for that edition, as the Modern Library has an excellent range of titles and deserves to be supported.To conclude, Joyce had an extraordinary imagination and wonderful command of the English language. He is a master of the English language and this is one of his most captivating work. Personally I prefer Finnegans Wake because if you persevere with it, past the first 100 pages, you find some side-splittingly humourous puns. In any case, I will leave my fondness for Finnegans Wake for another review. For now, grab a copy of Ulysses and enter the bizarre world of Joyce where the ordinary mundane things become surreal adventures, and language becomes so unfamiliar that it begins to start making sense again."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"Jorge Luis Borges once thanked Joyce and Picasso in the introduction of one of his books. It was a joke. Borges obviously felt both names had been evoked so many times as to make the mere mention of either of them seem ponderous. I kind of agree with that assessment.Joyce certainly has received top billing by the academy and if your impression of him is, well, reverent, you are in good company. I read Ulysses first because I wanted to know this huge book which everyone talked about with such admiration and then I read it again in college in a Joyce seminar. I have to say the seminar was enjoyable but not altogether because of the author chosen. I think we students and teacher felt like we were conquering a mountain and were proud of ourselves every step of the way. In memory the actual book does not loom very large in the way other great works do nor do I feel much affection for it. The characters and plot are implanted in my brain but rarely do they move about nor do scenes get replayed in my imagination. Perhaps Joyce's work was so complete that it didn't leave much room for any other imagination to go to work on it so Ulysses never became one of my favorites. I don't suppose I can wholeheartedly recommend the book given my less than enthusiastic feeling about it. In fact I think I learned a lot more from other books by less revered authors. Joyce had talent to spare but I think for me he just loads Ulysses with too many apparently ordinary though symbolic so very literary things and the result is that I am not inspired by his art but rather put off by the excessive weight and meaning the work aquires as one works ones way through. So much has been said about the work that it almost comes to the reader with a feeling of having been pre-interpreted for you. Joyce I think contributes to this reaction because he left little room for &quot;interpretations&quot; of his work, its all layed out for you and there really is no latitude for an individual encounter with it. You either submit to its spell or you don't. Perhaps the net result is that in this case more turns out to be less. It can't be penalized for being too much of a good thing so five stars despite all just said.Some have mentioned that this book benefits from being read out loud. Perhaps that is the Catholic interpretation of this very Catholic author. Ulysses as incantation. That approach does have its advantages with this book. There is available a recording of Joyce himself reading excerpts from Ulysses and Finnegans Wake(Anna Plurabelle). I've heard it and it is like hearing a fairy tale written by the unconscious for adults. His voice is musical and he reads like he is summoning the spirit."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"Few booka are as gripping, confounding, and ultimately satisfying as this vast novel.

Ulysses is like no other novel I have ever read. There is no plot to speak of, but you come out loving Mr.Bloom at the end of it. It's very hard to read at first, but helper books such as Don Gifford's Ulysses Annotated and Stuart Gilbert's book point out what techniques Joyce is using. I think Ulysses is like a cult classic - you either get hooked on to it, or you get turned off by the abstruseness. So don't give up easy, and you will enjoy it once you start realizing the intricacies of of Joyce's Ulysses."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"Ulysses, James Joyce's seminal work,has had a profound effect on millions of readers. Ulysses is both crude and sensitive, lyrical and blunt, funny and sad. It shows the reader a glimpse of one man's struggle to define himself amidst the chaos of modern experience.

Well, a great pioneering work such as this would probably have to take chances or it wouldn't be the work that it is. But suffice to say, when it all comes together properly it can blow you away. My favorite sections, \\"Scylla and Charybdis\\" and \\"Penelope,\\" seem to me to be unequalled in their raw intellectual and psychic power. Like the epic upon which it is based, \\"Ulysses\\" spends an inordinate amount of time and emotional energy on the nature of the marital relationship. The great tension of \\"The Odyssey,\\" the question of whether Odysseus can get home in time to keep his wife faithful, is turned on its head in \\"Ulysses,\\" where the wanderer makes a conscious decision to stay away from his unfaithful wife but is doomed to continue to wonder resignedly how he can resolve their sad situation. Don't be afraid to consult Cliff's Notes your first time through, but don't try to catch every nuance either, or you'll go crazy.

I think the people who gave it one star should forgive the book it's difficulty and direct their hostility away from it's five-star constituency. Personally, I find the difficulty of the work to be one of its many rewards. But its difficulty really starts to fade after a couple hundred pages as you get used to Joyce's protean style, and settle into Leopold Bloom's head. For those who deride the book's fans as pseudo-intellectual sycophants, I just want to say that most of the pleasures I derived from the book were not intellectual at all. I found it a very moving and uplifting story of the heroism inherent in the simple affirmation of going through an ordinary day. That Joyce implements the whole cultural arsenal of Western Civilization to conduct such a simple story is the evidence of his genius, and if that is too intellectual, I still feel richer for wading in the depths of his book. For it really contains all, or at least it seems to--the epic scope of the book dwarfs the reader coming into it. I certainly wouldn't read this book in order to feel intellectually superior to anyone. I imagine those who enjoy it rather feel humbled from the process. At any rate, I loved it.

How I feel about the book is still in question. Some parts I have found very poetic, lyrical, truthful, and yes! even slightly titillating; but, I must say, the vast majority of the book I think is not so much as boring as it is protracted and useless. However, with all due credit to Joyce, it's always honest. Very honest! I found Joyce's other work &quot;Portrait of the Artist...&quot; far more readable and inspiring. So, I don't thinks it's being unfair to Joyce when one says that Ulysses is extremely over-rated. Furthermore the novel seems to have a sort of literary snob appeal for those pseudo intellectuals (and/or Joyce-devotees) who feign some sort of intellectual epiphany from the experience of reading it. For them, yet perhaps another way to separate themselves from the &quot;unappreciative, uninitiated, unenlightened reading masses.&quot;"},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"ulises, es un libro maravillosamente disenado, esta bien de que el autor sea tildado de pedante por haber puesto en el libro cada cosa que se le viniera a la cabeza y hacerlo un poco duro de seguir, pero el libro tiene su valor y no en vano ha siso alabado desde que salio. su complicada estructura se presta a analisis de diferentes esferas de la mente humana. se puede ver como una asociacion de ideas y se necesita de una gran memoria o de una libreta para poder encontrar las referencias o leitmotiv del libro que estan donde menos las pienses. cada capitulo de ulises representa un estilo de narracion y cada uno es una pequena obra en si independiente de las demas. que no encontremos el significado inmediato no significa que sea malo, sino que el autor no estaba pensando en dar a su obra un significado,ese surge mientras lees la obra. los capitulos parecen no tener secuencia logica y los personajes parece que hablan disparates pero si miras bien y lees con calma puedes ver que hay un hilo conductor de la historia, linda parodia de un clasico. cada capitulo es una referencia a la odisea, aunque en algunos de ellos no esta claro a que se refiere hasta el final. es una obra para gente que quiera aprender que las mejores obras estan escritas para satisfacer no a un publico sino a uno mismo y cuando el escribia quien mas disfrutaba era JOYCE LUIS MENDEZ"},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"Truly a monumental acheivement in the history of writing.

Ulysses is James Joyce's Bible. What does one gain from reading this novel? Joyce has such a command of our language that it becomes putty in the hands of an artist. Each chapter has its own technique. Joyce wears a different mask for each section so that the reader sees the history of the English language unfold before him. Joyce remains the super-artist however, peering down from his overworld of the ulimate artist. Reading Ulysses will make all modern fiction seem to be the ineluctable flotsam in the path of the Joycean mothership. So who is Ulysses the character? What is Ulysses? Odysseus? Odysseus is the beloved Greek figure who appears in the form of Leopold Bloom. Ulysses was the despised, bloodthirsty, Roman rabblerowser who ended up in one of Dante's jivin' circles. Bloom is not Ulysses. Ulysses is something else. Everything else. A three in one of Bloom, Stephen, Molly; Father, son, mother(holy ghost); Scientist, artist, lover; the meeting place of lust and compassion: Word known to man: Love.

Joyce carries subtlety and grace with each poetic sentence and each step of character development; you don't just read, you experience, you live within this world. Immerse yourself in the essence that is Ulysses, whether your teacher assigns it to you or not"},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"Ulysses is the story of one day in the life of Leopold Bloom, an Irish jew. The novel follows his travels and ends with his meeting of Stephen Dedaulus. By reading the novel, the reader is able to see Bloom's character fleshed out before his eyes, as well as to tap into the personalities of the numerous other characters on the busy Dublin street. Symbolically, the novel parallels Homer's Odyssey, depicting the great &quot;journey&quot; that Bloom travels in one day.Although Ulysses is difficult to read, it is not impossible to complete. However, before even attempting to read this novel, it is best to have previously read several other pieces of literature to aid in the comprehension of the story. You should first already be familiar with Joyce's writings; read both Dubliners to get a feel of Joyce's style, and A Portrait of the Artist as a Young to fully understand the maturation of Stephan Dedaulus' character. Next, read the Odyssey, preferrable a verse translation. I'd recommend Robert Fagles version. Finally, it is also helpful to have read Hamlet, be familiar with both the Old and New Testament of The Bible, and know a little about early 19th century Irish history.Even if you are a literary scholar, you will probably still find some parts--probably even whole chapters--confusing or even incomprehensible. One unique characteristic of Ulysses is its style. Contrary to popular belief, the book is not completely written in the stream of consciousness style. Instead, each of the novel's chapters has a characteristic style, ranging from straigt narration to an almost 200 page long play. This can be a bit aggravating for the reader. Another confusion of the chapters is there exact parrallel to the Odyssey. Each chapter does have a parrallel chapter in the Odyssey but while some similiarities can easily be distinguished in the plot, other parrallels are only apparent in symbolism and style. Because of these difficulties it is best to read the CliffsNotes on this book while reading the novel.Overall, I can tell you that Ulysses is quite interesting in some parts and very very dull in others. If you are a fan of literature, I would recomend reading it sometime. Truefully, Ulysses was good but not as great as it thought it would be. My favorite parts of the book were simply the ones that helped to reveal Bloom's character. I got annoyed by the fact that too many other characters appeared and were characterized but actually had very little to do with the story's plot. The plot itself is a bit weak and Joyce is a bit too over-indulgent and is purposefully confusing in describing some of the action of the story (its 783 pages!). Also, in order to understand all of the novel's symbols you would have to read several literary references and this would take forever. I also think that Joyce sort of went a bit too far with literary styles. Some were good but others not so much. I liked the narrative and stream of consciousness chapters, but personally thought that the play chapter failed to convey its message and was meandering. And why wasn't there a chapter in epic format (as was the Odyssey) or other form of poem (Stephen was supposed to be a poet). Finally, I do not believe that Ulysses was universal enough to be considered a masterpiece. One of the great aspects of world literature is that it is supposed to let reader from other countries understand what it is like to live in the country in which the novel takes place. Joyce did try to achieve this goal, but he presented many viewpoints about Irish politics and facts about political figures (Parnell) with even trying to allow the non-Irish reader to understand these people or concepts.Dispite its problems, I would recommend reading Ulysses but if there is any other book you would like to read, read it first because Ulysess does seem to drag on forever. Don't expect to understand all of Ulysses or be excited about unraveling its symbolism. In order to understand most of the symbolism you have to read the CliffsNotes and this kind of ruins the fun of self discovery. The book is not as contreversial as I thought it would be--really the only parts that would warrant censorship are contained in the last chapter (Molly's monologue) but these are rather provactive. Overall, the plot of Ulysses does not neccesarily always make the best story nor could I actually call it a &quot;masterpiece&quot; but the book is interesting if you are a fan of Joyce and have the time to spend on it. It took me just short of three weeks to finish it. If you are just reading the book for fun (not for a class) I'd recommend reading it over summer or a holiday because it is definately not a light or short read by any means."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"For someone to revolutionize an artform is unique. But James Joyce did it with every book that he wrote. It is too bad he only wrote four but i guess between Ulysses and Finaganns Wake, a reader could spend his life decifereing them.

It is like a puzzle that is too large and complex to ever be finished, but at the odd moment that two pieces fit together, it is a revelation that sparks the mind and soul. Probibly the greatest peice of art that i have ever absorbed but to readers beware; it is more an art than a typical novel.

Reasons range from sloth to intimidation to a flat-out lack of interest. It is important to have some basic knowledge of the premise of ULYSSES prior to reading it; two things are particularly critical to be aware of:1. ULYSSES is an allegory for Homer's ODYSSEY. The whole thing.2. All of the events of the novel span fewer than 24 hours.Trust me, knowing those two things makes ULYSSES make a whole lot more sense.Since ULYSSES is a notoriously difficult read, its readers have come up with various means by which to approach the novel. Different things work for different people, but what follows is my version of a \\"Reader's guide to ULYSSES\\":1. This one is critical: read James Joyce's A PORTRAIT OF THE ARTIST AS A YOUNG MAN before ULYSSES. Not only does the former serve as a sort of primer for the latter, but A PORTRAIT introduces Stephen Dedalus, a key character in ULYSSES. Many of the events and circumstances of A PORTRAIT are referred to in ULYSSES, and Joyce will by no means spoon-feed you the connections.Supplemental pre-ULYSSES reading includes Homer's THE ODYSSEY and Joyce's DUBLINERS.2. Remember: this is supposed to be a funny book. If events seem absurd, disgusting, or nonsensical, there's certainly a reason.3. Take... your... time. I spent six weeks reading ULYSSES, and sometimes would spend up to five minutes on one page if I was confused or spacing out. This novel is, frankly, dense enough to sink in a pool of mercury. You aren't going to understand every pun, cultural allusion, or plot point even. Accept it: spend as long as you need, infer whatever you can, try your best, don't get frustrated.4. Do NOT give up! I read this as a 17-year-old; this is NOT an unreadable book! It is a very tough read, but not impossible. If you don't ever abandon ULYSSES, you're bound to finish it. Chapters are long; if you're burning out in the middle of one, just finish the next paragraph, stick your bookmark between the pages, and put ULYSSES on your nightstand for a while.All told, this is one of the greatest and most rewarding novels ever written. Give it a chance, prepare as suits you best, and have a nice read!"},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"This is the more complete edition to which I refer in my review of the free Kindle version of Ulysses.

Still, this has the internal poetry, doggerel, etc. that the the free edition has excised.Update: This is now listed as Ulysses (Annotated Edition) for $1.99."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"In this book, Joyce continually reminds his readers that this 265,000-word epic utilizing over 30,000 different words is more about his prowess, and sometimes less about your pleasure.As athletic feat is derived from hours of repetitive drills, so too may this novel's conquest only be enjoyed after years of reading ever improving literature. This is not a book for the amateur. Precisely the opposite, this is a book continually referring to other novels, uses language of greater expanse than most others, and is written in styles which make the complexities vastly increased.More puzzle maker than novelist, Joyce's decision to write in paradox, paradigm, pun, parody, contrarian, contradiction and more makes the reading experience as complete as one could ask in the English language. The array of writing styles is mesmerizing: simple novel; over 30 pages of newspaper column; a 180-page play; over 70 pages of questions followed by answers; and one final chapter made up of seemingly 30-40 pages in ONE sentence of rambling autobiographical sexual revelation by Molly Bloom - the protagonist's cavorting wife.The interplay of the styles is extremely brave and enlightening. As they touch upon the same topic, but in different voices and different styles, the reader can further delve into what transpired hundreds of pages before, when the writer intentionally did not reveal it all, and definitely did not reveal it in easily decipherable verse. The interrelation between the texts would allow one to probably read the chapters in different orders and end in the same frame of mind. Nabokov asserted one could do such to his \\"Lolita.\\" And, Nabokov, creator of \\"Pale Fire\\", reminds me so much of Joyce as each toys with and teases the reader with puns, parodies and sometimes outdated jokes.The main characters, Leopold Bloom and Molly Bloom, are known to even those who have not read the novel. Their mutual philandering is the focus of much of the novel. The exploits of each are relatively revealed. But, not in black and white English. The point is taken, and from this came one great pornography trial which culminated with a 1933 United States District Court decision proclaiming, \\". . . the effect of \`Ulysses' on the reader undoubtedly is somewhat emetic, nowhere does it tend to be an aphrodisiac.\\"Such words would not be clearer. \\"An exquisite dulcet epithalame of most mollification suadency for juveniles amatory whom the odoriferous flambeaus of the paranymphs have escorted to the quadrupedal proscenium of connubial communion.\\" University level English is a prerequisite to understand this alleged smut - or to use Joyce's words: concupiscence delivering induration.And, most of the book, believe it or not, is not about sexual issues. Much touches upon other topics: philosophy, anti-Semitism, socialism . . . . But it is not always condescending; and it is much more than a 700-800-pages of dialectic prose. Because some of those topics are extremely poignant in 2009, those portions of the book apply to today's themes and can be easily (?) read today. Other topics are not for today's discussion. And, that makes reading those portions very difficult for today's reader.In all honesty there were times when I read the novel and asked, \\"what am I missing?\\" I had to stop and reflect, \\"Do others really see something that I cannot?\\" For instance the following passage really lost me: \\"What do they think when they hear music? Way to catch rattlesnakes. Night Michael Green gave us the box. Tuning up. Shah of Persia liked that best. Remind him of home sweet home. Wiped his nose in curtain too.\\" Do I need recite more? This caught my interest as much as a \\"White on White\\" painting at the museum of modern art. \\"I just don't get it.\\"And then, later I read the question-answer portion (second to last chapter), and the efficiency and beauty of the writing is both unique and unparalleled. A master of accidence and syntax, the writing is clear and artistic and most importantly - understandable. At the end of that chapter, I could only close the book, lean back and reflect on what I just read, and say one word, \\"Shazam.\\"Like climbing a mountain, the trek may be difficult - but at the journey's end, the party who endured the hardship will be rewarded with a lifetime of memories. Because of some bizarre passages of experimental prose and style, I cannot assert this is my favorite book. Not even the top ten for me. But, it is a great book. And, so well worth the read.Few tips: Read \\"A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man\\" and maybe the \\"Dubliners\\" before this. I would also recommend reading the last two chapters before reading from the beginning. And have a dictionary nearby. You will use it. Trust me."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"I started reading Ulysses at the end of my junior year in high school with absolutely no knowledge of how difficult or \`great' it was reputed to be. I just bought a used copy and started reading after an essay about it struck my fancy on the SATs. There will be people who tell you that Ulysses is a work of art that can be appreciated only by someone of great intelligence and a high level of education. There will be people who tell you that the book is comprised of pretentious dribble that no one actually understands; designed to make \`intellectuals' feel good about themselves for pretending to \`get' it. Both are wrong. Ulysses is just a book. There will be people who love it and people who hate it, regardless of their intelligence. If you hate it, it doesn't mean that you're stupid or that you don't \`get' it; it just means that it's not your cup o' tea. So why not give it a chance?Personally, I'm no genius, and I adored Ulysses. I didn't have to read it with a map, a dictionary, and a book of Irish proverbs at my side, either. Yes, to get every possible thing that you can get out of it, you'll need these things, but you don't need them to fall in love with the characters, laugh at their awkward conversations, or marvel at Joyce's use of language. Chances are, if you can make it through the book out of liking it- and not just out of a sense of duty- then you'll want to go back and read it again anyways (well, perhaps after a short break) so you don't need to understand every little detail your first time through.Because of its reputation, Ulysses does tend to attract either the snobs who quote the most difficult parts of the book as the \`greatest,' or the snobs who can't get over the fact that they don't enjoy one of the most famous books of all time and quote the most difficult parts of the book as a reason not to read it. This makes it seem more dense than it really is. If you're patient and willing to pay attention, Ulysses isn't nearly as difficult as it's reputed to be. Just use the \\"Search Inside\\" feature on this site and take a look at the first chapter. The language itself isn't too difficult, it's the fact that the language and technique do take some time to get used to- so by the time you get into the rhythm, a new chapter starts and the style of the prose changes altogether. You just need to read slowly and patiently- and for the love of God don't skip passages. Yes, there are maybe one or two chapters that are pretty tough (Oxen of the Sun, probably, is the most notable) but the vast majority of the book is perfectly easy to understand to the patient reader.If you do opt out of Ulysses, you'll miss out on some of the most awesome, well-developed, and loveable characters in all of literature. Because Joyce chronicles the stream of consiousness of the main characters in a few of the chapters, we not only get to see what they think, but how they think it. It's hard to explain but very cool. The brilliant, modest, and socially awkward Leopold Bloom takes the role of the 'hero' or 'Odysseus' of the story. There is no possible way for me to describe how deep, hilarious, tragic, and downright likeable he is. Sadly, no one in the book really enjoys his presence, and a cloud of awkward silence seems to follow him wherever he goes. Pretentious, moody, and selfish, Stephen Dedalus takes the role of Telemachus. He's angsty, introverted, sarcastic and incredibly funny. The more minor characters are just as important, notably Buck Mulligan, Stephen's obnoxious, smug, life-of-the-party type roommate (think of your typical frat-boy) is very funny (if incredibly annoying to Stephen,) as is Molly, Leopold's (somewhat understandably) unfaithful wife, whose inner thoughts make up the entirety of the book's completely unpunctuated final chapter. The jingoistic anti-Semite \\"The Citizen\\" and Stephen's clueless, annoying boss are also both amazing.The book doesn't follow The Odyssey religiously, but I did find myself thankful that I had read the Greek epic before approaching Ulysses. This edition doesn't have the names of the chapters, (I don't know if any edition does) and I would suggest finding out what they are and writing them in. They give a good idea of the general theme of each chapter, and the contrast between the ancient heroes (Odysseus and Telemachus) and the modern day heroes (Leopold and Stephen) is a huge point of interest. It's also good to have a decent knowledge of the history of Ireland. I did find myself wishing that I knew more about Shakespeare (Stephen's obsessed with Shakespeare and prattles on about him constantly), other famous authors and philosophers, different languages, and Irish culture and history, but the book taught me more than it stumped me.I am only eighteen, and even though I could talk about Ulysses all day, I know that I don't yet have the ability to even scratch the surface of its' complexity and depth. I certainly plan on reading and re-reading it as I become more educated, but the reason that I want to is because it is, in essence, a good, funny, dramatic, and thoroughly entertaining read unto itself. Please, try not to pass up on it just because of its reputation."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"If you haven't read Ulysses yet, and feel daunted by the wildly different, extremely strident reviews of it, read on and I'll try to explain why this novel is worth your while.First, a brief summary. Ulysses attempts to capture what life was like in Dublin, Ireland, at the start of the twentieth century. It doesn't do this like a history book, solely in terms of political events and noteworthy individuals; rather, it attempts to convey the nature of the day-to-day lives of ordinary people by following its protagonist, an inoffensive fellow named Leopold Bloom, around the city. (It occasionally switches to following a young man named Stephen Dedalus, whom Bloom meets eventually, but Bloom is the main character.) It describes the things that transpire in the world around Bloom, as well as the thoughts that go on inside his head.Ulysses contains many disparate literary styles, but none are gratuitous; all are used in the service of the novel's themes. Joyce wanted to show how poetry, history, heroism, romanticism, and indeed all of human civilization, can be found slumbering in each individual, no matter how mundane his life might be. This comes to the fore in chapter 14, in which Bloom goes to a maternity ward to convey his best wishes to a woman in labour. When he arrives, he meets a bunch of drunk medical students who make callous remarks that make him uncomfortable; after some time, the nurse comes in and announces that the woman successfully gave birth, which relieves Bloom's anxiety. In addition to these simple events, the chapter tells the entire history of England. That is, the first paragraph is written in monosyllabic Druidic calls, the second approximates the style of ancient Latin historians, the third glides into early Anglo-Saxon poetry (\\"before born babe bliss had\\"), then it switches to Chaucer and medieval prose, and so on, the style of each paragraph moving a little bit forward in history, until it collapses into a mix of modern slang in the end.Thus, in numerous prose styles, the chapter recreates the birth and life of the English language itself, without warning the reader that it's doing this. In essence, it shows the history of a whole civilization in an original way. But the important part is, it never stops making sense; the plot and the dialogue keep progressing along with the style. Thus, the birth of a child is shown alongside the birth of the whole English language, indicating that civilization is born anew with every new human being. An ordinary birth is made to look like the culmination of all of English history, thanks entirely to this method of describing it. You don't have to have read Chaucer and Shakespeare and Gibbon to appreciate this chapter; Joyce read them for you, so all you have to do is watch the language change.This happens all the time throughout the book. For instance, chapter 13 finds Bloom wandering around on a beach, where some teenage girls are hanging out and talking. Without further ado, the book inserts itself into the mind of one of these girls. Her thoughts aren't anything amazing: basically, she just wants to fall in love with a handsome man, be loved in return, and be happy. However, in describing these thoughts, Joyce adopts the style of a dime-store romantic novel of the sort that are marketed to teenage girls: it's rife with sentimental, flowery prose like \\"the summer evening had begun to fold the world in its mysterious embrace.\\" The thing is, this style accurately reflects what folks go through during their teenage years: it's got the same heightened emotion, the same vague yearning, the same feeling one gets when falling in love for the first time, that this has never before happened to anyone else and will never happen again, the same romanticism and idealism. Thus, it's remarkably easy to sympathize with the girl, again solely due to Joyce's technique.That's probably the biggest reason to read Ulysses: all these styles and epic analogies are founded on a powerful emotional centre. Some folks like to say that this book is a \\"celebration of life,\\" or something to that effect. Well, in my opinion, it's a book about loneliness more than anything else. A large part of the book consists of Bloom's internal monologues, creating the impression that he's constantly hounded by unwelcome thoughts. When he's not running into hostile nationalists or petty gossips, he thinks about his adulterous wife. Then, in chapter 14, he meets Stephen Dedalus, decides to follow him out of the maternity ward and into the red light district, and then brings him home. Bloom, whose own son died eleven days after being born, feels fatherly affection toward Stephen; yet, Bloom and Stephen have nothing to say to each other. They engage in some small talk, but Stephen clearly doesn't take Bloom seriously, and Bloom doesn't really know how to approach Stephen. Then, Stephen, who is the closest thing to a friend that Bloom has met all day, leaves. Bloom goes upstairs and goes to sleep next to his wife; the final chapter is told from his wife's point of view, and it becomes abundantly obvious that her perception of her own husband is often wrong, and always strangely detached, as if he's not close to her at all despite living under the same roof. The style is breathtaking, rhythmic stream-of-consciousness, highlighting the sadness of this emotional distance between the characters.So, don't feel threatened by the style. Ulysses is very readable; true, each chapter has its own style, but most of the styles are perfectly accessible, and make the plot more engaging. All the \\"difficult\\" parts don't happen until the second half, giving you time to get accustomed to Joyce's idiosyncrasies (he doesn't tell you when he's moving from objective description to internal monologue, but after a while, you can usually tell). Just you try it on."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"I bought this to supplement the 1961 Random House edition (balance of textual corrections and respect for the original, matches most annotations), Modern Library edition (most portable, attractive package as all ML editions, typography a tad hard on my 40-something eyes) and '80s \\"Gabler edition\\" (hotly contested, worth keeping as a collector's item as it's been largely withdrawn).The original Shakespeare & Co. printings are out of my league, although I've seen several. Until I hit the lottery, this is the closest I'll own. A quick Google will find you first edition, first printing copies selling for up to 100k. I doubt my stimulus check is that big.This is a textual facsimile - a photo reproduction of the original, 1000-copy first edition - copy #784, to be exact. It also reproduces the cover typography and the Shakespeare and Co. title page, with an added, Orchises title page to keep the record clear. It contains the original colophon. It doesn't contain the forward, letter from Joyce to Bennett Cerf or Judge Woolsey opinion you're probably used to seeing in American editions.In a physical sense, it's hard to say how this is a facsimile, other than Orchises has reproduced the full size of the original. Of course, the paper and binding material are different.Most S. & Co. editions came unbound in blue-green wrappers, and could be bound as desired. This is why you see original printings in such disparate bindings. Orchises has reproduced the color of the original wrappers, although their binding looks a little more green than the original wrappers (maybe the color has shifted on those?). In any case, it's a solid cloth binding, comparable to, say, a better-than-average library binding. Bound size given as 9.6 x 7.5 x 1.7 inches, I measure it a hair taller. I daresay it will hold up to extended use.In addition to giving the slight tingle of pleasure that comes from knowing you're reading the text as originally sold at 12, Rue de l'Odeon, this edition is much more comfortable on my eyes than the others. I like the typeface used by original printer Maurice Darantiere for readability, but haven't gotten a definitive answer as to what it is - does anyone know? Somehow, it just feels right.Orchises says the paper is 50-pound, ph-balanced (aka acid-free) paper, and that seems about right. It's really good paper, with a slight, almost visually undetectable textured finish that feels good to the fingers. Excellent paper-to-ink contrast. I can, and will, read this all day.For the average reader, there's no earthly reason to spend this amount on a novel, and the ML edition will be both more convenient and, with its front material, more informative. For someone who rereads Ulysses for pleasure, it's a joy. The 1922 text has been analyzed to death, and is not without errors (2,000? 3,000? 5,000? the number gets larger each time it's mentioned). It was perhaps inevitable in a book with no clear reference manuscript - even the extant manuscripts were to some degree created by Joyce after the fact for sale. Part of one manuscript was burned by the angry husband of a typist, who found its content objectionable. An appreciable percentage of the text was written as corrections on the original proofs.Hence the charming apology from Sylvia Beach reproduced in this facsimile: \\"The publisher asks the reader's indulgence for typographical errors unavoidable in the exceptional circumstances. S.B.\\"But each effort to correct the errors added more errors, as well as layers of contention. See the well-documented battle over the Gabler edition. Or the disastrous 1998 \\"Reader's edition\\" by Danis Rose. The original is as good as any for reading, and if you care enough to buy a facsimile, you will have other editions for comparison anyway.For scholarly use, this isn't the best edition, since most standard annotations match the Random House or Modern Library editions. Unless you're beyond Ulysses 101 and want to compare editions.This is one of three first-edition facsimiles that have been published. I can't speak to the others, but I can recommend this one. Kudos to Orchises, and I hope they keep it in print. Or not, so my copy will become a minor-league collector's item.Ulysses has become an obsession and and a world in and of itself for its partisans, of whom I am one. The Ulysses obsession is much like the Higher Criticism surrounding the Sherlock Holmes canon. Many people find it bizarre, and I can hardly disagree. If, like me, you've got the bug, I don't have to explain it to you. This is an edition for you.If you don't, I paraphrase Louis Armstrong: \\"If you have to ask, you'll never know.\\""},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"Let's not mince words: Ulysses is one of the highest achievements of literary modernism. But it is also a book that must be read again and again (and again) if it is to be understood and enjoyed. Why buy a pulpy and cheaply made edition that falls to pieces on the second read? The Orchises edition, as a physical artefact, is not only aesthetically worthy of the text it presents (including the generous white space framing the text itself)--it also has the durability and weight you'd normally expect from a Bible.Other reviewers have detailed how this book is a faithful facsimile of the 1922 editions. The only other thing I would add is that this is the edition whose colour scheme Joyce himself oversaw: The white text and blue background of the cover symbolise the pentelic marble of Greece and the greenblue of the Mediterranean respectively (which are also the colours of the Greek flag).I thoroughly recommend this beautiful book for anyone who is serious about Ulysses."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"June 16th, 1904 in Dublin - a city under British rule and starting to try and shrug off the weight of the colonial oppression. On this day Joyce sets his &quot;heroes&quot; (heroes that only Joyce could create), Leopold Bloom (Ulysses) and Stephen Dedalus (Telemachus), on their own odysseys through Dublin's streets. Along the way we get a catalog of minor disappointments and victories, major literary experiments and a reading experience to truly last a lifeline.Stephen Dedalus, the hero from Portrait of an Artist as a Young Man, is the young student, the educated, literary and artistic individual somewhat based on Joyce himself. Leopold Bloom is the older, cynical 20th century everyman, in search of a son (where Stephen is, to some extents, missing a father). They make their individual journeys around Dublin that day, finally coming together in a chance meeting and then becoming friends.If you are after a riveting story, you won't find it here - the previous paragraph somes it up! What we get is to walk in these (and other people's) shoes for a day. We experience their small successes - an idle flirtation perhaps; we are with them as they realize some minor disappointment. Joyce termed these experiences ephiphanies and, to some extent, that's what Ulysses is - many, many iter-related and multi-layered ephiphanies.We also feel part of Dublin the city and Ireland the country. It's difficult looking back now after 80 years of home rule, with its successes and failures, what it must have looked like then unsure of what the future would bring. Joyce gives us a divided picture - we see the &quot;citizen&quot;, the nationalistic and stubborn individual who desires freedom at any cost; we see those who are staunchly royalist and who support (flirt with in the case of some of the women) the British soldiers. Joyce's picture is no one-dimensioned protestant-Catholic division either. This element of the book has great interest in it's own right.Ulysses has parallels from Homer's &quot;The Odyssey&quot;. The correspondence from chapter to chapter is highly selective. Some chapters use purely literary techniques to make a parallel (in particular &quot;The Sirens&quot;) where others have more pointed comparisons. You do not need to be familiar with The Odyssey to get something out of this book. Familiarity with Joyce's earlier works - Dubliners and Portrait of an Artist as a Young Man - is very useful, as is an understanding of Shakespeare's Hamlet. References to all of these abound.What you will probably also need is a guide. I used Harry Blamires's &quot;The New Bloomsday Book&quot; and I would seriously recommend using it or something similar on a first reading. Joyce's writing in this book is wonderful but it can be very very difficult. Having someone hold your hand on the journey helps you get much more out of it.The style of writing changes throughout the book; Joyce was experimenting with literary techniques to help tell the tale and give us insight into his character. Some of these are very successful - some are rather inpenetrable. In particular the &quot;Oxen of the Sun&quot; chapter is very hard-going in parts!However, unlike some other literary works, Ulysses is always fun. You might find you get the most out of some of it if you read it aloud (or imagine yourself doing so) because much of the work is highly poetical. For the final chapter - the only one told from a female perspective - the heavy stream of consciousness deserves to be read in a gallop, letting the words flow over you.Joyce wrote this seminal work over a period of seven years and, at times, it felt it would take me that long to finish it. It's certainly not something to embark upon if you won't be able to devote considerable time to it. With so many great books to be read, you may wonder why you should devote this amount of time and energy on a single book. In this case the answer is because it is a unique, wonderful and life-enhancing experience."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"Easily the most exciting book ever written. I'd give it 6 stars (or 10) if i could. Yes, i needed the Cliff notes to help me through it, and yes, i was on disability at the time, recovering from 4 knee surgeries, and it took more than 6 weeks, but it was all worth it. It's an amazing thing, a polyglotting amalgamation of languages (i counted more than 30, and am sure i missed a lot more), internal and external dialogue, brilliantly rendered characters and even dirty jokes.Perhaps i was ignorant beforehand, but i'd always thought that &quot;stream of consciousness&quot; referred to only the WRITER'S mental wanderings, the way beats like William Burroughs (e.g., Naked Lunch) and Allen Ginsburg (Howl, America, etc.) would later do it, or Marcel Proust (a\` la recherche du temps perdu--let's face it, the translations just don't cut it) during Joyce's time. But Joyce, progenitor of the beats and contemporary of Proust, did it for DIFFERENT PEOPLES' CONSCIOUSNESSES, moving from spoken word to internal thought states of several of his vividly drawn characters, and back again. It's almost impossible to convey the wonder of discovering this beauty, the way Joyce represented such a quantum leap in literature from Dostoyevsky, Dickens and Kafka before him, as Einstein did from 19th century physics.And to those who say &quot;anyone who says they've [sic] read this book is a liar,&quot; i promise you i read EVERY WORD, from &quot;Stately, plump Buck Mulligan&quot; to &quot;Elk and yak, the bulls of Bashan and of Babylon, mammoth and mastodon, they come trooping to the sunken sea, Lacus Mortis. Ominous, revengeful zodiacal host! They moan, passing upon the clouds, horned and capricorned, the trumpeted with the tusked, the lionmaned the giantantlered, snouter and crawler, rodent, ruminant and pachyderm, all their moving moaning multitude, murderers of the sun&quot; to &quot;and his heart was going like mad and yes i said yes I will Yes,&quot; the final words of Molly Bloom's soliloquy. And &quot;Frisco Beach&quot; too. (I'm NOT an English literature professor, just a physician--please don't hold that against me!)Challenging? yes. Worth it? oh my, yes. Your eyes (and &quot;The Doors of Perception&quot;) will be opened forever, never to approach writing the same way. WOW!"},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"In this book, Joyce continually reminds his readers that this 265,000-word epic utilizing over 30,000 different words is more about his prowess, and sometimes less about your pleasure.As athletic feat is derived from hours of repetitive drills, so too may this novel's conquest only be enjoyed after years of reading ever improving literature. This is not a book for the amateur. Precisely the opposite, this is a book continually referring to other novels, uses language of greater expanse than most others, and is written in styles which make the complexities vastly increased.More puzzle maker than novelist, Joyce's decision to write in paradox, paradigm, pun, parody, contrarian, contradiction and more makes the reading experience as complete as one could ask in the English language. The array of writing styles is mesmerizing: simple novel; over 30 pages of newspaper column; a 180-page play; over 70 pages of questions followed by answers; and one final chapter made up of seemingly 30-40 pages in ONE sentence of rambling autobiographical sexual revelation by Molly Bloom - the protagonist's cavorting wife.The interplay of the styles is extremely brave and enlightening. As they touch upon the same topic, but in different voices and different styles, the reader can further delve into what transpired hundreds of pages before, when the writer intentionally did not reveal it all, and definitely did not reveal it in easily decipherable verse. The interrelation between the texts would allow one to probably read the chapters in different orders and end in the same frame of mind. Nabokov asserted one could do such to his \\"Lolita.\\" And, Nabokov, creator of \\"Pale Fire\\", reminds me so much of Joyce as each toys with and teases the reader with puns, parodies and sometimes outdated jokes.The main characters, Leopold Bloom and Molly Bloom, are known to even those who have not read the novel. Their mutual philandering is the focus of much of the novel. The exploits of each are relatively revealed. But, not in black and white English. The point is taken, and from this came one great pornography trial which culminated with a 1933 United States District Court decision proclaiming, \\". . . the effect of \`Ulysses' on the reader undoubtedly is somewhat emetic, nowhere does it tend to be an aphrodisiac.\\"Such words would not be clearer. \\"An exquisite dulcet epithalame of most mollification suadency for juveniles amatory whom the odoriferous flambeaus of the paranymphs have escorted to the quadrupedal proscenium of connubial communion.\\" University level English is a prerequisite to understand this alleged smut - or to use Joyce's words: concupiscence delivering induration.And, most of the book, believe it or not, is not about sexual issues. Much touches upon other topics: philosophy, anti-Semitism, socialism . . . . But it is not always condescending; and it is much more than a 700-800-pages of dialectic prose. Because some of those topics are extremely poignant in 2009, those portions of the book apply to today's themes and can be easily (?) read today. Other topics are not for today's discussion. And, that makes reading those portions very difficult for today's reader.In all honesty there were times when I read the novel and asked, \\"what am I missing?\\" I had to stop and reflect, \\"Do others really see something that I cannot?\\" For instance the following passage really lost me: \\"What do they think when they hear music? Way to catch rattlesnakes. Night Michael Green gave us the box. Tuning up. Shah of Persia liked that best. Remind him of home sweet home. Wiped his nose in curtain too.\\" Do I need recite more? This caught my interest as much as a \\"White on White\\" painting at the museum of modern art. \\"I just don't get it.\\"And then, later I read the question-answer portion (second to last chapter), and the efficiency and beauty of the writing is both unique and unparalleled. A master of accidence and syntax, the writing is clear and artistic and most importantly - understandable. At the end of that chapter, I could only close the book, lean back and reflect on what I just read, and say one word, \\"Shazam.\\"Like climbing a mountain, the trek may be difficult - but at the journey's end, the party who endured the hardship will be rewarded with a lifetime of memories. Because of some bizarre passages of experimental prose and style, I cannot assert this is my favorite book. Not even the top ten for me. But, it is a great book. And, so well worth the read.Few tips: Read \\"A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man \\" and maybe the \\"Dubliners\\" before this. I would also recommend reading the last two chapters before reading from the beginning. And have a dictionary nearby. You will use it. Trust me."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"To fully appreciate Ulysses, one has to be aware how truly far ahead of its time this novel was. We have been through Faulkner stream-of-consciousness in high school and college English classes, and we can turn on the computer for live webcams all over the world, and we have been treated to the minutae of the Osbournes and other reality TV series. All of these - whether you consider them high art or dubious social experiments - are attempts to understand the human condition and the interaction among individuals in the most mundane of settings: daily life and relationships and the wandering life of the mind. Just as modern dramatists all stand on the shoulders of Shakespeare, so do modern literary writers stand on the shoulders of James Joyce. It is quite a hoot, however, to read what was deemed so &quot;obscene&quot; - we have sure come a long way (or fallen a long way, however you choose to look at it) - but the sheer craft of this book cannot be denied. Literature turned a sharp corner with this work. Yes, some of the passages can become tedious - and the references obscure (but even if you don't look them up, the overall effect is not lost) - it is best to read those long musing rambles almost with soft-focus eyes and let your mind flow with the words as if they were your own interior monologue. Another useful approach is to read them like poetry. Some of the phrases are just delicious and could stand on their own, perhaps like free verse or haiku. On first try, I didn't make it through Ulysses - a couple of years later, I tried again and took the pressure off myself to understand every sentence or to follow the &quot;story.&quot; I just read, and became completely engrossed."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"It seems, in this new century of total instant access to everything, that the accepted way of persuading people to read \\"Ulysses\\" is to say that it's a damn fine book but you need to be an experienced reader with a lot of time on your hands and plenty of patience...etc. Let's get a few things clear. This is not the \\"Critique of Pure Reason\\". There is not some algorithm you have to work out in advance in order to enjoy this book. It's a novel. It's a good read. The other stuff, the background stuff, the structural cunning and the wide-ranging allusiveness, is there in case you want to read it again. Basically, this is an unusually intelligent novel, in a basically comic mode, that plays a few games with the ways that we (sometimes lazily) tend to read. The rest is just a bonus. Joyce is just so generous in his joking and his desire to give us more than we normally expect from a book that we can get a bit overwhelmed by the cornucopia of stuff that he lays at our feet.I first read Ulysses when I was about 17 - I was still in what Americans would call high school, I wasn't reading it because I had to, but because I had heard it was supposed to be one of the best books around and it was set in the city around which I had grown up. I found the first three chapters a bit tricky but I kept going, because it seemed to me that the guy knew what he was doing. Then I got to the fourth chapter, and it suddenly became much easier. It seemed to me that this was the kind of thing that most of the writers I liked were trying to do, but most often failed at, because they just weren't this good. Joyce is supremely good at conveying the physical sensations of being alive - what it's like to be hungry, sad, lustful, worrisome, tired, hopeful, nervous. As the book went on, I knew I wanted to trust this guy. In the later sections, Joyce seemed to be expecting what I wanted to happen, and seemed determined to persuade me that how I wanted the book to develop wasn't necessarily the best way for the book to go - and I believed him. Since I hadn't read many \\"great\\" novels, his changes in style seemed to me to be exactly the sort of thing that an adventurous writer should be doing. I thought then, and still think, that he can be a bit garrulous, but he's such a skilful writer that I don't wish he'd made the book any shorter than it is.By the end, Ulysses had come to represent my basic idea of a really great novel. I had no notion that most novels aren't anything like as daring or as enjoyable. The only other novels I've read since which are both as courageous and as entertaining as this one are Pynchon's \\"Gravity's Rainbow\\", Sterne's \\"Tristram Shandy\\" and Melville's \\"Moby-Dick\\". Which, I know now, will tell you a lot about my taste in fiction.You really don't need to be an expert reader to appreciate \\"Ulysses\\". If anything, it's better if you have either read everything, or next to nothing. The notes are handy, if you want to know all that's going on - and I don't see why that should hurt. But even without them, Joyce - as they used to say of a certain brand of beer - can reach parts that other writers (or for that matter, beers) can't reach. He is a truly wonderful writer, and I'm (foolishly) proud that the greatest of novelists in the English language was an Irishman.People are still writing great novels - Pynchon's last was a lovely late masterpiece, and Don DeLillo is as vigorous as ever. But my personal opinion is that Joyce kicked a flagging Victorian form into new life, and the impact of his scuffed tennis shoe is still raw and smarting. \\"Finnegans Wake\\" is still awaiting the readers it deserves. In the meantime, there's no reason why any curious reader shouldn't get something out of \\"Ulysses\\". It's my favourite novel. It's also the best Irish book so far. Mind you, I can't wait till Mairtin O Cadhain's \\"Cre na Cille\\" gets translated into English..."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"&quot;Ulysses&quot; is perhaps the most challenging and rewarding book that I have ever read. Its slow pacing and density frustrated me the first time through, although the book provided enough snippets of briliance that I kept reading. However, after putting it on the shelf for a year, I picked up a copy of &quot;The Odyssey&quot; by Homer and read the two side by side. This made the events in &quot;Ulysses&quot; much more understandable, as Joyce borrowed the structure of his book from &quot;The Odyssey.&quot; It also helped me glimpse the true brilliance of &quot;Ulysses&quot;. By taking one of history's most epic tales and overlaying it onto a single day in the life of an average, unremarkable man, both books furthered my understanding of the common aims and desires of all people. If you buy &quot;Ulysses&quot;, pick up &quot;The Odyssey&quot; as well; this, more than any &quot;Joyce 101&quot; guides, will help you understand thiss fascinating and multilayered book. If you give it time and don't concern yourself with how long it takes to read, this book will grow on you and you will realize how many insights it provides on the human condition."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"Ulysses (1922) breaks traditional conventions of fiction: like Finnegans Wake (1939) it can hardly be appreciated completely unless passages are read aloud; like Homer's Odyssey it chronicles a plot of epic proportions, with details so rich and colourful they virtually epitomize realism and the stream-of-consciousness technique; and like the short stories in Joyce's Dubliners (1914) or Classical Greek drama, it focuses on a very specific, particular situation: a day in the life of a Dublin canvasser, Leopold Bloom.Ulysses gained a favourable reputation among Modernist contemporaries like Ezra Pound. Its inclusion of the vulgar language of Dublin's people was offensive to many, leading to public book-burnings and prohibitions against its publication. By the 1960s, when such concerns over language had dissipated, Ulysses still remained the esoteric interest of a limited number of readers. This is due partly to the text's numerous obscure passages and its reputation for being a &quot;difficult&quot; text. However, a basic knowledge of the Odyssey and an acceptance of the stream-of-consciousness technique -- which had, we should note, been employed in limited measure by writers like Dickens -- allows the patient reader to revel in decoding the text's plot, its puns, and its symbolic levels of meaning. Indeed, many editions of the work feature outlines listing some of the main features of each passage -- the equivalent of the pithy chapter titles that usually accompany the text of more traditional novels.Ulysses chronicles a place and time (Edwardian Dublin) but also a site and an age (the city and the 20th century). It does so with language that reflects the irony and fragmentation associated with the Modern era and its problems, as related in the novel. It took many laborious years to write (arguably, only Finnegans Wake would be more challenging to its author). Nonetheless, both of Joyce's long works have been immense influences on fiction and poetry in this century: they have re-asserted and re-emphasized the non-linear, non-written aspects of language (e.g. the Wake begins by ending its last sentence); they have (in Derrida's estimation) overturned Western society's privileging of speech (logocentrism) over writing (since many of the words and puns can only be understood via reading them on the page); and yet they retain a simple, straightforward backbone of human experience, connectedness, and imagination as their primary themes."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"There is an episode of the British TV series \\"Black Books\\" (a surreal comedy set in a second hand bookshop) where Manny says to his cruel employer Bernard: \\"I just sold that customer a copy of \\"Ulysses\\", \\"The Guide to Ulysses\\" and \\"A Handbook to the Ulysses Guide\\". Now surely that deserves a star.\\" This episode is even funnier now that I've read \\"Ulysses\\" for myself. Any reader who actually manages to get through \\"Ulysses\\" probably deserves a star as well.I read this book because it was reported to be controversial and I wanted to see what the fuss was about. I knew Anthony Burgess (the author of \\"A Clockwork Orange\\") was an expert on James Joyce and I've read other books that are written in strange versions of English (\\"The Night Land\\" by William Hope Hodgson, \\"Riddley Walker\\" by Russell Hoban and the aforementioned \\"A Clockwork Orange\\"). It was interesting to learn that James Joyce was the writer who invented the lingual style known as \\"stream of consciousness\\".Having already read a Penguin Classics edition of \\"A Portrait of the Artist As A Young Man\\", I thought I'd give \\"Ulysses\\" a shot. The copy of \\"Ulysses\\" that I read was a hardcover 1966 edition, published by Bodley Head. At 933 pages, the book posed an additional challenge by having no introduction at the front and no explanatory notes at the back. The plain green cover had no illustration and no blurb. Nevertheless I persevered.So what is \\"Ulysses\\" actually about? The only way a reader can appreciate this book is to have a knowledge of Homer's \\"Odyssey\\". That's what \\"Ulysses\\" is - a modern retelling of the Odyssey, taking place in Dublin on June 16 1904. There's no doubt that \\"Ulysses\\" caused a stir when it was first published (1922). People would have been more easily shocked back then. Even when the film adaptation was shown in New Zealand in the more liberated 1960s the audience was segregated by gender.If I have piqued a prospective reader's curiosity, all well and good. Although the book weighs 1 kilogram on the scales, \\"Ulysses\\" is definitely not light reading. As an experimental work, I would say that \\"Ulysses\\" does for literature what \\"Eraserhead\\" does for cinema. That's the best comparison I can think of.

Usually clocking in at 740 pages plus, this version manages to squeeze every word of the masterwork into a nimble 554 pages, thanks to a total lack of margin space or chapter breaks. Laughably, the book's spine does not allow even for this squeezed assembly, so that it arrives splayed and bow-legged, in unintentional tribute to the willowy author perhaps. Under-inked to the point of appearing mimeographed, with serifs giving way on almost every page, this is hardly the version one needs of a book to be cherished and re-visited often."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"This edition is the best and most readable edition of Ulysses available. As far as tackling the book goes... well, you get out of it what you put into it, but be prepared to put a lot into it. Simply: Don't read Ulysses because you feel like you have to or you should, read it because you want to and don't be too proud or afraid to seek out help.I was lucky enough to tackle this book in a classroom setting but it is not so utterly incomprehensible as to make that the only way to understand it. There are many guides (Stuart Gilbert's was the one we used but I suspect there are better. I even found sparknotes useful just for a chapter summary after reading.) to help people through the text and its deeper workings.The real question is, why choose this version of Ulysses over another, cheaper version? The text has been thoroughly reworked and many publishing mistakes directly interfering, misinterpreting, or outright disregarding Joyce's plan for his book have been fixed. The editors have nothing but the utmost respect for Joyce and for Ulysses and that care is evident throughout the book as the hands of the editors remain invisible behind Joyce's words.So rant and rave and rant and rave but I nearly gave this 4 stars just because of the product. The book itself, the binding and the cover, are absolutely terrible. My book was brand new and my cover fell off before I was halfway through it. By the end of the course more than half the books in our class were damaged and many of them had pages falling out as well. There's no excuse for any book, let alone the most important book of the 20th century, to fall apart while reading it."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"I have never heard anything like this before.

What's special about this day? Nothing, absolutely nothing. Bloom fixes breakfast, goes to the bathroom, does business, attends his friend Paddy Dignam's funeral, goes back to work, strolls on the beach, gets drunk with some friends, follows the party at a brothel, gets Dedalus out of a problem, and then invites him home for more drinks. Then he goes to sleep. Dedalus wakes up in Buck Mulligan's place (a tower), goes to teach at a school, wanders around the beach after visiting some relatives, goes to the library, in the evening he goes to a bar with some friends, and finally he meets Bloom at the brothel.This immeasurable book is a desperate attempt at capturing the present, which is constantly escaping: the present on the inside and the outside of people. It is an absolute witness of what the characters see, hear, fell, smell, and speak to themselves. It is looking for utter simultaneousness, trying to be an absolut record of everything that goes thorugh the bodies and minds of the main characters. Meanings? Symbols? Interpretations? Infinite. This book leaves, among many others, the sensation that it has passed and left us blank; that we didn't retain anything, that we hold nothing of it: exactly the same sensation that the present leaves on us.Every chapter parallels a chapter from Homer's &quot;Odyssey&quot;, and each is written in a different style. As a literary work of art, it is incomparable: it uses language, symbols, syntaxis, pronouns, time, everything, in a unique way, in order to depict for us what happens to a person in a normal day.A separate mention is deserved by the final chapter, the monologue of Molly Bloom. 50 pages without a period, a true masterpiece of stream-of-consciousness. A most faithful portrait of what goes through a woman's mind half awaken, half asleep, a summary of her life and her relationship with Leopold. It is necessary to read this passage in one single effort.When reading &quot;Ulysses&quot;, it is useful to keep in mind Marcel Proust's work. Proust seeks to recover the past long gone, while Joyce seeks to capture the present before it becomes past. This is an overwhelming book, irritating and, above all, admirable. It reaches unsuspected levels of creativity, experimentation and literary depth.Some people don't like it: that's their prerrogative. But to say this is a phony or bad book, is to acknowledge one's laziness as reader. They're losing a tour-de-force in literature. Be sure you don't suffer the same fate."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"It took me more than 4 weeks to finish this book. Most parts of the book were difficult to understand. That means I didn't understand them.I started out thinking it would be a great journey to read the whole 700+ pages of great writing. As I went along, I found that I couldn't understand one-tenth of what was going on. Well, I had to finish the book because I wanted to experience what many people say is the greatest novel ever written.One thing I learned from reading this book is that when you are faced with something you don't understand, it is okay to get the hell out. Otherwise, you'd just be wasting 4 weeks of your life.Needless to say, I will never forget the four weeks I spent reading this book. I'd remember it as one of the darkest periods of my life."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"This is a great edition for your first time through Ulysses. The notes and introduction are immensely helpful. Schemata, Odyssey parallels, a decent amount (for a novel edition) of allusions are all glossed.Buy from overseas. Really worth it. If you've already read Ulysses, this is a good edition for reference, but you may want a better quality paperback, so look at the Gabler for that. No notes there so be warned!"},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"Ulysses symbolizes the height of modernist writing, and in many ways, was the first to address post-modern issues- in it's fragmentation and pastiche of form.Each chapter, which accounts for a particular time of day in chronological order (perhaps the only linear aspect of the book), appropriates a certain 'style', which addresses the 'consciousness' that Leopold Bloom, our hero, is undergoing.For example, when Bloom is worried about his job at the newspaper, the chapter breaks into journalistic form, adapting headlines and soundbites, however comical and absurd.Another example, when Bloom enters a brothel, and is pensive about being recognized, the chapter becomes a play, where all the characters are faceless and have taken on roles.There is a tremendously humane and sad scene at the pub, where all of Bloom's friends talk and banter over him, not hearing the profound things he has to say. Bloom is a poet that doesn't know it, to borrow from Dylan's rhyme. He is a modest man, navigating his way through his banal day. He goes to a burial and daydreams the corpse rolling down the hill. A bar of soap melts in his pocket. He goes to the beach and looks at a girl. In the bath-tub, he notices his penis, floating like a water-lily. And that is why this book is so kind and rare: His day becomes beautiful through his eyes. Each banality and prosaic task becomes macro-cosmic and mythical in the way that it is written. Bloom's Odessey is to return home.With each transition, Joyce continues to astonish the reader with how agile his writing is. The most genius part of the book is the penultimate chapter, in which Bloom and Stephan (the narrator in \\"Portrait of the Artist\\" and Joyce's alter-ego), enter the former's home, both drunk and lonely. Here, the chapter becomes Q & A form, a series of questions that are answered. Perhaps Bloom, eager to sustain Stephan's company, so late in the night, adopts the role as an interviewer, the way we ask meaningless questions to allude the awkward silence.In the end, Bloom crawls into bed, and his stream of consciousness blends into that of his wife's, Molly. Here, readers enter her mind, and we discover what has been bothering poor and gentle and lovely Bloom all day."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"Not nearly as difficult as it is proclaimed to be, this book seems to have taken Nietzsche's advice to heart: A great writerwrites at such an elevated level that most people cannot understand him. This is absolutely true of Ulysses, as the convoluted meditations of the characters and abrupt jumps from reveries and memories to actual events do a marvellous job to perplex the reader.Content: Countless riddles, allusions, metaphors, even intended misspells complicate the reader's life but hardly make this philosphical novel unreadable. Yes, philosphical novel, something you can meditate on after reading. Also, it seems that James Joyce has decided to intertwine modernism, Homer, Irish history, human ethics, and his view on religion and life alltogether, in parts creating a pulp of dense bombast. The modernist techniques are somewhat amusing at first, but after advancing deeply into the book they seem nothing more than ostentatious display by Joyce of his masterful writing ability. There are some faint references to sex and bodily functions, but so subtle as to leave me in mystery of the reason for its ban. Disseminated over a variety of subject, Ulysses does not fail to include relgion and allocate to it a share of the onus. However absurd the concept of religion is, it does serve a purpose in a few of the chapters. Also, Ulysses is famous for its blatant Homeric parallel: each chapter of Ulysses modeled on a Homeric adventure or character. It is truly amazing how the two are combined. To understand the content of this literary behemoth with more insight, one might consult either Pinkmonkey.com (free) or Cliffnotes, both equally helpful.Characters: The characters could have used a lot more dimensionality. Frugal on polishing their facets, James Joyce seems to be using them as puppets to mouth his philosophy and not much more. Usually a protagonist attracts empathy of the reader, but Joyce did a poor job with his characters as they seem very distant in their meditative drivel. In other words, there wasn't a single way I could relate to them. Even Joyce's flaccid attempt at adding flaws to their character by assigning obscenities, made them no more human or real. Perhaps simplifying the embellished bombast would have helped in understanding them.Overall: Despite its many flaws (e.g. length, verbosity, etc...) there is no other book that deserves your attention as much as this particular one. If you will just find perseverance to bear through Joyce's daunting baffling narration, you will be delected to have found it (perseverance) to finished such a marvellous literary accomplishment. Having said that, I favor \\"The Portrait of The Artist as a Young Man\\" by Joyce over Ulysses."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"... The critics rave about Ulysses. Many readers who've slogged all the way through proclaim it to be the greatest book of the 20th Century. Put me in the camp of those who thinks it's a pile of gibberish.It's the only book I've ever read that still had me scratching my head after three chapters. Is it a novel? A series of unrelated short stories? A poem? Apparently, only intellectuals can tell.I was taught that writing is the process of communicating with readers. This book fails miserably at that. I honestly can't summarize the plot. I didn't understand it. Maybe I'm stupid, but I think the fact that Joyce repeatedly breaks into long stretches of French and Latin and his own made-up words--none of which I understand--has something to do with it.I give the book two stars because of Joyce's obvious mastery of vocabulary, and because maybe I'm wrong. Maybe I'm too ignorant to comprehend the genius. But I doubt it. To me, reading enjoyment shouldn't be this hard. --Christopher Bonn Jonnes, author of Wake Up Dead."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"The book is simply wonderful, and there is nothing I can say that is more eloquent or unusual than the other many reviews before me.The only thing I would like to mention, is my thoughts on the end. That one, long, run-on sentence. To my mind at least, it felt like he understood perfectly the way a woman can think.Of course I'm generalizing, but I read a review written by a man who'd read the first 50 pages, then skipped to the end to find that flow of thought, and thought it was perfectly weird.I felt sorry when I read that, because the way the thoughts swirl in and out and round about and seem to build with 'fervorency'(is that a word? did I spell it right?), is exactly the way my thoughts wander on occasion, and I marvelled at the way Joyce seemed to be privy to that sort of, what I consider to be, 'female' thought.It was beautiful. I enjoyed it more than I can say. I recommend it to everyone."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"A couple things: First off, everyone's heard of Ulysses, and everyone has their own notions of what they expect from a book, what they expect from Ulysses in particular, and how they feel about experimental literature in general (though by today's standards Ulysses appears vastly less experimental than, say, Finnegan's Wake). So basically, if you don't think you'll like Ulysses, you probably won't. And no, it's not a casual read. If you're willing to do some homework, though, which in my case included some Homer, Shakespeare, Freud, and Irish history (though I could go on), it just might be worth your time (lots of time) to slog through all 900+ pages of the thing. But that's just my two cents.The real reason I'm writing this review is to steer people away from the 'reader's edition' of Ulysses--that's the reason for the two stars. This is not the novel as Joyce intended--it is an adaptation by Danis Rose, and reflects what he (Rose) thought was 'accurate.' Though the changes he makes are minor--and, in all fairness, may correct oversights made by Joyce--I am offended by the idea that an editor has the ability to take an important and influential work and make changes as he sees fit. The fact that this edition was ever put to print debases the role of the artist (any artist), and reflects the increasing trend toward commercialization and dumbing-down of art in favor of turning a profit.So--is Ulysses the greatest artistic achievement in any medium, ever? I don't know, and whether I think so is irrelevant anyway. But if you want to find out for yourself, please, PLEASE, at least read Joyce's words, not Rose's."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"This is a wonderfully crafted book -- the physical object, that is, and not just the text. (Because if you're willing to pay this much for a copy of &quot;Ulysses&quot; you obviously take that for granted.) The volume is larger in size than typical hardcover books today, meaning that the type is a decent readable size and the margins are generous (for the note jotting fiends among us). Great care has clearly been taken in the choice of paper and the sewn binding, which allows the book to lay flat during reading and insures years of re-reading. Although there is no dustjacket the cover is made of very durable material; various cover protectors can be found to stand in or, for the really paranoid, a slipcase can be made or found. It should be added that the text is presented as originally published, so there are no notes or glosses to help the first-time or casual reader; neither are the episodes keyed to any of the line numberings found in other editions. However, those wishing to refer to notes would be best off buying one of the helpful readers' companions by Gifford or Blamires anyway. In relation to other available editions, this one occupies a vast middle ground between the throwaway mass-market paperbacks on the one hand and the out-of-reach collectors' editions on the other. The book's durability and elegant though understated presentation should prove most attractive to those readers who intend to read the text again and again, whether for pleasure or for study. In short, this volume is a keeper."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"How can this book be compared to others when it is so different? It has very little exciting plot. From what I have read of Joyce he has little imagination for pulling the reader to the edge of his or her seat, and keeping the reader up for hours past his or her bed time waiting to see what happens next. He does, however, have great knowledge of english language among other things, and uses it well. I LOVED reading this book, but not because of how much better it is than all other books (because it isn't), but because I couldnt wait to see what all of the fuss was about! You should definately get it for the same reason. By the way, Random House, the company that rated it number one has sole publishing rights to Ulysses."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"There are a few things you need to understand Joyce. A willingness to set aside race hatred is one. The ability to follow a poet even though he uses a number of different writing styles and narrative techniques. The capacity to explore religious ideas which may not rigidly conform to your own fundamentalist views. And most of all a heart which can feel compassion for all humanity, not just your own myopic tribe, sect, or church. If you have just one of these qualities you will find an unforgettable, life-altering adventure in between the covers of this book. If there is any book out there that has the power to restore one's love for the human race it is Ulyssess."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"It is a mistake to try to read this book along side the Gilbert &quot;skeleton key.&quot; It would be like simultaneously looking at a painting and reading a book on the details of the painting and why we should like the painting.It is not the easiest book to get through.

I pick it up from time to time and it is a joy. Aeolus read aloud by someone who knows what they're doing is quite funny.Read the first chapter. Read the Burgess book. Relax. This isn't a book to be consumed like a can of Busch. It is meant to be sipped and appreciated.I can't think of what other book could top the century's greatest works. Some other people prefer Busch. Nothing against Busch, but this book is like none other."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"One can dispute various things regarding the Gabler edition of Ulysses, but, for me, there was one compelling reason to purchase it.If a reader wishes to purchase one or more books that discuss and/or annotate Ulysses, then this, the Gabler edition of Ulysses, should be given prime consideration. Many of these supplementary books are line coded to the Gabler addition, such as:1. Ulysses Annotated by Don Gifford. This is a large book that annotates almost everything in Ulysses.2. Ulysses Revised Edition by Hugh Kenner. Another book of annotations.3, Reading Joyce's Ulysses by Daniel Schwarz.4. New Bloomsday Book, by Harry Blamires. Line coded to Gabler, but also has line codes for 1961 Random House and 1992 Penguin.5. Ulysses and Us by Declan Kiberd is an exception as it refers to the 1992 Penguin version of Ulysses. But this book doesn't use line codes.I own all of the above books (+James Joyce and Ulysses by Stuart Gilbert, and am grateful that I bought Gabler."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"Ulysses is a book well worth reading in any form. It is a beautiful story that compounds an epic journey into the sights and sounds of one day. This edition is a good place to begin reading Ulysses because it is a reprint of the first text as it appeared in 1922. While this text has many errors, many noted by the author himself, it is still one of the best representations we have of Joyce's intentions.

If you enjoy philosophy, heavy symbolic imagery, psychology, analysis of religious corruption, drawing parallels between Greek Myths and everyday life, and learning new english words then you will undoubtedly get the most out of Ulysses.I personally think that Ulysses is a great choice as the best fiction of the century because it covers almost *all aspects* of life from romance to racism. And it is one of the first books that lets you really see how the mind works (i.e. &quot;stream of conciousness&quot; technique). But it is probably this psychological aspect of the novel that turns people off. If one can get past this barrier than it can be seen that Ulysses is truly worthy of its #1 ranking.Homer's Odyssey (from which &quot;Ulysses&quot; is the main character) is considered to be one of the greatest books of western literature of all time. It is only fitting that Ulysses fills this role in the 20th century."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"This is one of those classic novels that gives classic novels a bad name. Modern readers equate the word \\"classic\\" with \\"boring and hard to read.\\" But most classics have risen to that status because they are timeless, powerful and entertaining - Heart of Darkness, War and Peace, and Red Badge of Courage come to mind (all highly readable, by the way). Then there are the novels that have been made famous because of the academic community's inability to distinguish between obscure genius and obscure pretentious pap. Ulysses falls into the latter category.This work has its moments, no question. I actually enjoyed the final hundred pages. Too bad I had to read 900 pages (hardcover version) of intellectual onanism to get to them. Joyce was a talented writer, but trying so stridently to prove that to his readers is just plain arrogant. His prose makes Faulkner look like Crichton. I was able to follow the narrative less than half of the time. Lest you think that has more to do with my intellect (or lack thereof) than bad writing, you should know that I am a well-read, educated person who makes his living as a professional editor. The point is, if a literate audience can't make (any) sense of your work without referring to a 500 page reference book every two minutes, your novel is a failure.Ulysses is a book for people who think a blank white canvas hanging in an art gallery is genius. Fans of Joyce need to read Tom Wolfe's Painted Word before they can have any credibility defending Joyce's &quot;masterpiece.&quot;"},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"This is a great book, it is masterfully written and there is not a word that cannot be explained. The negative reviews for this book are written by people who lack the patience or education to understand it. There are stacks of books written just for these people; The New Bloomsday Book being the best one. This is not an Oprah's Book Club book, it is Serious Literature, and it is unapologetic about it. It's fine to say that you didn't get it or you don't understand it; but to make these silly \\"Emperor's new clothes\\" remarks is a display of ugly ignorance.Ulysses demands something of its reader. You need a real education--not a job-training college degree, but the experience of having engaged the works of history's greatest writers for your own benefit and on your own terms. You need to have read a great breadth of authors in real depth, and you need to have understood them. You need to know what happened in the Odyssey, you need to know a fair bit of history, and you need to have read a wide variety of authors from Chaucer to Shakespeare to Dickens. You need to be well-read enough that you can understand what's going on without flipping back and forth to Cliff Notes.It blows me away that one of the negative reviews mentioned that someone was made to read this book in high school: I don't think you can possibly be well-read enough for it in high school. If you're not a voracious reader, someone who reads quality classic literature for the fun of it, you are not in Joyce's target audience. There's nothing here to entertain you if you can't keep up; Joyce isn't Mark Twain, giving you an entertaining adventure story to divert you if his larger social points go over your head. He wants to push literature into new directions, and he is very demanding.But if you are capable of approaching this book, the rewards are astounding. This book is incredibly great; the language will floor you, the characters are interesting and engaging (to whoever said that the characters aren't developed, what more could you ask for than Leopold Bloom?), and the book is very funny in parts. If you can read it, you'll be glad you read it.And if you can't read it, don't sweat it. Most people can't. There's nothing wrong with that--plenty of great authors are very approachable to less well-read people, and it's just that Joyce isn't one of them. Joyce wasn't trying to be mean, he was just trying to use ALL of his education to try some things that hadn't been done before. Try Dubliners, which is much more straightforward and readable, or even Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man. Joyce and his readers are not \\"overeducated\\"--and what a silly, ignorant, impossible concept that is anyway!Just don't take this attitude that Ulysses is for boring intellectuals. With this attitude, you are the one being snotty, not the Ulysses readers. This book is capable of getting some people really excited and engaged; respect it for what it is, don't deride it for what it isn't. This is a great book for people who have read most of the other great books; it may not be the great book for you. There's nothing wrong with that."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"A good version of Ulysses, no doubt, but it is still better to go with the Gabler edition. The first edition of Joyce's text and many subsequent editions averaged about 7 errors a page. In a book this long, those add up rather quickly.

Mr. Rose claims to have brought the beauty of Joyce's most famous work closer to being appreciated en masse. He strips the work of many techniques that Joyce is admired for, that set him apart as an artist and that he surely intended. Gone are many (there are thousands of revisions) of Joyce's omissions of puctuation, capitalization and other conventions of grammar. There are documented mistakes that Joyce attempted to correct during his lifetime, and three existing editions are far truer to Ulysses as it was intended. There is no reason to subjugate the techniques of James Joyce so people with short attention spans and speciously pedantic (why correct Joyce's purposeful misuse of grammar) leanings can appreciate. If you simply want to know the story buy the Cliff's notes or ask someone who read the book. If you want to find out all the reason's for Joyce's renown read the true \\"reader's editions\\" from the 20's and thirties or ,of course, the 1961 text. I am obviously very angry.

I actually did manage to more or less read it all the way through, in one long twelve hour night, which I can never have back now. And I don't know about all the nuances and subtleties that it supposedly contains, but the basic thrust of it was clear enough.Ulysses is basically an unbridled attack on the very ideas of heroism, romantic love and sexual fulfillment, and objective literary expression. This is made especially clear by the title's reference to The Odyssey of Homer (Ulysses being the Latin name for the Greek Odysseus)---and the unmistakably unbridgeable contrast between the two books, both in terms of the content of the stories, and their modes of expression.Odysseus is a great man, King of Ithaca, husband of Penelope, father of Telemachus, and a hero of the Trojan war. The Odyssey chronicles his heroic ten-year voyage to return home from the war to his wife and son. Ulysses, on the other hand, is about an ordinary day in the life of Leopold Bloom, a bumbling buffoon, impotent both in life and in bed. In Homer's view, man is a heroic, even God-like, being---and woman is more than a match for him. In Joyce's, man is metaphysically ridiculous, especially in matters of sex, and woman is his equal in patheticalness.And then there is the literary style Joyce employs to spew forth this sewage. While Homer's epic poem takes the form of strictly-metered verse, Joyce switches literary mode, from straight prose to dialogue to stream of consciousness (among other things), almost at random throughout the work, though it seems to degenerate more and more toward the end.If the point of Ulysses were to break free of outmoded and arbitrary restrictions of classicism, it would be admirable. But that's not what Joyce is doing. He doesn't offer a positive alternative to replace the Homeric values (which I think are genuine values) upon which he's pissing. He's pissing on them just to piss on them. It's pure nihilism, and it's disgusting.Ulysses is obscene, not because of any language it uses or its obsession with sex, but because of its thematic content---the ideas it conveys. The book expresses nothing less than an all-consuming hatred of man and any positive values to which he aspires. And that is why I think Ulysses is one of the most vile and evil books ever written."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"Joyce had sometimes been called a writers writer. One reviewer even suggested we should give Ulysses the benefit of a doubt, for the same reason we uneducated lay-folk use to accept on sight modern physics or Einsteins Relativity theory. Now I can think of all sorts of definitions for the meaning and purpose of imaginative literature -- to serve as the arcane Cabala for the initiates of a secretive cult is not one of them. If a novel lacks what it takes to reach every conceivable kind of reader, regardless whether it is to be received as a pleasure or a nuisance, than it is a failure, plain and simple. I may detest what I read -- even successful novels dont come with a gun held to your head -- but Ulysses is simply an empty shell, nothing left to form an opinion or taste either way. A bad writer is just bad, because he cant cope adequately with his task. But there is also a possibility that I may detest a good writer for the waste of skill and talent on something I deem to be an unworthy or badly misguided effort. So even if I may not like what he has to say, I can still be impressed by the beauty and cogency of his delivery. I dont like it, but the man has something to say, and he says it well. But this here is different: can anybody tell me what else it possibly could be than the vain demonstration of stylistic skills from the portfolio of a great talent -- with absolutely nothing to say? God knows, I am all for a reader who pays to a good authors work the respect it deserves and pitches in a bit of his own effort. This should entitle a good reader to carry home something worthwhile. However it is not just the Ulysses, I got the same impression from the entire work of James Joyce, even from his early poems. Except for a precious few luminous moments (the travel of young Steven in the train compartment, the damp and creeping cold atmosphere on the rugby pitch in the Portrait) it really amounts to little more than an exercise in the rhetorics of imaginative writing. It must be me, but I cant help feeling something amateurish in all this contrived effort. Call Joyce a genius, if you like, we all know he was determined to be remembered as the outstanding writer of the 20th century. And we do! We remember his legend the same way we remember Cervantes or Kafka before we open their books. An aura surrounds Ulysses, and this awe may even carry us through a few passages and purple patches, but thats where the comparison ends. Take away the halo from Cervantes and Kafka and you still enjoy a robust read -- I doubt the same can be said of Joyce. He had the gift, and he knew it, but even his consummate admiration for Ibsen didnt help him to find for himself a story worth telling, that is a story which would make his talent shine and captivate the reader. Technically, Ulysses is a superb piece of narrative engineering. A myriad of leitmotifs and themes entwine, separate and meet again each delivered in a variety of different voices and styles. So, ok, a letter torn to tiny shreds into the river carries to a corresponding theme five chapters later, a piece of soap bought in the morning becomes an important item in late afternoon, a galaxy of town-folks revolve around each other and do their daily chores, though mostly in pubs, hospital-canteens and hostelries -- a tat one-sided should it ever become necessary to reconstruct Dublin from scratch. So our Mr. Bloom masturbates over the sight of a crippled girl -- the joke to write parts of this particular passage in the pseudo-elegant journalese of a turn of the century fashion magazine is lost on me: is it supposed to poke fun on the clich beset thoughts in the poor girls mind? In fact Joyce ventriloquizes a lot; all over the book the English language is taken through her paces like a dressage horse, nobody can deny the authors brilliance, and sometimes he even presents a superb artistic flash, like the gold coins the principle is handing out to Stephen. Yet even here I see the author glancing sideways under his eyelids: are we really looking? Do we catch the moment? (Kafka did such things in his sleep.) So what does all this amount to, on some 800 pages, except to small change? Yes, Ulysses has style, a whole museum of styles to be exact, and nothing but style. After you finish it, if you make it through, you will leave it behind like a confused dream, and forget it just as soon."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"With _Ulysses_, Joyce truly showed the world what a elitist egotist he was. Unfortunately, too many academics were entranced by occasional flourishes of vivid imagery to see this sham for what it was (and is): An intense act of laziness and hubris by a writer who had trouble telling stories. I think of _Ulysses_ as the precursor to all the self-indulgent pseudo-intellectual garbage that turned so many people off from reading &quot;great literature&quot; over the last 60 some odd years. However, the greatest tragedy comes from the fact that Joyce had talent in spades and showed it on occasion, such as with many of his short stories. If he would have tried to make _Ulysses_ even semi-comprehensible, it may indeed have been as great as some make it out to be. In the end, though, it's all just gibberish without a story to drive it."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"Nest-stirring Hi[s]story at 10am in the school of cat-schism[This essay is a reflection on the second episode in Joycean Ulysses titled: \`Nestor']Ire's (land) is the anomie conscientious of \`Trans-mythos' in affectation, floating in a sunken lemuria.

Well, the critics have such overblown &amp; grandiose interpretations of the book's meaning &amp; Joyce's importance that they were alternately making me laugh or become violent.But last night I had an epiphany. It occurred to me that Ulysses is the greatest hoax of the century, ranking with Conan Doyle's Piltdown Man. Surely, Joyce must have realized that Ulysses was the inevitable &amp; fitting conclusion to the Romantic Age. Art, cut loose from the mooring of God, had steadily drifted away from the universal &amp; towards the personal. Ulysses is the culmination of this trend--a novel that could only be read, understood or enjoyed by its author.

Hardly. A babbling, senseless tome upheld by &quot;literary luminaries&quot; who fear being cast into the tasteless bourgeois darkness for dissent? Yes, that's the gist. Joyce rambles and, moreover, Joyce doesn't say a blessed thing (save what literary critics assign him -- but that's what literary critics do: They find profundity -- not to mention the occasional phallic symbol -- in the midst of absolutely nothing.) The poor trees who gave their lives that _Ulysses_ might gather dust on countless shelves would have been put to nobler use as toothpicks. As for L. Renner, who claims that Joyce's dull (if bedlam) world parallels our own - that &quot;we are all Leopold Bloom&quot;: I deny that I am so uncouth that I would exhibit such behavior on a public beach - in the midst of a fireworks display, to beat all!

Being, however, a charitable chap (and a chap who'd rather not be tarred, feathered and ridden on a rail by an agitated gaggle of bas bleus and &quot;lettered&quot; gentlemen), I've given Joyce a single, shining star.

Most of these remarks are high praises for the quality of his work and particularly for his originality.Before buying the book, I went on-line to check Amazon's review about it. At the time, the comment seemed helpful. It clearly explained the structure of the novel, the personality of the characters - Leopold Bloom ans Stephen Dedalus -, as well as the outline of the plot - a day in the life of these people.The review is very positive. It mentions that it is a &quot;modern masterpiece&quot; and that it is the greatest expression of realism in literature. Furthermore, it is said that the novel tells a &quot;funny, sorrowful and suspenseful&quot; story where &quot;everything happens&quot;.Since I am not an expert in literature I wonder what a masterpiece is? I cannot convince myself this is the best literature can get.Nevertheless, other characteristics mentioned are impossible to grasp. It is obvious that I wrongly assumed that Amazon and I shared the definition of basic concepts such as &quot;funny&quot;.Therefore, I discovered that the novel was not what I though it would be. I like thoughtful and dynamic story telling books. I should have never bought Ulysses because it is slow, distant and numbness of one's brain is required to understand what the author is describing.To sum up, the book did not impress me.

I knew the book was famous, considered by many the greatest book of the 20th Century, and I had a vague recollection of having tried to read it when I was still a teenager. Fully conscious and wide-awake I closely read the first 40 or 50 pages. I can't say I don't remember what I read, but I can say I had no idea where the &quot;action&quot; took place, no idea of who was talking, and absolutely clueless to what any of the characters thought. The experience was completely mind-numbing. I then turned to the last chapter, and turned page after page looking for the period at the end of that chapter's opening sentence. I don't know how thorough my scanning was but I believe the whole last chapter, several pages, is one very long sentence.Joyce is an aesthetic bother of Marcel Duchamp (known for The Fountain, a urinal, now a museum piece) and John Cage (the composer of pieces for prepared piano, where the piano's strings are mangled with trash. He also is the &quot;composer&quot; of violin piece where the performer goes through the motions of playing without making a sound. I don't know if Amazon's audio capabilities can capture the nuance of that piece.) In this &quot;club&quot; we have a composer who writes noise or silence, an artist who exhibits a toilet, and a writer who is incomprehensible...long may they rest in peace.Two positive things I can say about James Joyce is that he has a great sounding name and he gives wonderful titles to his works."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"I spent months to read this crappy novel, hailed by modern pseudo-intellectuals as 20th century best (maybe because they are so close to its flimsy thoughtless characters and broken up narration -typical to Post-Modernist 'masterpieces'-).

The thoroughly unreadable ramblings found inside are under no circumstance manifestations of artistic rebellion, being in fact just excuses coming from extraordinarily self-indulgent authors.Of course, some non-indoctrinated people could object and say: this book portrays well Dubliner &quot;middle&quot; society from ITS OWN perspective (not from a critical eye). However, I don't think this was author's intent. His intent was just &quot;getting rebelious&quot;: being &quot;new&quot;, unbounded by (older) rules and responsibility.Why two stars, then?

I'm sure it has tons of allegorical layers but whats the good of that when you can't tell what the hell is even going on.It seems that for a book to be considered great it has to have layers of meanings hidden that are very hard to figure out.

Joyce is not a model to be followed by any writer. Granted that it is the reader's prerogative to choose and pick - it is not up to the author of imaginative literature to be selective about his readers. This extremely gifted man had set out to surpass everything produced in literature up to his time, and if his goal had been tedium to the max, he achieved it. I am the first to give Joyce due credit for the linguistic scope and the skill with which he engineered the plot in Ulysses - but answer me honestly: does any of the characters come to live the way - say - Tolstoy manages to animate his people with a much more primitive technique? I seriously doubt it. Joyce the human being had limitations which got in the way of Joyce the writer which prevented Joyce the artist from living up to the full potential of Joyce the talent. Style is a direct reflection of an artist's temperament - obviously the writer of &quot;Ulysses&quot; could never make up his mind what kind of style it is going to be - the book lacks unity and appears in places unnecessarily oracular due to the style, but not necessarily for the subject matter, which can be looked up in a good reference! And if that wouldn't be bad enough, more than once Joyce went off on a rather revealing tangent: take for instance the masturbation scene in &Ograve;Nausicaa.&Oacute; Superbly written as it is, it gives us the whole deficiency of Joyce in a nutshell. He imitates the presumptuous and pompous phrasing in certain fashion magazines of the period, but just tell me to what end? Is it to poke fun on the cliche beset thought-process of the crippled girl? Well I fail to see the joke, this is just cruel. Satire either attacks a subject that has the capacity to bite back, or it is merely an act of a certain and in Joyces time very fashionable &quot;anti-philistine&quot; snobbery. Or perhaps the only reason for writing this way was that Mr. Joyce wished to flaunt his stylistic versatility? I am not objecting to have readers making an effort to get into a difficult text - not at all. But the reward should offer better things than the gratification of a crossword puzzle. We talk about participation. Participation in the artist's temperament to see things the way they present themselves to the artist. This does not prevent us from disagreeing. (I disagree with many things Tolstoy had to say when he couldnt resist to step on his collapsible soap box. But I also appreciate his artistic genius whenever he spares us the lecture.) To give another example: Compare &Ograve;Oxen of the Sun&Oacute; in Ulysses with the moments when women break their water in Tolstoys novels. Giving birth is not a linguistic exercise. Joyce's choice of style (in fact a display of 60 different styles and modes of speech) is just clever but completely detached from the event. What is to be expected at the very least, is a certain coherence of artistic vision, which I find utterly lacking in Joyce. He can't make up his mind, so he throws at us all the imitative bits and pieces from a (very talented) schoolboy's exercise book. Ulysses is the portfolio of a writer's versatility - it is not a work of art. When I was much younger and naive, I had read every single line of Joyce, including his letters and poems and even Finnegan's Wake (what a waste of time). I can't help it, the man was an amateur for all his life, a typical tinkerer and home improvement guy who probably never really found the kind of subject matter that could have distracted him from his self-consciousness. His short stories wouldn't be barely remembered these days if there wasnt his name under the title. They are imitation pieces, ventriloquistic exercises, and pretty flat and lifeless if held against Chekhov and Kipling, or Flaubert and Kathleen Mansfield. Apparently &quot;Dubliners&quot; and &quot;Portrait&quot; and especially &Ograve;Ulysses&Oacute; were written by an author who went on a quest for his own style. If Finnegan's Wake eventually was the place where the eagle landed, then, I am sorry to say, the game wasn't worth the candles. Joyce had tons of talent to burn, but something went seriously wrong here. I am all for modern art, and consider &quot;post modern&quot; a phony contradiction in terms. But lesser talents accomplished more - DosPassos, O'Neil, Kafka, Proust, Marianne Moore, Auden, Hemingway, Nabokov, they all have their moments, even clowns like Bukowski and Douglas Adams (who is a linguistic genius in his own right.) Borges could put in 3 lines what took a Joyce 30 strenuous pages without ever achieving a comparable impact. In the end, all I ask for, is the readers honesty. Don't just think something is great because a certain establishment says so. Real great artists (like Dickens or Shakespeare) can do without this sort of approval. Don't make it a mission to reach for an icon for no other reason than seeing it hanging high. A failure is a failure even if it is a great man's failure. And Joyce wasn't made of the stuff of greatness. But this is a different story. Approaching Joyce is an experience not unsimilar to &Ograve;The Approach to Al-Mutasim.&Oacute;"},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"I can not see why everyone thinks this book is so great.

And that sense of living pours off Joyce's pages and through his eccentric mouldings of the English language like a waterfall. It's almost too much to bear at times. We eat, we drink, we urinate, we defecate, we sneeze, we fart, we stink and we have sex, and after a few decades we die. No hidden wisdom. No great awakening. No grand nobility. No spiritual nirvana.

Joyce's poetry is minor if charming,his drama doesn't work,his poetry works best in the comic framework of the prose novel.Style ceases to be a relationship between author and reader,instead becoming a relationship of a magical kind between author and object.Experience is replaced by prose.Joyce was a Flaubertian realist infected by the bacillus of modernism, following The Dubliners,he wrote Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, calling his hero Stephen Dedalus,connecting the contemporary character with the mythical artificer:there are two movements,one outward from Ireland the other downward into myth. Superficially Stephen is dissociating himself,on a deeper level achieving an association with myth.This led onto the systematization of Ulysses,with the mystification that followed in its wake.Too systematized Joyce asked?All Joyce's works have a strong autobiographical element.Ulysses was preceded by the play Exiles.An Irish writer,Richard Rowan believes his wife is playing him false with a former friend/disciple.Rowan finds himself in a tragic position regarding his mother,a pious Catholic.The theme is autobiographical.A onetime friend in 1909 claimed that when Joyce was courting Nora,she had shared her favours with himself.Rowan reveals that he himself longs for his own deception,deliberately making himself a party to it.Rowan identifies with Christ and looks for Judases amongst his friends.Very Joycean.Nora thought he encouraged her to go with other men.This play is the real basis for Ulysses,with the part of Richard Rowan divided between Stephen Dedalus,haunted by his dead mother,and Bloom,haunted by the idea of his wife's infidelity.They are the same person and may be regarded as a man young and old or two aspects of the same man.The subject of the book is the attempt to reconcile them.They pass,they skirt one another all day,but it is only at night that they meet.Each chapter is written in a different style,the names given to these styles is metaphorical,each metaphor sustained by puns.For Joyce all thought arises from the unconscious and returns to it.We need to read Ulysses by a process of free association.The opening chapters of Ulysses are the highest development of Joyce's peculiar genius, for this lay with the habitual,the normal,the everyday,and his interest and observation were sustained by an elaborate system of analogy.But analogy will not permit of growth and development,these have to be foisted artificially onto the book,and as it approaches a crisis,it becomes bogged in tortuous technical devices,like the chapter of the lying -in hospital where the development of the embryo is illustrated by the development of English prose.The problem is it reduces man to dissociated metaphor.Humanity explodes like an atom bomb."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"Ordered the Ulysses book by James Joyce based on original 1922 version.

A person may imagine that writings of this sort confer a measure of immortality. The measure of immortality gleaned by such articles, however, is rather small. What do people learn about us other than that we have some small part in sorting out a minor detail of the workings of the universe? We are no more than a couple initials followed by a family name that appear above the abstract. In contrast, the degree of immortality gained by an author such as James Joyce in the writing of Ulysses is immeasurably greater. Infused into his character Leopold Bloom are the important details of a day of a life. From his morning ablutions to his final repose, marked by the famous soliloquy of his wayward wife Molly, Leopold reveals to us the broad spectrum of what every rich life might be expected to encompass. From birth to death, from the stirrings of love to betrayals both great and small, Joyce's protagonist experiences them all as his moves through the day--and through reflections on his life from the vantage point afforded by middle age.To help bring this book to life I urge the reader to look up Molly Bloom's soliloquy as performed by Angeline Ball."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"This edition is a great facsimile of the first edition.

Enjoy the beautiful language the while you distance yourself and look for repeating patterns. The theme of /Ulysses/, in my opinion, is universal love and the unity of all humanity through biology, history, and language. The flipside of this theme is that human beings don't treat each other like family; rather, we treat each other like dirt.The unity theme in Joyce inspired Joseph Campbell, the great comparative mythologist.The Gabler edition is superior if only for the preface where the simple theme of love is discussed.This book, as the professor I had told the class I was in, will change you.

It influenced my writing, and the way I view the world, a lot. The language is beautiful and unique, especially in the first three episodes (the book is based on Homer's Odyssey) and in Night-town, near the end, which is structured, and has been put on, like a play.

High Lit...It's not my field of expertise. But I did get a lot out of this book. Joyce writes in four dimentions; with omniscience + individuality. I really enjoyed the simultaneous casting of the characters as social constructions and as owners of free will. I also enjoyed the extremely well choreographed, or shall we say synergistic, interplay of the people involved, as well as the deeper meanings suggested throughout.

I personally don't think that Joyce can lay claim to writing a true literary masterpiece simply because the language is immensely challenging. I strongly suspect that the accolades come in part precisely because of the fact that Ulysses rises far above the language of the less-intellectual novels that grace today's best-seller lists, and there is only a certain breed of reader that will wrestle with such a monster and live to tell about it. Not to down-play the other reviews here (which I think are all valid), but this veneration of Joyce seems to have a slight odor of literary snobishness. I can think of many more modern classics that are written with such clarity that even the less 'intellectual' can grasp the depth of the work...and isn't that truly the hallmark of a premiere author?"},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"Masterly done. One of the greatest novels I have ever read. James Joyce always hides another story, an image that passes us during the first read, that envokes us to read the novel a second time. And as soon as we pick the book up again, just when we thought we knew the allegory, another story surfaces itself from the pages. Stunning. An example of this two-sided method Joyce uses in his story is the first chapter. We see Stephen Dedalus shaving himself while he talks to his friend Buck Mulligan, but after a second read of the chapter we don't see Stephen Dedalus shaving but as a reciever of communion from Buck Mulligan who is actually a Protestant priest that consecrates the host at the beginning of the chapter. Only a master can put two stories in one chapter."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"If you want to understand Ulysses, you HAVE to read Portrait first, by JOyce of course. Try to get some portrait commentary so you know where Joyce is coming from, preferably an essay or two on JOyce's aesthetic theory and on the role of Stephen. If you can, read Dubliners too. I listened to an audio book lecture series on Joyce before i began his work ... it spoke of how the book begins in this oddly shaped tower the likeness of which can only be found in Ireland, hence, an American reader would most likely be ignorant as to where the books begins. As you read, consult the ANNOTATED ULYSSES for vocab and sentences that just seem too complex ... like the first sentence of the Bloom section and the ineluctable modality... - most people would not pick up the Jakob Boehme reference in the sentence, and when you do, if you dig Boehme as i have, let's just say it is a pleasant experience. I suggest the Everymna LIbrary series edition, it is a beautiful edition and has some very insightful supplements, including an introduction, the statement by an American judge that has become so renowned, a history of how the book has been printed(and more oft, destroyed) and a helpful chart on the structure of the book. I suggest one reads as much of this book as one can, even if it is just the Stehpen section, else one might die without at least experiencing part of this genius. Knowing a dash about Aquinas and Aristotle and reading some Berkeley will also sharpen one's mind to what's going on here."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"Joyce was a great writer.

In addition his life history is also important) to approach because the scene is a century ago and the references many.

What it is, certainly, is a work rooted in the depths of writing, a work labored over by a very intelligent man for years on end, and a work which deserves more thought than some are willing to give it credit for. The simple fact that a novel must be digested and thought about does not make it &quot;obscure,&quot; nor is it, &quot;worthless.&quot; It can be enjoyed by all who are willing to think about it. Writers like Carver who can demonstrate beauty in the simplicity of their writing have their place in the corpus of the English language, but so do writers like Joyce, whose complexities weave around themselves and ask us to consider the possibilities of our language in a different sense.

I have conquered one of the Literary Behemoths (with Moby Dick and Middlemarch often considered as the other 2 of the Great Big Scary 3).Many aspects of this book are very, very challenging, and in my opinion you may want a little exposure to Joyce (like Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man) before you attempt this book. The other thing I strongly suggest is the new book Ulysses and Us by Declan Kiberd. Kiberd is essentially THE Joycean and spells out important literary concepts for each chapter of Ulysses.There are so many things the book brings up, but my personal favorite discussion has been the balance between art and obscenity within the eyes of the law.I remember touring NYU when I was between junior and senior year of high school. Right there, in the middle of the Art Department main office, was a black and white photograph of a woman sitting on the toilet. I was shocked. She had a faraway look in her eyes, and she was clearly thinking about something else-- the grocery list, all the things she had to do, something overwhelming. I was... confused but mentally intrigued. I had never seen anyone on the toilet before, and it's not something I actively think about other people doing. Ulysses is a lot like that. Almost as soon as Leopold Bloom, the main character, is introduced, we see him on the toilet. It's not particularly gross or graphic, but it's a private moment and there the reader is-- hovering. The book spans the course of one day, June 16th, and we see Leopold do pretty much everything. He eats, farts, has lustful thoughts... sure, some of the lustful thoughts might be creepy out of context, but in the 700 pages of context given, the reader becomes aware that this persistent lust is mostly due to the fact that he and his wife don't get down to the hanky-panky very much since their infant son died ten years ago.Joyce shows every aspect of life in such away that the reader realizes exactly what it it to be a human, full of conflict, obsessive thoughts and bodily needs (that goes back to the eating and farting). Just be prepared, because you have to find that beauty among a load of experimental styles and prose that can get very heavy at times."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"Ignoring the fact that I've had it a year and only made it to page 100...the format of the book is a bit odd.

This copy is a good size, fits in a bag easily, and is easy to carry. Some editions of U have a table of contents with the Greek parallels noted--did Joyce do this at some point? Anyhow, there is no table of contents (which it typical for most editions). This makes it difficult to study, esp. to link it with annotations. I find myself going from text to text trying to find my place in U and the annotations (I use Don Gifford's text). If you aren't willing to put in the time to study the text, I would suggest a text with a table of contents, if you know U and/or like the game of the book, I would highly recommend this edition."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"If you've ever wanted to join the intrepid few to have done \\"Ulysses\\" from cover to cover - but have found the task too forbidding - then this is probably the easiest and most palatable way of accomplishing your wish. The two narrators bring the work to life in a way that the printed work can only hint at; with the aid of their command of a dizzying variety of languages, accents, and dialects, you grasp (fairly often at least) what the flat-looking verbiage of the text only intermittently suggests.There are, however, inherent problems with a spoken-word reading of this work. The flitting from thought to thought that characterizes much of the text is slowed down and made too deliberate. The stream of consciousness is slowed to a trickle. Eighteen hours is stretched out to forty two in this reading and the sensation of a flurry of impressions that an ideal inner reading might capture (in Heaven?) is missing. In practice, however, only somebody utterly familiar with all the recondite allusions of the text could possibly read it so rapidly and you will probably get through the work more quickly by hearing this version than by reading it silently.I thought the \\"Circe\\" episode was the most compromised in this reading. It seems to go on for ever with the narrator having to announce the identity of the speaker every couple of sentences and the sense of whirling delirium goes missing because it drags so much. I don't know if this problem can be solved but I wonder if an ensemble of voices in this episode might more closely capture its atmosphere. Another gripe is that Donal Donnelly has a tuneless singing voice and the many musical snatches lose their point as a result. Joyce was highly musical but you'd never know it from this audiobook.But I moan too much. \\"Ulysses\\" is highly problematic - I would say self-contradictory - and I can't imagine any version in any medium could possibly elucidate it completely. This version comes relatively close to giving it point and for that I'm grateful.

Certainly, simply sitting down and trying to read it cold turkey is much too daunting for anyone who is not a literary scholar (and even some of those, too).The way I did it was to listen to these wonderful CDs while following along word-for-word in the Gabler Edition, published by Vintage, which is the version used by Irish actors Donal Donnelly and Miriam Healy-Louie. (Purists may cavil that this is not the approved edition, but it's one that matches the audiobook.) The reading is very clear and understandable to non-Irish listeners, and journeys through Gaelic, Latin, French, and even a bit of cat language, if I heard right.Yes, indeed -- one chapter every day or two, followed by an analysis by a professor from one of those CD/DVD college lecture series, and I not only finished the thing but understood it rather well, enjoyed it immensely, gave it as a birthday present to a friend, and now plan to take a second run-through.I must caution that the book and the audio should be used together, or the reader will get lost in the stream-of-consciousness writing that seems almost schizophrenic. In other words, it's not to be listened to in the gym while jogging on the treadmill (I found that out pretty quickly)."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"Jim Norton, the actor reading this rendition, is fabulous in all his characters.

If reading this tome while flying, don't be surprised if an attendant comments on your \\"light reading\\". A summer novel for the beach, it ain't. Start preparation with a visit or revisit to Homer's ODYSSEY which forms the circuitous modern adventures of Leopold Bloom in this one-day Dublin \\"odyssey\\" paralleling Homer's hero Odysseus. There are many excellent critical treatments of ULYSSES, which are recommended as guides once the ODYSSEY episodes have been (re)familiarized. These critical guides are not in the nature of the high school/college crib sheets CLIFF'S NOTES, which are to be avoided as the plague, but are scholarly treatments linking the classical approaches with those of Joyce's Bloom. One is advised to read one chapter of Joyce first, consider what was read and how it connects to characters and actions in Homer. If foggy, or puzzling, the treatment of this chapter in the critical treatment should be visited. Then the Joyce chapter should be reread and contemplated. So, on to the next chapter. Sounds challenging and time consuming? Yes , but what a reward awaits those who persevere. Understanding and the layered richness of Joyce will unfold. And then, you are off on the ride of your life.

Academic infighting notwithstanding, I think the Gabler edition is as close to a &quot;correct&quot; Ulysses as we're going to get. The work he has put into studying each word is really astounding, and he's cleaned up a lot of sentences that never made sense earlier (I'm sure plenty of graduate students wrote long papers on how brilliant those nonsensical fragments were), and restored several sections that make it a much richer read - the telegram to Stephen, especially, opened up a lot of things for me.The book itself can get infuriating if one doesn't read it with a guide. Reading it beside the Bloomsday book allowed me to enjoy it the first time I went through it; if I hadn't done that, I doubt I would have enjoyed it much at all. It occasionally seems like he is just throwing in a different gimmick each chapter just to make it opaque - Oxen of the Sun, especially, just annoyed the hell out of me.But there are moments in this book that are unequalled by any other writer in English, and everyone should at least read it once - no matter how many people have ripped Joyce off, no one can get his style just right. Honestly, it is difficult to love this book as much as one might love Portrait, or even Dubliners, but there are moments of great compassion and insight here - you just have to cut through some of his tricks first. And the tricks usually aren't without purpose - most of them do need to be there. I find myself flipping through the book and reading some of the chapters again and again - the first two, Hades, Nausicaa, Circe, and Penelope, especially - and they're rewarding no matter how many times I read them. Beat through the whole book. And get this edition. It's worth the effort."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"I've always laughed at X-Files fans, but I'm beginning to suspect a conspiracy. For years now, all I've ever heard is 'Ulysses' is unreadable, obtuse, unwieldly. It is anything but, being outrageously funny, unstoppably readable, dementedly inventive. Why would 'they' want us not to read it? Although it has saturated modern culture, Joyce's frightening lessons have been ignored or emasculated - film, literature, art, music are as timid and cliched today as they ever were, as if 'Ulysses' had never existed. 'Ulysses' demands that we think for ourselves, it bursts with inchoate possibilities we must take up for ourselves. Of course we shouldn't read it. But you really must get this edition (Oxford World Classics, edited by Jeri Johnson). go to 'Ulysses' bald, as I have done so many times, and you will probably throw it down after three pages, frustrated, annoyed, anchorless in a river of unfamiliar words, ideas, style. Johnson's annotation here is scrupulous. For each chapter, she registers the Homeric paralells, she discusses the various schema (each chapter has its own colour, art (eg literature, medicine), body organ etc.), she offers a brief critical precis of what is going on. Her notes, explaining historical literary, popular etc. allusions, are indispensible. With the exception of the (mercifully few) Stephen Daedalus chapters, as dense and (generally) dull as their hero, the book is a joyous breeze (well, almost). This in itself is a betrayal of Joyce - we are supposed to be jolted, confused, lost, such is the nature of modern life Joyce wanted us to taste. But he provided all his friends with clues, and we're just as good as them, right? There's no point talking about the discrete ingenuity of each episode, the depth of character, the unheard-of realism in describing their emotional and intellectual lives, the satire, the comedy, the seething anger at authoritarianism, communal idiocy and intellectual myopia, the parodies and pastiches of all literature and other cultural products. Like all great post-modern works (and like Godard, Picasso, Stravinsky, Joyce is a fertile POST-modernist, not a strangulated modernist), it will be impossible to read previous literature in the same way before, while it makes almost everything that came after it seem diluted and half-hearted. Leopold Bloom has been called a bourgeois everyman, but if only he was. His kindness, his (however unmethodical) voracious curiosity, his self-awareness, his humour, are as unusual in 1904 Dublin, as they are in our racist, money-mad, mean-minded, self-obsessed, greasy-tilled society today (I mean Ireland of course). My favourite episode is 'Sirens', the ultimate fusion of everything that is 'Ulysses' - character, language, humour, style, parody, satire, anger, emotion. Life. Now for the Wake!"},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"What a read! Stephen Dedalus's pretentious aestheticism reminded me a lot of Thomas Mann's Death of Venice's character Gustav Aschenbach, without of course the cynical hatred of the rotten Europe, more the wide-eyed lover of the growing Dublin. Leopold Bloom on the other hand seems to be a man to my own naive (or ignorant) tastes. The poetic consumer of words versus the materialist producer of words, a unity of humanity seen through two (or maybe including Molly three) eyes. The allusions to Aristotle and Blake needed a regular flicking through literary notes and for the Proteus chapter even a German dictionary! This was no bad thing though for if anything Ulysses is an education. Like all good things it required work, but with some good notes of history and literature its a must read, as beautiful as the Lithy."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"This book is so bizarre it made my eyes itch.

Not merely because of the difficulty (I like long, 'difficult' books generally) but because it's a book that you've got to totally submerge yourself within. Once you get comfortable with the bizarre minutia of daily life in Dublin circa 1904, and with the way that Joyce will change register, tone, syntax and structure, often within the same sentence, it becomes a little more manageable. A little. Each section is deeply challenging, deeply strange. Just when you begin to get the tempo of one, it ends, and you sort of have to teach yourself how to read the next one all over again. It often wasn't clear to me where the mythic and mundane end and begin in this book, because they bleed into each other in different ways both structurally and thematically on almost each page. There are moments of real stylistic brilliance throughout the book (the incredible 'wandering rocks' section, the hallucinatory mythological hodge-podge of the 'cyclops' part), and there were even some parts where I was genuinely emotionally moved (the funeral scene, the final, love-affirming pages of Molly's monologue). That being said, Joyce is also an insufferable intellectual show-off. And while this might be his 'biggest' work, for my money, 'Dubliners' is still his best, because he's at his best when he makes you interested in his characters instead of being merely interested in his own intellect. It definitely helps a bit if you've read 'Portrait of the Artist' first, but you certainly don't have to. And don't bother with a reader's guide. It might help you get some of the references (and god, how this book references things), but it won't help you to actually read it. Enter at your own peril."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"Stephen Dedalus, Molly Bloom, Milly, Leopold Bloom, Buck Mulligan, and Paddy Dignam, except that Paddy Dignam is dead, (as is poor Rudy), inhabit this tapestry of a book. Dead dog, body bloated, exists just beyond the sands, outside of the Martello tower, Stephen's digs. A dead father, a dead mother populate the story along with sights, smells, but most of all noise-- songs and chants. There are ditties, rhymes, advertisements, sayings remembered, refrains, art songs, Baroque and classical music filling the pages of this book.There is a great send-up on newspapers and the misinformation embodied in them. Parallels exist with Stephen mourning his mother and Bloom his father. The hectic flush indicates a finished man, a drunkard. Paddy Dignam is dead. Master Patrick Aloysius Dignam considers his last night, boozing.Molly Bloom is from Gibraltar. Eating liver, Leopold Bloom recalls when Molly laughed at another singer, Ben Dollard, who needed a suit. Poor Mrs. Purefoy has been in labor for three days. Tap, tap, tap sounds the cane of a blind man. Leopold Bloom helps him across the street. Cornelius, Corny, Kelleher is the manager of the funeral establishment. A new character emerges, the citizen. Bloom wants to meet Martin Cunningham about the insurance of Dignam. For an advertisement there must be repetition. That is the secret according to Bloom.Gerty MacDowell is lady-like, pretty. Words used by Cissy Caffrey embarass her. Another of her companions is Edy Boardman. Gerty wishes that her father had avoided the demon drink. Bloom admires Gerty's beauty and has sympathy for her lameness.Stephen, a stand-in for the author, uses a self-description of bullock befriending bard. Stephen is seeking a career in literature, and hopes to avoid a career in the church or in journalism. Bloom was warned by his father not to go with drunken goys. Bloom warns Stephen, taking a fatherly interest in his well-being, away from Mulligan.The most densely written and exciting book of the twentieth century remains exactly that. Its artistry has never been exceeded except, perhaps, in Joyce's FINNEGAN'S WAKE."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"I only just finished reading Ulysses myself for the first time and believe I may provide at least some small aid for other prospecitve readers. Obviously the book is complex. I would characterize it as the most difficult book I have ever read, whoever, I would not take this as an offence to the genius of the book. I have read (and performed) Hamlet, Homer, Dante, and a host of other &quot;classics,&quot; but even if you have not you can still appreciate this work. I would be lying if I said I understood all of the esoteric references even to the literature I have read, but lets be honest how many of us can say we havn't been stumped by a book, or movie, or story, or whatever even with references relativly close to our times and places. I know people who would have no clue if I made a reference to somthing like &quot;Fight Club&quot; even though it is both a best selling book and huge motion picture success (Lord of the Rings for that fact). Don't worry if somthing goes over your head. This is not a casual novel (no Koontz or King here). This is a thematic character study. I recently heard an interesting interview with Quentin Terrantino in which he said somthing to the effect of &quot;people don't talk about 'the plot' they talk about their everyday s**t,&quot; and actually that is a pretty fair description of what the framework for Ulysses is. It is one day in the lives of predominantly two people. We are all dynamic individuals, try to immagine a day in your own life and the stresses and desires you face. What memories creep into your concious. What little games do you play at work, with friends, your lover? I bet your not the same person in all those places are you? Don't sweat it if you don't understand a word here and there just take your time and be carefull with the text. The perspectives will shift and the stream of conciousness will kick in and you have to roll with the punches.It will probably help most people to have some reference books available during a reading of Ulysses, but I personnally felt I became too distracted with every little newance (that's probably spelled incorrectly) so I just went with it. There is a reason all the ivory tower types love this book and that is because you can literally spend years deciphering all the layers. The book, like all pieces of art, is a product of its time so be prepared for that as well. It helps to have some knowledge of turn of the twentieth century Irish/English relations, world views, even literary styles of the era. I had a duece of a time getting through the collected works of Poe because so much of it was in German, French, or Latin (you know people in America used to learn Latin in school, how lame ;) ). I have rambled for way to long so I will close with a point. Many people don't understand modern classical music because they don't understand its place in history. Many people don't understand Jazz or Punk or Hip Hop because they don't understand their places in history. Ultimatly Ulysses will be like many other works of art in this regard. Take your time with it and relax with it (you are not being graded on how many of the top 100 of whatever you have read you know). You may not really like it after having read it and thats OK, but don't be a close minded neigh-sayer just because its not your style. I don't really like Russian novels, but I see their quality, just as I see the genius of Pollack, Whorhal, and Basquiatt (probably missed at least one of those names) but would rather hang a Munch or Picasso. To each his own just don't be pretentious."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"In 2000, the Modern Library came up with a list of the one hundred greatest English language novels of the 20th century. Topping their list at number one was Ulysses, by Irish novelist James Joyce. After completion of this novel, I can conclude that they have made a wise decision.Ulysses follows the lives of two Dubliners, Stephen Dedalus and Leopold Bloom, on a single day in Ireland. Leopold Bloom is a lonely middle-aged Jewish man who has a wife, Molly and a daughter, Milly. He also had a son that died as a child. Stephen Dedalus is a young school teacher who has seperated himself from his old drunken father. During the day, Stephen and Bloom make their seperate ways through the hectic streets and taverns of Dublin. Along the way the encounter various characters (such as the Citizen and the Anonymous Narrator) that act as symbols for Dublin society and the world in general. By the end of the novel, the theme has been understood. Like that of Homer's Odyssey (hence the name of the title), Leopold (Ulysses) has gained a son in Stephen (Telemachus), and Stephen has gained a father in him.Ulysses is undoubtedly Joyce's masterwork. He takes command of the English language, as well as nearly a dozen others, throughout the course of the novel. Various literary styles are exhibited to fit the theme of each chapter. For example, to show the busy workplace of a newspaper office, Joyce begins each section with a headline that sums it up. A complete five act drama is even included in a single chapter of this novel. Joyce's methods of characterization are also very obscure, yet brilliant. Characters are not characterized by their actions or by dialouge, but by their thoughts and fantasies. This allows the reader to see each character's hidden emotions and fears. These inner monolouges may be triggered by the smallest occurrence, then escalade into the meanings of life and death.I would only recommend Ulysses to an experienced reader with a lot of spare time. This novel is 783 pages long and takes roughly thirty to forty hours to read. Joyce's various writing styles, although genious, are very difficult to read. So, if you think that you can get past these obstacles, should you read Ulysses? There is a simple answer that you will only understand after completion of the novel: Yes."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"It's a book I've long wanted to read and I have.

If you're planning on reading Joyce, you'd be better off with the hard copies for now; with maybe a free e-edition on your Kindle to supplement it, for those times when you're standing in line at the grocery store and can't be bothered to carry around 2 pounds of excellent literary deadweight."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"This is one of those books that's a classic for good reason.

Some people love it, some people hate it.I found that once you get into the flow of reading it, Joyce has a way of representing thought that feels more like you're thinking than reading something. That's what they mean by stream-of-consciousness. Sure, it's old. Sure, it's dense. You probably won't understand every single sentence or word in this epic, but try it. You might like it. It's a fun - yes, fun - book. Joyce jokes around. He is witty, unique, and yes, nonsensical.I loved this book. Not everyone will, but drop your fears and read it. Its difficulty is overhyped. You'll never finish it if you don't start it. It's definitely one of the more rewarding books I've read."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"It's a daunting and difficult prospect, contemplating the reading of ULYSSES. Much like Proust's IN SEARCH OF LOST TIME, this is a book more quoted than read. It comes freighted with the most serious of professorial endorsements and a reputation for \`difficulty' hardly belied by its length.Does it justify its reputation as difficult? Yes. Does that hamper one's enjoyment reading it? Hardly at all. Jonathan Franzen's intervention in a debate about the differences between obtuse and clear writing is hardly helpful when considering ULYSSES. There should be a place for the products of literature, as for any art form, which requires the active participation of a reader, without succumbing to the charge of \`elitism'. Most great writers teach their readers how to read. The same applies to Joyce and ULYSSES (does the same apply to FINNEGAN'S WAKE? I don't know. I'm too scared to read it ...).My advice to any would-be reader - don't be intimidated by this book's reputation. Don't worry if at points, you find yourself confused or lost. Yes, there's a chapter in which Joyce recapitulates the evolution of written English to mirror embryonic development in humans. And yes, the chapter commonly known as \`Circe' is a bit long-winded. Despite that, the novel is a joy to read and to spend time with. Joyce's concerns in writing one day in the life of Leopold Bloom are life-fulfilling. There is tremendous joy, wit, fun and compassion in his portrayal of this most (un?)usual of heroes. It may help to avail yourself of the many resources available on the web. I found a lengthy pr&eacute;cis of each chapter particularly helpful at the start of my journey; and found that, about half-way through the book, I didn't need it any more. It is true that Joyce relied on allusions and references that are now all-but-lost to any modern reader. Again, don't worry. Any annotated edition will carry you through; and/or you'll find that the need to know each reference declines the further you journey along with Bloom.Have courage and you'll be rewarded. The book is life-affirming and very down-to-earth in its concerns. Joyce borrows the structure of Homer's epic in order to lampoon its myth-making and to play with its martial obsessions. Bloom is no hero. And that's the point."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"I can't watch The Producers now without thinking of James Joyce.

This tale of the adventures of advertising salesman Leopold Bloom on June 16, 1904, in Dublin is a remarkable conflation of mythology, symbolism, philosophy, social realism, and humanity. Bloom's relationships with wife Molly and surrogate son Stephan Dedalus reflect the simple decency of the common man. There is no doubt that reading Ulysses places great demands on the intellect of the reader. Joyce's intentions in writing Ulysses, to present a totally realistic view of one day in the life of ordinary Dublin citizens, yet at the same time to weave into this a grand parallel with Homer's Odyssey and on a smaller scale to deal with issues as complicated as those of Irish politics and religion, mean that before they come upon the novel, it is necessary for the reader to have a wide base of knowledge.

Perhaps this is the first book to transcend the ability of what it has parodied. To those who have denied recommending it to someone of sixteen or seventeen, I had been upon this earth for a decade and a half when I came upon it, and just reread it one year later. Granted, you need a Latin dictionary and a good book of annotations to thoroughly understand it, but this book has made me realize just what a waste my public rural high school education was--Ulysses is literary heaven and hell and propagator of autodidacticism and eschews all principles of what has ever been said to create this century's magnum opus. I am exactly one-hundred years younger than James Joyce (and Stephen Daedalus), and on the sixteenth of June in 2004 I plan to! take the route of Leopold Bloom to vicariously relive it. One thing to be forewarned about: it is highly addictive. I have developed Ulysses codependency, as will anyone who gets through it. My head aches after reading it, for it is the best kind of masterpiece, the kind that attacks physically and intellectually at once. It is vulgar, carnal, and base (for its time, that is) and at once completely holy and pure because it has allowed the world to start over. Joyce is the avant-garde. He is our master philosopher and psychiatrist, who wrote the book that will never be shredded."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"When read by those looking for prose, they go away disappointed.

The words kept me there for many, many more hours (and just a few pints). Imagery started leaping out at me, I felt as if I was hallucinating. Not for the timid, weak, or close-minded, but worth the effort if you want to give yourself up to a good book."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"Many have said that Ulysses is the greatest novel written in English in the 20th century. Technically speaking, it's certainly unimagineable that any author could have put more into a book in this or any other century. But it's not for all tastes. You should read Dubliners and A Portrait of the Artist before attempting Ulysses, as the former are more accessible and will let you know whether you like Joyce. Read the World's Classics edition of Ulysses, the notes are very helpful. Be prepared to work at this book. It takes some getting used to. Having read it, I think the effort was worth it. Joyce is a genius (evident from his earlier works). His writing is almost lyrical at times and every word is chosen deliberately to achieve the overall impression he seeks to make. He was one of the Protean Modernists, though, and in Ulysses he takes Modernism, the novel and literature itself to their outer limits. At times, thoughts and actions, reality and imagination all get mixed up in this book and sometimes the narrative line just seems to disappear - but isn't this the way of the human psyche? Don't expect Dickens or a plot in its normal sense. Do expect, after all the hard work is done, to marvel at the author's abilities and to have a warm feeling for Leopold Bloom, to wonder at his humanity and to do this despite the character's weaker traits."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"Ulysses is the greatest thing (in all of arts and sciences)ever created by a man. I have read it all the way through once, and have re-read the individual episodes plenty of times on their own. A whole part of my life was defined by the reading of this book. It is no small undertaking to construct a universe. Ulysses is more than a machine, more than an organism; Ulysses is a universe. If you want to read deeper into things (which of course you do, if you're reading this book), then the most indispensible of the commentaries is Stuart Gilbert's, which was written under Joyce's supervision."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"A very complex narrative! I think it must be the most difficult reading I ever made. Joyce built an entire new language of literature to write this remarkable novel, an original work in all aspects from tale to structure and language. People talk in many codes, from old rude Irish to Latin, Italian and common english. The description of inarticulate sounds like the cat's &quot;Mrkgnao&quot; was quite new to literature. The tale grasps to describe the everyday action of early century Dublin, a single day of the common life of some Irish villagers - every action, every thought and discussion, every joke, memory and dream! The story is about a man that represents the classic hero inside of the common man. Heroic deeds aren't done only in the bloody fields of senseless wars; the common man does great deeds every day without bloodshed. Remember that Ulysses was a a hero that hated war. Joyce believed that modern literature was empty within its meaningless structures and tales; only the profound significance of the classics could inject human soul back to literature. Joyce believed that people were always unconsciously reliving the classics models in their lifes, like a circle that never ends. Finally, the structure is made of many styles in order to create an entire new genre of modern literature. Think of something and you find it in &quot;Ulysses&quot;: popular songs, discussions, theatre, oniric events, medieval tales, monologues, mind narrative... &quot;Ulysses&quot; has what it takes to stand among the greatest works of mankind's literature. Scholars say that Joyce wrote &quot;Ulysses&quot; as the book that would end with all books, the final stone of modern literature in its way to regain the soul of the classics. They may be right! &quot;Ulysses&quot; is a small world written into book. It's an unique piece of work!Carlos Madeira Portugal, 16th of August of 1999"},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"One thousand years from now, when the acid will have long since dissolved the remembrance's from our tombstones and even the internet will have been forgotten, Joyce's works will still be read and loved.

It is much easier to read an accessible classic like The Lord of the Rings (the peoples choice for novel of the century) or The Catcher in the Rye, though they are unrewarding and juvenile works in comparison with Ulysses.As to those of you who pretend to be intellectually superior to Ulysses or the Wake, stop kidding yourselves.

Why Joyce would set out to purposefully confuse and mislead critics and readers can only be explained by his overbearing, self-absorbed, pretentious nature. A thorough study of Homer's Odyssey and Joyce's Portrait of the Artist - two foundations upon which Ulysses was constructed - will assist the reader in navigating Joyce's murky waters - but not nearly enough to make the effort enjoyable and worthwhile. Stuart Gilbert's famous study will bring the reader further into Joyce's stream of consciousness - but Gilbert chooses to be pretentious and occasionally obscure as well (no surprise since Gilbert and Joyce were collaborators). Joyce was a first rate literary artist - no mistake. Ulysses stands as a milestone in the art form - in many respects the first true &quot;modern&quot; novel (for better or worse). However, for the clerisy of readers, Dubliners and Portrait of the Artist are the limits for appreciating Joyce. Ulysses steps over the line, leading to Finnegan's Wake, which is completely out-of-bounds. Those who do make the effort necessary to understand Joyce's work in Ulysses will come to realize that, rather than celebrate and memorialize the Dublin he knew - as Homer did for the Hellenic world in The Odyssey (creating a lasting vision of the Greek world as the Greeks saw it) - Joyce lays his world in waste and ruin, leaving the landscape in desolation. Joyce's bottom line message can only be interpreted one of two ways: first, that the Heroic Age is so far removed (keeping in mind that Joyce considered the Irish to be Greek descendants) as to be unrelated (if not in opposition) to modern events; or second, that man is incapable of heroism in any form. An interesting interpretation of Joyce's Ulysses is its relationship to the science of chaos, in its complex formation. However, chaos (or more strictly speaking, non-linear dynamic systems) that exists in reality produces incredible complexity from surprisingly simple, non-linear feedback systems. Joyce constructed his work by merging too many source motifs with the intention of creating complexity. In the end, it is the overwhelming negativism that wins out in Joyce's Ulysses, without redemption. Ulysses is one of the great over-praised works. Over-praised because it is inherently flawed, as most great experiments are bound to be."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"The novel of the century! &quot;Time&quot; Magazine got it right!

YOu will find there all the major themes written in an engaging style, and all the threads of the plot. Just jump there and the teacher will think you read the whole not-easily-digestible work.Each episode is a microcosm and a repeating or respeaking of the same themes. Cyclops probably presents these in the most immediately comprehensible way possible. YOu quickly realize that Joyce throughout the work is MAKING FUN OF THE WAY PEOPLE TALK AND WRITE, from the first turn-of-the-century style to Molly's final stream of consciousness tour-de-force. But throughout Mr. JOyce is doing PARODY, which is exagerrating and making fun of how we speak and write, onoly to show that his underlying themes are impossible to express in modern terms. and so in Cyclops we hear every voice from ancient heroic legend to modern ringside boxing reports and wedding reports.But the basic themes remain. Mr. Bloom most explicitly states here that Love must be the basis for human interaction, and this is expanded upon. Also and most explicitly are Joyce's political undercurrents, the vile and oppressive nature of the BRitish empire's military force, which continues today stealing oil in Iraq while destroying its cultural heritage. Joyce shows how the same happened to Ireland, destroying resources (lumber) and cattle (under the false pretext of hoof and mouth) and industry as a way to impoverish and enslve the once great nation. The direct indictment of the BRitish naval power is especially explicit. This is my favorite and funniest epsode at the same time. Listen to it around disk eighteen of the forty disk Donal Donnally recording.THen ask your teacher if the reason Stephen Dedalus (get it? Dead. Alas!) did not kneel to pray for his mother, keeps Kosher, wears black with head carefully covered and wanders alone and lost, finding company only with the alleged Jew Bloom, is that while in Paris between Portrait of the Artist as A YOung Man and this work, he realized he was not a Jesuit Catholic, but on his mother's GOulding side, a Jew, and he returns to Ireland in search of his Jewish community. THis will knock your teacher's socks off.Please realize that Mr. Joyce himself reported there is not a single serious word in his work, that it is all a joke about the poor way people write. Yet, while there is not a single serious word, the underlying themes are deadly serious matters of life and death, faithlessness in marriage, national identity in the face of brutal (British) imperialist rape and oppression, and the theme of love in all its permutations. Love eternal and carnal is the basis of this book.My original analysis of this monumental work I assume got reported and dumped, without my saving a copy, so let me only briefly say that you may want the Gabler edition for the most reliable text, even though it loses the important page sized capitals S, M and P as reproduced in the Random House, as well as the important large period or asterix answering the questions \\"Where?\\" and is famously poorly bound.Do get the Donal Donnally (sp.?) recording. Jim Norton's is ABRIDGED grotesquely. Donal's is complete and extremely well done. If you want the basic gist of the novel, listen to Disk eighteen and nineteen of the forty disk recording and you will get the basic message. Love loves to love love.I am sorry to have lost my complete review written here in Ulysses style for a flavor of the original. Who's knows what lines were offensive. This book is essential reading, and re-reading, but don't get me started or I might get reported again.Be sure not only to get the Annotated Ulysses, which focusses mostly on historical explanations of places and people, but especially the Schwarz \\"Reading Joyce's Ulysses\\" and the Sicari \\"Joyce's Modernist Allegory\\", both excellent beginning commentaries that will make the text and intent much clearer to any reader. But the serious reader interested in the deeper socio-historico eleements suggested by joyce should get Dr. Cheng's excellent critique on JOyce racism and colonialism, as well as Attridge's Semicolonial Joyce. And those who get way over their heads with Joyce ought to check out Joyce and G-Men how Hoover killed Joyce's novel in the USA.The Donal Donnaly recordings really bring the novel to life.You can find several other commentaries in all price ranges, some by professors eager for tenure and looking to publish or perish, and others that are really helpful. Try Hugh Kenner of course, and the ones which investigate the brutal colonial nature of Ireland's history which Joyce alludes to, to reflect on current world events. It is worth the effort. Even Joseph Campbell has interesting things to say, on how this novel inspired him to begin to explore our world's mythologies, masks and meanings. But his commentary I found surprisingly shallow and at times off the mark. But I grow wordy . . ."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"To understand something of &quot;Ulysses,&quot; one must firstlook at its publication in a historical perspective. Brought out inprint in a time when the banning of books was common practice in the war against &quot;obscenity,&quot; Mr. Joyce's work was championed by all liberals everywhere--not so much on its artistic merits, but, rather, due to what it symbolized for them: The struggle of the artist against the State. As for the book itself,the writing was almost secondary. In fact, it was not just derided by philistines; many noteworthy authors--among whom number Virginia Woolf and Gertrude Stein--questioned its originality and its effectiveness. (For certainly, most of its now-thought &quot;original techniques&quot; had been used before by other writers to far better effect!) That is to say, &quot;Ulysses&quot; became more important for what it was SUPPOSED to represent than for what it actually was. As time passed and young people of a more liberal turn acceded to positions of social authority, &quot;Ulysses&quot; began to be, almost defiantly, hyped as a modernist masterpiece. This, of course, to tweek the nose of the older generation more than to herald a legitimate work of Art. As a result, whole generations of subsequent Americans have had imposed on them the the ready-made opinion that &quot;Ulysses&quot; holds an unassaible position in the Letters of the World; for, certainly, they fear to have attached to themselves the tag &quot;Vulgarian&quot; if they dare to express their own thoughts on this grossly over-rated book. No, truly, &quot;Ulysses&quot; is a triumph of propoganda that, when taken out of its historical context and judged squarely, falls flat, resuming its true proportions on an artistic level given it by great writers of the time: A dry, pedantic and boring farrago."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"If you're like me and you like a good brain raping now and then, you'll want to pick up this book. There are two ways to approach this book: A. Find, study and theorize on every single referance in every single sentance in every single paragraph, etc. or B. Just let it glide over you and enjoy some fantasitc writing with a good helping of human wit and emotion. Either way this book will blow your mind if you let.

You have to be pretty well read to approach this novel. Most of the book is inner monologue style, and it is 99% full of obscure references. It helps to have at least some background in the Odyssey and the Bible to understand this novel. I personally do not like a \\"talking heads\\" novel, so I find that I am simply skimming the pages out of boredom. Most of the book's references are very dated so you'll find that most of the text goes \\"over your head.\\" I salute those who \\"get\\" this novel, because you must be quite a worldly individual to not need help with it. For the \\"joe everyman\\" like myself, there's no need to read this book unless it is being assigned to you. I love to read, but this book is honestly making me tiresome of it. You really need alot of patience, a huge dicitonary, a small library of other classic novels, and an understanding of Ireland's history to get through it. I will finish this book, but I will not have taken in a single word at the end. If you MUST read this book, I highly recommend the SPARKnotes to go with to even get an idea of what you just read. Without it, you will just give up. I only gave it 3 stars because if I understood what I read, I could honestly tell you whether I liked it or not, but since I don't understand 98% of the book, I'll just sit \\"middle of the fence.\\"Also as a side note, don't get this version of the novel because the binding is total [...]"},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"Okay, I just gave only four stars to a book that is universally known as one of the greatest works of literature of all time. I left off the extra star just because I have to review it from my own perspective. I'm an older guy who never got around to reading Joyce back in my college days, and have always figured I should.I love complex books--books that require some effort on my part to get through and appreciate. Joyce plowed ground for such novels. But there are a lot of good ones by more modern authors such as Thomas Pynchon, David Foster-Wallace, Zadie Smith, Margaret Atwood, Barbara Kingsolver, etc. etc. etc. All of those books have a lot more action--Ulysses spends too much time with thought and reflection, without enough happening. Part of the challenge of reading Joyce is that he constantly refers to facts and customs and ideas from his time and place, so understanding requires some historical research, which is a diversion from the enjoyment of the literature. It's much more fun to read Pynchon (for example) because the challenges are ones that are supposed to be challenging. In short, I think it's great to catch up on historically important literature, but don't let it divert you from the many great works of more contemporary authors."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"Tough to be critical of a classic, but this book will not be finished!

But I have no clue what the book is about.And one wonders how it achieved \\"Classic\\" status."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"Hard to read, but I'm really glad I read it. It has influenced so many other works. While discussing this book with another friend, he summed it up well -- \\"It's like eating a really, really good meal... of vegetables.\\""},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"While this text is undoubtedly one of the most difficult that I have read, the sheer skill at manipulating language that Joyce demonstrates is remarkable. The result is a novel that offers a most intimate study into the human method of thinking.Not for the faint of heart, however, because this is a text that requires dedication, as the games that Joyce plays with language and the thinking of his characters often obfuscates the meaning."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"Mr. Joyce should be commended for writing a book which obviously needs careful interpretation to be understood. Simple things are not always best.The most important questions which the novel raises, for this reader, is: To what extent is literary criticism a rigorous discipline? I'm sure one can place interpretaions on the way Joyce uses language, and what he alludes to: but how many other, competing, interpretations can one put upon it and can one credibly say that one interpretation is (in any sense) better than another?And if the answer to the first question is &quot;a great many&quot; and the answer to the second is &quot;no&quot;, then is not literary criticism as much a fiction as that which it surveys?"},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"I can sum this book up in two words: \\"Ass Beating\\". It was the most painful reading experience of my life.Like many readers I was sucked in by the \\"Modern Library Top 100\\" list of which Ulysses is number 1. After getting about half way through this book, I realized that many of the so called \\"Top 100\\" were probably more important than they were, well, good. Ulysses has several passages of graphic sexual description and discussion of infidelity during a few of the author's more lucid moments which surely made it edgy for 1922. The Modern Library must have overlooked the long and frequent passages of rambling lists and nonsence that makes one seriously question if the author was getting paid by the word and needed to pay his rent. I was not surprised to find out that Ulysses was initially a serialization and Joyce was actually getting paid by the word!You can read some of this online, but I don't recommend reading it in any form. Life is too short for bullisht like this novel.http://www.online-literature.com/james_joyce/ulysses/"},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"Joyce flaunts and celebrates style in this book. There's a chapter written in the form of a play, a chapter imitating the development of English, a chapter written in question-and-answer form, a chapter without punctuation (the closing monologue, probably the most beautiful, life-affirming thing ever written), and a chapter written in the sentimental style of a girl's novel. There are countless other stylistic tricks, some of which an impatient reader will miss. Yes, &quot;Ulysses&quot; is a difficult book to read...but just stick with it, pay close attention, and you'll do fine - and in the end, the rewards of having read it will be worth the struggle. Other more recent novels I recommend are P by Conn, The Losers' Club by Richard Perez"},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"Okay, so we know already that this book has been deemed 'The Greatest Book Ever Written' which is why, I must confess, I endeavoured upon it. I took no literature class concerning it, nor do I plan to. My only other experience with literature that is vaguely similar to this is 'Gravity's Rainbow' by Thomas Pynchon, which I read about a year ago. And although I found the esotericism in GR interesting and comparably relevant to my personal work, I actually found U to be a slightly more entertaining read. However, if it's 'entertainment' your looking for, don't read this. Go read a Stephen King book, or something. In fact, don't read anything, just go see the new Tomb Raider movie....I didn't give this book 5 stars, because, as it's been mentioned in other reviews, there were too many points in the book that I was wanting more. More wordy experiments, more originality. Too often, some sort of brilliant style will surface and then go away and drone on for another 50 pages until some other new and interesting element occurs again. Some may say that I'm simply saying that the book wasn't 'entertaining' enough, contradicting my argument in the previous P. Well, to those I say, whatever. I can deal with being a hypocrit. I mean, when you really think about it, there are two conflicting elements of human nature at work here, 1. the sort-of Americanization of a culture to need constant entertainment, and 2. the instinctive craving to learn. Which is more powerful in you?I will say that if you just want an interesting snippet of this book to read, I'd read the last chapter. This really made the book worth reading IMO. It's done without hardly any punctuation and it's left to the reader to cipher where sentences begin and end, really the definitive stream of conscious technique, but more than that, it's the most emotionally powerful section of the book, right up to the last few words."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"As I read Ulysses, I asked myself, what is the point of putting all these words next to each other? When I got to the end, (and not until then) I realized that this book is Joyce's search for God amid everyday life in Dublin. This God(the father) is one who is caring, concerned, shows consideration, and is also a cuckold. One of the greatest moments of my reading career was the question and answer session at the end of part 2, and it is very much worth the journey through the streets of Dublin of June 16, 1904."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"Another reviewer complained about &quot;Ulysses, the Corrected Text&quot; as a rewrite by Danis Rose; it is NOT. The Bodley Head (London, 1984) edition of this name was edited by Hans Walter Gabler and has a preface and recommendation by Richard Ellmann, the foremost biographer of James Joyce. This edition is a significant contribution to Joycian publishing and a &quot;must&quot; addition to any complete library of Joyce's works, alongside any of the &quot;original&quot; text works. Joyce's manuscript as sent to the printers was difficult to read (it had many handwritten corrections of corrections and border notes which the original publisher could not decide whether he was supposed to use), and Gabler merely did a highly-regarded job of reconsidering original manuscript materials and other sources. The first- or second-time reader of Ulysses likely would not notice the differences in the text, but Joyce scholars and Ulysses fans regard this as an important reconsideration and an essential work. Most editions of Ulysses use an identical numbering system for sections and paragraphs so that comparisons between editions are easy to make."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"How can anybody short of a literary genius review this book?

I just finished it (it's June). Phew!! Yes, it's a hard nut to crack -- you can see why so many people give up in rage and frustration (and unfairly express their resentment at being unable to understand by writing vitriolic reviews). And yes, if you're going to climb Mount Everest (or maybe K2 -- _Finnegans Wake_ appears to be Everest) you need an oxygen mask and a team -- get _The Bloomsday Book_ and _Ulysses Annotated_. But to say it was well worth it would be a giant understatement.I'll try to say in a nutshell what's so great (for me) about it: _Ulysses_ is the incredibly poignant story of one ordinary man's attempts to reconcile himself to his failures as a father, a husband and a human being. At the same time, through its rich description of Dublin (which comes to stand for every human community, everywhere); through a staggeringly complex web of historical, metaphorical and philosophical associations; and through Joyce's use of words, in which the English language _itself_ becomes a character in the novel, _Ulysses_ becomes about much, much more than a day in the life of one man -- it becomes a hugely cosmic-comic and very personal oddyssey through the readers' soul, in which every pretension or fantasy one could possibly have is brought to light and then smashed. Does this sound dismal? It isn't -- it's hilarious; and for those who've made it through, the ending words of Molly Bloom's soliloquy and her final &quot;yes&quot; are the sparkling, intoxicating wine of possibility -- heartbreakingly bittersweet, moving and transcendent."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"Let me first start off by saying I love the book. Its language is of the likes I have never before seen. And, let me also say, that while people who hate this book will try to totally disparage it and, in my opinion, try to burn it, if they had the chance, you, the prospective reader of this book, should cast aside all preconceived notions, whether yours or others', about this book. Just as well: throw my comments about the book away, and decide for yourself (because that is just what I said). But keep the idea of deciding for yourself, and disregard all the ploys that people will try to get you to not read this book, and go read this book, you just might enjoy it.Besides, how do other people know what you will like?

The issues of missing text are fixed at least in a spot-check of the opening chapter. I just checked with a new download via the PG website of a 1.72 mb file. But, as of today, you have to do it yourself, not via the instant function here. (Amazon's site is not aligned to do this as of this date of writing. I note as I write this Amazon posted a note that the Kindle free [aka Project Gutenberg] text is not available and that they are looking into reported problems as an \\"item under review.\\")I had first downloaded the free file a few weeks ago (pg4300.mobi @ 1.7 mb) to my Touch. I found that in the the Martello scene, for instance, \\"The Ballad of Joking Jesus\\" sung memorably by Malachi was missing. Other ditties, such as \\"I am the boy...invisibility\\") indicated by indentation in standard form (even in the e-book online via Gutenberg-dot-org) were missing as well from the Kindle version of the free text. In other places, if not surprisingly, spacing was off. I assume later chapters may have lacked the graphic designs that the novel relied upon as to punctuation and page presentation. The spacing looks a little better in the updated download. Let's hope these matters have been corrected, thanks to Gutenberg's team of volunteers for a valuable service after so many decades of copyright control beyond reasonable limits exerted by the author's estate against creative uses.One challenge, if not to be blamed on any version of Joyce's text as published originally. The e-books come in parts I (Stephen), II (Bloom) and III (Molly). So, the chapters attributed later on are not included, but they may be on electronic resources that are not the public domain one, as added value. I cannot figure out on a Kindle how to make bookmarks and label them as to chapters--I did this on an Aldiko version on my phone.Finding gratis a public domain (finally!) version despite its drawbacks is wonderful. I cannot fault those who prepared a difficult text for an e-book for free. There are other versions for sale that are nicer, and they merit their own reviews by others, but Amazon heaps all media for many texts in the public domain together, so rating the medium is jumbled with the content itself, no easy solution.Making e-books off of a notoriously unstable ur-text that's long tested the patience of any Joycean editor already isn't easy. So, the bulk of the novel's intact for reference, concordance work, and looking up passages or phrases nearly instantly. It can always be compared to the Gabler or Random House eds., of course. It's great to have my favorite novel even in its rawer form, to look up or dip into on a Kindle."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"Enough good things have been said about Ulysses, and most of them are true. You should benefit greatly from reading such a wondrous masterpiece. But if you are serious you should shy away from the Gabler Edition. It is widely considered among Joyce scholars, and even some of Gabler's original advisers, that he took way too many liberties when producing this edition. He made many noted blunders and errors. In essense, Gabler damaged the script with his misguided sense of editing.I have read the Gabler Edition, and really didn't know better at the time. It was still brilliant and I loved it, but I defer to the experts. I now own the Random House edition, and have skipped around to reread parts of it. Supposedly the Penguin and Everyman's Library editions are worthy reprints of the 1960 edit. There is a forthcoming edit from Norton that is anticipated as becoming the new definitive edit, but they have been delayed in getting it out. Be careful about which edition you get. Some are reprints of the original edition, which contains many errors. Go with Penguin, Everyman's or Random House for now.Also, this Vintage edition is horribly made. The book binding frayed and the book fell apart after a year; the pages all fell out (some individually, but mostly in clumps of 10 to 100 pages)and I was desperately and pathetically trying to keep them together and in order (I was only trying to hold on to the book because of my extensive margin notes). After, a while I just gave up and vowed never to buy Vintage again.I plan on rereading Ulysses, but in a different edition than Vintage. I read it along with The New Bloomsday Book by Harry Blamires. It is an extremely helpful and well regarded commentary/guide."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"Don't read \\"Ulysses\\" because of what other people say about it or how highly it's usually ranked among great 20th-c. novels; if you don't like it, move on to something else. But if Joyce intrigues you, well, you've got a lifetime to sort it all out. I've read the book several times and it's never the same experience--Joyce is always many steps ahead of me. When I first read \\"Ulysses\\" as an insufferable young man of 19, I kept thinking, \\"Why does he write this way?\\" (Along with, \\"Why am I not 'getting' it?\\") (Because I was only 19, I guess, and I tried to plow through it quickly so I could tell everyone that I \\"read 'Ulysses'!\\". Ouch.) And talk about slow reading! Let your eyes melt into a paragraph or a sentence. Let it sink in! Perhaps the ideal reader of Joyce is the one who memorizes the entire thing. Let me explain: Everything in \\"Ulysses\\" is interrelated. I'll bet there aren't 20 facts in the book that don't relate somehow to other aspects of the book. He'll mention something in chapter 3, and by chapter 10 he'll mention something else about it. \\"Oh, right; chapter 3.\\" You know, sort of like in real life. Joyce could have written the book normally, but I'm glad he didn't. Like asking Bach to make his fugues simpler. What's the point? and who has the right. Joyce is not deliberately obscure; to me, he's one of the least obscure writers ever. Paging Aristotle! To me, he had the most control over his words of any author who ever lived. (Again, it's all interrelated.) So yes, the book is not going to come alive on the first reading. Poor baby. Takes more than that to peel this onion. If you were to look up all of the allusions etc. in this book, you'd have a solid liberal-arts education. But you don't have to, of course. It's just that the more you know, the more you'll get out of this book. Would that I were raised in Dublin. Oh well; we don't fault Homer for being Greek now do we. And I'm taken aback by some of the Woolf-ian critiques here. Like Voltaire on that \\"barbarian\\" Shakespeare. Like Shaw, Wyndham Lewis weren't jealous; they just hated him because he was so darn good. And even Jung was puzzled; what, hadn't he been studying myth his whole life? Maybe the book seemed more radical in the 1920s. But Joyce wasn't trying to be \\"modern\\" or \\"avant-garde.\\" He couldn't care less about that surreal stuff either. So, \\"Ulysses\\" is perhaps the final book of a long tradition, the fullstop of the West. (Scan the Internet for some articles and join some chat-groups if you don't believe me.) Now, wait; what about \\"Finnegans Wake\\"? Arrrrrrrghhhh!"},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"This is without question the most difficult book I have ever read. It is also the most interesting, descriptive, imaginative, funny, poignant, life-affirming, and learned book I have ever read. As someone nearing 50 who has read broadly, I consider the experience of reading Joyce's masterpiece an achievement that was well worth the effort. And it was an effort.The Naxos audiobook was essential for me (I have the CD version, which I downloaded to my Ipod; I have seen comments suggesting that the Kindle version has technical glitches). I am not a particular fan of audiobooks, but the Naxos version is very well put together, and Jim Norton - who reads 98% of the book, does a phenomenal job covering the countless voices that enter and exit (and often reenter) the text. Then Marcella Riordan reads the final monologue of Molly Bloom and her delivery is equally impressive. My approach was to follow along with the text while listening to the audiobook, and then refer to Don Gifford's annoted notes (a separate volume) that provides very helpful background to the often obscure references. For difficult chapters I would also relisten/read the chapter, which always provided added value. It sounds like a slog, and I guess it was, but I repeat: I do not regret a minute of it. Very rewarding."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"This, as it is for many, is a wonderful and challenging read, forcing you to work at reading at creating and meeting up with the author in this wonderful and truly rich fiction that truly is fiction in all senses - not following but breaking up, re-casting fictional elements as he goes.

I decided to read it ANYWAY.The book starts off quirky and interesting and (yay!) Stephen Dedalus is back. Each chapter is written in the style that is best for the content and that is one of the things that really impressed me.

But with the language and phrasing and stream of conscience style that Joyce uses, there added to the difficulty of the read in a few spots.I also really wish Kindle would number the pages. I know this changes based upon the size type a reader may set his Kindle at. However, it would really enhance the reading experience. Even if the page broke in the middle of a \\"page\\" due to the size type that the reader selected, it would be most helpful.

Sometimes I literally had to read the book backwards in search of a missing or forgotten thread. One small section is so fiendishly composed that I had to write it out by hand to untangle it. Other parts are as obscure to me now as they were when I first read them.That being said, when you lock onto Ulysses--when you can hold onto the thread--the words, the pages, everything vanishes. Pure thought, like music or cocaine, insinuates itself into your mind and clings to the pleasure centers.That you may never totally unravel Ulysses is unimportant.

It's bloody famous and often quoted, but you don't get a sense until you've read the whole thing that where other books leave you begging for more or hoping them to come to an end more quickly, this ending is *perfectly* satisfying.

This is my emotional response.]"},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"That &quot;Ulysses&quot; is a great novel and a (not the) turning point in the history of modern imaginative prose is, I think, proven beyond reasonable doubt. But, after having read it twice, a nagging doubt remains: is it a life-enhancing achievement ? Like the best of Shakespeare or Tolstoy. Does it achieve universality beyond obvious plodder-type references harking back to Homer ? Which are pros and cons ? Among pros, I'd say that most important are exuberant playfulness of language and gorgeously hilarious stampedo of comic banal incidents. Joyce is truly great comic writer. As for his status of the progenitor of experimental prose, I'm more sceptical. The stream of consciousness technique remained confined mostly to English-language literatures; what's more objectionable, it doesn't seem to possess potency of meditative-reflective approach of a Conrad or Proust, nor direct prophetic insight of a Dostoevsky or Lawrence. There is something arid and self-defeating in the very nature of Joyce's endeavor. Among cons two come to mind immediately: a scholastic network of cross-references that serves as the underpinning of the entire structure-something that impresses a naive innocent reader as an erudition beyond, beyond...but, actually is an exercise in a dated and dead world view ( and even this is far from being impeccable-Joyce's reading in philosophy is superficial; he confuses Duns Scotus and Johanes Scotus Erigena ); the other con is the all-pervading banality of virtually everything. As if a double perspective is achieved simultaneously: Joyce's work is as detached as possible, yet, its all-devouring meaninglessness betrays the author's mindset. And this mindset I would call as subjective and life defeating as any imaginable. Conclusion: Joyce's inventiveness and humor produced a great book. At the same time, his aesthetic pseudoreligion and something I could call only a soulless Weltanschauung prevented him to create a summit like &quot;A la recherche&quot;, &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot; or &quot;The Devils&quot;. A great novel. Among the most influential. Not among the greatest."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"Although I enjoy using Anthony Burgess', &quot;Joyce Prick,&quot; as a walking guide through Ulysses, it's not a difficult read. However, the best part about Ulysses is that no matter your view, no one will ever agree with it!Ulysses is best understood, in my opinion, by the male aged 35 to 50. It is the story of Bloom's passage into middle age. His last bit of memory, physical or mental, of his youth. He is passing on to new memories, but allows for one final mental seduction.In the meantime, his wife, Molly, is also passing. She has allowed herself, in her own final touch with youth gone, to be physically seduced.In the end, Molly and Bloom rejoin. Life goes on; youth is dead.I guess that I will always love this book, however, I will always be amazed at how simple it is and how much has been written analyzing it. But then, it is no less than perfect"},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"Yes because you never read it since college with the pointyheaded old man but you can read it again it is better every time yes one day in Dublin is infinitely interesting with Joyce yes it has everybody yes tired young Stephen tired old Bloom and plain tired Molly yes it does everything from the newspaper to the bathroom yes it is complicated but better every time you read you must buy it say to yourself yes I will buy it yes I will Yes"},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"Aside from the other flaws pointed out, it doesn't have any chapter breaks. If Amazon doesn't want a good edition available for free for the Kindle, that's their business, but that this one comes up first on the search page sullies the reputation of the Kindle, of free books available over the Internet, and of Ulysses itself. (I'm not going to say Ulysses isn't a challenging read, but it's an impossible one here.)"},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"When one looks at Ulysses by James Joyce without prior knowledge, one comes in with pre-conceptions of what should be expected. They find it difficult and confusing and without purpose. Some say it is an exercise in intellectually masturbatory narrative, some say it is just a terrible work completely without merit. To those I say, look at Picasso, van gogh or any other artist for that matter and you will gain an appreciation for the work. Let me explain myself.Joyce was quoted as saying something to the effect of \\"If Dublin disappeared off the face of the earth, this book would be able to recreate it down to the last detail\\" now while that is a tad hyperbolic, he illustrates the main point of the novel. To paint a picture of dublin. Imagine a landscape painting be it an urban, idyll, or what have you. You don't necessarily approach it with a plot in mind, you simply enjoy the sites as they are. That is what this book is. Joyce's methods of achieving it are what separate this from the other works of any literary genre.It is a painting in the truest sense of the word. Each chapter forms a kaleidoscope of narrative, point of view and immersive yet alienating sensory details. This hodgepodge of narrative styles can infuriate or delight as it paints with immense detail a single day in the life of one Leopold Bloom.To be sure there are chapters that are extremely opaque and less sensory based than others, but this is a way of enhancing the narrative differences of each chapter. Every chapter is a microcosm of narrative which ultimately creates the macrocosm of the work as a whole. Take for example chapter 15: Circe, this is written as a script. Chapter 17: Ithaca a catechism, Chapter 18: penelope is the purest stream of consciousness ever written.And to those detractors who argue that plot is important, keep in mind not all literature has the intention of telling a story.So I leave you with this. This book is difficult, I'm not going to lie, the first read will be infuriating as almost a guarantee, but with a mindset of Painting over story you may perhaps enjoy it as such and find this review at least somewhat helpful"},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"This review is specifically for the Naxos AudioBooks production of Ulysses. Nowhere on the Amazon website (although I have now requested this change) does it say that this audiobook is ABRIDGED! The quality of the performances are so far outstanding, but it was disconcerting, to say the least, to be in the middle of Book I and suddenly be transported to Book IV. I purchased the audiobook to help me as I read through the book itself, so to that extent the audiobook abandoned me just when I needed it most, as Book III is rather arduous. It is still worth it to me since the only other audiobook is going for almost $150, and as I'm reading the book in its entirety I will not be limited to the abridged story.

Written by James Joyce, and subsequently banned in America and England it was ranked as the greatest book of the 20th century by the Modern Library.Written in the revolutionary stream of consciousness style it fills about 1000 pages, and it is contined within puns, allusions, and other arcane references."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"This is a book designed to make some people hate it, and make some people love it. That's what we all want to write - the seeds of a good debate.Does one need to understand something to appreciate it? I first approached this book like any other - steam through the pages, and try to remember what the story was all about. I found a book which didn't make sense, a book that was near incomprehensible, and I felt frustrated that I could not see what the fuss was all about.I could not hate a book I could not understand, however, except for the fact that it seriously dented my ego. A book I couldn't understand? Never! How dare it??But certain fragments stayed in my mind, and I returned to it again, six months after my first read through.Picked through the text, fell through the lyricism, and replaced the book back on the shelf, where it resided more as a symbol, a badge of courage than a book.And I returned. Again and again. Snippets, fragments, open the book at random, extract. Replace. Repeat.Bit by bit it began to fall into place, the characters and the ambition of the book began to emerge. Bit by bit I began to like it more. I had to stop judging it on its reputation, difficulty or intellectualism. There are sections I love, sections I find a chore to read, and sections I discover all the time. Bizarrely, previously tedious chapters began to come to life, and I began to appreciate them. Equally so, I began to dislike some I previously liked, and the whole balance is always changing. So, I can say that although I've read all the words at least thrice, I have not finished reading the book. And at my rate of a few pages a month, I never will. I hope I never will.Most will either focus on the ambition or the difficulty of the book. There is no need to justify, I think, just read it. There is no need to judge it against any criteria other than yourself; you are the only yardstick any book needs (unless you're an academic, in which case something else is needed). There is no need to redefine &quot;good&quot; over and over again, and justify it.Multifaceted, multilayered, and most of all, strangely human, this is a book I'm not done with yet, and I don't intend ever to be so.That's why I'm giving it 5 stars. It never has ceased to uncover something new each time. The only other book that I can look at time and time again and discover something new all the time is a very good atlas! Well, that's why I think I'll give it 5 stars today. Tomorrow, maybe 4. It changes all the time.Joyce won, didn't he? Everyone wants to write something which is near immortal, and by writing a book which would prompt endless debate, he achieved that goal."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"Jim gets a little carried away like Pacino chewing carpets.

All the bits of doggerel and poetry that are in the text seem to be missing. I made it through 16% of the free edition, and just felt like something was not right. Not having a hard copy where I am, I checked out another Kindle edition that costs about $3.00. It in fact feels complete, at least so far. The poetry is in there, which really adds to the text. An example of what is missing: early in the book Stephen Dedalus is talking to his class, and they ask for a riddle. He gives them a riddle, which is missing in the free text. The ANSWER to the riddle is there, but the riddle itself is missing. Now some have argued here that this type of text is not necessarily integral to the book. However, let's be blunt. You are preparing to tackle one of the most challenging books in the English language. Don't you want the whole thing? To do less is to not do justice to your efforts as a reader.Unlike some here, I don't disparage Amazon's efforts to put these free books out there. I have read several on an extended tour outside the country, where my kindle is my constant companion, filled largely with free books. Some have had typos, some have had formatting issues. The common denominator is that they have all been free. BUT, to read Tarzan of the Apes for free, with some typos, is one thing; to tackle Ulysses without the benefit of the full text seems somewhat pointless, particularly when there is a low cost text available on Amazon which appears to be complete. One last note, though. The edition I am mentioning here is the Unabridged and Illustrated. When it first showed up on Amazon it said Unabridged (annotated). There were no annotations, and I have yet to see any illustrations. Still, this is the text you want, not the free version here.Update: Amazon keeps changing the name of this more complete edition.

Also, I'm only three chapters in.If you are unfamiliar with this book and care about these things, you might want to look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"For people who know of Ulysses but have never read it, calling it a \\"blast\\" may seem ludicrous. Maybe it is, but I know there are more than a few of us who found this book to be a thrilling adventure without quite knowing why. On the surface, it appears to be the story of 18 uneventful hours in the lives of two Dubliners. We see them snark, teach, defecate, work (half-heartedly), worry, lust, and drink. Exciting right? Yes.Admittedly, this book can be exciting only to a lover of language and literature. The book is subdivided into 18 sections, each roughly an hour. Each section acts as its own writing experiment, some more obvious than others. Contrary to popular belief, the book is not written in stream-of-consciousness. It employs this technique, as it employs many others. True, the last section of the book consists of a 40-page stream-of-consciousness sentence, but another section presents itself as a play where the stage directions help move the reader into the subconscious desires/fears of the characters. I doubt Joyce was ignorant of Freud. And I can't forget to mention that the layers of symbolism and metaphor are absolutely dazzlying.But if Ulysses was nothing more than a writing experiment, it would be dull even to the most erudite of readers. Its true strength lies in its surprising humanity. By poking at the heads of the two protagonists, Stephen Dedalus and Leopold Bloom, Joyce offers up one of the most complete portraits of the human experience ever put into words. The sylistic experiments are not simply indulgent, but are woven into the fabric of this portrait.Everthing ties together in a phantasmagoric representation of the mundane, complete with a brilliant and frightening climax that seems to fuse every primal symbol of the universe into a single sentence....But I had help with this one. If I hadn't had the professor I had and a whole month to study the book, I may never have had the literary adventure I did. To anyone who wants to tackle this beast, I recomend picking up the EXCELLENT guide, The New Bloomsday Book: A Guide Through Ulysses, by Harry Blamires. I can't say enough about how accessible and thorough this guide is.

The explanation concerning the difficulty in preparing it for this oral reading is an excellent aid for the \\"listener\\" in further understanding this masterpiece.If you are not familiar with this literary classic, then the clarity, intonation,and dramatic oral presentation will certainly help both those familiar and those not familiar with this work to understand both the literal and implied \\"meanings\\" throughout the entire work."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"These are the things you will probably hear the most about James Joyce's great epic: ULYSSES is hard to read. ULYSSES is a masterpiece of 20th Century literature. ULYSSES requires a deep knowledge of Western Civilization. ULYSSES is the expression of modern man's heroic quest for meaning in a world without heroes or meaning. ULYSSES has to be read along with a dozen other books on how to read ULYSSES.Much of this is true.But what is omitted by reviewers, time after time, is the warm humor, born of Joyce's compassion for people, that surfaces on every page. From the obvious riddles told to and by the protagonist, Leopold Bloom, to the scholarly puns and tropes uttered by the narrators, ULYSSES can be seen as one great comic book. Listen closely to the words of the one-eyed Citizen in the &quot;Cyclops&quot; chapter. Pay attention to what the soldier screams just before he decks Stephen Dedalus. The dark humor surrounding Paddy Dignam's funeral is hysterical.No, this doesn't mean ULYSSES is light reading--don't bring it along on your trip to the beach or the ski lodge. The novel makes many demands on the reader, as do many of the other works we consider milestones of literature. This doesn't mean you have to read it in a dusty library and takes notes on every page. The book is filled with lightness and life. The fact that it ends with the word &quot;Yes&quot; is the most obvious expression of ULYSSES' life-affirming attitude.Certainly there are devestating moments that wrench your heart: Stephen's run-in with his pathetic father and Bloom's vision of the ghost of his son immediately come to mind. But for the most part, ULYSSES is a raunchy, rowdy, ride that makes the difficult parts easier to bear."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"I'm 14 years old and I am halfway through the book. I took people's advice and am taking it one chapter at a time, and then discussing it with a friend of mine. I'm not really into books, but I love to push myself. After every chapter I need to research a little, and look words up in the dictionary. I would recommend this book to a dedicated reader who is prepared to work hard and use their head constantly."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"Ulysses does not throw out the welcome mat. Indeed, the book hardly seems to notice you as you trudge its Dublin streets with Stephen Dedalus and Leopold Bloom. James Joyce spent seven years in composition (1914-1921), and a really thorough and thoughtful first reading (consulting numerous references meanwhile) can easily take more than a year. The entire book chronicles just one day (June 16, 1904).In Ulysses, Joyce further refines his stream-of-consciousness narrative technique already mastered in the Portrait. Ulysses also is written in Joyce's signature \\"dramatic style\\" (ie, fiction that has no author's comments to help orient you). These two traits - stream-of-consciousness narrative and dramatic style - make Joyce hard to read at least at first for some people. And the occasional savage wordplay of Ulysses (wholly tame by the standard of Finnegans Wake) can quickly disorient - \\"con-trans-magnificand-jew-bang-tantiality\\". Nevertheless, once you've grasped Joyce's style it's a pleasure that's always fresh.As do the Portrait and Wake, Ulysses redefines the concept of \\"reading\\" a book. Joyce develops hyper-realistic atmospheres in each chapter through stream-of-consciousness narrative and/or drastic changes in style. For example, in the \\"Cyclops\\" chapter, the style crescendoes with biblical intensity up to a hilarious apocalyptic finale, followed at once by the \\"Nausicaa\\" chapter, which is written in the sentimental style of a Victorian girl's magazine. (Imagine the bone-jarring bathos of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony instantly followed by the theme song to the children's program Barney.) This goes on non-stop till the final chapter of Molly Bloom falling asleep - a chapter of dark earthiness composed of seven immense sentences. The novel's overall effect is Plato's \\"intelligible sphere whose center is everywhere and whose circumference is nowhere\\". Big claim but Joyce makes it happen.Mark Twain remarked \\"a great book is a book everyone wants *to have* read and no one wants *to* read\\". Initially unwelcoming, Ulysses is \\"a book to be enjoyed over and over again\\", as Joseph Campbell stated. Helpful references are Joseph Campbell's six audiocassette lectures, Wings of Art, and Stuart Gilbert's book, James Joyce's Ulysses.(Perhaps) the twentieth century's greatest work of English fiction."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"As an avid reader, I've often thought, &quot;Which book would I want to take with me to a desert island if I could only pick one book.&quot; Others like the Bible, or Dante's Inferno, or the Odyssey have crossed my mind, but in terms of revealing almost infinite possibilities, Ulysses is my pick, hands down. Recently I've reread some of it, but I read the book in a full in graduate school. For first time readers, my advice is, don't be intimidated! Unlike Finnegan's Wake which is not really &quot;readable&quot; by a normal person (okay, if you happen to be able to understand word puns in 27 different languages -- I don't mean to insult anyone...), I find that with some background preparation, Ulysses is very readable. As background, you should reread the Odyssey since each book is based on a corresponding book of the Odyssey. Then, you should get one or two guides to reading Ulysses (Gilbert has an easy to follow one) and try reading one chapter of Ulysses while keeping open the pages in the commentary (may remind some readers of biblical study). In fact, reading this book is the closest I think a non-rabbinical student will come to an exercise like reading Talmud (which comments on the Bible). The experience is infinitely rewarding and will teach you more about reading than any course you could take. The basic plot of the book is not at all hard to follow and there is an abundance of ribald humor. Lest you think Ulysses is &quot;upscale&quot; think again!Let me be clear: this is THE masterwork of the 20th century. It holds up well as one of the greatest of all time. No serious writer has escaped its influence. When you tackle it, you will understand what a great literary achievement is. After reading it for the first time, I become a Joyce fanatic. I'd also recommend both the Ellman biography of Joyce and the even better (in my opinion) biography of his wife Nora. You'll learn lots about Ulysses by reading both of these books as well. Don't be intimidated -- jump in head first. You will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"This edition omits most everything that appears in the print edition centered in the page, i.e. the poetry and songs like \\"The Ballad of Joking Jesus,\\" noted by other reviewers.

How many other great books could you read in the time it takes to get thru Ulysses (assuming a serious effort)? It's a huge chunk of your reading life. Still glad I got thru it and can now enjoy some familiarity with one of the legendary works of western fiction.I do think Joyce went overboard structurally. Some of the episodes struck me as too cryptic and obscure in their form, their structural basis too removed from anyything meaningful for me. Such a large portion of the book is entirely unconventional in form and it's so overwhelming and confusing. Of course, there is some spectacular writing, and a ton of great wit and laughs. And some of the stream of consciousness and interior monologue sections are so remarkable and compelling that you just have to read it.Some advise no reference materials on first reading. I disagree and say get the Gifford encyclopedia and try to use it only when needed and to try to resist looking up every reference, allusion, slang or colloquialism, etc. I also used SparkNotes just for basic episode summaries. A good dictionary is essential.

It provided just the necessary final incentive needed to throw all the \\"wait 'til a good time\\" aside and actually just read it, which of course is ultimately how it needs to be read.\\"Ulysses\\" is famous for being \\"impenetrable\\" and \\"unreadable\\", but is far from either. Just like other formal experiments in writing, like Beat era writing, Thomas Pynchon novels, and more recently novels by such authors as David Foster Wallace (may he rest in peace) and Mark Z. Danielewsky, it's not a matter so much of understanding everything and getting the plot as it is of letting the book take you along on its own terms. In the case of \\"Ulysses\\" specifically, each chapter is it's own new formal experiment, and it is of my humble opinion that you are allowed to like some parts better than others. Those who have a problem with it are those who go into the reading with their own expectations or demands informing their analysis. \\"Ulysses\\" is an experience, and one that I think most people should at least try to have to see if it's for them or not (just like skydiving or eating unfamiliar food in a foreign country).And like most media, the things that make it controversial are quite often beyond the point, and anybody who actually read the text finds that out quickly. This novel is about a lot of things, love, language, intertextuality, Shakespeare, Greek myth, Dublin (it does, after all, fall between the proto-neorealistic writing of \\"Dubliners\\" and the intense brooding of \\"Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man\\"), humour, and life, and there are other repeated themes, allusions, motifs, and forms to give any critical reader much to play with and brood over, but it certainly is not difficult reading and it definitely isn't smut. Go figure.In conclusion, this was a great way to start actually following Amazon's recommendation system, and I'm very proud of myself for finally getting around to doing something I really wanted to do after putting it off needlessly for so long.--PolarisDiB"},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"Many others have written in more words than I care to think about concerning the tremendous effort that it takes to read Ulysses, the worth of this expenditure of your time, and of their almost universal admiration for it. There are a few detractors to be sure and Joyce would be ecstatic that his artfulness has indeed led to his \\"immortality\\" since he is quoted as saying as much.I wish to add what seems to be left out almost universally in the many reviews and recommendations. Everywhere you are told to accompany Ulysses by annotations, discussion/interpretation books but almost nowhere are you told to accompany Ulysses by the words Joyce wrote himself. One of the protagonists, Stephen Dedalus, as well as his father Simon, are not first introduced to us in Ulysses. They are introduced in great detail in \\"A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man\\". Simon's fall from prosperity to poverty and the impact it has on Stephen/Joyce is crucial background. Understanding that \\"A Portrait ...\\" is autobiographical in nature, reveals much about both Joyce and the characters. You are better prepared to meet Stephen with his superior intellect, education, and his feeling of separation from his countrymen and his behavior if you first read \\"A Portrait ...\\".Many of the characters in Ulysses are introduced to us first in the collection of short stories \\"Dubliners\\". Easily two dozen characters from the Ulysses, some mentioned only in passing, are much better developed in short stories in Dubliners.The milieu of Ulysses, as well as the many characters (all meanings intended) Bloom and Dedalus interact with in their meanderings, are better taken in with these two wonderful works helping to embolden you to tackle Ulysses. Both of them are wonderfully approachable, easily read, and are extremely entertaining, full of the wit and wisdom of Joyce. You are certainly more intimately involved with the evolution of Joyce as he proceeds towards Ulysses with these arrows in your quiver.The structure and basic timeline of the book are dictated by Homer's Odyssey. It is certainly easier to understand why Stephen is Telemachus, Bloom is Odysseus, and Molly is Penelope if you have actually read the Odyssey!The reviewer goes to Symphony Space on Broadway almost every year for Bloomsday (June 16). Find a similar event near you. Ulysses is a monster \\"play\\". It is meant to be enjoyed with others and is much more accessible when experienced aloud. Take the time to understand why people believe this to be the best novel of the 20th century. It will be my favorite forever I am sure.Lastly, I do not recommend Gabler. It is clearly marked by Amazon and other booksellers as by Joyce and Gabler. Be forewarned that there is much scholarship which seriously detracts from Gabler's additions, subtractions, and modifications as not intended by Joyce. That said, I am absolutely certain that Joyce would have enjoyed the controversy tremendously. Read Ulysses in whatever form you can get it but prepare yourself first with the words and experiences Joyce wanted you to have first."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"I don't think its helpful to read Ulysses as a novel. If you expect a plot, or a tale or character arcs, or realism, or accessible prose, you will be frustrated. Would you read the Bible with those expectations? Or the Odyssey? And those books along with Hamlet are touchstones for Ulysses but also the caliber of the company Joyce's great book keeps. So how is Ulysses a novel? It has characters that we follow and whose psychology is revealed to us. It uses narrative to move along story elements through the eighteen episodes (though clearly not chapters so more evidence of it not being a novel). There is Bloom's letter to Martha, Boylan's date with Molly and Stephen's homeless fate. Ulysses uses the novel to both explode that form and to honor it as an artistic expression. This aspect of the book; its subverted novelistic qualities is what gives Ulysses its forbidding reputation as unreadable or as pointlessly obscure.The pleasure in reading Ulysses is not novelistic, it is humanistic, it is to ruminate on the existence of Western Civilization. It is to experience connections to our mythic past and our primal present. It is to ponder where our flawed, suffering, imaginative, humanity will take us as we move through the century beyond the Joyce's creation. More than that it's a chance to contemplate our own capacity for contradiction, ambiguity, creativity, perversity, cleverness and fantasy.Joyce isn't just showing off his genius. He is displaying the full range of it so that we can participate in it and take of it what we can, if we can and be not afraid of not making sense. There are deeper truths than simple comprehension and Joyce tantalizes us with glimpses of what they could be."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"The Vintage Classics is a great version to get because it includes the Supreme Court ruling from Judge Woolsey lifting the ban on \\"Ulysses\\" which allowed it back into the United States. Besides, it also contains the corrected text.It's true that this book revolutionized and refined stream-of-conciousness and it's almost too easy to get caught up on that fact. Really, though, Joyce is doing nothing more in his writing than what people do every day in their lives. When I first started reading this book I re-read over passages but later realized it was better to go on, to follow the certain thought process the character had, just to help realize how complex and subtle some things really were. The book is dense but mimicks how a person thinks and feels within the context of every day life. With that said, the plot is only there as something running in the background so that there can be various thoughts provoked by the action. What makes it a difficult read (this is what the writer of preface to \\"Finnegans Wake\\" said as well) is the readers wanting to piece things together systematically so that it makes sense. Have you ever been having a discussion or been walking down the street when something random seems to remind you of something else completely unrelated? Often times a path may be traced to how or why something reminded you of something else and the same goes with this book. But I think the hardest part is accepting that everything fits together even though we don't understand it.As others have said, the last chapter is worth reading the book alone. The inward struggle Molly has with herself, along with her reconciliation at the end, is absolutely wonderful. Without the initial 740 (!) pages written in his difficult style I don't think I would have gotten as much out of this final chapter. I have to say, I was literally breathing heavily after I read this and felt as though I were feeling exactly as Molly. It's certainly a lot of pages to wade through but worth every minute and gives perfect reason for enjoying a second reading.This is by far the most enjoyable and rewarding book I've ever read. When I put it down I thought to myself, \\"What the hell just happened?!\\" and I wish every book could do the same."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"It seems Ulysses touches on every theme experienced in human life. But it doesn't dwell on any of these subjects (or literary style) for long enough to pass judgement.Bloom is criticized for being a jew, but his critics are drunken commoners who are also simultaneously ridiculed and praised. Stephen mourns for his mother but dislikes and avoids his father. Bloom's wife truly loves her husband but she cheats on him.This novel is purposely vague because there are several ways of looking at any one thing and Joyce demonstrates this truth in the various narrators. Almost every character and line of dialogue is considered and reconsidered through the minds of the characters or other unnamed narrators. Joyce is telling us there is no one truth accesible to everyone, all we can do is appreciate the endlessly interactive and timeless quality of an ordinary day and strive to love our enemies."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"OK. It doesn't take a genius to realize that unless you're name is James Joyce you're not going to fully understand this book. There are too many obscure allusions and not even the very well read will get it all. So here's how I tackled the book. Skip the allusions. Yes, skip them. There's no point trying to figure them out because you won't. Just read the narrative, follow the story, trace the themes, and 'try' to appreciate Joyce's style. Then, if you really like the book that much go back and re-read it, only this time use one of the 'guides' to Ulysses that are out there to figure out the allusions.If you approach the book this way it become much easier to read. You'll still get the story, the structure, and the enough of the style."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"This is a question that has come up many times. First of all, let me make it clear that I haven't finished Ulysses. I'm in the middle of it, but I feel that I can give a fair review with the amount of it I have read, and I want to review it with it fresh on my mind. Ulysses is not the best novel ever made. Since there is nothing else like it, you can't compare it to anything. It isn't revolutionary, and it doesn't teach the reader any valuable lessons in life, like the Lord of the Rings, Catcher in the Rye, or to Kill a Mockingbird. However, it is insanely enjoyable. The monologues of thought and conversations, as well as descriptions, are beautiful. I can't recommend Ulysses to anyone, however, because I'm sure alot of people hate it. It's difficult to understand (at parts), and contains many cultural references (to Ireland), which confuses the reader even more. Something similar to Cliff's Notes might help. If you have read books challenging on the philosophical level before, I can't imagine a better choice for your next novel than Ulysses. (unless, of course, you haven't read the Lord of the Rings or the Catcher in the Rye :oP)"},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"I will admit that I dont understand every little word of ulysses but the lyricsm of the novel of enough to warrant five stars. The way the novel goes back and forth between joyce reality and the stream of thoughts are simply increable. Increable in both how he conviced it and who effect it is. There are also just prse of pure emtion that anyone can instanitly understand . As for the charaters, all are intresting and distinct. Each word has to be read very carefully to understand what is happening but the end resut is both and intresting and intensen novel.Any one who truly enjoys ulysses should also check out Berlin Alexanderplatz by Alfred Doblin, which is also a large urban story useing the stream of concessness"},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"Strange as it may seem, many people do read and re-read this novel simply because they love it!It would be impossible to summarize a work such as this in a few lines, but what I love most about this work is its humanity. Joyce is not satirizing Homer: in invoking \\"The Odyssey\\", he is not so much deflating the heroic as elevating the everyday. The mundane day-to-day events which constitute life for the vast majority of us are given a heroic dimension - and, indeed, why should they not? A good, decent man like Bloom is as worthy of praise as was Ulysses.This is one of the great affirmative novels in a century where literature has, by and large, been dominated by darkness."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"One cannot stress the importance of Ulysses. As a book, it almost defies explanation, such is it's achievement, in that it seems to be a story a story of so very little, yet with the importance of Odyssean epic. It's hard to explain. The thing about Ulysses is that it's sheer inventiveness will capture you. Joyce not only places you in the scene via description, the very words he uses become the description themselves, in the shape and texture of them. The book is also a library of allusions, but they can be taken as they are, or decoded within the book itself. There has never been a book quite like it before or since, and it is absolutely essential reading for anyone who wants to understand the twentieth century's malaise. It addresses not only the development of Ireland, but the development of man, and predicts the trends of the next hundred years effectively."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"it is hard to imagine exactly what i think of this except for the fact that maybe precisely once more you forget but forget no forgivance that once around is more for twice but you grow with twice"},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"I must say, Ulysses is perhaps the most difficult to understand book ever written (aside from Finnegan's wake) yet it is pure genius. I decided to read it as my independent book for a highschool english course. I stumbled through it, with lots of assistance from my teacher and found it to be the most rewarding literary experience. Joyce's characters are so complex and three dimensional that one can hardly believe they are not actual humans. It is the most enlightening experience to feel that you are in someone else's mind. Although this book is very challenging, it is something every person should experience before they die. Make a point to read this book sometime in your life."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"Having read Ulysses, as well as dissecting it's labrynthe and numerous metaphorical qualities, far too many to go into in a maximum of a thousand words, I can say with all confidence and utmost rightousness that Joyces masterpiece belongs in the league of reverence given to Shakespeare, Dante and Homer. It is without a doubt the single most awesome display of genius in the twentieth century."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"Enough! To those unmanned by the maze: you are not stupid by default if you despise every scrabble Joyce scribbled. Many intelligent people, including Virginia Woolf, saw nothing in Ulysses and less in the Wake. To others Ulysses is the liveliest and funniest book ever. To the academics who comb Ulysses--agile horse--for the nits of criticism (thereby insuring Joyce's immoraltality), please leave alone we who would enjoy without inheriting the immense debtorship of things better left undone. To those who would deny that Ulysses is the most important (not necessarily the best) novel ever written, the very fact that so many are compelled to constantly trash it is the ultimate tribute to its place. Finally, let it be known that Joyce swore on Ulysses, on the honor of a gentleman, which admittedly he was not: --There is not one serious word in it."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"After finally summoning the courage to attempt a reading of Ulysses, I am profoundly greatful that I did. While the novel is intricately layered and multi-referenced, reading it is really not as challenging as its reputation would have one believe. Moreover, it is a page-turner in the truest sense; never before have I been so absorbed by a piece of literature. Joyce's relentless and masterful descriptions of characters' thoughts, both important inner monologues and equally flippant patter, offer an insight into the human condition which is unparalled in English literature. I am utterly convinced that Ulysses is the most important novel of the twentieth century; it is a true masterpiece of literary art, one that simply makes the reader proud to be human."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"The only two things that matter in any type of writing are What Is Written (Substance) and How It Is Written (Style). Ulysses is an amazing book when it comes to style. I can not think of a book that compares; in fact, Ulysses is many books, with each chapter written in a style that is best suited for it. I first read Ulysses when I was in graduate school, and was simply blown away by the sheer breadth and depth of Joyce's writing ability. The book influenced me dramatically: it freed me from the chains of accepted modes of written expression. I love the last chapter: not a SINGLE mark of punctuation. Maybe that's nothing new but back in the beginning of the century it was Totally Radical! But with this said, the story itself is very boring, the philosophic allusions inpenetrable and the supposedly comic elements totally unfunny.But for its stylistic brilliance and Joyce's courage/genius, I give it 10 of 10."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"A classic by James Joyce. Enjoy it on your e-reader. Probably adults will be more inclined to enjoy reading it."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"Ulysses can be a tough read, but is very rewarding for those who plough through it. James Joyce writes, in this book in particular, in what I would call the literary equivalent of the impressionist style of painting. By this I mean he sometimes he uses words as if they're broad brush strokes meant to give you an impression of the events taking place as opposed to describing them in a literal sense. Once you get the hang of his writing style the book really takes off, describing, in a surreal way, the world that the main character lives in. There were some portions of the book where I was lost and didn't know what was going on, but I persevered and this ended up being a good read.If you're ready for a challenge, pick this up. If you're just looking for some casual reading you might want to find something more straightforward."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"Read it a long time ago, bult now I love having at hand, wherever I go, it takes a lifetime to really appreciate this classic"},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"Overall, better written than Portrait of an Artist, but nowhere near as entertaining. Basically, consider this as a brilliantly conceived book but with the most wholly unimaginative of plots. It's as intelligent as anything produced since Shakespeare, in other words -- but without all the life-giving drama. What it is is magnificent, in my opinion; but what it contains is insipid. Few people will actually enjoy reading this book, although it does have its moments. But mostly it's an impressive tower that in reality contains nothing much of importance. The most amazing construction possible in the center of which resides a pot of total rot.The narrative mainly follows two protagonists: Stephen Dedalus (from Portrait of the Artist, loosely based on Joyce himself) and \\"Leopold Bloom,\\" presented as Stephen's somewhat more reasonable counterpart, as they meander throughout the course of a single day in Dublin, Ireland, shortly after the first World War, although that fact has almost no bearing on the story.The \\"plot\\" (which is also much beside the point) centers around death: the recent death of Stephen's mother and the not-so-recent death of Bloom's infant son, Rudy. In the end, the two personalities come together in Bloom's home and a kind of a reconciliation is formed -- but again, this is all beside the point.The book appears to be James Joyce's attempt to completely reconstruct what the novelistic form can accomplish, and it reads as such. Terribly thin on plot, but thick on construction, like a house whose rooms are empty. The writing is interesting, particularly to individuals interested in the art of writing -- but the story of the day is quite simply boring as hell.The few good moments include Stephen's theories about what many consider to be Shakespeare's finest play -- Hamlet -- and Bloom's somewhat psycho-sexual encounter with a young girl later on in the evening.Distasteful passages frequently occur, where Joyce appears to take great pains toportray man as a whole as a sick, sadistic, filthy, and secretive animal; again, not really a joy to read through.The real problem here is story, not form. The form is magnificent. It can't be improved upon. But where is the story? What is particularly interesting here? That ultimately Stephen and Bloom forge a kind of friendship? That ultimately provided meaning, but I did not care. Will you?Portrait of the Artist has a developing character changing over time; Ulysses just has a single day, no matter how well written about it is. And so one is drama and the other exercise, and so one worth your time and the other not."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"Well, Ernest Hemingway thought that Ulysses was a \\"Goddam wonderful book\\" so who am I to disagree. And I don't. Thie is a very nice edition, well produced and has Odyssean titles to chapters in the Table of Contents, if not on the chapter headings. Yeah, well OK but I do like the definite chapter beginnings. As a reference text to Ulysses this is it - clear line numbers and pagination make for a universal communication device between devotees. I wish that mine was a hardback so I really could have a DEFINITIVE volume."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"I read this book twice, and it still stands out in my mind as the most creative use of English in the history of the language. Taking the plot of a classic work is not unique, the way it was executed in this book was. Ulysses doesn't explore any of the great secrets of life. It doesn't seek to take on some great social issue. It is just a great work of art. It is difficult to understand, but with such an ambitious work this is no surprise. Any fan of English literature needs to read this."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"I could not finish it. I made several attempts, but I could not.

I am very content!"},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"A couple of months ago I wrote a review (below) of a very specific edition of Ulysses (the Modern Library hardcover version) complaining that the relevant Amazon page contained descriptive material misidentifying which version of the text the book contained (an important matter in this case, as anyone familiar with the Ulysses Wars will recognize!). Now I realize that the problem with Amazon's description of books with multiple editions (like Ulysses) goes far deeper than I initially realized, as my review seems to have been attached by Amazon to all sorts of different versions of Ulysses, rather than just the page for the specific edition I had set out to review. In fact, you really cannot tell from the Amazon page for a book like Ulysses which version is being discussed. So, be warned that Amazon's modus operandi can create sheer confusion for works that are published in multiple (varying) editions!My original review of Modern Library edition:Amazon's current webpage description creates the misleading impression that this (Modern Library hardcover) is the text as \\"corrected' by Gabler in the 1980s. However, the cover of the book seems to be clear that this is in fact the 1961 verson of the text. Gabler's edition has some supporters but also some vehement critics. I would just suggest that those planning to invest in a copy of the book take at least a brief look at accounts of the controversy to decide which edition they might prefer. In any case, let's at least try to be clear about which is which!"},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"Brilliant book, a web of words encompassing centuries of literature and philosophy and its impasse on the overeducated lower middle class, a perfect allusion to a work of great literature (The Odyssey) that this book has matched well. Perhaps this is the first book to transcend the ability of what it has parodied. To those who have denied recommending it to someone of sixteen or seventeen, I had been upon this earth for a decade and a half when I came upon it, and just reread it one year later. Granted, you need a Latin dictionary and a good book of annotations to thoroughly understand it, but this book has made me realize just what a waste my public rural high school education was--Ulysses is literary heaven and hell and propagator of autodidacticism and eschews all principles of what has ever been said to create this century's magnum opus. I am exactly one-hundred years younger than James Joyce (and Stephen Daedalus), and on the sixteenth of June in 2004 I plan to! take the route of Leopold Bloom to vicariously relive it. One thing to be forewarned about: it is highly addictive. I have developed Ulysses codependency, as will anyone who gets through it. My head aches after reading it, for it is the best kind of masterpiece, the kind that attacks physically and intellectually at once. It is vulgar, carnal, and base (for its time, that is) and at once completely holy and pure because it has allowed the world to start over. Joyce is the avant-garde.

After all, I have taken the trouble to read the thing. Also, I have a bachelor's degree, and have taught High School English. I've also read an exegesis of Ulysses, and am currently reading Finnegans Wake, so I do have something in the way of qualifications. At heart, I account my opposing opinion to the fact that I believe that the standards that I use to judge the merits of a novel are different than those employed by the fellows at Random House. Further, I think that my criteria aren't necessarily all that bad.Indeed, I like to believe that my criteria are probably closer to what most people look for in a novel.The things that I look for in a novel include: an exciting plot; memorable, interesting characters; clean, crisp writing.The things that I believe the Random House voters look for in a novel include: intricate word play; obscure literary allusion/allegory; originality in form and syntax, even to the point of obfuscation.Ulysses certainly is a winner in the second category, as all eight hundred pages of it concern one man on one day in his life. Most of those pages are devoted to word play, literary allusions, experiments in literary form, etc. What Ulysses does not spend a lot of time on, however, is developing plot and character--the things I love in a good book. There is almost no clean, crisp writing to be found--Joyce's primary consideration was not to be understood; he wanted to be *clever*.For instance, take the \\"word overture.\\" At the beginning of the \\"Siren section,\\" (Ulysses is modeled after The Odyssey), Joyce mirrors the overture of a musical by running together out-of-context fragments and snatches of words from the chapter to come. He does this without preamble or explanation and reading it is a very confusing experience. But Joyce didn't write it with the intention of being clear--he had something artistic to say, or something experimental to try, or something like that. Please understand that this makes Joyce very, very different from most of the masters who preceeded him, such as Thomas Hardy, Leo Tolstoy, Charles Dickens, Victor Hugo, etc. They wrote in an effort to communicate themselves very clearly; Joyce wants to be difficult. They wanted to write interesting stories, Joyce wants something altogether different.For myself, I neither like Joyce's style nor his intentions. I honestly cannot figure out the point, other than cleverness for cleverness' sake. Further, I believe that his method, which has become the main literary aesthetic in schools (which is why they all concentrate so much on literary devices such as metaphor and allegory), has been detrimental to education. By turning literature from entertaining stories into puzzle solving, I believe he has turned many children away from reading. I think this helps to account for, say, J.K. Rowling's success. It's not that kids don't like to read, it's that they don't like to read things like Ulysses or similar efforts by Joyce's admirers.Many people reading this will likely disagree with me. They think that Joyce was a \\"genius.\\" That's fine--they're entitled to their opinions. But, I'm entitled to mine as well, and, in my opinion, Ulysses does not say nearly enough of importance to be worth all the trouble it is to decode, and in the end it is simply not a lot of fun. In my opinion, there are tons of other books that have just as much of value (if not more), and *also* have exciting plots, interesting characters and clear writing. Joyce was, perhaps, a genius at puzzle-writing and encoding, but Ulysses is a poor novel."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"Clearly a great book, and not just my opinion.

What I can offer is the viewpoint of an 'average' reader.My edition was the 1922 text, and it was prefaced by the original publisher with a simple disclaimer: \\"The publisher asks the reader's indulgence for typographical errors unavoidable in the exceptional circumstances.\\" And it certainly is understandable and necessary: the text is rife with punctuation, spelling and word issues - but it is nearly impossible to tell which are deliberate and which came courtesy of the type setter.The structure itself is almost more of a literary experiment than a novel. It switches presentations, from interior monologue to grandiose play to question and answers to stream of consciousness. At least that happens in sections, so the reader has some chance of keeping within the structure presented.I read that Joyce wanted someone to be able to recreate Dublin from the text of this book - that's probably a good way to describe the essence of it. While not every street is named, the character of the city through its inhabitants comes through (often more clearly than what the event does that he is writing about).It was a struggle to get through this book on my own, and I think I would have gotten a lot more out of it if read as part of a class or discussion group, particularly if there were participants with knowledge of Irish history and specifically Joyce's background. The failings however are more my own versus the text itself."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"At the end of one of \\"Ulysses\\" most unpleasantly challenging chapters, \\"Oxen Of The Sun,\\" Joyce throws out an offhand comment which might read as a sort of gauntlet to anyone who fancies him or herself as a capable reader: \\"Just you try it on.\\"People have been \\"trying on\\" \\"Ulysses\\" ever since, and if my experience is any indication, the result is an infuriating and intoxicating read, not always both at once however. Sometimes it's great, and sometimes it's terribly self-conscious and clever, serving no purpose except allowing self-aggrandizing deconstructionists and post-modernists a chance to strut their stuff and feel like they have something over the rest of us.I want to be clear in saying I regard \\"Ulysses\\" as a supreme example of craft and literary brilliance, but I don't think it is the great English-language novel, only maybe the most important. J.D. Wombacher said it very well in one of the earlier reviews: \\"My own view is that Ulysses is an example of a writer not doing his job.\\" If a writer's job is to create a novel in such a way as to let the reader in, this is not only a valid sentiment, but a boldly honest one.You start out thinking this isn't going to be as bad as every says. We watch an awkward young man named Stephen deal with his supersmug semi-friend and an annoying British interloper high atop the city of Dublin, in Martello Tower. Stephen is aware of the fact his \\"pal\\" Buck is really a bit of a user, and patronizing as hell, and in subtle, clever, and often funny ways, Joyce lets the reader see how. Then we watch poor Stephen alternately try to instruct a bunch of Anglo-Irish brats and deal with a supercilious headmaster, who fancies himself an expert on everything from livestock to why the sun will never set on the British empire.Then Stephen goes to the beach, and what follows in the third chapter, \\"Proteus,\\" is something that would make any good editor cry out for a rewrite. Joyce noted that his writing skills by the time he got to \\"Ulysses\\" were of such an advanced degree that he could do anything he wanted to with the English language, but there's ample evidence in the finished work that such absolute power can corrupt absolutely.At least Joyce seems to realize this, too, somewhat. He shifts the focus to another social outcast, a Jewish advertising salesman named Leo Bloom who busies himself with the stream of life around the fair city of Dublin so as to avoid going home, where he knows his fat wife is about to carry on an affair with a callow bounder.The results are some of the most affecting chapters ever written, each one slightly askew from the next, but forming a kind of whole that takes into account the whole history of literature, while advancing that history into unexplored territory with stream-of-consciousness narratives and multiple perspectives. Chapters like \\"Wandering Rocks,\\" \\"Sirens,\\" and especially \\"Cyclops\\" work on so many levels they make the head spin, and Joyce the humorist (he claimed one of his principal goals in writing \\"Ulysses\\" was to make the reader laugh) rivals Twain in his humanistic humorousness. Witness this sardonic exchange in \\"Cyclops,\\" my favorite chapter.\\"Dead?\\" says Alf. \\"He is no more dead than you are!\\"\\"Maybe so,\\" says Joe. \\"They took the liberty of burying him this morning anyhow.\\"But do we really need the mindgames of \\"Oxen Of The Sun,\\" or the play-form phantasmagoria of \\"Circe,\\" which lead us into blind alleys and throw enough red herrings to kill us with mercury poisoning? People say you need to read the Greek legend this all is based on, and I didn't, but I don't think I'm alone in finding this tangent strained. When Stephen finally ditches his false friend, he does so off-stage as it were, and it is never explained what transpired. Critics have their ideas why the connection between Stephen and Bloom, once made, is so vital, but it eluded me, even with all the supplemental reading I did.The end result is a writer writing essentially for himself, and for those who will play his games. That leaves out the rest of us.I'm glad I read this book, and hope God grants me the time to read it again someday. But don't believe the hype. Read \\"Ulysses,\\" but don't sweat what you don't get. Many of those who say they do \\"get\\" it are kidding themselves. Better to be honestly perplexed, and humbled by the experience. Humility has its virtues, and Joyce might have benefited from it more in writing this, creating a real masterpiece for the masses rather than an ivory tower to which only he held the key."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"There is not a book out there that is more frustrating than James Joyce's Ulysses...unless, of course, it is Joyce's Finnegan's Wake. The problem lies in the fact that this novel is such an amazing piece of art that the reader can feel like Joyce forgot all about him. It is almost impossible to read by oneself with it's seemingly garbled maze of words and phrases and madness. However, this is what makes it such a joy to read. Imagine that an author decided to do away with any and all rules concerning fiction and to write a book that was it's own entity, showing you what it wanted to show you, telling you what it wanted to tell you and acting like its own character. This is what Joyce has accomplished with Ulysses. I was fortunate enough to read this book in a class, four months of nothing but Ulysses, and I have to warn would be readers that I don't think I would have made it through without expert guidance. I would advise anyone wishing to tackle this literary giant to gather some book loving friends, and a guidebook or two for Ulysses, and to take it very slowly. Read a chapter a week and then meet up with you group to discuss and puzzle out what you have just read. I am willing to bet that your weekly conversations will be a greater work of art than any book out there, and I think that Joyce would have liked that, would have enjoyed sparking debates and conversation, its probably the main reason why anyone creates anything; for it to be enjoyed and shared. The story line is simple, you have two main characters, Stephen Dedalus, the brilliant but alienated loner. You have Leopold Bloom, a simple man who is as alienated as Stephen, but not for his mind, for his cultural background and meek manner. The entire book takes place over the course of one day in Dublin, and after the first three chapters the entire book simply follows Bloom around during a day when he knows that his wife is having a romantic meeting with her lover. It is hard to sum up such a giant book in a few sentences like this, but basically Bloom is trying to set his life back on track, trying to reconcile himself with his wife's betrayal, and trying to reach out to Stephen who he feels could use a loving family. Of course, you could read this book and not find any of what I am saying in there, but the beauty of Ulysses is that I would love to hear what it is that you found in this novel as much as I would love sharing what I found."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"There's probably not much about Ulysses that hasn't already been said, but having just spent well over a month of my free time struggling through this book I thought I would put my two cents in.In my opinion, Judge John M. Woolsey's synopsis in his 1933 ruling on the work's obscenity charge sums up the book almost perfectly. It is indeed an astonishing achievement and a literary tour de force. It is, as he says, by turns brilliant and dull, intelligible and obscure. And of course it is unprecedented in its exceptionally honest treatment of sexuality.I really can't agree with his contention, however, that every word of the book is purposeful in its contribution to the whole. In some ways, particularly the incredible realism of its characters' interior monologues and its ability to make a particular place and time come alive for the reader, Ulysses is perhaps the most well-written novel I've ever read. In other ways, namely Joyce's frequent inability to resist showing off his erudition and mastery of language, it is one of the worst and often cries out for editing. While there's not a word of Hades, Wandering Rocks or Penelope I would change, some other chapters (e.g., Cyclops, Oxen of the Sun, and Ithaca) become downright tedious despite their conceptual ingenuity and flashes of brilliance. Additionally, the book is sometimes cloyingly self-referential, plausibility too often bows to symbolism, and many of Joyce's allusions are so esoteric or ambiguous that they can only serve to distract the reader. While it has faults (and despite the book's deification in literary circles, I can't see any other way to characterize many of its quirks and stylistic excesses), Ulysses is nonetheless well worth the exceptional effort required to read it due to its penetrating and poignant illumination of human desires, delusions and relationships. As an added plus, at many points it is nothing less than hilarious.Personally I found it very helpful to listen to a recording of the text on audio to get through the book (the version narrated by Donal Donnelly and Miriam Healy-Louie published by Classics on Cassette is extremely well done), as twice previously I had attempted to read it without such support and couldn't get beyond six or seven chapters. I would also suggest having at hand an unabridged dictionary, a book of scholarly annotations, and especially Harry Brimes' Bloomsday book for those passages where, despite your best efforts, you still can't figure out what the heck is going on (occasionally Brimes can't either).Four stars may seem niggardly for a masterpiece, but I'm comparing it with King Lear and The Brothers Karamazov. If you're an Irish Catholic literary scholar with doctorates in western religion and etymology and an upcoming sabbatical, by all means add half a star."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"On June 16th, 1904, a young James Joyce met his future wife for the first time. Ten years later, in 1914, he began what would become one of the greatest epics of modern language, Ulysses, setting the entirety of the events within that one special day shared by him and his wife, offering it to the world in an alternately joyous and tragic, comical and dense tribute to life and to living.The story cannot be summarised without reciting the book itself, an exercise that goes beyond the scope of this review. Suffice to say that the novel follows Leopold Bloom as he makes his way about Dublin, and Stephen Dedalus as he wanders from place to place. The two eventually meet, and the book finishes. Then again, that description is like saying Moby Dick is about a whale and Gravity's Rainbow is about a rocket. Technically true, but how much detail and texture do you miss with such a soul-less description?Ulysses has since grown beyond itself, garnering a reputation that scares away most readers. Considered an 'ivory tower' book, a 'professor's dream', it should be admitted that there are very difficult sections. Whole chapters - most of which are quite long - can be extremely tedious to read, becoming bogged down in medical or legal terms which serve mostly to confuse and distract the reader. But then there are chapters of amazing insight, clarity, wisdom and skill - thankfully more than there are difficult. The Cyclops chapter is sheer genius, a 120-page play that moves from bizarre to hilarious to sublime and back again. By itself, it is almost worth the price of admission, but there are many more that are just as amazing. The question and answer chapter of Ithaca is sheer genius, and Molly's monologue, right at the end, while texturally dense, flows and runs like a river.The language used ranges from flowery to technical to simplistic to overly complicated to deliberately obscure to beautiful. 'Wavewhite wedded words shimmering on the dim tide' is beautiful, whereas 'What selfinvolved enigma did Bloom risen, going, gathering multicoloured multiform multitudinous garments, voluntarily apprehending, not comprehend?' is difficult. Of course, there is always the famous 'The heaventree of stars hung with humid nightblue fruit', quite possibly one of the most gorgeous sentences written by man.Another interesting technique Joyce uses is his willingness to deny the luxury of perfect sentence structure or grammar to better convey the mood of the characters, or to greater achieve those wonderful sentences. He merges words, removes words, adds words, mirrors sentences within themselves, juxtaposes letters, words, paragraphs, all in an effort to create passages of absolute delight. Tens of pages will fly by, each one filled with wit, insight, beauty, depth. At times, it is safer to simply let go and trust that Joyce knows what he is doing, that you will be taken where you should go.However. This book can be very difficult, as I said above. Fifty pages of dense, verbose prose with little to no indication of what is happening, who it is happening to, or what sort of reference can be applied so as to make sense of it in the greater scheme of the novel, is common. These parts can be tricky to get through, but I strongly advise you to continue. Happily, the first few chapters are very easy, and very beautiful. It is only around the 210 page mark that Joyce ramps up the difficulty, which culminates in the Wandering Rocks and Siren chapters. But bear with it, and enjoy it for what it is.In the end - and I hope I have made this clear - the novel is a difficult one, requiring a lengthy time commitment, but in the end, the efforts are more than rewarded. Having just turned the last page, closed the book and put it aside, I am itching to take it up again, to follow Bloom and Dedalus once more through their beautiful, wonderful day."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"I bought theUlysses (Gabler Edition)edition of this book recently as we were reading Ulysses as part of an online book club. The advantage of that edition is that it is popular edition and also has line numberings so that as part of a group you can immediately locate a piece of text.Then I discovered that you could get a free Kindle edition, so I downloaded the free Kindle for computer app from Amazon, and got this edition. Later I bought a Kindle.I am somewhat surprised at the one star reviews of a free product, the leading one of which is based on a flawed premise, lack of comparison to an actual published text.This reviewer does not compare the Kindle text with an actual book. She bases her one star review on a google line search, finding inconsistencies and saysUlysses Annotated: Notes for James Joyce's Ulysses [Revised and Expanded Edition] is different. Ulysses annotated is not Ulysses the book, it is a reference book about Ulysse, and if you imagine it, it operates like a phrase dictionary and explains the references and allusions in the book, but it is not the book. She bases her one star review on a google line search, not a direct comparison with an actual copy of the book, and comparison with an entirely different book. Really?I have compared this with the Gabler and picked 20 lines at random from the book, and then searched the Kindle edition, and read the surrounding passages. Except for one case in the Gabler edition which has musical notation and lyrics to a song the text was 100% the same.Obviously, there will be inconsistencies between versions of a book that has many editions. That does not mean that just because this edition is free and has minor inconsistencies it is worse than other editions. Nor does it mean that large amounts of text have been deleted because it's free. No, it's based on an actual text. In fact Joyce edited and added bits and pieces to the text over the years much to the chagrin and frustration of his publishers, so you can expect minor variations between editions, yet they may be 95-99% similar.In fact, there are certain advantages to having the Kindle edition. If you have ever read a book and you are trying to remember something about a character, you can type in the characters name, and you will immediately get all the references in the book. If there is a word you do not understand fully, by pressing a button you can immediately get the full meaning of the word. You can check for popular highlights, and it willl tell you how many people have highlighted which passage. For example \\"Ineluctable modality of the visible.\\"There are certain passages that no dictionary will help you with, and that is why you may need a companion book, such as Ulysses annotated, which explains the many allusions, whether to Latin, parallels with the Bible, with the Odyssey which this story loosely parallels, to Latin, British Rule, historical context, local maps, Hamlet, mythical search for the missing father, Shakespeare and the Bible.The further you get into this book the better it gets.At once this book is inpiring yet challenging, sometimes perplexing yet ultimately rewarding. Full of inventive wordplay that sometimes defies instant comprehension. I have read entire pages that turn out to be word salad at first. Every chapter has a different narrative style, such as inner monologue, narcissistic, catechism, stream of consciousness. Sometimes this book is brutal to read, sometimes a joy. I can understand why this book is so influential, and the words nibble at the edge of your consciousness forcing your mind to expand itself. This book has changed the way I think about writing, as I have never seen som many different narrative devices used in a single book before. The final chapter with Molly Bloom in bed, with its runon sentences is simply hilarious.I encourage you to get this edition. Why not? It's free. Free to buy. Free to read. Free to enjoy. The Kindle format gives you advantages over people who have read it in the past, and offers interesting, new, and quicker ways of navigating the text.And you can go get free online chapter summaries of chapters to speed your comprehension.I hope you found this review helpful."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"Looking at the sample chapters of the 99c MobileReference edition, I notice an entire missing paragraph (after \\"and chanted:\\").

They bring the book alive and impart a level of clarity and coherent understanding that offsets the reader's tendency to get bogged down in details. No matter where you are coming from in relation to Ulysses, this reading will dramatically increase your appreciation for it."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"If you approach Joyce's Ulysses looking to be told a story worthy of the Modern Library's #1 book of the 20th Century, then you will most likely be disappointed. But if you throw aside your expectations of what makes a book great and just read the words as you would the people, places, sights and sounds that trigger your thoughts during the course of a normal day, then you will be amazed.In Ulysses, James Joyce uses his superhuman vocabulary and literary knowledge to relate a day in the life of a couple Irishmen (Stephen Dedalus and his friend, Leopold Bloom) and the people with whom they interact. Joyce's words are abnormally sophisticated, yet one never gets the feeling he is simply showing off. While his writing style is often referred to as stream-of-consciousness, it is clear that every word is appropriately placed and deeply thought out. As Ulysses meanders along through its day, the objects that enter the periphery of the protagonists triggers emotions and thoughts that lead to: poems, songs, theological and political discussions, laughing, shouting, incoherent noises, etc. The novel ranges from sublime to aggravating, but that is only because it is so true to its form. How many times in a normal day, if we were to stop and ruminate upon what we were just thinking, would we then think, &quot;What was that?&quot; But then it's quickly on to the next interaction destined to spark different emotions, thoughts, ideas, etc...It is impossible to sum this book up. It follows no plot or pattern other than that it is simply 1 day. A few people... 1 day.Reading this book reminded me at times of the Simpsons episode where Homer is seen watching an episode of David Lynch's Twin Peaks. &quot;Brilliant!&quot; Homer remarks, but then quietly to himself, &quot;I have no idea what is going on here.&quot; While I often found myself in Homer's predicament while reading Ulysses, I was always able to appreciate Joyce's writing, even if the individual words were all I understood. For that reason, I plan on reading this book again several years from now to see what life has taught me that might expand my understanding of Joyce's beautiful day."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"Typical straight-from-Project-Gutenberg textfile conversion: no ToC, no italics, no chapter breaks.

It is highly praised by some, and it is loathed by others. In this case there can be no middle road. If you like a good, gripping story, then this is not your cup of tea. If you like literature for the sake of fine language, then you are on the right track. Joyce is not out to make the journey through this book easy, in that respect one may get the idea that the story of Ulysses is really the story of the reader's struggle through the book. But there are much riches to be found in it. Perseverance is the key. A reviewer here thinks the GertyMcDowell part to be the best, indeed it is the most readable chapter in the book because it is a parody of cheap 'women's' literature. The other chapters have their own strengths, and it is not unimaginable that each reader will have his or her own favorite chapter (for example, Molly Bloom's incredible soliloquy at the end of the book, or the eerie 'play'-chapter). Go click and buy this work of art, try it, and if you hate it, put it away and return to it in a few years. You may find you savor it then."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"I not only read this book, I was taught it. It was the subject of my thesis at Berkeley. However, I would not presume to know a great deal about it. I think I will learn even more the next time I read it.Is it the greatest novel ever? Big question. I haven't read every novel, so I can't say. It's the best novel I have ever read.The novel is much deeper than most people believe. I would think to read it on the surface level only would be pretty boring, except for the lyrical style. But the real brilliance lies in his intertwining several allegorical levels with the action (if it can be called that). Too complicated to go into.Suffice it to say this book is about Everything! and Everyone! The universe contained in one ordinary man in one ordinary city on one ordinary day. We are all warriors and adventurers while at the same time stepped on by cowards and beat up by triviality. We are Leopold Bloom. Didn't you know?Apart from the mind bending, headache inducing allegory, what sets Joyce apart from other twentieth century novelists is the way he makes the English language into music. Joyce truly exhibits the shear beauty of words, creating nothing less than a symphony filled with harmony, dissonance, rythym and syncopation, noise, peace, passion, hopelessness, beauty, and terror that you can hear if you listen and if you let your mind let the words pierce that well disguised wall of cynicism.It's a romantic adventure about the best and the worst in all of us.Helps if you read it with the New Bloomsday Book. Hard to make it through it without it."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"I was inspired to give ULYSSES another try after reading Bartholomew Gill'sDEATH OF A JOYCE SCHOLAR, a detective story whose plot is closely tied to Joyce's great novel. One of Gill's characters gives the advice to let the words flow like music, over you and through you, and not to get hung up in the details. Good advice, I found. If read quickly in this way, ULYSSES is more mesmerizing than it mystifies, and constantly exhilarating despite its occasional tendency to exasperate. I fully expect that a second reading will require a full summer rather than a mere week, and demand the use of a dictionary, a map, and a detailed reader's guide, but a first pass without any of these can still bring enormous pleasure.I did find it almost impossible, however, to read for plot. Although the events in ULYSSES are rather simple and are confined to a single day (Thursday, June 16, 1904), so much is told in flashback or in the imagination that it becomes hard to separate the various strands. I found it helpful to refer to the online Cliff Notes after reading each chapter just to confirm what I thought had happened. And, in real terms, nothing much does. Two men, the young intellectual Stephen Dedalus (Joyce's alter ego fromPORTRAIT OF THE ARTIST AS A YOUNG MAN) and the fortyish Jewish salesman Leopold Bloom, wake up, leave the house, wander around Dublin for most of the day, crossing paths occasionally, only to come together towards the end of the book and part again before the story ends in the small hours of the following morning. But the plot is only one of several threads that Joyce uses to organize a novel that contains as much of life as he can cram into it; among the other devices that shape the book are parallels with the ODYSSEY, the geography of Dublin, an almost Freudian penetration into the psyche of his characters, an ever-deepening humanity, and a large-scale structural organization akin to the movements and thematic connections within a piece of music.Joyce's language is musical too, and should probably be heard rather than read. His set-pieces -- such as Molly Bloom's famous erotic soliloquy in the Penelope chapter [18] that closes the book, Leopold Bloom's parallel fantasy at the end of Nausicaa [13], the Viceregal procession at the end of Wandering Rocks [10], or the numerous passages of Homeric invocation that punctuate Cyclops [12] -- show his magical ability to weave a spell with words and his exuberant delight in doing so. But there is no single Joycean style; one of the joys of ULYSSES is that each chapter introduces a distinct style of its own. The classical passages in Cyclops [12] are answered by long early-British sections in Oxen of the Sun [14] in which no latinate words are used whatsoever. The intellectual legerdemain of some of the Stephen Dedalus chapters is balanced by the down-to-earth barroom conversations of Leopold Bloom's friends. At different times, Joyce uses the language of magazine stories, the Catholic Church, political rhetoric, or scholastic debate. He includes densely-argued prose, free verse, snippets in six or seven languages (ULYSSES is not merely Irish but cosmopolitan), quotations from opera and street songs, and even two pages of musical notation! Wandering Rocks [10] is composed of brief fragments, like verbal snapshots of Dublin at a particular moment. Ithaca [17] is cast in the form of a catechism that addresses subjective emotional issues with the detailed objectivity of scientific analysis. Circe [15], the longest chapter of all, is a masochistic nightmare written in the form of a play script, or rather a movie scenario years ahead of its time.More than anything else, I found myself reading ULYSSES for the sheer delight of its many styles, and hugely enjoying even those parts that I didn't understand. There are many more treasures to be found in the book, I am sure, but this was more than enough for a start!"},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"The reader of Ulysses is forced to continually reassert his perspective and understanding of point of view when reading the text. The narrative frequently shifts in perspective between Stephen, Bloom, the citizens of Dublin and a faceless narrator operating on levels internal and external. Language is used directly in speech and substantiation, as well as symbolically in mental thought and acquires transcendental meaning in grammatical and spelling reconfiguration.Stephen's typological character is self-defined in Telemachus as that of a servant. As he explains to Haines, \\"I am the servant of two masters... the imperial British state... and the holy Roman catholic and apostolic church.\\" Whether this servitude is literal or self-inflicted, we do not know. We know from Mulligan's remonstrations of Stephen's actions at his dying mother's bedside that Stephen has struggled with the Catholic faith. We know from Haines' knowledge of Gaelic over the milkwoman's that there is a level of intellectual and political dominance in place. We also know this from Haines' self admission, \\"We feel in England that we have treated you rather unfairly. It seems history is to blame.\\" This is exactly a point where a reading of Ulysses accompanied by a fair knowledge of the political relationship of England to Ireland and an understanding of the rise of Nationalism during the time in which the novel was placed could add a good deal of understanding to the depths of the characters relations. This will continue to be the case throughout the novel as there are countless allusions to the history of the church and Ireland. There are frequent references by Stephen of historical heroes such as Pyrrhhus, Moses and Parnell who were frustrated while trying to lead a certain people out of bondage. The purpose of these references culminates in the important discussion between Stephen and Bloom toward the end of Ithica about Moses Maimonides and the chanting of the 113th psalm which celebrates the escape of the children of Israel from Egypt. These historic and theological references are important counterpoints to Stephen who in Telemachus declares himself not to be a hero. Though the narrative of the first few chapters can be followed fairly consistently without historic knowledge of this kind, in the later chapters the narrative will cease to make much sense when references are cited and counterpoised to create specific intellectual and sociological meanings in the lives of the characters. Once a fact or idea is raised it will surely resurface at a later time in the thoughts of a character and will be mulled over ad infinitum. It is the discourse of the narrative that gives the best illumination into the classification of characters.Not only does Joyce span the forms of narrative from dialogue to subconscious hallucination, but also he twists the structure of language and words themselves to reassign meaning to language tools whose original purpose was to have a definitive meaning. Consider the final functional unit of the novel. Molly begins her soliloquy with the internal declaration, \\"Yes because he never did a thing like that before as ask to get his breakfast in bed.\\" The entire soliloquy could be labeled as the indicial knowledge which feeds into the question: will Molly bring Bloom's breakfast to their bed in the morning? However, in the course of this long final narrative the question is eclipsed by the question: will Molly continue to be unfaithful to Bloom? Directly after this is established, it is tempting to speculate about the meaning of the narrative rather than cling to the rules of understanding its structure. Before this point in the narrative we have only had a very short encounter with Molly. The most we have gathered about her character is that of an object of desire. This image is both reinforced and destroyed by her final soliloquy. The answer concerning the original question of breakfast appears to be in the positive as Molly has expressed disappointment in her lover and a remembered passion of her vow to Bloom. This speculation gives a more refined meaning to the narrative as a whole implying a cyclical nature to Dublin life. Molly will bring Bloom his breakfast and he will leave on another journey throughout Dublin leaving her to remain in the bedchamber as an image in the lascivious imagination of the world. This seems to be the consensus of overall criticism of Ulysses. But, as it seems the day of Ulysses was the first day Molly had an affair, this suggests daily life isn't as static as it might first appear and people have the propensity to break from their assigned roles. This is especially true as with Stephen, whose role was to find a father figure or a \\"home\\" in the novel, but Stephen leaves him/it when the discovery is made. Creating final and definitive answers to Ulysses meaning is impossible and we should remain aware of this in conjunction with our methods of reading."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"This is the second time I've read &quot;Ulysses&quot;. It is a 'hard read' even for me, a good reader; my consistant criticism against Joyce is that he intentionally works to hide his arguments, his characters, and his thematic material behind a mind-boggling wall of style in &quot;Ulysses&quot; and &quot;Finnegan's Wake&quot;, though his earlier works are quite approachable.Too bad. The book is actually quite deeply human, and funny as hell. Bloom is a decent, bungling 'hero', a human like all of us. He's got his strengths, his weaknesses. I see him wandering flat footed in his black slacks like Charlie Chaplin through the crazy, jangling streets of Dublin. The night-town scene is a burlesque with a keenly penetrating, humanistic mind firmly at the helm. The barroom brawl a riot, especially with the dual narrators; the uneducated clod of low intelligence, and the archaic, mythic intonations of the blabber mouthed rhetoritician.He muses on the wonder of existance; how we, living, dead breaths breath. How man and woman come together, making love and making babies. How, ultimately, we are all connected, umbilically to the past through our connections with the Tribe of Man.&quot;God loves everybody,&quot; says the comic, absurd voice in the barroom scene. It is funny. We grin, chuckle at the absurd voice. But it is true. It is Joyce's central theme.Unfortunately, what he's mostly done is kept a ton of scholars busy writing 'commentaries' for a book that is revelant, all too human, and funny as hell... Perhaps even more hillarious than &quot;Catch-22&quot;... but that's debatable.I give it five stars because I happen, through the graces of a good education, to be able to understand it. It is towering and complex. If you're willing to work, go for it. It will take you some time; took me two solid weeks of work. Still, when you're through, there's a sense of mental satisfaction. You feel like you've solved a great logic puzzle. However, don't just read it for themes; try to recreate the scenes and dialog in your mind. This isn't easy, granted. Joyce's style makes it tough.. but do! The rewards are immeasurable. Once you see these characters as real, solid characters, not as abstractions, the lights begin to shine, and you understand how Joyce sees the mythic/ religious shining through our chaotic, jumble of the modern world."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"This book is five or six times the length of most novels, has an army of minor characters to keep up with, and contains a vocabulary that makes prudent keeping handy a good, unabridged English dictionary. (Never mind the German, Italian, French, Gaelic, Yiddish, etc., or the allusions to classical or Irish mythology.) A damned difficult book, it's true. But it captivated me. ULYSSES is by turns crude and sensitive, lyrical and blunt, funny and sad. During Bloomsday, the people of Joyce's universe eat, ogle women, defecate, bet on horses, worry, work, make love, lift their petticoats and wiggle their behinds, attend funerals, beg, give alms, pray, blaspheme and discuss every subject worth breath from the disposition of Shakespeare's second-best bed to God being a shout in the street to sex in all its manifestations. Yes! O yes! I have never seen anything so rich with the texture and feel and vivid details of life. Add to that Joyce's use of stream of consciousness and interior monologue to draw the reader into the tale with the characters (something no novelist before Joyce, not even Henry James, could pull off) as well as blindingly beautiful stretches of sheer poetry and you are looking at magic. Read this. Truly beautiful things can be as difficult as they are rare."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"Definitely buy this Jim Norton version. Do not get the Donal Donnelly version that one reviewer recommends -- I followed his advice and it was a huge mistake, now I am purchasing the Norton version. The Donal version is haltingly slow with disruptive pauses between each word, even in dialogue. It's so bothersome -- the reading is like a 3rd grader would read. This Jim Norton version runs over 27 hours, but the Donal Donnelly version runs over 40 hours -- the extra time? It's spent in awkward pauses that break the flow of the language and the dialogue -- you totally lose the beauty of Joyce. Don't make the costly mistake that I made -- buy the right one the first time. Now that I have this Norton version, I can happily sail through Ulysses and appreciate Joyce's supreme writing. If you really want to get through this novel, the audio is a tremendous help to play along with you as you read."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"&quot;Stately, plump Buck Mulligan came from the stairhead, bearing a bowl of lather on which a mirror and a razor lay crossed.&quot; &quot;Ulysses&quot; begins with an easily understood sentence, identifiable actions and objects, and little of the puns, ambiguities (well, except for what word &quot;stately&quot; modifies) and symbols (ok, maybe the cross on the bowl of lather) for which Joyce is read, and, perhaps just as often, not read.I think it's well worth reading; in fact, it's probably my favorite book (so far), one to which I return often. I think the key to enjoying--rather than just finishing--the book is that it can be read on many levels. One can choose to decode every historical, literary, and religious allusion, the staggering play of words, and sometimes barely comprehensible inner dialogue. I recommend decoding these selectively--they do add meaning and humor--but to also read this as a kind of tone poem, in which language itself is celebrated and elaborated, with passages of great humor and sympathy. A non-slavish interpretation of the book, enables one to laugh (out loud, even) at the rich humor, to identify with the struggles of every-person Leopold Bloom, and to savor, Zen-like, the sound soup without total comprehension. In addition to Joyce's mastery and subversion of the language, there are larger issues: A liberal critique of ethnocentrism, nationalism, dogmatism, and vanity. Criticized by some as degrading the human spirit (see Jeffrey Segall's &quot;Joyce in America&quot; for a very good review of critical reactions), it is really a celebration of it, finding dignity and soul in the flaws and triumphs of the &quot;common&quot; person.I can also recommend some books to negotiate the complexities of the book, especially &quot;Ulysses Annotated&quot; (by Don Gifford with Robert J. Seidman), &quot;The Ulysses Guide&quot; (Nicholson), &quot;James Joyce: A to Z&quot; (Fargnoli and Gillespie), and &quot;Ulysses, Portals of Discovery&quot; (McCarthy). (All of these available at Amazon.) While I kept the Gifford and Seidman book handy, and think it enhanced my appreciation of &quot;Ulysses,&quot;it is definitely not necessary to solve every allusion and ambiguity. In fact, appreciation of ambiguity is just one of the book's many facets. Just embrace and enjoy &quot;Ulysses&quot;; it is one of the funniest and wisest books you'll read."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"Okay, this is clearly the most thought out book I have ever read. You go through it, and you pick out any part and say, why must he be so wordy about two people getting a guinness, but you realize that he is putting all the mythical overload into trivial events, and that while it is absurd, it is true. If you can read this book in a class, that would be best, but at least be sure to have a complete guide so that you can get some of the allusions. You don't need to catch EVERYthing. It is very show-offy, a bit like Joyce is trying to just pack every single piece of information he's ever picked up into this novel (or whatever you'd like to call it, I think it is a novel, though). This can be annoying, but it is amazing.

I doubt James Joyce would like his books as ebooks. Any more than Shakespeare, Ovid, Milton, Boethius, Sartre, Shelley, Kazantzakis or Tobias would. It's not an appropriate fit. These authors transcended the instantaneous, the inelegance of electricity. They wrote by candle-light, just as Nureyev danced by candlelight."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"I was tempted to write this review after reading the other reviews.

It puts me in mind of someone going to an art gallery full of atrocious modern art and faking that they liked it to show how sophisticated they are. The truth is this book stinks.For one thing it is vulgar, which, I hate to disappoint anyone, requires no talent at all. This is a talent any six year-old boy possesses. Is the wordplay clever?

One of my English teachers once told me that if a book did not capture your imagination within the first 50 pages, it would be wise to put the book down. Well, I gave this book 225 pages, and I thought that it was once of the most boring and esoteric books I have ever come across. I first read -A Portriat of the Artist as a Young Man-, which I thought was quite good. I came in with high hopes for -Ulysses-, but was very let down. I found myself not only getting lost with the pages and pages of thoughts Joyce presents us with, but also with some of the dialogue, when all the characters rample on about someone speaking Irish. I have no doubt that Joyce was a genious, his books are filled with game show like trivia. However, I think for a book to be considered a \\"Classic,\\" or, \\"one that should be read by everyone,\\" then that book should not have to be refered to as a \\"Project,\\" nor should it take people a year to read, as some of the other on-line reviewers have said it took them.

Read an entertaining author. No wonder Americans don't read more often, the trash that people &quot;in the know&quot; tell them is a classic is as boring as driving across Kansas at 10 mph!This book was deemed to obscene for the US when it was first written. The obscenity seems mild today but maybe they were just placating Joyce's ego by telling him it was too obscene instead of allowing unknowing Americans to waste many hours that they can never have back reading his rambling and self-glorifying pile of dung he considered his crowning achievement.Pass on this one!

In this book, they solve the problem by having page numbers from the first edition in the margins across from that page's original bottom line. Still, there are several editions of this book (and countless other books) where the pagination does not match up. This can be terribly annoying if you are in an English / literature class and everyone has a different edition of the book. Someone says &quot;turn to page 37&quot;, and every page 37 is different. I think when the book publishers want to issue a new edition, they should copy the pages from an old edition using the photo-offset process. This is my personal pet peeve and probably has nothing at all to do with the actual novel by Joyce, but I can't really speak on that issue because I haven't read the book yet.

No kidding it's really that long.They say when the millenium comes we may need to stock up on necessities like toilet paper, well if you run out, I would recommend this book - not cause it's bad or anything (I wouldn't know I didn't read it) - but you would definitely not run out of paper for a real long time.

Joyce shows here that to get the technique down right you need more than technique, even more than a command of the English language, you need a good viewpoint. And Ulysses has many, from Bloom to his wife Molly to Dedalus, every person is detailed through their thoughts and words with enough dimension to make you wonder if this is a novel or a true account. Is it difficult to read? Yup. Most parts you can at least figure out what's going on but some, like the play section toward the middle, at times makes absolutely no sense (and what is up with that, is it a dream or something), but some parts that you think would be impossible, like the massive sequence at the end with Molly not only is nearly compulsively readable but quite beautiful at the same time. It's weird to say this but at times I wanted the book to be longer. Simply put, one of, if not THE greatest novel ever to come out of the English language (though I'm a Pynchon fan first . . . sorry), one of those few novels that everyone should at least attempt, if only to immerse yourself in the complexity of the language."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"When I first read Ulysses as an Eng.Lit. student in the 1960's, I knew I had to become a creative writer. Ulysses is my vade-mecum. When I am having problems writing a novel, or am dissatisfied with reviews, I turn to Joyce's masterpiece and gain fresh hope and inspiration. This is the book to beat all books - the Book of books. I never work on Bloomsday: I go down to Davy Byrnes public house in the centre of Dublin and order what Leopold had.

His command of the language is masterful and like the truly great writers, the English language is better for his use of it. His experimentation with stream of consciousness in the opening of the century profoundly shaped the literature that followed. Joyce will be remembered as one of the greatest writers ever to have lived: his writing is true virtuosity in both form and substance. He ranks with Homer, Chaucer, Shakespeare, Milton and Tolstoy. It may help to read this work with guidance by a teacher or professor. If that's not possible, after reading it in college and more recently, I recommend that you read it chapter for chapter with Homer's Odyssey or with a guidebook like Stuart Gilbert's James Joyce's Ulysses: otherwise, the intricate structure of the work may be lost. Bloom is 20th century man: to understand him is to peer into the inner depths of one's own being. Ulysses is magnificent. I stand in awe of this work. I am humbled by it. A more gifted literary genius may never have walked the planet and may never inhabit it, again."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"This novel was OK, but I didn't feel like it was speaking to me.

I understood about 30% of it. Was it worth it?Yes:1. The inner-monologue technique really opened up for me on a second reading, and you realise how close to reality Joyce's representation of inner thought is.2. The main character is kind of interesting. A bumbling middle-aged man with lots of curiosity for life and sensitivity to others who is subjected to a range of humiliations throughout the day, from the small (being ignored as he says hello) to the highly disturbing (his wife sleeping with another man in their bed). The interesting part is how Bloom deals with these humiliations. Not angry, and not self-consciously depressed - he just continues on with his day and his thoughts, but you sense that these experiences have changed him in some way.3. There is plenty of interesting commentary on Catholic theology, literary theory, and some of Ireland's history around 1900. If you don't find those subjects interesting, much of this book will bore you.No:1. There is no \\"story\\". No drama, no build up of suspense, no climax, no resolution. The focus is not on a plot, it is directly on the characters, and to a less interesting extent on the language. Entertainment is hard to come by, unless you are satisfied by faintly humourous banter.2. Quite a few of the episodes are very self-indulgent. Joyce was a Modernist, so he was trying to play with forms of representation. One of the episodes is written entirely in the form of a song. Good luck making sense of it.Overall:The book is not worth reading in toto. But parts of it are. If you want to read the best of the novel, just read the Calypso, Hades, Cyclops, Nausicaa and Penelope episodes. That's about 300 pages, and quite worth the effort. You can read summaries of the rest of the novel from one of the many sites on the net.P.S. I leave out the episodes featuring Stephen Dedalus because his character is just a regurgitation of all the philosophers he has read.

The major obscenity, which should never have been permitted by the USA legal system, the marketplace for literature, or the fawning academic community, was the publication of this duplicitous enigma. Many scholars have devoted their careers to explaining its content, but its raison d'tre and current status are still a complete mystery to me.Psychological Profiling: Joyce/BloomFrom \\"stately, plump\\" Buck Mulligan's entrance on the first page to Molly Bloom's memories of her first lover 20+ hours and 600+ pages later, the unifying constancy is: This is not a \\"reader-friendly\\" work. For example, check out Wikipedia's content descriptors for major sections:* (Episode 3, Proteus) \\"Stephen reminisces and ponders ... This chapter is characterized by a stream of consciousness narrative style that changes focus wildly. Stephen's education is reflected in the many obscure references and foreign phrases employed in this episode.\\" [NB: When Stephen thinks or talks, it is often in Latin, French, or Italian - with no translation for the reader.]* (Episode 7, Aeolus) \\"This episode ... is characterized by an abundance of rhetorical figures and devices.\\"* (Episode 12, Cycolops) \\"This chapter is marked by extended tangents made outside the voice of the unnamed narrator: hyperboles of legal jargon, Biblical passages, Irish mythology, etc.\\"* (Episode 14, Oxen of the Sun) \\"This chapter is remarkable for Joyce's wordplay, which seems to recapitulate the entire history of the English language. After a short incantation, the episode starts with latinate prose, Anglo-Saxon alliteration, and moves on through parodies of, among others, Malory, the King James Bible, Bunyan, Defoe, Sterne, Walpole, Gibbon, Dickens, and Carlyle, before concluding in a haze of nearly incomprehensible slang.\\"* (Episode 15, Circe) \\"The plot is frequently interrupted by \`hallucinations' experienced by Stephen and Bloom - fantastic manifestations of the fears and passions of the two characters.\\"* (Episode 16, Eumaeus) \\"The rambling and labored style of the narrative in this episode reflects the nervous exhaustion and confusion of the two protagonists.)* (Episode 17, Ithaca) \\"The style is that of a scientific inquiry ... The deep descriptions range from questions of astronomy to the trajectory of urination.\\"* Episode 18, Penelope) \\"The final episode ... also uses the stream of consciousness technique ... consists of Molly Bloom's Soliloquy: ... she recalls ... wishes ... imagines ... wonders ... senses ... fantasizes ... remembers ...\\"So what's the take-away from this painful experience? For me it was the state of James Joyce's mental health as he wrote Ulysses.ConsubstantialityHere I treat James Joyce and Leopold (Poly) Bloom as one. I will let Stephen Dedalus, a central character, make the argument for me. Early on Stephen makes the argument that Christ and God the Father are one:* \\"... the consubstantiality of the Son with the Father ... Sabellius who held that the Father was Himself His own Son.\\" (p. 22)* \\"... the son consubstantial with the father. ... He Who Himself begot middler the Holy Ghost and Himself sent Himself, Agenbuyer, between Himself and Others, Who, put upon by His fiends, stripped and whipped, was nailed like bat to barndoor, starved on crosstree, Who let Him bury, stood up, harrowed hell, fared into heaven and there these nineteen hundred years sitteth on the right hand of His Own Self but yet shall come in the latter day to doom the quick and the dead when all the quick shall be dead already.\\" (pp. 179-180)Having made the spiritual argument, Stephen then extrapolates to the relationship between Shakespeare (\\"After God Shakespeare has created most.\\" p. 193) and Hamlet contending that (a) Shakespeare begot Hamlet, and (b) Shakespeare and Hamlet are one.So here I accept the Joyce/Dedalus argument that the Father and Son are one and that Shakespeare and Hamlet are one and conclude that he is telling us that he and Bloom are one.Psychological Profile: Bloom/JoyceGiven the manner in which Ulysses is written, it is difficult to identify passages representing bona fide hallucinations. I do not accept the \\"fantastic manifestations of the fears and passions of the two characters\\" (Wikipedia, Episode 15) as hallucinations primarily due to their transient nature. Bloom easily discards his hallucinatory behavior when Stephen is in need of protection, guidance, and mentoring. True hallucinations are not easily discarded when reality dictates the need for lucidity. Rather than hallucinations, Bloom's expressed fears and passions appear to be dream content. I suspect James Joyce kept a dream diary and used the material from it many places in Ulysses. I also suspect many of his dreams were in the form of nightmares, perhaps induced by excessive use of absinthe, a highly alcoholic beverage quite popular at the time.Let's use the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed.) to label Bloom's behavior:* Primary Diagnosis: Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder characterized by recurrent pornographic sexual images, repeated doubts, the need to have things in a particular order, excessive counting, and word repetition.The entire book is a testimony to Bloom's OCD but two favorite examples come to mind here:* Bloom is asked by an unseen inquisitor what he admires about water. His extensive listing starts with its \\"universality\\" and ends with its \\"stagnant pools in the waning moon\\". (p. 528)* Later, he is asked to describe the content of two drawers which he goes through each evening seeking relaxation before attempting to go to sleep. The detailed listing (pp. 566-568) is apparently revisited each night before going to bed.He even presents a detailed list of men he believes have been his wife's lovers over the years and does so in the order in which she has been involved with them. (p. 575)And by his own declarations of consubstantiality, we have reason to think of Bloom and Joyce as one.In summary, if OCD is your thing, you will enjoy reading Ulysses over and over again."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"This is a book that I have thought about almost all my life.

I have long questioned Joyce's status as a great writer. Not that he failed to display a knack for the pen - indeed, his _Dubliners_ contains work of substantial depth and real stylistic artistry (particularly &quot;The Dead&quot;). My qualm is with his later works, especially the much-praised _Ulysses_. Here Joyce lapsed into experimentation for the sake of experimentation. The final result was a muddled mess, the underlying meaning of which can only be _constructed_ by general readers of exceptional creativity or professional critics with advanced degrees and an excess of spare time.And even if we give Joyce the benefit of the doubt, even if we believe that he was (like Thomas Wolfe, who had, after all, a very patient editor) writing to capture each and every moment of our lives, we must admit the difficulty of the task. Literature must follow some logical construct; it must sort our daily chaos with art. If we follow Joyce's example by stuffing a day's garbled thoughts into a book, we have created only a mirror - something that apes our futility. True literature, on the other hand, attacks our existence piecemeal. And though such literature may never reveal the meaning of each breath or cry &quot;fiat lux&quot; before God or the Void or whatever lies at the root of the universe, it is a symbol of our unquenchable willingness to kick against the pricks, to grasp at unknowable truth. The artist, in carefully crafting - in reaching for that elusive order and higher truth - breathes new and continual life into those words of William Faulkner:&quot;[Man] is immortal not because he alone among creatures has an inexhaustible voice, but because he has a soul, a spirit capable of compassion and sacrifice and endurance. The poet's, the writer's, duty is to write about these things. It is his privilege to help man endure by lifting his heart, by reminding him of the courage and honor and hope and pride and compassion and pity and sacrifice which have been the glory of his past. The poet's voice . . . [must] help him endure and prevail.&quot;How can our &quot;puny inexhaustible voice&quot; ring defiantly when, like Joyce, we wallow in our daily morass?"},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"I am sure you will not find this worthwhile.

Even though I've read the novel many times, I'm not qualified to compare this new edition to its predecessors: I'm a commercial artist, not a literary scholar. I AM qualified, however, to complain about how badly produced this book is. Professor Rose refers in his intro to the important influence that editors, designers and printers have on a text. Careful analysis of those influences are the basis of the method he used to create this new edition. Well, too bad he wasn't able to influence the publisher. This edition of Ulysses is printed on very cheap paper -- the kind of dim gray brittle stuff that the cheapest of romance fiction is printed on. Fine for a book that will be read once, but terrible for a &quot;Reader's Edition&quot; of a classic that will be reread and annotated. These pages will be badly discolored in a few years. The typography is mediocre, too: the title page looks like the Bad Example in any design textbook.

For an excellent account of Gabler's edition--of the legal reasons for its extensive modifications of the text, of the dubious textual methods employed, of the subsequent scholarly controversy--read Bruce Arnold's excellent little book _The Scandal of Ulysses_. Joyce's book has now twice in recent years been messed around with by dubiously-motivated editors--more recently, the \\"Reader's Edition\\" that was the subject of a wrangle in court to suppress it--which is an absurd indignity to be visited on one of the touchstones of 20th-century fiction."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"Joyce was a great genius, granted, but what he did with his genius is something that doesn't appeal to me. Dangling the snotgreen stuff at the beginning of the book is not what I would call an inviting beginning. Yes, it's a marvel of writing, but I do not like what it is being marvelous about, or at. It's like a beautiful women who farts a lot but doesn't give a damn, because she knows her bosoms are so fetching. Well, fetching bosoms can take a woman only so far, just as fetching writing-- even a genius's writing-- can take a book so far. (IMHO). So yes, I like Joyce's writing's beauty and I like its fetching sensations, but I do not like his artistic manners and I do not like the liberties he takes with my attention-- which he sure knows how to catch, but so what. So can Flaubert (a greater writer, imho), and so can Proust (almost ditto).With all that out of the way I'll not-grudgingly say you probably have to read Ulysses, because, first, it sits like a dead weight in the midst of modern writing, and, second (if you are a writer), so you could steal some of Joyce's marvelous writing technique. But I would not read him more than once.AM"},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"Probably every avid reader feels compelled at some time in life to read \\"Ulysses\\", especially as it was voted the best work of fiction of the 20th century at the turn of this millenium.The style of writing throughout the book is usually referred to as \\"stream of consciousness\\". This method has been subsequently employed in other works such as \\"To The Lighthouse\\" and \\"The sound and the Fury\\". However, in my opinion, these latter two works used the style much more succesfully than Joyce.If you are currently reading \\"Ulysses\\" at the moment, expect a very patchy book. The second half is , in general, better than the first half, with the two penultimate chapters \\"Cabman's shelter\\" and \\"Ithaca\\" standing out from the rest. After that, the description of birth in \\"Oxen in the sun\\" is also excellent , as is the part dsecribing Paddy Dignam's funeral early in the book. As to the rest of the book, I believe there is little to recommend it.Opinion tends to be polarized about \\"Ulysses\\" . Its severest critics suggest that it is only praised by those who are scared to be criticized for not understanding the book, a sort of \\"emperor's new clothes\\" scenario. There is, however, more than a grain of truth in this opinion. It does seem incredible that a book with so much \\"padding\\" could be so highly thought of. It might have made a very good book of around 200 pages, but one does have the sensation that Joyce is taking his readers for a ride in many parts. ( Of course, his ultimate send up of his readers was \\"Finnegan's Wake\\"! ). Furthermore, the much lauded sense of humour is overblown. At best, this is a mildly amusing book with one or two laugh out loud lines. To label it as \\"very funny\\" is pretentiousness itself. Most of the humour is also of the \\"toilet\\" variety.On the positive side, there are some interesting passages as mentioned above. However, the main interest lies in seeing this new attempt at a style of writing , and to try to fathom out why this book has become the \\"darling\\" of the ( maybe \\"so-called\\" ) intellectuals.

The second time you read it, you will begin to suspect that Joyce is actually writing about the contours of your own mind. The third time you read it, your earlier suspicion will prove true as you successively laugh, gasp, swear, snort, breathe, moan, think, and yearn in anticipation of the occurrences of these events on the page. By the fourth time you read it, you will realize you never stopped reading it - that even the interlude of years between your first and second reading was only a momentary pause to catch the breath of your life outside the Book; and that you made a habit of the yearly 16-June read merely for the sake of ordering that interval of months between the readings - and during those intervals you will find yourself repeating passages in your head that you would never have imagined to be memorizable. Each time you emerge from this book you will find yourself unmistakably changed - your eyes opened to a further deepness of what it is to be human, what it is to be yourself. Joyce will demand everything of you, but he will give you a greater everything in return.If you have tried to read this book before, and didn't make it - well, i understand. The first time, it is admittedly extraordinarily difficult. But turn, if you will, to page 903 of the hardback Knopf Everyman edition, and read the bit of catechism &quot;What in water did Bloom, waterlover, drawer of water, watercarrier returning to the range, admire?&quot; that extends through 905.

So here's my explication/review:Ulysses : Political Commentary And SensualityJames Joyce was a famous contributor to the 18th century literary tradition. Nevertheless, Joyce's use of the supernatural is all too often mistaken for social commentary in Ulysses. Below, it will be proven that Ulysses's Surrealist overtones and views on hate are not evidence of Joyce's surrender to love. This claim is buttressed by three points: (1) the Surrealist views of Ulysses's protagonist, Tom Joad, (2) Joyce's triumphant use of satire in the work, and (3) the author's employment of human nature, showing the influence of the the British Modernist school.First, Joyce's male sympathies are evident in Ulysses. To indicate that Ichabod Stephenson is the work's villain, the author makes his dialogue simple. Ishmael Maxwell is a famous character for this very reason; it is also meaningful that scholars--by seeing him as an avatar of Joyce's Minimalist views--have misinterpreted the character King Adams's role in the book.Furthermore, consider that Ulysses was not so much written by Joyce as belched forth in a fit of sublime inspiration. Ulysses's use of incest is in keeping with its Constructivist point-of-view. Captain Stephenson is a far from marginal character; in fact, it is through him that many of Joyce's 18th century influences show through.Last, Ulysses cannot be fully understood without examination of the post Minimalist school of Roman literature. Many teens see the book's closing scene as the most enduring; I, however, do not. Nick Daniel is a witless character for this very reason; this is definitely why One-Eyed Caulfield is such a monumental character.It's easy to forget that Ulysses was the most brilliant work of its time. Perhaps it's time that scholars reevaluated their estimation of the book. Though contemporaries found Joyce's use of dystopic future-vision ponderous, history will vindicate Ulysses. Q. E. D. -- Quite easily done.The End"},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"Who published this? There are no characters in the entire book who would look anything like the characters on this cover! Most of the action takes place in a newspaper office, in a bed room, in a Martello tower, and at a funeral. Most people are dressed in jackets and ties, not torn shirts, and certainly no one smiles as dumb as these jokers. The looks of this book are a disgrace to the author."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"Ulysses is not that difficult a book to understand, contrary to what you may have been led to believe. Compared with Finnegans Wake, for instance, it's a cake walk. The book's most frustrating part comes early on, after Stephen leaves his Uncle Richie's house. From here on out, a dictionary (preferably a comprehensive one) becomes invaluable. In my opinion, a good deal of the confusion surrounding Ulysses has arisen out of the fact that most people, upon encountering a word that they do not understand, choose to merely carry on in confusion, as opposed to looking the word up. You would be shocked at how instantly comprehensible this book becomes once a dictionary is employed. Since this book was written as a sort of mock-heroic counterpoint to the Homeric poems, a knowledge of those literary works is also very useful for any competent appreciation of Ulysses."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"All I can say after finally finishing Ulysses is that it deserves its reputation - both of them. Yes, it is a masterpiece - and, yes, it is a difficult, at times seemingly impenetratable read. When I finished reading this book and finally closed it, I felt I had accomplished a monumental deed. This is the only book I've ever read - and I've read many (difficult ones, too) - that was an actual physical chore to read. One reviewer mentioned that reading it is comparable to climbing Mt. Everest - many people start it, but few make it to the summit - and, ridicilous as that sounds, it is true, in a way. I'm not going to go into a detailed analysis of this book (that's arguably impossible, anyway), or summarize the plot, or anything like that - there is no plot. Small review forums limited to 1,000 words such as this one is not the place for a detailed dissertation on a book as profound, monumental, and important as Ulysses - doctoral thesises and 100,000 word essays have been written for that purpose by people far more qualified than I. It is not difficult, but impossible to summarize Ulysses: it must read in full. I have done so - it wasn't easy, but I did it. I read Joyce's A Portrait of The Artist As A Young Man first (which I highly reccommend you do also), although I didn't use any annotation or Cliff's Notes, or anything like that. I have no doubt that many of the book's complexities, metaphors, allusions, and ancedotes were lost on me, but I wanted to read the book on my own first. I don't claim total comprehension of his vast and difficult masterpiece; I fully admit that there are many parts of the book that I did not understand. This is no reason to slander the book, as many have ignorantly done. I did enjoy reading the book, however - and felt great joy and a sense of accomplishment upon on reading it - and yes, it IS a masterpiece, and for this reason: this is one of the few, if not the only book(s) ever written that accurately and realistically depicts real life. There is no plot, there is no \\"story\\" - there is certainly no moral. What this book (I believe) attempts to do - and does - is to portray life in a fictional setting - real life. This book takes two normal people, and describes their day. The cross paths at times - intersect, ramble, and collide - and this book, basically, just shows a normal day in the life of two normal people. This may not sound exciting - it isn't. It may sound boring - it often is. Imagine if you wrote down in a book every single event of your day in pain-staking detail (and there are parts in thsi book where Joyce goes into such detail as to border on mundanity, despite its ultra realism.) Still, it is a brilliant and ingenious literary device - surprisignly unattemped before - and carried off marvelously well here. This book addresses the normal, everyday things that other books always cease to mention: defecation, masturbation, rambling thoughts inside a person's head. Like Portrait, this book contains no quotation marks. All dialogue is written as it is personally experienced by the character; I know no other writer besides Joyce who writes - both dialogue and narraration - from INSIDE the character: you actually feel what it's like to walk around inside a person's head, rather than just witnessing his external actions, like every other book in the world. Ulysses, though a long and difficult read (especially if one chooses to study it), is ultimately rewarding, and I reccommend tackling it to anyone who reads with an open mind. It is a masterpiece, and it is, indeed, the true last word on realism."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"A blasphemous, vulgar and sexual book about the lives of sots in Ireland written by a Shakespeare-variety wordsmith. At first glance, it sounds too good to be true. The catch...An extremely comprehensive plot summary for each chapter will only take about 25 words. That's right-it takes place over the course of a day and a night, and the action can be completely and all-inclusively summarized in only 450 words. However, there are only two ways to get this summary: 1) five or six years of study, or 2) by reading a Cliffs Notes-type book.This book has been fairly assessed as incomprehensible, numbing, nightmarish, and mind-numbing. The average reader will have a excruciatingly grim time completing this book.Still, I am convinced that anyone who reads every word of this book will love and embrace it. Be warned, the love and embrace do not happen immediately. After reading the first 90 pages, I had the worst headache in my life. I could not read for five more days. I hated the next four hundred pages of the book. Around page 500, I began to embrace this beloved work. It took the last 250 pages to achieve a unity and oneness with the book.I'm one of those people who reads the dictionary for fun. Because of this, I know a lot of words that I've never heard or have never read. Ulysses changed that. I think that he used every word that I have ever learned by reading the dictionary, but have not heard in life. Finding those words in print is worth reading the 700+ pages.As a smattering of the jewels of perspicacity of James Joyce, I have included my four favorite parts of the book. If you like this small morsel of the volume, you will love the rest. Enjoy!1. Moses, Moses, king of the jews, wiped his arse in the Daily News.2. Love loves to love love.3. Q. Did Bloom accept the invitation to dinner...? A. Very gratefully, with grateful appreciation, with sincere appreciative gratitude, in appreciatively grateful sincerity of regret, he declined.4. Q. What in water did Bloom ... admire? A. Its universality: its democratic equality and constancy to its nature in seeking its own level ...

In my experience as a teacher of undergraduates and as a published writer of fiction as well, I would like to say in response to comments by a so-called Phd English student, that criticising a monumental work of art that deals with the need for a personalised fiction in the fragmentation of twentieth century alienation, reflects an ignorance that boggles the mind. It is better to remain silent on what one doesn't understand than convince the world of one's lack of, well, insight. My suggestion to those who want to fathom what Joyce is trying to do is to check out what writers like Burgess have to say. And as for comments about male 'post-modernist' stuff, please read Grass's 'The Flounder' on what excess feminism is all about and learn to grow."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"There are no notes in this book.

I really appreciated it! Merry Christmas."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"A masterpiece? Yes, no doubt about it, yes, it is a masterpiece, yes!Joyce's \\"Ulysses\\" is endowed with Aristotelian unity of space: it all happens in Dublin, and God knows, it helps if you know your way around that city. Unity of time as well, it all happens in a 24-hour period starting on the morning of Thursday, June 16, 1904, and God knows it helps if you know the headlines of Dublin newspapers for that day. It even has unity of action, whatever there is of that ingredient in this novel. It all revolves around the current adulterous affair of Molly Bloom with the vulgar Blazes Boylan, and the preparation of her next adultery with intensely intellectual Stephen Dedalus, whose father Simon had also been her lover at some point. There seem to be three main characters: Leopold Bloom, his wife Molly, and the young \\"bard\\" Stephen Dedalus, alias Joyce himself. It is amusing that Joyce repeatedly keeps referring to Stephen Dedalus, his alter ego, as a bard, a title reserved these days for William Shakespeare. This seems to signal Joyce's conviction that he belongs to a very exclusive club with the bard of Stratford upon Avon as its only other member.Beyond these three \\"main\\" characters, there are literally hundreds of other characters whose names and even their Dublin addresses are mentioned and oft-repeated. You might think, I wrecked your whole pleasure in reading this book, by giving away these spoilers. You need not worry, as things are not what they seem to be. The true main character of the novel is none of the above, but rather the English language, of which Joyce has a command second to none, with the possible exception of the bard of Stratford upon Avon. I wouldn't be surprised if Joyce's vocabulary had weighed in at twice or maybe even thrice that of the typical educated reader, and not for a minute does he let you forget this fact. Why?Why? Well, the book has a clear anti-British slant, and Joyce is rubbing it in to the Brits, that it takes an Irish genius like himself, to show them what can be done with their language. He also feels free to distort the King's English, and by extremely clever alliterations, homophonies, misspellings and lists he manages to poke quite cruel fun at the tool he wields with such virtuosity. He casts Irish art in the role of \\"cracked lookingglass of a servant.\\"I just mentioned lists, and God knows, there are so many in this book, some of full-page length. The whole novel reads like a veritable prose-poem. Think but of the Joycean line \\"A veil awave upon the waves.\\" In many places Joyce lapses into actual poems, most marvelously that \\"Ballad of the Joking Jesus\\" (supposedly borrowed in an abridged and altered form from his estranged friend Oliver St. John Gogarty, the model for the Buck Mulligan character in \\"Ulysses.\\") the first two lines of which I cannot resist writing down here,I'm the queerest young fellow that ever you heardMy mother's a Jew, my father's a bird.In the next two lines he refers negatively to \\"Joseph the Joiner\\" and one cannot miss the sharing of James Joyce's own initials with both those of the Divine Joking Jesus and of His holy mother's sainted husband.Along Leopold Bloom's Dublin wanderings deep issues are addressed: the dynamics of anti-Semitism, the difference between male and female sexuality, the patterns of married life, among others. In the latter context, a whole chapter is devoted to an extremely original, if far from provably correct analysis of William Shakespeare's marriage to Ann Hathaway. What is remarkable is that this analysis manages to shed light also on the problems in the Bloom marriage, with Leopold Bloom taking a different and much more forgiving attitude toward his wife's adultery than the bard.When dealing with sexuality, Joyce, in a serious novel written a mere decade after the Victorian age, does not shy away from the use of four-letter words, the detailed description of masturbation and of passionate intercourse, and quite some space is devoted to bodily functions. Indeed a crucial scene in the penultimate (\\"Ithaca\\") chapter ends with Leopold Bloom and Stephen Dedalus sealing their friendship by the quite homoerotic act of urinating together in the garden.Finally, maybe the most important influence this novel has had on modern literature is at the stylistic level. There can be little doubt that Vladimir Nabokov's exotic, if always so marvelously correct, word-choices owe a big debt to Joyce. The title character of one of Saul Bellow's famous novels shares the name of the minor character Moses Herzog in \\"Ulysses.\\" In \\"Ulysses\\" each chapter is written in a different style, here a romantic novel, there a tabloid newspaper, there a serious newspaper, now a play, then an unpunctuated stream of consciousness and so on. In \\"Herzog,\\" Bellow also mixes a basic narrative with the epistolary style of the letters despondent Herzog dispatches to all kinds of live and dead world leaders. The word \\"snot-green\\" invented by Buck Mulligan to describe the color of the Irish sea in the first chapter of \\"Ulysses\\" has made a comeback in twenty-first century novels, not to speak even of the use of four-letter words and explicit sexual scenes in serious modern fiction. To a certain extent, even the deeply moving poetic style of Tennessee Williams' marvelous plays seems indebted to a certain extent to Joyce.Above all, the stream of consciousness narration, which traces the free flow of the characters' thoughts rather than of their actions, has become a standard in modern fiction. Between the unexpected turns of these thoughts and the beauty of Joyce's use of the English language, one remains glued to \\"Ulysses\\" through its almost eight hundred pages, much as one would if he had spiced the story with all the trappings of a first rate thriller.As a practical piece of advice, use as I did a paperback edition, and tear it into some ten fascicles of seventy-eighty pages each. This way you can enjoy one of the major masterpieces of twentieth century literature without risking a hernia and/or a carpal tunnel syndrome."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"The ultimate controversial book, maybe just behind the bible.

So it's just fair to rate it a well-deserved 3 stars, the just average to a work that can easily be described as sublime and profane, at the same time -- sometimes not even chapter to chapter but paragraph to paragraph.

The book, based on the Odyssey, follows a day in the life of the ordinary/extraordinary Leopold Bloom as he wanders through Dublin. There are many historical and literary descriptions and allusions that make that day come alive. Many of the supporting characters, especially Stephen Dedalus and Molly Bloom, are fully realized. The final stream of consciousness passage ends with what I think is a triumphant line.If you want to tackle this book, take your time and think."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"James Joyce (1882-1941) was a tormented Roman Catholic who forsook his faith, picked up his pen and wrote the great novel \\"Ulysses\\" based on the epic poem \\"The Odyssey\\" by Homer. It is impossible to explain Ulysses or give it an adequate review in the short space alloted this reviewer. Howwver, I would offer the following thoughts for those brave souls eager to enter the labyrinthal complexities of a genius's mind:Joyce tells the story of one day in the life of the people of Dublin, Ireland on June 16, 1904 (the day he first met his wife Nora Baracle). As he does so in eighteen chapters linked with similar episodes in \\"The Odyssey.\\" During the day (about 900 pages) we follow the two chief characters on their peregrinations and adventures. Those characters are:Stephen Dedalus-Named for the Greek mytholgical figure Dedalus who builds wings to fly in the sky; his son Icarus flies too close to the sun and perishes while Dedalus lands in Sicily. Stephen was the chief character in Joyce's \\"The Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man.\\" He is tormented by his failure to pray at his dying mother's bedside; tormented by the Roman Catholic Church's burden of guilt laid upon his soul. Stephen is an aspiring author. He is ambivalent in his feelings toward his native Ireland. As the novel begins he is living in the English built castleThe Martello Tower along with his friend Buck Mulligan and an Englishman named Haines. Stephen is a teacher who is supervised by the horrible Deasy a West Englishman who in an Orange Protestant. Deasy is a false Nestor to the callow Stephen. Stephen is an intellectual with biographical correspondence to the author James Joyce.Leopold Bloom-A 38 year old advertising man who is married to the sensuous Molly. Bloom is a middlebrow who roams the streets of Dublin plying his advertising career engaging in arguments, dreaming about a sexy young thing on the beach and saving Stephen from trouble in the famous Nighttime section of the book. Leopold does not practice his Judaism. His father was a Hungarian Jewish immigrant. The novel ends with Bloom returning home to his unfaithful wife Molly just as Odysseus returned home to his faithful wife Penelope in the Homeric epic. Bloomsday is celebrated worldwide on Feb. 2 each year (the date of Joyce's birth in 1882).c. Molly Bloom-Her nearly fifty pages of stream of consciousness prose was until recently the longest sentence in the English language. She is a coarse, bawdy, serially cheating wife to Bloom.I do not claim to understand everything going on in Ulysses. Joyce said it would take the professors and critics centuries to explore its rich minefield of literary allusions, jokes, and analysis of the human condition. Ulysses has been banned and blasted by literary critics as the same time it has been praised. You may find out yourself by giving it a close reading with a good commentary handy. Joyce plums the depths of the human mind. He is a great Irish genius whose work demands study."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"The best edition of what's considered by many the apotheosis of English fiction. As mentioned in the front matter, \\"this book reproduces, as closely as offset printing will allow, Roger Lathbury's copy of the first edition of Ulysses published by Sylvia Beach's Shakespeare and Company in Paris in 1922. Broken type, signature numbers, and the colophon have been left as printed.\\" Editorial slip-ups are therefore obviously included, adding a quaint historical nuance.The perfect gift for any fan of Stephen Dedalus and Leopold Bloom, this edition is elegant, a pleasure to hold and read, and ideal for anyone new to and wishing to appreciate Ulysses. (Most mass market editions, while well edited, are otherwise cheap products.)Two outstanding aids for appreciating Ulysses areWings of Art: Joseph Campbell on James Joyce, and Stuart Gilbert'sJames Joyce's Ulysses."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"i have been waiting for kidd to release his corrections to the 'corrected' editon of ulysses for nigh on 17 years now. amazon, god bless its heart (i guess corporations have hearts now that they're real people), gives kidd's future book a listing here and therefore a way for me to keep track of it. and if kidd ever actually gets it published i can preorder.professor kidd, i beg you, please put out your edition of this classic, and bury gabler once and for all."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"Reading Ulysses is a different experience for everyone. One thing is for certain - it is a difficult,long read. It is also, strangely, very hard to put down and it leaves you searching for meaning and just in a state of complete wonder. Amazingly, Joyce is able to convey each character's thoughts and dialect in a way that has never been achieved by anyone else. It feels almost as if each character was composed by a different author - they are so unique and detailed. Though I cannot express much of anything that has not already been said - let me make one recommendation to the reader of Ulysses - read something to help you through it (even cliff notes) and also read the Odyssey again - you will find this very helpful in navigating through this remarkable text."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"I've read Dubliners and Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man and now Ulysses. One apparent source of the joy of reading these for me is that all of the characters are good, sympathetic people, even when they do petty things. It is a world full of light and air, humor and optimism. Stephen Dedalus, Buck Mulligan, Leopold and Molly Bloom and all the rest are more-or-less normal humans living normal lives even though somewhat oppressed by poverty, the Church, and the English, and of course themselves. Ulysses has none of the violence, darkness, ugliness, cynicism, villiany, and perversion that is found in so much of modern literature. The most dramatic and upsetting thing that happens is when Stephen gets his hand whacked in school (in Portrait). Even Stephen's alchoholic irresponsible father is painted somewhat empathetically.The events in Ulysses are so prosaic and quotidian that Joyce had to dress up his work with high-fallutin prose and verbal pyrotechnics. Otherwise the work would just be too bland. The reader can skate over most of the obscure rambling parts or go back and endlessly ponder them. I ignore most of the references, and I'm not too taken with the Homeric and Biblical symbolism. The book can be read on many different levels. I admit I loved it--but I would recommend reading Dubliners and Portrait first. I would also recommend visiting Dublin if you can swing it, and especially Howth, which figures prominently in Ulysses. Howth is a charming village and vast, dramatic, wild, high headland with sweeping views of the Irish Sea, Bailey Lighthouse way below, and Dublin city center in the distance--all within the city limits of Dublin. Last stop north on the DART (Dublin Area Rapid Transit)."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"Ulysses symbolizes the height of modernist writing, and in many ways, was the first to address post-modern issues- in it's fragmentation and pastiche of form.Each chapter, which accounts for a particular time of day in chronological order (perhaps the only linear aspect of the book), appropriates a certain 'style', which addresses the 'consciousness' that Leopold Bloom, our hero, is undergoing.For example, when Bloom is worried about his job at the newspaper, the chapter breaks into journalistic form, adapting headlines and soundbites, however comical and absurd.Another example, when Bloom enters a brothel, and is pensive about being recognized, the chapter becomes a play, where all the characters are faceless and have taken on roles.There is a tremendously humane and sad scene at the pub, where all of Bloom's friends talk and banter over him, not hearing the profound things he has to say. Bloom is a poet that doesn't know it, to borrow from Dylan's rhyme. He is a modest man, navigating his way through his banal day. He goes to a burial and daydreams the corpse rolling down the hill. A bar of soap melts in his pocket. He goes to the beach and looks at a girl. In the bath-tub, he notices his penis, floating like a water-lily. And that is why this book is so kind and rare: His day becomes beautiful through his eyes. Each banality and prosaic task becomes macro-cosmic and mythical in the way that it is written. Bloom's Odessey is to return home.With each transition, Joyce continues to astonish the reader with how agile his writing is. The most genius part of the book is the penultimate chapter, in which Bloom and Stephan (the narrator in \\"Portrait of the Artist\\" and Joyce's alter-ego), enter the former's home, both drunk and lonely. Here, the chapter becomes Q & A form, a series of questions that are answered. Perhaps Bloom, eager to sustain Stephan's company, so late in the night, adopts the role as an interviewer, they way we ask meaningless questions to allude the awkward silence.In the end, Bloom crawls into bed, and his stream of consciousness blends into that of his wife's, Molly. Here, readers enter her mind, and we discover what has been bothering poor and gentle and lovely Bloom all day."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"Why haven't you read this book?

One of my very best friends cannot read past an early description of the sea as \\"snot-green.\\" Go figure. Joyce challeneges our notions about the ordinary. The ordinary is not always beautiful. It is not always remarkable. But seen through the life of one ordinary man, a single day is an epic, albeit an ordinary one. And what's so wrong with that?Leopold Bloom and Stephen Daedelus are perhaps the most intriguing characters in 20th Century art. They are opposites of a sort. Bloom is an everyman, Daedelus wants to be the Ubermensch, but he is far too Gallic. Bloom (the Hungarian Jew - anything but Gallic) triumphs in his epic, this day in Dublin. Stephen, well, he doesn't quite triumph. There are lessons here that one can explore for eons. Why is Bloom successful in his odyssey? Why isn't Stephen? Stephen is trapped in emerging Gallic existentialism, dark, \\"sinister\\" as Buck Mulligan describes it. Bloom is, well...Bloom. He is the good kind of existential...the Teutonic rather than Gallic.Read this book, for God's sakes. Don't take my word for it. Love it, hate it, I don't care.

Joyce was living in Europe, hitting up friends, relatives, and would be patrons for money as he masturbated away his talent right in front of the poor, half-wit woman he married. &quot;Because,&quot; he answered, &quot;I can't think of anything else to do.&quot; That about sums up why this book in truth is an eruption of verbal flatulence, a screech in the literary void by a man who was not capable of doing what lesser writers could: compose a plot. There are scenes, passages and conversations from Ulysses that are truly brilliant--but that's all one can say about it. The tragedy is that a man of such talent, who would have secured a place in literary history if he had never written another word after &quot;The Dead&quot;, felt obliged to labor his way through this doorstop of a novel, when he could have produced something so much better."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"I have a BS in English from Ga Tech in the USA.

He wrote this work for people who cared more for style over substance. Don't read this book. Leave this dark epistle where it is in the store and read Joyce's other works.

In high school I purchased the volume because that is what readers did. Purchasing the book, however, is about all the good I got out of it back then. I don't think I even made it into Part II without giving up. So, naturally, a book likeJames Joyce's Ulysses: A Studyprofited my younger self infinitely more so than the novel it purported to study. That is because, without even having read the book, I could speak somewhat intelligently on the novel and also make ridiculously absurd remarks about its place in the \\"modernist project.\\" As you can imagine, I was invited to a lot of parties.Years passed, a Modern Library list of the one hundred greatest books of the twentieth century was issued, and Ulysses remained unread on my bookshelf. During my undergraduate studies, and I use the term \\"studies\\" in its most liberal application, I enrolled in a James Joyce course. I read it and I hated it. Now, in an attempt to read through the Modern Library's list, I have read it again. I am still convinced that it is not a great book.Ulysses is not a great book for many different reasons. First is its notorious and intentional difficulty. Joyce himself once commented on the book that he had \\"put so many enigmas and puzzles that it will keep the professors busy for centuries arguing over what I meant, and that's the only way of insuring one's immortality.\\" And this is the problem. Joyce has forced so much meaning into the text so as to render it meaningless. Indeed, reading Ulysses is more academic exercise than pleasurable literary experience. Literature, at its core, is an attempt at human communication and what we have here is a failure to communicate. Few average readers are willing or able to invest the time and effort necessary to read and understand a novel whose explicit goal it is to confuse professional scholars.The difficulty of the book extends beyond the themes, symbols, and structure and into the very language employed to tell the story. If only Joyce had adopted - as Biddy the Clip describes Stephen Dedalus' language in the Circe chapter - a \\"marked refinement of phraseology,\\" then perhaps the novel wouldn't be so bad. Instead the book is strewn about with an infuriating amount of useless and obscure language. This opacity has spawned a cottage industry of explanatory texts. But this is a novel, not an excursion into unknown territory. We shouldn't need maps. In the end the language of Ulysses will limit it to a very select readership, namely those interested in convincing others of their sophistication and intellectual powers (you know, people like me). It will never enjoy popular readership. I am reminded here of the quaker librarian's warning from the Scylla and Charybdis chapter where he comments that, \\"the mocker is never taken seriously when he is most serious.\\"I offer that the book fails in two more respects. First, it fails in its stylistic ambitions. The book is perhaps best known for its stream-of-consciousness innovations. This narrative technique is an effort to get inside the head of the characters and to replicate the character's thoughts. For the most part, Joyce fails miserably at this. No one thinks like the characters of Ulysses think. Their thoughts are simply too sporadic, befogged, and preposterously plentiful. These passages may very well be streams-of-unconsciousness, but no one ever had a conscious thought pattern as absurd as those found in Ulysses. The interior monologues of Stephen Dedalus are the worst. Most readers, I imagine, skip them entirely. Readers interested in a proper execution of the stream-of-consciousness technique need look no further than William Faulkner or Virginia Woolf.Secondly, the novel fails in its modernism. If the modern novel is meant to serve as a symbolic manifestation of the confusion and aggravation of modern life, then the book is a wild success. Indeed, perhaps the only thing more confusing and aggravating than reading Ulysses is readingFinnegans Wake (Classic, 20th-Century, Penguin). If, on the other hand, we understand the project of literary modernism to be an articulation of the era's spiritual disillusionment, despair and alienation then we need look no further than the prose of Ernest Hemingway.There is a way to read Ulysses. Read it slowly. This works in two respects. First, part of the charm of the novel, if there is any, is its language. By reading slow you will be able to digest it all. Secondly, if you are polymath and polyglot enough to understand what is going on, you will not miss anything important. Finally, as my undergraduate professor suggested, it helps to recite the book in your mind with a deep Dublin Irish accent. Doing so makes the book at a least a little more entertaining.So why would I offer suggestions about how to read the book if I feel that it's not worth reading? Well, my limited appreciation of the novel is based on its at times brilliant wordplay, its humor and the beauty of the final chapter.Few books provoke authentic LOLs. Ulysses is one of them. The first glimpse of this humor comes from the Hades chapter when Leopold Bloom - the alienated Jew trapped on an island of rabidly anti-Semitic Irish Catholics - ponders the curious rituals of the Roman faith as he and his peers lay to rest poor Paddy Dignam. Mr. Bloom satirizes the ritual prayers over the dead body with his own intonation of, \\"hoping you're well and not in hell.\\" In terms of the book's funny punnery, none is as enjoyable as that found in the conversation between Alf and Joe during the Cyclops chapter when Alf asks who has been making character assassinating allegations against Bloom. Joe replies, \\"I am the alligator.\\" Stephen Dedalus provides the biggest gut buster when, drunk and conversing, he professes that his understanding of brotherly love is reducible to the maxim that, \\"greater love than this no man hath that a man lay down his wife for his friend.\\" Unfortunately, finding such humorous literary gems in Ulysses is like searching for a needle in a pile of donkey poo.Despite my previous distaste for the majority of the novel's language, there are some very pretty sentences in Ulysses. For instance, the shade of a tree becomes \\"the treeshade of sunnywinking leaves.\\" On a morning trip to the butcher, Leopold Bloom, relisher of the inner organs of beasts and fowls, watches as \\"the ferreteyed porkbutcher folded the sausages he had snipped off with blotchy fingers, sausagepink.\\" Finally, instead of entering the carriage, a character pokes his \\"silkhatted head into the creaking carriage and, entering deftly, seats himself.\\"Finally, Ulysses endeared itself to me a bit more this time because the final episode, the Penelope chapter, is just so wonderful. This chapter documents the thoughts of a woman - Molly Bloom, wife of Leopold - as she falls asleep. Where elsewhere Joyce fails in composing a convincing stream-of-consciousness, here he is resoundingly successful. Molly Bloom's lazy, floating thoughts fall upon memories of her friends, her lovers (premarital and adulterous), her childhood, her dead son, her living daughter, her desire to blow Stephen Dedalus before finally and beautifully coming to rest upon (yes) her husband who has literally just kissed her ass. I realize that the prospect of reading a ponderous forty page run-on sentence may not sound like the most palatable literary endeavor. If there is anything that makes Ulysses worth reading, however, it is this chapter.Should you read Ulysses? I don't know. On one hand, it's the greatest novel ever written. Then again, it's certainly one of the worst. If anything, please do not read it on the Kindle. Get a print version. That way you can look really smart when people see you reading it on the subway."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"Yes, this book is staggeringly difficult. Yes, Joyce was a pompous, self-absorbed, pretentious butthead. Yes, he was a cynic who indulged in bitter ironies. But at the same time Joyce was also a senitmentalist and an idealist, and this magnificient novel is a successful exercise in unadulterated nostalgia. It is humble. It is funny. It is sad. It is vexing. And it contains the most sublime sentences and passages written in the English language: \\"On his wise shoulders through the checkerwork of leaves the sun flung spangles, dancing coins.\\" The \\"Scylla and Charybdis\\" chapter alone is both dazzling and haunting. Shorn of the baggage (and garbage) it has accumulated over the years, Ulysses is, at its heart, a deeply moving probing of nothing less than the human heart."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"James Joyce turn a left turn from Tolstoy's idea of elegantly revealing the stream of consciousness, unto pouring it by the bucket on the reader's head.

Most people who tell you that they understand the book are lying. Joyce was a genius--not in a way that he was a &quot;really good&quot; writer, but in a way that he simply had more brain power than almost all of us. He pushed himself for years and years to write this book, and he is a genius, so why should we be able to understand this book in one or two readings? You might get the gist of it after a few readings, a good professor to guide you through, and a strong literary background. But it doesn't matter if you have your MA in English or not, Joyce's intricacies will, for most of us, remain elusive. Not understanding Ulysses doesn't mean you're stupid it means you are human. I don't know why people are suprised that they don't &quot;get it&quot; when they read it. Most of us will probably never be able to grasp the brilliance of Mozart's music or Einstein's theories either, we have to kind of trust people that know how good they are. After a while we may be able to see why they are so good too. It's curious that people would hold literature to a lower bar than those disciplines. If you're not a rocket scientist, chances are you're probably not going to pick up a book on rocket science and expect to understand it."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"Certainly, Ulysses must be one of the hardest books to review. The fact that so many has been written about it makes one shy to add one's own humble opinion, while the fact that it has recently (although somewhat controversially) been chosen as the best book of the last century makes one want to give it the benefit of the doubt with respect to every critical remark.And most of all, Ulysses is simply a brilliant book. The reader finds herself immersed in a dull day, which nevertheless reflects all aspects of life in Dublin around 1900. And this realist, evocative aspect of the book is balanced by its success in mirroring large parts of the literary heritage with which every book must come to terms. Loosely based on Homer's Oddysey, and riddled with references to Dante, Shakespeare, and the Bible, it shows both a tremendous respect for man's wish to put his life into words and an ironic distance from every specific attempt to do so. There were indeed many times I found myself thinking that I was reading the perfect book, the &quot;novel to end all novels&quot;.Nonetheless, in the end I concluded - albeit hesitantly - that Ulysses is a flawed gem. There are two aspects of the book that make it so. First, there are the constant allusions to Irish folk music. Indeed, large parts of Ulysses (and not only the Sirens chapter) read as though they should be sung. While this certainly adds a layer of meaning to the book for everyone who knows these tunes, it makes for frustration with everyone who does not. Moreover, with the inclusion of this fickle and all too transitory form of art, Joyce has strongly connected his novel to the early 1900's. While this might have been his intention, it detracts from the novel's universality and its ability to transcend the boundaries of its time. Even now, 75 years after its publication, I often felt like I was gazing at a world which is both completely lost and partly incomprehensible. The second major flaw is the apparent lack of structure between the episodes. While every episode itself is highly structured, and one of the main joys in reading the book is to gradually discover these structures, I could not help but wonder why certain structures were chosen, and how they relate to each other. The prime example of this is the Ithaca episode, in which Joyce has turned some rather mundane events into an elaborate catechism of questions and answers. While hilarious at times, this structure seemed highly arbitrary to me. I am quite sure that many interpretations of this aspect of Ulysses have been given in the secondary literature, but the essence of structure - as in poems - seems to me that it should invite the reader to understand it: the reader should see glimpses of a larger whole in order to start looking for it. Unfortunately, in Ulysses I did not find myself invited, but more often the subject of some incomprehensible joke of the author.I am well aware that both flaws are only so on the basis of some (probably outmoded) theory of literature, and that they can both be turned into major beauties of the book. Nonetheless, I think that Ulysses is the prime example of a book who wishes to be perfect, but which, unfortunately, is not."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"Like everyone who've read the book, i saw ulysses very complicated and hard to read.

I think part of the reason that many readers have difficulty with the novel, though, is that they approach it similarly to other reads. Personally, I think this is a mistake.Ulysses is, in my opinion, the literary equivalent of improvisational jazz. Improvisational jazz is considered by many musical professionals as the purest of music. Jazz performers find it thrilling, joyful, and simply without comparison to other musical forms. Yet, many others consider it boring and difficult to understand. I think at least part of the reason for this is that it lacks the musical structure to which we are all programmed to respond to. Many people have no frame of reference to place it in.In a literary sense, I think Ulysses shares these aspects in many ways. Many passages are difficult to understand, especially if one seeks a familiar literary structure within which to place it. And yet, if one steps out of the box a little and takes the time to appreciate its poetic lyricism, to allow the words to flow without necessarily seeking to place them within that familiar structure, some otherwise difficult passages can be reached at level different from other novels. The normal reader's desire to understand the passage in its purely contextual form is lessened. The end result is that the novel becomes a less daunting read.Ultimately, though, I give it only four stars. Irrespective of a reader's approach, too many brain cells have to fire for too long to get through it (its over 1000 pages long).

Many of the points made by detractors of Joyce and Ulysses are valid, in fact most of them are. Even Yeats who praised the book confessed that he never finished it. But that is indicative of some peculiar choices by Joyce, for instance, the Third Chapter is intentionally unreadable. Joyce apparently did this to make a point about the mentality of the educated Irishmen, such as himself, who had the tendency to make themselves irrelevant to their countrymen. He did this by filling the entirety of the chapter with verbiage so obtuse and obscure that even educated people would have trouble telling you what's actually happen, which isn't much, they guy just sits there on the beach and feels sorry for himself. If I had not been in a Module whereby the Lecturer explained that this is essentially unreadable I surely would have put down the book forever.There are many points of interest for me in the book, I highly suggest reading the last chapter by itself as its prose is quite enjoyable and really provides of portrait of a time and a place and a people. It's not really necessary to read the book stait through, as my good friend and classmate (though he never took this course) explained it to me: \\"Ulysses is a book which is never intended to be finished, you just pick it up and open it up anywhere and start reading and when you can't take it anymore, you put it back down.\\"In regards to this book, if it can help provide the insight I needed to help me understand Ulysses I would say it is worthwhile, but my experience is that these books never do that, they just tell you what they think it is you should know about the famous book, banking on the name-recognition of the book and the author, knowing full well that most people has never read enough of the book to refute them.It was a strange thing for Joyce to do in his effort to \\"write the greatest book in the English language\\" where the result was really much more (and then again sometimes less) then a book at all. The volumous \\"story\\" - we'll call it that for lack of a better word, really became an entity within itself because he hi-jacked the English language to make statements by the use of the text itself rather than within it, and within the hundreds of pages he hid what was considered pornographic imagery, knowing full well that those who would take exception to it would be hard pressed to actually read it for themselves. The result was so un-approachable that he actually had to tell people that it was a parallel to the Odyssey (despite the name) and provide notes on how to interpret it. If this was any other book this would signal the utter worthlessness of the book, but what Joyce did, and which has never been recreated, is the exception, if you are ready to accept it for what it is, and what it isn't: a good story.The story itself, is rather boring and uninteresting, this was part of Joyce's design though. He was making a statement about Ireland by making this incredibly uneventful and uninteresting story and then contrasting it with the heroic tales of Odysseus. There-by making the Joyce-equivalent all the worse by comparison. Like I said, it makes the story itself boring, but it's interesting if you know that going in, thank goodness Joyce provided the author of the first literary analysis of Ulysses with his notes!Even though I whole-heartily agree with many of these points on their own, I believe that Ulysses is an import book to peruse, if not read. And it should not be dismissed in its entirety. However for an enjoyable work by Joyce I highly suggest something else, such as Dubliners, where the short story form restricts Joyce from getting to ostentatious."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"I will admit it took me atleast two times the amount of time to read this as most books but,it was worth the time.

But, how to acomplish yhis ambition, when Romeo and Juliet and Anna Karenina is allready written? Joyce's solution is to redefine what the concept of a Great Love novel is all about. Instead of regarding the reader as someone to ammuse and seduce - someone that has the passive role of observing the story, Joyce combats the reader and makes the readers experience of reading the book as a crusial part of his story.Even the 16th of May 1904 was a long time ago and happend far away as Joyce wrote Ulysses in Trieste, Zurich and Paris from 1914 to 1921, Joyce describes virtually every detail that happened in Dublin that special day, long ago, far away. Even the fact that James Joyce wasn't much of a husband, drinking heavily when he had money, often was out of work and in conflict with his family because of his drinking, spending and unemployment, working on Ulysses - against his doctors strict orders as it would make him blind - when he was in a state of working, his wife hanged on to him all this time. In the same way the book appears difficult to read, and goes on \\"forever\\" in the sense of pages, places and number and level of hidden meanings you can dedicate alife to, Ulysses simply gets too much for many of its readers, making them give in, regarding it to complicated, difficult to understand, simply not worth the effort. In the same manner, the most obvious conclusion to draw from a marriage with James Joyce, might be that it was not worth the effort. As soon as I understood that this probably was exactly the point Joice was trying to make though, it was like I would not and could not let him prove that he was right and unlike my previous attemts to finnish the novel, I succeded. Blessing or curse - I guess this feeling of denying to give in, is excactly what can make a relatationship like this go on.As far as I know, Joyce is the first writer to introduce this projective way of writing - integrate the readers feelings and reactions to what he reads as a vital part of the story. After though, this projective writing is used by several writers - for instance when Bret Easton Ellis writes in a manner that makes the reader of American Psycho feel as bored as his main character Patrick Bateman feels - illustrating that he has more in common with you and me than we care about, or when Jerome David Sallinger in A Perfect day for Bananafish at the last line of the shortstory makes you realize that he has wrapped you arond his little finger all the time, manipulated you to think what he wants you to think, feel what he wants you to feel, leaving you with the predjustises that he wanted you to have , in order not to make you see the fatal conclution.It is obviously other ways to read Ulysses. You find a lot of them in the other customers review. It can be a good advice to put a copy of the so called Ulysses schema in the book when you try to read it, to make it easier to orient in time, space and theme. Make an internet search and you will find it.I hope you will finnish Ulysses with a sense of having read something that made it worth-while:)"},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"If I never read any of his other books, this one alone would make Joyce my favorite author. It isn't a book for everyone, but if you're patient with it, it's a very rewarding read. This book is one of a handful that gets consistently better with each reading. The first go is the hardest, but I encourage you to finish it. Joyce said that he wanted to paint a portrait of Dublin so complete that if it were to disappear, it could be recreated from what was described in his book. I don't know how true that statement is, but I have never read a more complete description of human nature as that presented in this book."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"If you intend to read ULYSSES here are a few suggestions.First off, read or reread Homer's The Odyssey, from which Joyce's seminal work is based. Aside from the Dedalus/Telemachus, Bloom/Odysseus, and Molly/Penelope parallels, each book in Joyce's novel reinvents equivalent parts of the Greek epic. You will gain a much greater appreciation of Joyce's achievement in transposing and reinterpreting a 10 year mythic and epic journey in ancient Greece to a 1 day journey in early 20th century Dublin.Secondly, don't come in expecting to understand everything. Many have tried and quit after reading a few parts, daunted by the strange syntax, the disjointed time frames, the shifts from waking to dream states, and the lack of traditional narrative replaced for the most part by stream of consciousness (internal monologue) to develop the plot. Joyce plays around a lot in ULYSSES, changing narrative styles, dialects, inventing words. You can't breeze through it. It requires a lot of patience to get through ULYSSES..to appreciate what Joyce has accomplished. It's always tricky categorizing a great work, but being that it's a novel about thought processes I guess you can say it's beyond realism..call it super realism. This is literature as a ground breaking art form. Joyce broke rules, but so did Picasso, and ULYSSES is kind of a literary Cubist masterpiece.Finally, after getting through ULYSSES (if you can), read the voluminous critiques on it. Read about the author. Do further exploration. Then read ULYSSES again. Multiple readings certainly enhance the experience, and bear fruit which are hidden or unripe enough to initially enjoy and appreciate."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"I recently returned from Dublin where I met many Irish people and native \\"Dubs,\\" as they call themselves.

I followed along as he read and began to understand the rythm of the text. \\"Ulysses\\" became exciting instead of imposing.Jim Norton is truly gifted: Great voice and wonderful imagination."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"Despite what the reviewer from MA had to say about this novel, it is readable and it should be approached by anyone who is interested in it. It is not an easy read, but then again, really innovative and engaging works never are. Joyce does something in this novel that few authors have the courage to do--trust the reader's intelligence.Yes, this is a retelling of The Odyssey, but even without that framework, the novel stands by itself. The story picks up about a year after Joyce's novel A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man leaves off with some of the same characters, notably Stephen Dedalus. But the protagonist of the work, Leopold Bloom, is the real stroke of genius. It might help to read Portrait before approaching Ulysses just to get an introduction to Stephen and his family. Anyone who really wants to get as many allusions as possible should probably use Gifford's annotations, which are available for both texts.As for our friend from MA...well, what can you say about someone who is reviewing the Cliff's Notes version of the text? Is that what Poly Sci majors read in order to try and feel intelligent as English majors?Do not be afraid; you can read this book. If you are afraid of starting a book that is so long by yourself then get some friends or family involved and read the book out loud to each other. It's marvelous."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"From the beginning of anyone's Joyce readings, he automatically assumes a powerless position. In Dubliners, we are walking through a labrynth of short stories connected only by theme and setting, paralysis and Dublin. We see the same theme and setting in A Portrait. Ulysses, though, presents Joyce's labrynth at its most complex. Unlike other more traditional novels, the chapters in Ulysses have almost no connections from one to the next. Rather, Joyce presents a series of coincidences and seemingly unrelated events within one day. The navigation of the novel in most places becomes rather belaboured, especially &quot;Oxen of the Sun.&quot; Like the epic it was modeled after (Odyssey), Ulysses includes moments of divine intervention. However, a Ulyssean intervention is made by either Joyce or the reader rather than by a Greek God serving as a deux es machina. The plot of Ulysses is the plot of the modern hero in the greatest epic of all, life. The novel is the most intricate, and probably the most realistic novel ever. I say it is the most realistic even though it has many moments of disillusionment with knowledge that we all go through many moments of disillusion throughout each day of our lives. The characters, just as the readers, are hopeless in the grand scheme of things. Fate, rather than the human hand, controls all of us. If you feel like trampling through a labrynth of deeply insightful and, at times, awfully confusing epiphanies, then Ulysses is for you. The labor involved in the reading makes its brief moments of understanding (the epiphanies) all the more worthwile. After all, you have to go through hell to come out right."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"Due to the recent explosion of fame of this novel, many literature lovers have gone out to buy the book (or get it from a library,) to at least see what the hype is all about, if not to actually enjoy it. Unfortunately, many of these literature lovers enjoy not just reading, but the atmosphere of reading--curling up in bed or in a plush recliner after work and shutting off the outside world to live with the characters for a few hours. These readers generally throw Ulysses away before getting past the third chapter because they realize that no such reading atmosphere is possible with such a complex novel. To those interested in reading the novel, I offer two suggestions: first study a little Irish history, particularly about Charles Stewart Parnell, Daniel O'Connell, Arthur Griffin and Sinn Fein, the Fenian movement, etc. even if you just peruse encyclopedia articles. Second, read the Don Gifford notes for the novel along with Ulysses itself. This will constantly interrupt your reading of the novel, but it will help your understanding. If you are completely unwilling to put in this effort, buying this book will be a waste of money. But even if you don't think you would be willing to read a novel that requires so much initial research for basic comprehension, consider this: If Ulysses is really as good as its fans claim, you will want to go back and read it a second time, and then you will be able to enjoy it without constantly referring to notes, history texts or foreign language dictionaries."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"This edition corrected hundreds or thousands of mistakes that were in the 1961 edition. When Ulysses was originally published, it had to be typeset in france because english printers could be prosecuted for \\"pornography\\". These typesetters didn't know english and made a lot of mistakes. Joyce's corrections (he often worked backwards to develop certain themes) were scrawled onto (at least) two sets of galleys and many of them were never included. In addition to that he was going blind and missed a lot of typos which thus came to seem intentional. Ulysses is (IMHO) the greatest book of the 20th century and demands careful and close reading. With the 1961 edition, which I read through several times before this one came out, I was left with many obscurities (such as Bloom having a watch in one chapter and needing to ask someone the time in a later chapter) to ponder which, it turns out, Joyce never intended, as well as struggling through passages than made no sense at all. This is still a very difficult book to read, but there's far less that's inexplicable in this edition. The difference is analogous to hearing cleaned-up CDs (of, say, Robert Johnson) as opposed to tapes made from shellac records with all the pops, scratches, and hisses on them."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"Ulysses is Leopold Bloom - husband of Molly, father of Milly, advertising canvasser, lover of \\"the inner organs of beasts and fowls,\\" Jew, atheist, untutored but curious and sympathetic observer of the world around him. On June 16, 1904, Bloom has breakfast, defecates, attends a funeral, goes sporadically about his work, has lunch, visits the library, has a heated discussion with some Dublin barflies, masturbates discreetly while enjoying the view afforded by a conveniently reclining shop-girl, falls in with some drunken medical students, visits a brothel, and tends to an obnoxious young hipster-intellectual, whom he brings home for a cup of coffee and a chat.That's what \\"happens,\\" but over the course of Bloomsday we are invited into the life and times of the most fully and brilliantly realized character in world literature. As Bloom strolls around Dublin, and the novel records fragments from his endlessly fascinating internal monologue, his life slowly comes into focus: he is of half-Jewish descent; he is married to a voluptuous beauty named Molly who, Bloom knows, will spend the afternoon getting a thorough seeing-to by a well-hung local playboy; he has a daughter, but his only son was still-born, since which time his marriage has been largely dysfunctional; his father committed suicide; he is carrying on a clandestine correspondence with a married woman; but at the core of his uxorious being remains Molly, his mind returning time and again to their courtship and the happy early years of their marriage.We learn much, too, from his interactions with his fellow Dubliners. Throughout the day Bloom endures a steady stream of anti-Semitic bigotry, ranging from the casual to the (comically) violent. Bloom is an outsider, a humane and free-thinking man in a city of parochial bores. He is also, in Joyce's words, \\"a good man,\\" a man who takes it upon himself to collect funds for a recently widowed woman and spontaneously helps a blind man cross the road. Most endearing of all, however, is his boundless curiosity, his wonderful (if often ill-informed) observations of people and things. When he looks at his cat he ponders: \\"Wonder what I look like to her. Height of a tower. No, she can jump me.\\" \\"Good puzzle would be to cross Dublin without passing a pub,\\" he muses later. Or: \\"Wife locked up at home, skeleton in the cupboard. Allow me to introduce my. Then they trot you out some kind of a nondescript, wouldn't know what to call her. Always see a fellow's weak point in his wife.\\" Or: \\"Back of everything magnetism. Earth for instance pulling this and being pulled. That causes movement. And time? Well that's the time the movement takes. Then if one thing stopped the whole ghesabo would stop bit by bit.\\" Or: \\" Curious she an only child, I an only child. So it returns. Think you're escaping and run into yourself. Longest way round is the shortest way home.\\" And so on.Bloom, his mind and his life, - like the city he lives in - comes into focus bit by bit, like tiny pieces of a dazzling mosaic slowly coming together before your eyes. With unnerving prescience, Joyce has created a genuinely modern Everyman (he works in advertising!): deracinated, middle-class, tolerant, suburban, he's a little bit like you and me, making a go of his modest existence with a redeeming dignity.The final chapter belongs to Bloom's wife Molly, who lies in bed next to her husband and reflects - in eight astonishing unpunctuated sentences - upon the events of her day and her past, throwing new light upon what we think we know about Bloom and his marriage. Big-bosomed, generously-bottomed Molly is Woman with a capital \\"W\\". Where Bloom is intellectual, reflective and logical, Molly is impulsive, florid, instinctive, sensual. The faithless Molly is an improbable Penelope, but as she concludes with the ecstatic recollection of her courtship with Bloom atop a hill overlooking Dublin bay, and with her climactic Yes - to her husband, to life - it all makes perfect, glorious sense.Next to Joyce's latter day Ulysses - and his Penelope - the stylistic fireworks of the novel are of secondary interest, a brilliant means to an end rather than a legitimate pretext for anorak-like fixation. You'll get more out of Ulysses the more familiar you are with Homer, with the western literary and intellectual tradition, with the geography of Edwardian Dublin, and with Irish culture and history, but in truth you don't need any of those things. Here is a rich, nourishing, generous feast of a book: all you need is an open mind and a sympathetic interest in the world and the creatures that inhabit it.Finnegan's Wake is strictly for comfortably tenured scholars and tragic seekers of hermetic wisdom. Ulysses is for the rest of us. Just you try it on."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"First, please disregard the star rating. I had to choose something, but in this case, it's meaningless.I read Portrait of the Artist in college and found it absolutely wonderful. It influenced me to change my major and, to a degree, my life. I was sure then, as I am now, that Joyce is one of the greatest writers I have ever read. I therefore tried to read Ulysses several times, including just recently, and each time hit a wall after a few dozen pages. My most recent attempt was assisted by an extrinsic aid that summarized the chapters and elucidated some of the obscure references. I was determined to make a go of it; I pictured myself wallowing in a warm bath of self-satisfaction at having completed the book, and being able to mention to others (casually, of course) that I'd read it.I failed.I have read my share of stylistically difficult novels, and consider myself reasonably well educated. I could doubtless plow through the book with gritted teeth, determined not to let it get the better of me, but life's too short. I surely can't say it isn't a great work of literature (particularly since I've made barely a dent in it), but I would venture to say that you should not even try it unless you are prepared either to devote a few months of close study, with reference materials, or to miss eighty percent of what the author was trying to say and do. I can also say that I think it unlikely that you will genuinely enjoy the book unless you derive inherent satisfaction from conquering a difficult task, or are a scholar of literature of this genre.Not a beach book."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"Plot? There is no plot? Hath life a plot? I think not. Life is a continual process, ebb and flow, rising and falling, like plate tectonics, like the ocean:constant movement, sometimes building to grand, pulsing, God-quaking climaxes before receding back into everyday lifes slowly humming grey. But sometimes not. Don't approach Ulysses looking for a coherent arc of plot, you're going to be disappointed(again, it hasn't one). Approach it more like Lolita, less concerned with the subject matter than with the beauty of its language; each word is a live, crawling jeweled beetle gnawing and burrowing through the dung of a day in the life of ad salesman Leopold Bloom, flittering their wings, busszing and forminng new patters, cresting and swirling into a cone, a tetracylone around an ordinary day in the life of an essentially ordinary Man. It works like a silhouette:each word, like a wort, pimple, hair or other blemish on a face defines its shape, as does ulyesses a life in the context of a single day(cf Finnegans Wake), through long sonorous sentences and chapters brimming like a cistern full of noisy pink coffee, out of which meaning blooms like a bloody Liebestod-singing rose, grabbing you. Even still, there is no meaning-ordering modern life? There is no order.&quot;Der Inhalt ist in den Augen einer Eule&quot;. Using The Odyssey to parallel Blooms avoidance of Molly is but a simple ploy, an act of acceptance and defeat, a concession of escape and resignation-much like those little pimply puke potsmoke fourteen year olds who compare their lives to popular songs. Don't hide. The pure organic beauty-tragic, erotic, hilarious, pathetic, and ulimtately affirmative runs through this novel like a vein of gold ore. Pick it up. Enjoy it at length. Enjoy it many times over-the more you read it the more you get. Don't seek God in Ulysses-Joyce's brilliance could certainly back up his notoriously mammoth arrogance but he was no seer, no mystic, but a human, flawed just like any other-instead, enjoy its beauty, and in it(eventually, but with time you will)recognize yourself, and every other human being on Earth-for am Ende we are all Leopold Bloom(nee Virag)--therein."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"I won't review the book in detail, other than to say that I did enjoy it very much, and there were places where I laughed out loud (particularly when Leopold Bloom wonders whether or not Gods and Goddesses have anuses, then decides to resolve the matter by closely inspecting a statue at the National Museum).Also, to first time readers: just ignore episode 3. Many people enjoy Episodes 1-2 just fine, then get to episode 3 and stop dead in their tracks. Just skim through it or even skip it altogether. Ulysses is a book to be re-read, not just read once, so don't concern yourself with Episode 3 the first time through. It will make more sense if/when you reread the novel later. (And you should reread it, because you will be amazed at how easy it becomes once you're familiar with the basic plot).The main reason I'm posting this is to let readers, especially first time readers, know about an essay, \\"Art and Life, Nature and Culture\\" by Cheryl Herr, published in \\"James Joyce's Ulysses: A Casebook.\\" Most articles about Ulysses assume that you agree with the author that Ulysses is a great book, without taking the time to explain WHY it is a great book.

Some people get frustrated (I did) thinking that Ulysses is just one big puzzle that can be easily solved if you have the right \\"key,\\" making it seem mechanical, systematic, and just not fun.

It is by turns a desperate struggle to free writing from the literary straightjacket of convention, and an unctuous exercise in literary hubris. It is one of the most definitive products of the modernist movement then in vogue and shares the inconsistency, contradiction and schizophrenia that plagues that movement, constituting a rejection of bourgeois conformity on the one hand while on the other yielding accessibility only to a literary elite.\\"Ulysses\\" is many things: a literary experiment in variety and anti-style (different chapters are written in entirely different voices and forms); a rejection of Victorian conformity; a protest against method, structure and classicism; an attempt to transcend conscious boundaries; and not least, a gross and orgiastic display of literary exhibitionism.There were few contemporary works that dared to take the modernist movement to such extremes. Faulkner wrote similar stream-of-consciousness works but ultimately anchored his writings to a foundation of literary convention that allowed ordinary readers to understand him. Joyce, while ostensibly writing ABOUT ordinary people, never wrote FOR them. He was the ultimate literary snob who, by this time, had grown so infatuated with obfuscation that he would follow up \\"Ulysses\\" with the utterly impenetrable \\"Finnegan's Wake\\".There is something hypocritical about such an outlook: to extol the typical Irishman in writing that no typical Irishman could ever hope to understand; to reject not just established convention, but any appreciable sense of system at all; to push 'writing' entirely beyond the bounds of 'communication'.What saves \\"Ulysses\\" is that, with this work at least, Joyce does not yet go entirely over to the dark side. He goes right to the edge, but only playfully puts one foot over. Despite its calculated obscurity, its see-how-brilliant-I-am experimentation, its auteur elitism, he doesn't quite abandon content for form. This would be the last work in which he holds on to reality, and his decision to anchor his work in at least SOME recognizable conventions allows us to see where he is trying to go.This is a book that is far more important than it is either enjoyable or even readable. Its status as a \\"masterpiece\\" is problematic and misleading: since this honorific is earned if the work is judged by its incomparable technique and sheer audacity--but is undeserved if judged by its respect for the common man. This is a book written for literary highbrows--at times, one almost suspects that it was written solely for Joyce himself--and no one should feel obliged to wade through a morass of such literary contrivance. Those who do, however, can expect to glean many moments of brilliant revelation out of long stretches of teeth grinding frustration."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"Ulysses is, without a doubt, the greatest novel of the twentieth century. Although many great books have been written before and after its publication, nothing has equaled it, or even come close. It is, without a doubt, a true and lasting work of art.Ulysses is an immensely detailed, perfectly-crafted, often sordid account of the wanderings of certain Dubliners around their city on 16 June 1904, principally, Leopold Bloom, outwardly a Hungarian Jewish proprietor of a small business, but inwardly, a sensuous rags and tatters Hamlet, a man who has lost both his religion and his name; his adulterous wife, Molly; and Stephen Dadelus, a clever but pretentious young teacher, Joyce's alter ego. Joyce labored for years on Ulysses, amassing and checking facts and then, with a genius that has never been matched, drawing them all into various symbolic patterns that mirror the wanderings and ordeals of Homer's Odysseus, Joyce's own hero.In one episode, narrated by an anonymous Dubliner, Bloom enters a pub and politely declines a drink offered to him by a Nationalist, accepting a cigar instead. Despite numerous attempts to change the subject, the Nationalist rages on and on, grumbling about foreigners and strangers. Bloom eventually gets fed up; he defends himself and his race, jabbing his cigar for emphasis as he speaks. Eventually, though, Bloom is accused of true treachery against the Irish race--not standing everyone a drink when he is thought to have successfully backed an outsider in the Gold Cup horse race. The Nationalist explodes and throws a biscuit tin at Bloom as he quickly retreats.In Ulysses, this scene is funny, but it is also so much more. The Nationalist is the one-eyed giant Cyclops from whom Ulysses escaped by jabbing his eye with a burning stake. The tunnel vision and terrorism that are but a small part of the Irish race are fought by Ulysses/Bloom as he jabs his cigar at his tormentor. &quot;But it's no use,&quot; Bloom says. &quot;Force, hatred, history, all that. That's not life for men and women, insult and hatred. And everybody knows that it's the very opposite of that that is really life...Love.&quot;There are ironic devices used in Ulysses other than the Homeric one, including the one used so strikingly by Joyce in A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man (in which we were introduced to the character of Stephen Dadelus), matching the style of the narrative to the person occupying the foreground. As a Modernist, Joyce wanted this stylistic device to be &quot;visible&quot; rather than &quot;invisible;&quot; he wanted readers to develop an awareness of his technique, to identify, not only with the story but with the way in which he was telling it.Joyce had a message to deliver in Ulysses: he sought to tell the world of the people he had encountered; to describe their conduct and speech, to analyze their motive, to relate the effects the sordid, turbulent, disorderly &quot;world,&quot; replete with Irish whiskey and Irish ecclesiasticism, had upon him, an emotional and egocentric genius whose chief pleasure was self-analysis and whose chief preoccupation was in keeping a notebook filled with every incident he'd ever encountered and every speech heard, all recorded with a Boswellian fidelity.Although Ulysses is not impossible to understand, the book does test anyone's endurance as it is filled with fragments of songs, bits of other languages, lists, obscure references and Joyce's stream-of-consciousness style. Idiosyncrasies abound; from the early Dubliners, Joyce abjured &quot;perverted commas&quot; in favor of French-style punctuation.Reading A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man is one way to prepare for Ulysses. In that book we are introduced to Stephen Dadelus and we also have a chance to get used to Joyce's capacity to externalize his consciousness, to put down in words those things many of us would be ashamed to admit to thinking, even to ourselves.Unlike Odysseus, Joyce never returned home. He wandered around Europe, his eyesight failing, with his fiercely-loyal wife, Nora, at his side. It is Nora Joyce celebrates in the tremendous punctuationless passage that ends Ulysses.Although Stephen Dadelus, in his Parisian tranquility, would have pretended indifference to the praise heaped upon Ulysses, Joyce knew that he had created something special and lasting. &quot;O rocks,&quot; Molly says to Bloom, &quot;tell us in plain words.&quot; That is something Joyce never failed to do."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"This is a brilliant novel. And it will find its salvation not because it is a triumph of form--which it is. Admittedly it packs intellectual poetry into every syllable, carefully constructed. But this means nothing today. Joyce was the only modernist who seemed to know that eventually the modernist form would fade and people would just wonder why The Wasteland is so damn hard to read. This book will find a salvation because it is more classical than any other book in the 20th century canon. And because it is a realist work before it is anything else.Anyone who doubts that Joyce is a realist writer needs to take a glance at Dubliners. It is, more than likely, the realist tint of Ulysses that made upper crust elitists like Woolf dislike it. In his failed poet Stephen, Joyce offers a critique of the aesthete lifestyle. His hero, Bloom, is an impotent Jew suffering in sexual silence for the sake of his wife. The spiritual motivation of the book is a near-illiterate woman. There's little for the oversexed anti-semites of 1930s Paris to appreciate here.Joyce wrote this book for his wife. It is his gift to her; fill in the details, ask yourself why that particular day, and you will see how Ulysses is perhaps the most profound love ode in the English language since &quot;The Divine Comedy.&quot; It abolishes identity, language, politics, ethnicity and class in favor of a simple love poem. Read and be moved, but never say it is without content."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"It's a pity for so many out there that appreciating this remarkable novel requires a broad and good education. A grounding in the classics certainly helps - Homer, Dante, and Shakespeare, as some reviewers have noted. But, in addition, if you've read widely and can catch the parodies of, say, Gibbon or the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, or of journalism around 1900, you'll enjoy it even more.Even then, 'Ulysses' is set in a time and place which have faded - Dublin in 1904 - and there are a lot of topical allusions to the politics (e.g. Parnell and his fall, Zionist publicity for immigration to Palestine), music (operas and lighter musical libretti) and much else to create a world, a whole set of intersecting lives, perspectives and meaning.Joyce was a true polyglot, so the bits of Italian, French, Latin, and rhyming underworld slang, for instance, can strike people as just showing off - but they make the book much more than a recounting of a banal day in a narrow setting.Precisely for both reasons - the allusions which have by now faded, and the breadth of the intellectual experience the book provides - even the most well-read connoisseur of literature would probably gain something by referring, at least occasionally, to the annotations of a book like Gifford's. But once this is done for a bit of the book, it gets much easier not to lean on the annotations, and 'Ulysses' can be read on its own, coming back to Gifford to see what more can be added to fill in the multiple meanings and subtleties.'Ulysses' has to be read slowly. Joyce took seven years to write it, so why not spend a year or two to absorb it? I'd suggest that the right discipline in approaching the book is to read no more than a page or two a day, and to break off and come back to it as often as needed.But then, exactly as some of the reviewers suggest, if you don't have either the background or the time, maybe you should read something else. After all, a top listing by Modern Library or the opinions of others who've thought 'Ulysses' a classic, or the fact that the book is a staple of English literature departments at universities, shouldn't force anyone to read it. And if people don't force themselves to read something they don't like, maybe they won't find a need to call the book or the author names.Yet, in spite of the difficulties of access which make 'Ulysses' somewhat esoteric, it has a lot of verbal pyrotechnics. If you enjoy the sheer mastery of language, there's little to compare unless you go back to Shakespeare. More than that, in the finest humanist style of the high renaissance (Montaigne, and, again, Shakespeare)the world of 'Ulysses' is in the measure of man. There's all of life to be experienced in reading it: tragedy (the death of Stephen's mother, from which he is still recovering, of Bloom's infant son, vividly remembered, the suicide of Bloom's father, Virag, which comes back in Bloom's reveries); comedy (mockery of \\"high society\\" in a hilarious catalogue of names, of \\"high art\\" in a sketch of a dog's barking as if it were reviewed in appreciation of its poetic qualities; sexuality in its many aspects - a quite touching portrait, through her letters to her father, of Bloom's budding young daughter who has just begun to work, but also a nightmarish and hallucinatory scene with Bloom and Stephen in a brothel.Joyce's vision is kindly and humane. He mocks established religion (the blasphemy is quite amusing if you're not easily shocked),or the 'gods' of \\"nationalism\\" ('patriotism' if you wish), and many other '-isms'. But his low-key message is of loving one another, affirming life for what it is, and doing the best one can, with no easy guides.In the end, reading 'Ulysses' is a unique experience. If this review helps even a few more readers have it, I'll be satisfied. All the others should just relax and just read what they enjoy better!"},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"This is a fascinating book for those who have the patience and time to explore its intricate chapters and themes. Yet, it should not be forced upon anyone as required reading or for that matter anyone under the age of 21. The richess and complexity of the Circe episode alone earns a 5 star rating. Other episodes such as Cyclops, Ithica, Nausicaa and (of course) Penelope are memorable. There were times (Oxen of the Sun, Scylla and Charrybdis) that I just did not have the energy required to continue, but on the whole, a worthy venture.It particularly helps if you can identify with the eroding dreams of either Leopold Bloom or Stephen Deedalus. That is why it may appeal to those who their 20's just making their way out in life or those who middle aged such as myself, who reflect upon what has gone down and what is yet to come."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"1. When you tried it in college, it was a task, a challenge, an intellectual mountain to climb, a test of your literary mettle. Perhaps if you read it apart from any course, as I did, you felt you failed.2. In the intervening time you've read perhaps hundreds of Modernist and post-modernist novels by Joyce's acknowledged progeny, those whose numbers are legion: from William Faulkner to Beckett to Barth to Perec to Eggers to Coover to Calvino to Kundera, from \\"Wittgenstein's Mistress\\" to \\"Wittgenstein's Nephew,\\" from Jeanette Winterson to Louis Paul Boon and Gilbert Sorrentino to Peter Handke. These you have relished and enjoyed tremendously. Why, then, not tackle their progenitor, the master himself, again?3. A book is no longer in any way a notch in your belt; you read for enjoyment, enlightenment, enrichment, a sense of connectedness, all the right reasons and some that aren't.3. You can start with your old paperback, and if Ulysses again proves too difficult, you can toss it aside, no harm done.4. If the old paperback falls apart and you find you're still reading, you can buy a new copy.5. You're not in such an all-fired hurry any more. You have the sense to adapt to Joyce's demands and slow down your reading speed, recognizing that this is like a prose poem. Take five minutes on one given page, what's the rush? The writing is finely tooled enough to deserve it.5. Your maturity allows you to see beyond the Masterpiece Syndrome and the Scholar's Paradise that Ulysses became to enjoy what a romp it is. This is fun! for God's sake. Joyce is forty different kinds of comedian, veering from irony to black comedy to sly humor to sheer buffoonery.6. Each section being in a different style is itself royally entertaining, and Joyce is masterly in all of them. This is a buffet prepared by a virtuoso chef, and if you hang onto your hat, it's exhilarating as all get out.7. The unexpected effect of all this variety is that the three main characters, Stephen Dedalus, Leopold and Molly Bloom are more vivid and real than they could possibly be otherwise. Various sections familiarize us with their intimate habits, personal effects, private thoughts, and the way others see them; and by regarding them through different stylistic lenses, Joyce effects unusual familiarity and allows these fictional entities to assume the palpability of real people.8. We feel great affection for these characters, and Joyce achieves this while depicting them not as highly exceptional, heroic souls but rather average, idiosyncratic and unremarkable people. Even the highly intelligent, poetic Stephen is a typically self-dramatizing, youthful romantic. And yes, though the novel is rife with comic turns, there is poignancy, great and generous humanity.9. The novel is a sensuous feast, the words chosen always with an ear for sound in the reciprocal service of memorable, ultravivid images. You can dog-ear a dictionary (to many disappointments, considering Joyce's flamboyant taste for arcana and neologisms) or not; your workable vocabulary will suffice for much, if not most, of the glorious language. In this regard Joyce is a wizard, a magician unsurpassed by any poet in memory.10. As another reviewer here noted, you will have the urge, once you've come to the last line, to immediately begin again. Keep your new copy handy. This is such a kaleidoscope, a ride of a book, that you'll want to read it a third time, soon enough."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"Ah, Ulysses. What can one say that has not already been said? It seems that everyone who has read it, and indeed even those who have not, has an opinion regarding Joyce's seminal work. And now, after finally turning over the last page, I hereby add my own name to the long list of critics who have attempted to analyze this novel, and who, although perhaps unwittingly, have also added to the length of the grin on the face of its author--that eloquent literary trickster, that infuriating kicker-of-the-wheels of language, old double J himself.What immediately strikes you upon reading the first few pages of Ulysses is that, despite the cloud of mystique surrounding it, it is only a novel--a collection of words written by one man. It is not, as some would have you believe, some sort of prophetic vision of mankind, a work of art so highly conceived and perfectly executed that it transcends all space and time. No, it is only, as all books are, a story. And thereby it can be reduced to this: a man wakes up, walks around, and then goes to sleep. If you're looking for anything more than that, then keep looking--because you won't find it here. It is simply the story of one long (and I do mean long) day.But the plot is of little importance in this book. What the author wants you to focus on is style and meaning; and there is plenty of both to go around. In fact, there is too much. When Joyce attempts to reconstruct the evolution of the english language in a mock birth of modern speech and literature, he crosses the line that separates amusing people from annoying ones. In passages throughout the book--too numerous to mention in this limited review space--you often get the urge to say to its author, &quot;Okay, that's enough; we get it already.&quot; But on and on he goes, confusing you, irritating you, making you wish you had never started reading this damn book in the first place. So why keep reading, you ask? Because there are parts of the book, again too numerous to mention, that for sheer beauty and clarity of description rival anything ever written. Joyce's portrait of a grizzled old sailor in a scene towards the end of the book quickly comes to mind as a shining reminder that there are rewards for making the long and sometimes frustrating journey on which he wishes to take you.And that, I suppose, is what Ulysses is all about. You love it at times, you hate it at times, but by the time you reach the end you feel, well, something. And no more should we expect of our authors."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"Symbolically, Ulysses follows Homer's the Odyssey; literally, it follows one-day in the life of a Jewish-born Irishman (an anomaly, to be sure), Leopold Bloom.First, whoever gives this book less than five stars does not respect the English language or English literature.Second, whoever picks-up this book expecting to enter the temple of profundity is in for a big shock: this book is, and was meant to be, very funny.Third, this book actually is profound, which is due to Joyce's genius and broad learning, not due to the book's intention, which was to recreate the novel and rival Shakespeare in word-play (both of which Ulysses does very well).This book treads from the extremely scatological (Joyce humorously describing masturbation as a &quot;honeymoon with the hand&quot;), to the very highest planes of human thought, for instance at the beginning of the Proteus episode: &quot;INELUCTABLE MODALITY OF THE VISIBLE: AT LEAST THAT IF NO more, thought through my eyes. Signatures of all things I am here to read, seaspawn and seawrack, the nearing tide, that rusty boot. Snotgreen, bluesilver, rust: coloured signs. Limits of the diaphane. But he adds: in bodies. Then he was aware of them bodies before of them coloured. How? By knocking his sconce against them, sure. Go easy. Bald he was and a millionaire, maestro di color che sanno. Limit of the diaphane in. Why in? Diaphane, adiaphane. If you can put your five fingers through it, it is a gate, if not a door. Shut your eyes and see.&quot; In these short lines, we have a fairly complex argument about the nature of reality; from the Aristotelian argument of knowing things through their transparency or translucence, &quot;diaphane&quot;, to Dante, maestro di color che sanno, &quot;master of those who know&quot;.But don't take it from me: go read this book; and if your befuddlement becomes too great, do what I did, and pick-up a good Annotation--even Cliffs Notes--but don't say it's crap just because you can't read it like you do John Grisham."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"Unfortunately, the first edition of *Ulysses* to be published in Dublin is not the edition of this book which anyone should read first. Danis Rose's decisions to normalize punctuation and spelling, to make intrusions into Joyce's prose on the basis of his own criteria of syntactic and semantic coherence rather than on textual evidence, and to re-insert apostrophes into Penelope (although he prints an alternate version of the chapter in an appendix) are only barely justifiable in terms of his own theory of editing -- and entirely alien to the &quot;normal&quot; practices of scholarly textual critics. This is quite a shame, because some of Rose's work on the manuscript evidence (as it is described in his introduction, quite interesting in itself) might potentially be of great importance to the textual study of *Ulysses*. Without an apparatus criticus, however, no one can tell for sure. Although (as Rose himself points out) there is and can be no absolutely &quot;definitive&quot; *Ulysses*, there are better places to start. Read Hans Walter Gabler's 1984 edition, keeping in mind its limitations (or, if you want a student's edition with good notes in the volume, use the reprint of the 1922 first edition, edited by Jeri Johnson for OUP, taking care to check out some of the more important alternate readings in Gabler's text). For those interested, a forthcoming issue of *James Joyce Quarterly* will include extensive discussion of Rose's edition and its merits."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"I think Jonathan Franzen had it about right when he compared Ulysses to a great, Old World Cathedral packed full of iconography. Tourists wander in, snuffle about, pick up the odd snippet that they find aesthetically pleasing without ever coming close to comprehending the depth of the whole thing; then there are the fanatics who consult with the priestly critics who can comprehend its mysteries. On top of this the state certifies the thing as great art (Ulysses is a huge national institution in Ireland - it has spawned a great Joyce industry (even though he lived most of his life as an exile from Ireland) and the 100th anniversary of the day on which Ulysses is set was marked by native Dubliners parading round the streets in stockings and boaters).Ulysses is a hugely difficult book (though not as bad as the impossible Finnegan's Wake), made doubly so by the fact that it is so reader unfriendly. I suspect most people read Ulysses because they have heard it is the ultimate literary challenge, plough through it with some difficulty, skimming large parts, picking up the odd stylistic triumph that keeps them going, then breathe a huge sigh of relief when they have finished it.If you still insist on reading Ulysses, I recommend 'The New Bloomsday Book' by Harry Blamires which offers a page by page readers guide to the book's contents. But really, unless you devote months of scholarship and read a multitude of supplementary texts, you won't fully grasp what is really going on."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"This version is NOT annotated, in spite of the claim. The book itself is of course a classic of literature in the English language...but do not expect any annotations (and this is a book which would be much helped by annotations)."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"This is in the eyes of most literary critics the greatest novel of the twentieth century, and a major addition to the Western literary Tradition. So much has been said about it in so many ways that I will free to chip in my less than two cents without doing the reviewer's ordinary task of describing the work, and telling the reader what it is all about. Bloomsday is a day on the literary calendar of the world. And Daedalaus, and Leopold Bloom and Molly are with K. and Falstaff, and Sancho and Pickwick in the cast of world - literary creations whose image is part of the collective human consciousness generation to generation as most real human beings are not.Ulysses is not easy to read even if one takes a Gilbert Stuart or some other modern guide , and figures out what each section with its own separate style, technique, theme parallel in the Odyssey is all about. And there are parts and not simply small parts which bore in their incomprehensibility as only Finnegans Wake will exceed. But there are also, and this is all through the work great lyrical passages of course culminating in Molly Blooms yes I said I will yes. There is too I suppose the particular pleasure of trying to figure out all these literary mysteries and these hidden hints in the multi- layered language of the text. Already Joyce here is moving toward the creation of his own language and the portmanteau and pun principles are richly at work. In Oxen of the Sun he writes the history of the English language parodying its styles. And the whole theme of parodying rewriting alluding to the great work, and somehow superseding it are in the frame of the work ( Before Bloom and before Daedalus there was a real Ulysses) Joyce's effort to write in one day the whole of human experience and to make too of the form of catalogue encyclopedia a higher way to art is part also of the transformation of popular forms into the highest art forms. Shakespeare did it on many levels and so must Joyce, as Hamlet Daedalaus reminds it. Ulysses at publication time was revolutionary to many in its putting on the page the lusts and obscenities , the sexual thoughts and even ' experiences' of its characters. It too broke the frame of convention in a whole host of other ways including through the shifting centers of its narrative consciouosness- the way it tells and does not tell its story. The sheer lyric musical beauty of Joyce's prose is poetry at its best .And the epiphanies on oval leaves are revelations of the beauty in language itself its sheer joyful joycean playing. And how can I having read through with dismay so much of the hidden and not so hidden anti- Jewish character of so many in the Tradition not be hearted by the warm feeling which flows toward the good souled Leopold Bloom. If I were to complain about graduate school time reading through the longest longeurs in Joyce I would nonetheless always keep in mind that one wee bit of an Irishladdie allalone went out there and by himself only made a masterpiece all mankind can make its own by reading and rereading before running on to riverun from bend of bay to swerve of shore past Howth Castle and environs"},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"I run these Donal Donnely disks continually just for the sheer joy of the language.

The Modern English Library rated James Joyce's magnum opus the greatest English-language novel of the 20th century. Was their judgment correct? Perhaps (though a Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man does not fall far behind). However, Joyce's novel, which traces the misadventures of Stephen Dedalus, Leopold Bloom, and then Molly Bloom, is of course an echo of the Odyssey. It is also an affirmation of the Hebraic and Hellenic cultures in the West. But that is not really how it should be read. Ulysses is perhaps even more difficult to comprehend now than it was when it was first published in Paris through the Shakespeare Book Co., because Joyce alludes to modernist Irish literature, art, and architecture with breathtaking speed (though it is still far more cogent than Finnegan's Wake). However, you must read Ulysses, it is a rich cathedral of European artistry, from Joyce's command over the vernacular to his groundbreaking \`stream-of-consciousness' form. The first section of the novel deals with Stephen, and it can be regarded as a kind of carry-over from a Portrait of the Artist (though a bit more accomplished in form), while the middle section deals with Bloom, one of the strongest characters in the history of Western literature, and certainly one of Joyce's greatest achievements. Bloom is the thrust of the novel. He is the middlebrow that bridges Stephen (the intellectual) with Molly (the tramp), and his observations are the most lucid and revealing about the state of civilization at that time and place. But Ulysses is always funny, and moving and beautiful at the same time. The closing of section one ought to illustrate the strange majesty of Joyce's prose: \\"He [Stephen] turned his face over a shoulder, rere regardant. Moving through the air high spars of a threemaster, her sails brailed up the crosstrees, homing, upstream, silently moving, a silent ship\\" (51). This curious novel, which unfolds over the course of a single day, will undoubtedly continue to astound and perplex readers and scholars eternally. The way to work your way through Ulysses if it is your first time, is to be mindful of the details; Don Gifford's Ulysses Annotated is an excellent resource for a listing and explications of the more arcane allusions in Ulysses. Hugh Kenner's critical book is also a first-rate work of criticism for those who want further explication of the \`meaning' and significance of the work as a whole. For those who are truly courageous, you can begin to look into the Post-Modernist interpretations of Ulysses from fellows like Derrida and DeMan, but you should be wary of them, as they are often more complex than Joyce was to begin with."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"Ullysses is an Alice in Wonderland of writing styles.

If you put the book down half-way you are undoubtedly going to walk away disliking it-the final chapters really tie everything together and the Penelope chapter is vital to understanding the ideosyncratic bits of the text that leave you asking, \\"What?\\"I would not suggest making a go of it without buying \\"Ulysses Annotated\\" by Don Gifford. A lot of what he includes is superfluous unless you read the book for school, but it really gives such a greater idea of what Joyce is trying to do with this book, explaining the Odyssey stories for each chapter, stylistic intentions, and illuminating obscure references to Judiasm, Irish nationalism, character histories, food obsessions, etc. Without it the book will probably not have that much meaning for the reader, it's too complex.At first Stephen may seem annoyingly self-involved, Bloom a weak coward, and Molly a tart, but when you consider the themes Joyce is taking on-Irish nationalism, being an outsider, understanding another person in a way that allows you to accept their flaws, etc. their character \\"flaws\\" give way to another interpretation. Especially considering the novel takes place in a single day.The book definitely gets better as you read, so don't get frustrated, the end, while not idealistically upbeat as most novels tend to be, is really fitting and satisfying."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"I tried to read Ulysses when I was about 20. I couldn't get into it. The stream of consciousness put me off completely Now I'm over 60 and I greatly enjoyed the book. I could hardly put it down. The writing is beautiful. I just had to go out and get a gorgonzolia sandwitch with a glass of burgundy."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"I had this book described to me by a friend as both the best and worst book she had ever read. I can truly understand and appreciate her sentiments. Parts of the book are sheer poetry, and the descriptions and language draw the reader into the mystical brilliance of James Joyce's non-narrative. Other parts are maddeningly obscure and leave the reader wondering just what the hell is going on. The surprising part of this is that these obscure moments actually add to the book, rather than detracting from it. If &quot;Ulysses&quot; were not so obscure in so many parts, then the sheer mundaneness of much of the day would make it as boring as its detractors claim it to be, but the obscurity forces the reader to read attentively throughout. This is not a challenge enjoyed by all. This is not a light read, and if you're looking for a summer book by the cottage then stick to John Grisham and no fault to it (the light reads serve their purpose and should not be denigrated). However, if you're looking for a book that will test your imagination &quot;Ulysses&quot; is the perfect book. You probably won't fully understand it (I estimate I fully understood about 2/3 of it) but you will have learned much about yourself and the world of early-20th century Dublin and also of the world we live in today. Also, another reviewer here as written that this is a book to be read aloud. I agree whole-heartedly with that appraisal. It will add to both your understanding and enjoyment."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"Many people see Ulysses as perhaps a pretentious volume of over-rated nonsense which can only be appreciated by intellectuals and academics. This is not the case. By 'the consummation of all literature' I mean that it employs every style of language, every grand philosophical and theological theme. It unites styles of literature like playscript, monologue, soliloquoy, poetry, melodrama, fantasy, heroic, symbolism and makes use of all literary devices: bathos, puns, litotes, dramatic irony, hyperbole - fusing them not only into a story but into an Odyssey. It is the heroic storyteller's heroic story. It's context - modernism - is transcended and becomes what one would hesitatingly refer to now as Postmodern. By that rather glib statement I mean it uses all these disparate themes and unites them via the central character, Leopold Bloom. Leopold is the Modernist man - the manifold fragmented man who asserts a new identity by unification of his 'hundred thousand flaws'. Virginia Woolf tried to demostrate this in Mrs Dalloway by allowing no chapter breaks in her exploration of the semi-autobiographical heroine and thus totalising the sum of experiences. Where Joyce succeeds over Woolf is that he explores not only the totalisation but the totalisation of all relevant parallel events. Like a theorist of chaos, he explores the detail that affects the major life-forces and struggles. The parallel to Homer's Odyssey is emphasised by making the hero's journey so incredibly anodine on the one hand and so completely heroic on the other. Using the Homeric myth of Cyclops, Joyce explores the prevalence of anti-semitism, the Irish religious conflict, the pettiness of argument and theological truths in but one scene. Joyce's work is a classic, not in the way that Finnegan's Wake is - which explores the actuality of language, the song of words and music , but by taking a life in a day and writing about lives themselves and the world they inhabit. It sounds extremely pretentious to say it is the consummation of all literature, but no other book thus far, in my experience, comes even close nor attempts to tackle so much of what Joyce achieves. It is not only that Joyce sees a world in a grain of sand he sees, more importantly, the grains of sand in the world."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"While I have a number of quibles about what Random House/Modern Libary put on their 100 best list, I had no problem at all with what they put first. If I had to pick one book as the best book of the century, it would by Joyce's Ulysses. It's a book I first read about 25 years ago and have returned to it every couple of years since.Ulysses is a rich, complex book that works on many levels. Most people tend to focus on its experimental prose, which Joyce used to both explore his characters and to widen the scope of his novel. But, beneath all of this, Ulysses is a novel of character, a profound look at the human condition. The book experimentation works because it is grounded on the story of Leopold Bloom, who is fundamentally a decent, likeable man. It's also the story of Stephen Daedalus, who, while somewhat of a prig, is a very intersting person, whose thoughts and ideas are exciting to follow.The more I think about it, the more I think that it'll soon be time to read Ulysses yet again."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"Yes, ULYSSES is a mainstay of college literature. Yes, the book is a worthy literary endeavor. But for those who are not brutally devoted to the endless pursuit of mind-numbing genius, ULYSSES is tiresome, tedious, and passe. The appeal of reading the mind wanderings of a pasty, weak pseudo-intellectual grows stale after the first dozen pages. For those enterprising readers such as myself who feel guilty dumping a Joyce work after only a chapter, read on. It gets worse. Confession: the genius mind-maze that is Joyce is sometimes just not worth exploring. One would have better luck escaping the Minotaur than successfully exiting this lingual labyrinth.

It is certainly not &quot;about nothing&quot;--those that say so are talking about its lack of a standard plot. It's about the relationships people build with one another. Look at the relationships depicted: Bloom's love for Molly despite her infidelity, Molly's love for Bloom despite the infidelity she percieves, Molly's purely sexual love for Boylan, Bloom's fatherly love for Stephen, Stephen's constant searching for paternal influence, etc, etc. Joyce examines in minute detail each one of these and allows the reader to come to his own conclusions about the characters and their feelings.It _is_ a difficult book. Stick through it; it's worthwhile. For me, it really started to come together around &quot;Oxen of the Sun&quot; (chapter 14). After &quot;Ithaca&quot; (ch. 17) I felt like I'd known Bloom all my life. And &quot;Penelope&quot; (ch. 18) is remarkable not for what it reveals about Molly, but for what it reveals about Bloom.If you didn't get anything out of _Ulysses_, you didn't read it carefully enough. I suspect many people pick it up without knowning anything about it, and I further suspect that many people who read it for a university course are only skimming it for essay topics (of which there are plenty). Get something like &quot;The Bloomsday Book&quot; to help you through it, read something about the book before you start to read it, read it carefully, and read it more than once. That's the only way you can get everything out of it."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"Yes, &quot;Ulysses,&quot; we are told, is a work of genius; yes, it is multi-faceted and pregnant with meaning; true, it may even be a compendium of all Western Culture since Homer. But, let's be honest: It's as fun as reading a telephone directory! One risks opening oneself up to the assaults of the junior college-educated parrot, who gleefully repeats what &quot;wisdom&quot; was imparted to him by his talentless and blustering English instructor. But for those of us not interested in posturing; that is to say, for those of us who actually read Mr. Joyce's work--yes, every last page! (and not at the behest of some school-drudge)--we can risk dispensing with the bombast and dogma to whisper our opinions in a voice sharpened with an edge of honesty. &quot;Ulysses,&quot; such as it is, is a bore. Few unread novels have enjoyed as much success. Such fame rests chiefly, however, on the fact that it is usually not touched . . . which, even if it were, it would reveal itself to be wholly incomprehensible--thus allowing any pseudo-intellectual halfwit to attach any meaning to it that he wishes. The truth, though? &quot;Ulysses&quot; is a satire--and a very tedious one--of Homer's wonderful Odyssey. But Homer's work is actually readable and entertaining! Sad, considering that the ancient Hellene is several thousand years removed from us and yet still has the power to spin a fascinating story. Joyce, however, has created--nothing! He borrows, he steals, he imitates . . . badly. For a true original; for a man of genius and an author who can actually write his own plots; one should look no further than Homer. Joyce? He's a pedant and an over-rated, long-winded bore."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"Ulysses begins where A Portrait of The Artist as a Young Man left off. Stephen Dedalus has left Ireland only to return to his dying mother. Just because you've read and understood Portrait, don't expect Ulysses to come quite as easily. It's rough going in spots but well worth the effort of getting through. In the process you will be taken through 783 pages that encompass less than a twenty-four hour period in the life of Stephen, the Blooms and Dublin. And what a day it is. Everything you might imagine happens, and much more than you ever could imagine also occurs. From the uneasy start of Stehpen's day to his boring job as a teacher he plods through his mind as he tries to plod through his life. In the course of the day a man dies, a woman gives birth, Stephen finds himself at the library discussing his theories of Shakespeare, Hamlet, and that paternity may very well be legal fiction. Also during this same day Leopold Bloom is going about his routine business in Dublin and finally fatherless Stephen meetssonless Bloom. They venture off into the night world where the present and past hallucinate in a theatre of the mind living nightmare that culminates with Bloom taking Stephen under his wing. And while all this was going on, Mrs. Bloom, Molly has had her own sort of day. The Blooms have an odd relationship yet manage to maintain a bond through their thoughts that neither of them does well in putting into words to one another. Whatever they do, they do with full thought and awareness of the other. What makes this book so terrific is the wide ranges in style that Joyce uses. Each episode is like a novel in itself. There is no boredom or tediousness to get through, the main thing that makes it difficult are the constant allusions and references that Joyce makes that may have you wondering at times just what is going on. There are a number of good books to refer to while reading Ulysses and they can make it easier, but even without them, it's worth plunging forward and reading it all. The novel covers everypart of human existance from the banal to the sublime. You will not be in doubt as to what these people are feeling or thinking, their stream of inner consciousness takes up most of the book. And what's great about that is in finding out what these people are about you can learn something about yourself that you were not previously aware of."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"I want you to decide for yourself. Ulysses, to some the masterpiece of all 20th century works, a glorious, sun-ravaged inspiring that is open to all nooks and encompasses all passion. Others call it ludicrious, pompous and dull; overlong; a frustrating exercise in pieceing together symbols. I want you to look over some of the other reviews and see for yourself the division between the pros and the cons; the academic justifications and the confused, ennerverated whining. The fans overpraise with unspeakable delight: believing themselves in the know--a fan of another person's excellence, a seer of all there is to know. You can scan the pages and glean all sorts of terminology, from the label of 'modernism' to the execution of 'stream-of-consciousness' (two indescribible approaches that cannot be so singularly defined as to explain just what, exactly, is going on). There are references to other experts' reviews, and the almost outraged frustration with which it is bespoken tells the person who couldn't get into it that somebody else out there has written about all the things you didn't like in the book and therefore it must be brilliance. The haters are less uniform in their scorn, although most of them summarize 'it didn't make any sense' in one form or another. There are rat-tat-tats of 'boring(s)' and machine gun slogans writing off this unquestionably influencial opus as something not even worthy of remembering.Me? I fall less in the middle and more to the side of scorn. It is a techically dazzlingly display--a rip-roar of English-Latin-Gallic with the cantor on fire and the rhythm in flames. Boom-boom-boom goes the glory of this lover of language who plays and who plays and who plays--trickling insight with the tickle of a feather and bringing the house down with a terse yet finely tuned phrase . . .The biggest problem is the story--a legitimate babble of voices talking over one another with a transformative center that can't keep anyone focused on what any of the characters is actually saying (the characters notice this too). The dialogue goes on for pages--twenty--fifty page stretches!--where no one seems to have the interest or attention span enough to keep things settled for a moment to even decide if any of them know what they're talking about. The topics shift abruptly--aloofly, it would seem--and the range of all of their interests is predictably limited. I can respect (and even admire) the effort to invoke this mindless clamor of Babel, and appreciate the consistancy that can redeem by none of them ever learning anything, but the end result is a story that no one can follow unless they had written it themselves.Ulysses is a book Joyce wrote for himself. No doubt it was joy--an endless experimentation from a frustrated (and rather pompous) author who finally felt justified at the publication of his previous two books. Ulysses, to me, reads as more of a show-off work. A man with great genius who wanted to prove to everyone just how great he could be. The problem is that he was boasting to himself. Here is a book about me me me! All passing to 'naturalism' or the 'realistic aspect' related in numerous grinding scences, are valid, certainly, but merely another label that cannot begin to describe the monster Joyce created here.In the end, an endlessly unpleasurable read that causes one to stop and think often, some of that time about setting the book aside and reading something better--"},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"What to make of Ulysses, that towering work of modernism that has been seen as both the hallmark of the age, and an impediment to later generations of writers trying to get out from beneath Joyce's long shadow?Ultimately, the worth of the novel can't be questioned, even if you do not \`like' the book. Perhaps no novel in the 20th century exerted (and continues to exert) so great an influence over the written arts. Lots of ink has been spilled about the novel. On this, my third reading of it after twenty years, I have this to say:Part of the challenge and thrill of the novel is Joyce's chameleon like ability to thrown on literary guises, while at the same time being intractably, even stubbornly, Joyce. He had few illusions about his genius, and wrote a work from that lofty standpoint. Although loaded with humor, dirty jokes, and common place incidents, Ulysses is an intellectual's novel, meant not to be read but re-read. It is nearly Talmudic in its dimensions. Dig deeper into a passage and you find multiple layers of meaning.Part of the challenge (and frustration for some) of this novel is its incredible restlessness. The first third of the novel features Joyce's famous stream of consciousness technique. Characters are minds in bodies, thinking a stream of thought, occasionally interrupted by some external datum.Here Joyce creates a kind of hyper-naturalism. It is as if he wishes to show readers that the naturalism of the preceding generations was nothing more than a fictive mask. Here is the closest we can get to the workings of the human mind in its social and psychological settings. He bends language get this. He coins new words. He leaves words dangling off and thoughts unfinished. In other words, he tries to reproduce how our halting minds actually think their thoughts.Once Joyce has accomplished this, he appears to repudiate it. We then get a variety of chapters written from certain literary standpoints (often mockingly so). It is as if Joyce is saying: this is literature too, a series of guises that we throw on and off at will. This is the lens through which people see the world. They are more than encapsulated minds. They also structure their worlds.So, Ulysses keeps the reader off kilter, and with a sense of sheer delight on the part of Joyce. We start over and over again, chewing on the same material and spiritual conditions of one day in Dublin over a hundred years ago.In the process much that is profound happens surrounded by a spectacle of mundane happenings. In other words, just another day."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"Is this the greatest novel of all time, or just a colossal waste of time? My experience is that reading Joyce's ULYSSES will indeed pay the reader great dividends for the time she put into it. However, I don't believe it's a novel that can be understood and appreciated without a great investment of repeated readings and consultation of outside texts. In fact, I don't think there's ever been a novel that requires that the reader consult at least a half dozen texts and repeated readings to not be totally bewildered by what the hell the author is trying to say.Here's why I say this. I read ULYSSES several times while in college. The first reading gave me absolutely nothing! However, because I was an English major, was deeply interested in Irish lit, and had the time, I gave the novel repeated readings and consulted dozens of secondary books and periodicals. Then I began to get somewhere. What before was a jumble of gibberish about Irish towers and bars and streets and a dog on a beach, before born baby boardman had bliss, shamefaced peaches clop clop clop introblio ad nauseam began to reveal the deeper currents underneath. And I feel it was all quite worth my time and trouble.So here's my advice for the new reader. The 1st reading should be accompanied by Cliff Notes (don't laugh) to get a basic idea of each chapter's theme. This will be a great help. Beyond that, the ANNOTATIONS book is a very good resource. Another secondary source on ULYSSES that I found very valuable and interesting was the many great pieces from THE JAMES JOYCE QUARTERLY on the novel. I hope that by now someone has digitally compiled all that scholarship so that it's not lost and forgotten in college library basements!Here's what I found out: Joyce's astounding accomplishment with ULYSSES is that he successfully layered multiple literary, religious, psychological, philosophical biological and historical structures in a single work. The 1st chapter alone is worthy of a full semester's attention in order to unravel and reveal the myriad references and their cross-associations. What we have here is modern scripture, and the largest literary puzzle ever. If intricate literary structure interests you, this is the magnum opus. I'm not risking overstatement to declare that ULYSSES could be called The Book of Life, as a key reason why so many scholars have lauded it as the greatest of novels is that it's the most voluminous and eloquent tale of living that's ever been written.But again, to share these scholars' opinion of this novel WILL require MORE work from the reader than she has given to probably anything else she's tried to read and really appreciate.

YOu will find there all the major themes written in an engaging style, and all the threads of the plot. Just jump there and the teacher will think you read the whole not-easily-digestible work.Each episode is a microcosm and a repeating or respeaking of the same themes. Cyclops probably presents these in the most immediately comprehensible way possible. YOu quickly realize that Joyce throughout the work is MAKING FUN OF THE WAY PEOPLE TALK AND WRITE, from the first turn-of-the-century style to Molly's final stream of consciousness tour-de-force. But throughout Mr. JOyce is doing PARODY, which is exagerrating and making fun of how we speak and write, onoly to show that his underlying themes are impossible to express in modern terms. and so in Cyclops we hear every voice from ancient heroic legend to modern ringside boxing reports and wedding reports.But the basic themes remain. Mr. Bloom most explicitly states here that Love must be the basis for human interaction, and this is expanded upon. Also and most explicitly are Joyce's political undercurrents, the vile and oppressive nature of the BRitish empire's military force, which continues today stealing oil in Iraq while destroying its cultural heritage. Joyce shows how the same happened to Ireland, destroying resources (lumber) and cattle (under the false pretext of hoof and mouth) and industry as a way to impoverish and enslve the once great nation. The direct indictment of the BRitish naval power is especially explicit. This is my favorite and funniest epsode at the same time. Listen to it around disk eighteen of the forty disk Donal Donnally recording.THen ask your teacher if the reason Stephen Dedalus (get it? Dead. Alas!) did not kneel to pray for his mother, keeps Kosher, wears black with head carefully covered and wanders alone and lost, finding company only with the alleged Jew Bloom, is that while in Paris between Portrait of the Artist as A YOung Man and this work, he realized he was not a Jesuit Catholic, but on his mother's GOulding side, a Jew, and he returns to Ireland in search of his Jewish community. THis will knock your teacher's socks off.Please realize that Mr. Joyce himself reported there is not a single serious word in his work, that it is all a joke about the poor way people write. Yet, while there is not a single serious word, the underlying themes are deadly serious matters of life and death, faithlessness in marriage, national identity in the face of brutal (British) imperialist rape and oppression, and the theme of love in all its permutations. Love eternal and carnal is the basis of this book.My original analysis of this monumental work I assume got reported and dumped, without my saving a copy, so let me only briefly say that you may want the Gabler edition for the most reliable text, even though it loses the important page sized capitals S, M and P as reproduced in the Random House, as well as the important large period or asterix answering the questions \\"Where?\\" and is famously poorly bound.Do get the Donal Donnally (sp.?) recording. Jim Norton's is ABRIDGED grotesquely. Donal's is complete and extremely well done. If you want the basic gist of the novel, listen to Disk eighteen and nineteen of the forty disk recording and you will get the basic message. Love loves to love love.I am sorry to have lost my complete review written here in Ulysses style for a flavor of the original. Who's knows what lines were offensive. This book is essential reading, and re-reading, but don't get me started or I might get reported again.Be sure not only to get the Annotated Ulysses, which focusses mostly on historical explanations of places and people, but especially the Schwarz \\"Reading Joyce's Ulysses\\" and the Sicari \\"Joyce's Modernist Allegory\\", both excellent beginning commentaries that will make the text and intent much clearer to any reader. But the serious reader interested in the deeper socio-historico eleements suggested by joyce should get Dr. Cheng's excellent critique on JOyce racism and colonialism, as well as Attridge's Semicolonial Joyce. And those who get way over their heads with Joyce ought to check out Joyce and G-Men how Hoover killed Joyce's novel in the USA.The Donal Donnaly recordings really bring the novel to life.You can find several other commentaries in all price ranges, some by professors eager for tenure and looking to publish or perish, and others that are really helpful. Try Hugh Kenner of course, and the ones which investigate the brutal colonial nature of Ireland's history which Joyce alludes to, to reflect on current world events. It is worth the effort. Even Joseph Campbell has interesting things to say, on how this novel inspired him to begin to explore our world's mythologies, masks and meanings.

In fact, much like the splatter-painting of Jackson Pollock, or the black-on-black canvases of Ad Reinhardt, or the silent compositions of John Cage, or the cut-ups of Wm. Burroughs or the pop lyrics of Bob Dylan, Ulysses has no real meaning at all--and that is its secret to success. When an artist has something important to say, he (or she) expresses himself with as much clarity as possible, just as a person who is shouting &quot;fire&quot; or &quot;wake up&quot; would. When he has little or nothing to say, he writes or paints or plays either right-brain stream-of-consciousness gobbledygook and calls it &quot;metaphor&quot; or &quot;exploring the unconscious&quot;, or presents minimalist nothing at all and calls it &quot;conceptual&quot;. He can then sit back for decades and watch the pseudointellectuals and tenured humanities professors invent endless meanings where there are none, whereas books that contain any clarity will slip into obscurity, since their meanings are obvious and leave the masters (and doctors) of hot air nothing to debate. Ulyssess is the all-time champion of this sort of thing; while many of modern art's similar hoaxes have long since been relegated to the proverbial dustbin, Joyce's obvious genius for manipulating words keeps this thing at the top of the charts among those influenced by academic pretense. The fact that those words are all surface and communciate not one idea of any significance to anyone is a something of a shame for serious people (who might waste time seeking them here, due to its reputation), but an absolute goldmine for the people who like to write glorified term papers about this glorified crossword puzzle and its like.

So I found it wonderful as a written work, with all the fun, strange and brilliant techniques Joyce used; but as a novel, as a story about people's lives, I really didn't have much interest. I was kept at a distance from the characters by Joyce's telling of the story, so that even when the characters were deep in frenzied monologues, I only heard Joyce's writing, and not the characters' actual voices.

James Joyce just wrote a book for you to enjoy. If you want to make a big hairy deal out of some Irish guy writing a book, you probably have no life, or else a Master's thesis to write. James Joyce just stuffed a bunch of language into a book he thought he might like writing. He was just trying to write something worth reading, like Mark Twain, or William Faulkner would. Get over yourself. Joyce took language a little farther out on a limb. He was just another writer trying to make love to English. Why would any writer not try to love a language as lovely as English? Joyce made love to English. Shakespeare was a true polymorphous lover of English. He was embarassing.

Sure James Joyce was a writer of some talent as shown by his early short stories and his Portrait of an Artist as a Young Man. But this book?When he wrote it Joyce was in the hands of the European artistic progressives. They had rejected the notion of contest in favor of form. That is hypnotized by that arch braggart Wagner they accepted the delusion that art must continually progress and change form. When he wrote art generally was subject to continual change in style. Picassos went through his various periods, French Art struggled through Impressionism, Cubism and so on.James Joyce moving in those circles felt that he had to reject the form and grammar of his predecessors. That is he had to reject the way of writing which made Dickens, Eliot, Austin and Conrad the giants of literature that they were. What in fact is wrong with the use of grammar and the English Language. It has given us masterpieces such as Shakespeare, Milton and Wordsworth.With Ulysses you can see a novel peeking out from behind the obscure language.

We also had noted that the book was on top 100 books of the century etc.. All of us decided the only reason this book could be recommended is because Joyce introduced a new form of writing called \\"stream of consisiousness\\". This style of writing basically goes into the character's mind and portray's his/her thoughts. This style at least in this book is very very had to follow, if no narrative is given in between characters thoughts by the author.

In art there was C&eacute;zanne, Seurat, and Picasso. In music Scriabin was experimenting with the melding of music and light.Artists were experimenting with form rather than looking at content. Sometimes these experiments worked other times they led to a dead end and were forgotten.Ulysses is an experimental novel, one that uses the form of stream of consciousness. The form is at the expense of its readability and clarity. What happened with Joyce's experiment, it limped through Finegan's Wake which is so impenetrable it barely rates as a puzzle and died. Ulysses as an experimental art form is a dead end, and with good reason.The sorts of things that made and make literature great are the sorts of things that Joyce rejects with his experiments in form. Literature is related to the content rather than the empty vessel of form.This of course is not to say that Joyce was without talent. It is just a shame to see that his talent was wasted as he became immersed with the fashions of the time."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"It took a little too long to get the item.

I hated the book! :("},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"Ulysses is one of those big, mad bellwethers of a book that X will tell you is the biggest, best, most important blah blah blah and Y will tell you is a load of badly written tripe. Neither X nor Y tend to notice that the book consciously encourages both responses...but, well, I'll get back to the academic riffing in a minute.I first tried to read Ulysses aged about 14 (I was an annoying little boy that way) and didn't get very far. The first three chapters are set in and around the mind of Stephen Dedalus, one of the most ridiculously clever and over-educated characters ever conceived, as he takes breakfast with some friends, teaches in a school some miles south of Dublin and walks along a beach. Along the way, his mind ruminates on subjects as diverse as 16th century underworld slang, his dead mother, and something he calls &quot;the ineluctable modality of the visible&quot; which I'm still struggling with. But he's a curiously ambiguous character, this Stephen; he fancies himself as a poet and rebel but when, on the beach, he picks his nose, he has a quick look around to see that nobody's watching before he smears the snot on a rock. (Joyce likes to poke fun at pretension this way - although he doesn't suggest that Stephen's ideas or rebel stance are completely hollow, either.)The 14-year-old me didn't get that far. I gave up. It wasn't until I was 19 or so that I got as far as chapter four and encountered a Mr. Bloom, pottering around the kitchen making breakfast, that I started to get a grip. Bloom is one of the most likeable characters in fiction. He's a quiet, rather shy, oddly intelligent advertising salesman married to a voluptuous siren of a wife, Molly. Either you're prepared to go the distance with Bloom, or else cast the book aside with a hollow oath, because he's about to spend the entire day walking around Dublin. Nothing will happen except that a man will be buried, a baby will get born, and Bloom will help Stephen when the latter gets into a drunken fracas with some British soldiers. (Ireland was still part of the Union in 1904, and Dublin was a garrison town. Many non-Irish readers concentrate on Joyce's innovation or wit or technical whatever, but Joyce is extremely historically aware, and Ulysses, like all his other books, is riddled with the traces of English domination. These add to the book, rather than diminish it.)Readers who like those clanky, tinpot contraptions known as &quot;plots&quot; may get a tad frustrated. Leaving aside Joyce's gifts for parody (a _tad_ too indulged, in my opinion), the, if you like, human interest in Ulysses is in the details of the to-ing and fro-ing between the characters. A quite banal conversation turns out to have all sorts of fascinating undercurrents; Bloom, who is Jewish and therefore even more of an outsider than Stephen, is extremely good at detecting the hints and shifts in the tones of the people he meets. He keeps running into two things that cause him particular discomfort: anti-Semitic remarks, and reminders that his wife is about to sleep with another man.Ulysses is about language, but that makes it sound like it's some godawful lumbering doorstop written by an English professor. (John Barth, come on down!) It doesn't feel abstract at all; it's full of sights (the band of old sweat inside Bloom's hat), smells (restaurants, horse urine, flowers) and especially sounds (cats, printing presses, trams). I can't think of any other book which transports you so completely to a different place and time. (It might've helped that I grew up in Dublin and knew most of the places that Joyce is writing about.) Borges described Joyce's prose style, at least in the earlier half of the book, as &quot;strong and delicate&quot; and that's a good description.As the day wears on, the book starts to rumble at the foundations and it lurches with increasing unpredictability from style to style. Joyce is making a point about language; that things are altered by the manner in which we describe them. This can get a bit wearisome after a while, but when it works well - as in the chapter where the doings of a young girl on a beach are narrated in the style of a girl's magazine story - it can be very funny and rather touching. The book closes with a mighty tour de force as Molly Bloom sits up and thinks about her life and her curious husband.Okay, that's the beginner's guide. My personal opinion? It's the best Irish book, a constant wonder, irritation and delight to read, and a stunning effort of imagination and intelligence by the most significant and most lavishly talented Irish writer. 20th and 21st century Irish culture is unthinkable without it. I'm grateful that it's there. What else is to be said?"},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"I picked this up for a group read of Ulysses. I figured it would be convenient to have it on the computer so I could look up all the references I didn't understand, and the price was certainly right. Unfortunately, as I came to realize, this edition of the book is missing pieces of text. I probably wouldn't have noticed this, except that when I googled one of the references that I didn't get, I came up with a preview of a book called Ulysses Annotated, which describes in detail the meaning of all the references. As I read, I noticed that in several places there were references noted that I hadn't seen in the text. Finally, I got annoyed and googled the exact line that preceded an area of missing text, and found that some lines of verse had been omitted from my edition of the book.

It's read by two people: one guy, who does absolutely everything (including Molly) up till the last chapter, then the last chapter, which is read entirely by a woman.2. The guy is supremely talented at reading. It's a dramatic reading, in which he imitates the voices of the others and tries to get into it. I would regard his imitation of the voices of others as supremely believable.3. He has a light British accent (London), but switches to a convincing Irish brogue when reading straight spoken dialogue for most characters. Excellent French and Latin pronunciation. His Italian and Spanish are less successful. The woman is certifiably Irish.4. There are no sound effects (footsteps, keys, etc.), but there are a few songs interlarded, usually at the beginning of each CD.5.

Read this book. It's absolutely ridiculous to say this book can't be read. I can't say you're going to find it interesting or enjoyable, but you can read it.There are people who would have you believe you have to wage a massive campaign of pre-&quot;Ulysses&quot; study before delving into Joyce's novel. I've heard it's necessary to read biographies of Joyce, read all of his other literature, read about the history of Dublin, read Greek mythology...even study Dublin city maps!!! Don't you believe any of this. &quot;Ulysses&quot; is perfectly approachable having read none of the above. I admit that reading &quot;Portrait of the Artist&quot; first is helpful, and at least having some passing knowledge of &quot;The Odyssey&quot; won't hurt, but being familiar with these other works will only help you appreciate some of Joyce's nuances. Being unfamiliar with them will not prevent you from digesting &quot;Ulysses.&quot;Now, for the book itself. Is &quot;Ulysses&quot; good? That's become an almost irrelevant question to ask. Do you have to like &quot;Ulysses?&quot; No. Do you have to admit that it is the greatest novel ever written? No. Anyone denying that the book was influential in altering the course of literature would just be foolish. However, I don't think &quot;Ulysses&quot; is the be-all and end-all of 20th Century literature, and the new ground that Joyce broke would have been broken anyway had he not done it first. He was certainly an innovator, but other authors (Faulkner comes to mind) use Joyce's modernist approach to fiction and do it better.For ultimately, Joyce is a lousy storyteller. Notice I did not say he is a lousy writer. One can't deny the absolute mastery of language apparent in &quot;Ulysses.&quot; But Joyce is almost completely unable to connect with his reader. Parts of this novel come close to doing just that, but in between there are vast numbers of pages of dull, dull prose that set out to be as incomprehensible as possible. What was Joyce afraid of? Was he scared that what he actually had to say wasn't either particulary interesting or profound, so he had to bury it underneath layer after layer of obscure allusions and writing styles? I didn't understand every part of &quot;Ulysses,&quot; and I don't believe all of these so-called Joyce experts do either, despite the massive amount of critical study done about it. However, understanding every single part of the novel and understanding the novel are two different things, and I believe I understood &quot;Ulysses.&quot; And what I found is that it's not the beast everyone's made it out to be, but neither is it particulary interesting or profound.In short, I would recommend that everyone read &quot;Ulysses,&quot; if for no other reason than that you can have an opinion on it. I won't be reading it again, so I guess I'll have to just live in ignorance of all the hidden delights Joyce offers his readers. I neither loved it or hated it---there are many books I've enjoyed reading less and many more books I've enjoyed reading much more. Before reading &quot;Ulysses&quot; I was reluctant to state that I didn't like Joyce's writing, feeling that any opinion about Joyce without having read his masterwork would be uneducated. Well, I've read the damn thing now, and I can state with a very educated opinion: &quot;I do not like Joyce's writing.&quot;"},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"I have frequently heard Ulysses proclaimed the best book ever written, but I could never understand why. I purchased this edition of the novel three years ago, and since then it sat on my shelf, a mighty 900 page undertaking that I kept putting off. I was reluctant to read it, for I have often heard how difficult it was to get through. Finally, I have read it, and though I believe it presumptuous to call any one book \\"the best book of all time\\", I certainly believe that Ulysses could claim that title. First off, it is not a difficult read. If you could get through A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, you can get through Ulysses. I heartily recommend this edition because of the brilliant introduction by Declan Kibard. Before I read Ulysses, I could not understand how this could be the best book of all time. According to my understanding, it was a novel detailing, in 900 pages, one day in the life of a Jewish Irishman, Leopold Bloom. A totally unremarkable day at that. After reading Kibard's introduction, I was fiercely eager to begin the novel. In his introduction, totally some 70 pages, Kibard answers the precise question I had: Why would this book be called the best of all time? This book is never boring, and is actually a quite enjoyable read. It is arranged in 18 chapters, and to me, the most astounding aspect of this piece of literature is the fact that every chapter is written in a different style. Joyce wanted to show that \\"originality\\" in terms of style was merely a new arrangement of previous styles, and so shows his brilliance as a writer by changing his technique and method completely in each chapter. It is indeed difficult to believe they were written by the same person. The styles are listed as: Narrative (Young), Catechism (Personal), Monologue (Male), Narrative (Mature), Narcissism, Incubism, Enthymemic, Peristaltic, Dialectic, Labyrinth, Fuga per canonem, Gigantism, Tumescence detumescence, Embryonic development, Hallucination, Narrative (Old), Catechism (Impersonal), Monologue (Female). Some chapters, such as the Cyclops, done in Gigantism, are deliciously satirical and overdone, while others, such as the Lotus-eaters, are sharp and direct. Though Joyce is often called a \\"stream of consciousness writer\\", only a few chapters are the truly chaotic stream of consciousness, such as the Oxen of the Sun, the Proteus, and the Sirens. The culmination of absurdity and abstraction occurs in the massive Circe chapter, a play styled as a hallucination in the brothels of Dublin. This novel is nearly impossible to take in with just one reading, and I will be reading it again shortly. On this note, I would say that I heartily recommend reading Ulysses straight through in its original form, rather than labouring under the weight of the hefty annotated edition. A true masterpiece, one of the best books I've ever read, and yes, quite possibly the best book ever written."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"The eBook is missing text.

When I was 16 or so, I tried to find Ulysses in the St. Cloud Technical High School Library. It was listed in the card catalog, but it was never on the shelves. Finally, I asked the prim-and-proper old biddy librarian where the book was. She fairly shuddered and asked me with a cockeyed combination of excitement and accusation &quot;why&quot; I wanted to read it. I told her I'd heard it was a great book and so please hand it over. Sure enough, it was in a back room and the old battleaxe crept forth with the book, jacketed in a beautiful red. At home I opened it and tried to make sense out of the first page. I dipped around in it and finally threw it hard as I could against the wall of my bedroom. &quot;This is gibberish junk!&quot; I said to myself. Later, I kept hearing more about the book and thought, &quot;well, maybe I'm just dumb,&quot; which really teed me off. One day I found a book called &quot;Re-Joyce&quot; by Anthony Burgess (of Clockwork Orange fame). He was a Joyce fanatic and wrote a book about how to read Ulysses. And so I read Re-Joyce as I read Ulysses and, wonder of wonders, what an experience! That was back in 1965. I still read Ulysses. It's the one book I re-read more than any other. Oh, and when I look back, way back to my high school library, I know now how Joyce would have roared with merriment at that biddy librarian. He would have been honored in his sly way to see his naughty book kept behind that bun-haired spinster's iron petticoats. Don't give up on Ulysses!

Well, struggling through Ulysses is kinda like that. If you haven't taken a bottle of pain relievers mid-point through the book or perhaps just sprained your wrists trying to hold aloft the 768 page tome, you might just start to understand the methods behind Joyce's madness. But understanding doesn't equal enjoyment.Ulysses, one of the most celebrated and challenging books in the English language has been reduced to one of two things: to the general public, a curiosity, a book of importance that no one would really read or: to Lit majors: the equivalent of a double-dog dare among the Lit-Crit crowd; a book professors assign in order to weed out the weak, who more than likely change majors to something less demanding, like quantum physics. Inevitably, in both circles it has become a book to be endured, not enjoyed.What is the book about? Joyce, a master of the written word *does* appear to have a lot to say about everything, including, but not limited to, religion, politics, sex, and literature. But if there is a flaw in the book (and indeed, it could be argued that the flaw lies with the reader, not the author), it's that Joyce seems more preoccupied with how his story is told, losing sight of the actual subjects. Ulysses is really about WRITING, it seems, and in particular, how well Joyce can do it. The skill involved in the writing often attains that genius status, but too often it feels strangely hollow, a series of breathlessly staged feats of writing skill. In other words, he's showboating.Still, despite Joyce's blatant shouts of \\"look at me!\\", many moments of passion do leak through. Particularly impressive is the final 40 pages or so which takes on a confessional tone that at last attempts to engage the reader emotionally, instead of keeping them at a distance.Reading Ulysses is difficult, to be sure. Joyce drops more obscure references than Dennis Miller after three highballs. Joyce assumes you've read The Odyssey, Dante's The Divine Comedy, the Bible, Hamlet, and, of course the dictionary. He also assumes that you have a passing knowledge of about 6 or 7 languages. But, even if you do have prior knowledge of said works and you know Latin, it cannot help make Ulysses as a whole, an engaging, vital work. It is a towering achievement, yes, but much more of a textbook on writing, which just happens to use the characters of Stephen Daedalus and Leopold Bloom as examples of the styles that Joyce writes in.All said and done though, I would recommend this book as it is unique and it is one of those titles that, like childbirth, has to be experienced to be understood.I would also recommend Joyce's Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man as a superior work of art. It's just as inventive, it's moving and passionate, and it says what it has to say before wearing out it's welcome."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"The Orchises Press edition stands out for three reasons.

Finally, the weight of the paper, the strength of the binding makes this edition one that will last (and you will not, as with the paperback editions, be forced to transcripe all your notes from a book that falls apart after three readings).

The most beautiful writing in the book is when Mrs Purefoy has her baby.Reverently look at her as she reclines there with the motherlight in her eyes, that longing hunger for baby fingers (a pretty sight it is to see), in the first bloom of her new motherhood, breathing a silent prayer of thanksgiving to One above, the Universal Husband. And as her loving eyes behold her babe she wishes only one blessing more, to have her dear Doady there with her to share her joy, to lay in his arms that mite of God's clay, the fruit of their lawful embraces. He is older now (you and I may whisper it) and a trifle stooped in the shoulders....And Doady, knock the ashes from your pipe... You too have fought the good fight and played loyally your man's part. Sir, to you my hand. Well done, thou good and faithful servant!It makes you think that life might be worth living after all, and that maybe God will one day say the same to you."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"As an undergraduate, I tried and failed to read James Joyce's Ulysses the conventional way - I think it took me six months to finish chapter 1. Having treated myself to the audiobook, I can say that it's a completely different experience - Jim Norton's and Marcella Riordan's masterful recording really brings the text to life. On a purely practical level, the lengthy stream-of-consciousness bits make a whole lot more sense when they're read with the intonations of natural speech, and the variation in vocal tone makes it much easier to stay engaged in sections that otherwise tend towards the soporific. Most impressive are the 'voices' Jim Norton does for all the different characters - Stephen Dedalus's 'thoughts' are all done in a low-pitched deadpan monotone that perfectly captures his personality, while Buck Mulligan is loud, brash and has a much stronger Irish accent (this difference in volume is large enough to be a potential problem for someone listening through headphones). Norton's skill is particularly noticeable in 'ensemble' scenes such as the library, where he has to switch voice every couple of lines. I've got the Oxford Classics edition of the book (1922 text) and it's almost identical to the recording - very occasionally there's a word or two that's different. This time round I'm actually really enjoying Ulysses - who would've thought."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"I've read the reviews. I've seen the complaints. &quot;It doesn't mean a thing... I can't understand it... It's just a bunch of drivel...&quot; All are opinions that anyone who has read the book is certainly entitled to. As for all the scholars out there who say that there are hidden meanings in every sentence, well, that's your opinion too. And you're more than welcome to scour &quot;Ulysses&quot; for the rest of your natural life looking for pieces to Joyce's grand puzzle. But I'm going to offer something a little different - those who would scour the novel for such meanings are missing the point in almost the same way as those who toss it aside as incomprehensible.In &quot;Ulysses&quot;, we are given access to the inner-consciousness of Stephen Dedalus, Leopold Bloom, and Molly Bloom. They are normal people living ordinary lives in early 20th century Dublin. They go to work, go to the bathroom, walk the streets, greet people, and think about their lives. They mull over details of their own lives that are so personal to them that they could mean nothing to anyone else. And if you think about it, isn't that what we all do? If someone were to open up your head and read your thoughts, they might say the same thing - &quot;What the heck is this?&quot; But we also consider the things that affect us all; love, death, loss, and hate, among others. Those are the thoughts that would carry weight and meaning for anyone, and the characters in &quot;Ulysses&quot; ponder these things as we all might. We cannont completely become them, and thus we cannot completely understand everything they think of. But they hit upon enough major truths so that there is meaning for anyone. Their adventures through Dublin would have made an interesting story on their own - being able to see inside their minds takes the novel to a completely different level."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"Why do people who don't like Ulysses always lambaste those who do? You have every right to like and dislike what you please, and so do I. Why the name calling? I wouldn't call myself an intellectual and I'm certainly no \\"literary luminary,\\" but I love the book. For me, it's not about mythic parallels or stylistic experimentation or esoteric theories of art-it's about the richness, the absolute miracle, of human experience. Whatever else you can say about Joyce's intent, he wanted to show us life. And every time, for example, Bloom wonders whether black reflects or refracts light, I see life-the sort of life (banal, uncertain, driven by the demands of the flesh, often a joy, sometimes thankfully relieved by humor) that I live. Joyce (I think) succeeded in giving us a very simple but profound truth: every moment of life is sacred. Eternity, heaven and hell, God, the whole shebang, are right here around and within us all the time. And we spend 99% of our time distracting ourselves in one way or other.Bring your sense of humor! (it's supposed to be a comedy), and a little patience. The more you read it, the more you get out of it."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"I am writing this review on the 100th anniversary of the most famous day in the life of the wandering Jewish Dubliner Leopold Bloom, who was created by James Joyce and immortalized in Ulysses. \\"Bloomsday,\\" as this day is called in some circles, prompted me to once again revisit this vast, difficult, and important book.I should note that I have only read Ulysses from cover to cover once, and that was more than 15 years ago. But I refer to it and re-read parts of it periodically, even though the years appear to have dampened some of my enthusiasm for this brick of a book.The more I think about Ulysses, the more I decide that most of the value of reading and understanding the book (two very different things, by the way) comes from its ambition and the impact it has had on 20th century literature. This is the work that -- probably to the chagrin of literature students everywhere -- more or less invented the stream of consciousness style of literature, and which literary historians say marked the start of the modern era in English literature. The narrative, a nearly 800-page examination into the events in Leopold Bloom's life on June 16, 1904, is dense but also very compelling, and the language is often crisp and colorful.Unfortunately, the language is even more often a bizarre maze of metaphors, references, and descriptions so inaccessible that some scholars think they may contain some kind of secret code. At one point, the erotic and deflating soliloquy of Molly Bloom (Leopold's wife) takes up something like 25,000 words unmarred by a single punctuation mark -- a section long enough to be published separately as a novella.Without a doubt, a similar book written today by an unknown talent would never find its way the shelves of the neighborhood Books-A-Million without first shedding 300 or 400 pages under the red ink of some unfortunate editor. There's also little doubt that the modern literary cannon is better off for the fact that that didn't happen when Mr. Joyce produced this seminal work. Readers are also better off, but only the ones willing to work at it."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"I started reading Ulysses with the help of the annotations, but soon left those behind. The horror stories that I had heard of the difficulty of the book were unfounded, and I enjoyed every moment of the text. Having read the Dubliners and Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, I was used to Joyce's style, or so I thought. But in Ulysses I discovered that stream of consciousness could be taken to a new and deeper level. Joyce did not mean for us to grasp every allusion, therefore annotations are not really necessary. By reading Ulysses, I also managed to gain a new insight into the Odyssey, and found new undertones withing Homer's work. People had told me that at the age of 16 and 17 it would be impossible to read Ulysses. I disagree. Length does not make a book more difficult to read -- Walden Pond is, at times, harder to understand than Ulysses. When I finished Ulysses, I felt an emptiness, for I had been living in the mind of Leopold Bloom. It was as if part of me had been taken away. In the future, I will definitely reread Ulysses, and I recommend it to anyone who loves literature. It is a masterpiece."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"This review is for people that have not read this novel and are frightened by it.Greatest novel of all time, blah blah blah. Forget the academic wankery that has encased this novel like a black, shiny coffin. Joyce never meant this novel to be read with reverential nods and oh so serious frowns. This is a novel that is bursting with atmosphere and life.In its essence, this novel attempts two major tasks: to inflate one utterly ordinary day in the life of a human being to epic proportions, and to do so by undertaking a different writing-experiment for each chapter.The \\"epic inflation\\" aspect is absolutely fascinating. Mr Leopold Bloom spends an entire day wandering around Dublin for a bit, then comes back home. Absolutely nothing \\"epic\\", in the usual sense, actually occurs here. He encounters a spiritual son in the form of the slightly malnourished, youthful, pseudo-intellectual Stephen Dedalus...but the encounter doesn't really lead anywhere.Rather, it is the point of the novel to inflate the simple things in life to something epic. Taking the Odyssey as its skeleton (and you really should be familiar with the Odyssey before attempting this book), Joyce turns each tiny incident during the day (in pretty much \\"real time\\") into an epic event with its own incredible atmosphere and drama. Even Bloom sitting on the toilet, going to the post-office, or drinking instant chocolate become massive epic events.To some degree this is slightly self-mocking. However, the novel makes you see your own life in a slightly different way. Maybe there are no \\"dull\\" days in our lives; from a certain point of view even the most mundane stuff, like dropping off something at the post office, or drinking Ovaltine, becomes miraculous.Secondly, there is the experimentation. The fact that each chapter is a totally different experiment gives you a real sense of curiosity about the novel. What is coming next? Stream of consciousness wackiness? A play? Random newspaper headlines? The division of the book into different experiments means that, even if you don't like one chapter, you can read on in the hopes that the next chapter will be more to your taste.Think of it as being like a concept album. Even if you don't dig Within You Without You, When You're Sixty-Four is just around the corner.Overall, I liked the atmosphere of the novel. Even if sometimes you don't totally get what's happening, you get a strong sense of Dublin c. 1904, with people lunching on gorgonzola sandwiches and sherry at pubs, people wandering along Sandymount Strand and buying sweets, people going to the turkish bath and buying scented soap.There is also the unmistakeable tang of the Homeric Aegean. Dublin is near the sea, like Troy, and you don't forget it. Whether wandering the sandy beach, eating headless sardines from a tin, or watching drunken soldiers wandering along the street at night, the sea is never far away.Don't be put off this book. Wallow away in something that is truly an epic \\"show about nothing\\". Speaking of which, what is this book comparable to in the modern world?\\"Seinfeld\\", with its excruciating minutiae about life in New York City being raised to the mock-epic level, whether it's George lying about his job or Elaine wondering if a rabbi is gossiping about her.\\"Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\", with its exuberant, youthful experimentation with the very bedrock of music albeit with a playful unpretentiousnessmost oddly, \\"24\\", with real time coverage of events in such a way that every single hour has something epic happening in it."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"Ulysses is great fun. It takes a bit more work to read than most books, just as it takes a bit more work to play tennis than it does to play catch. You shouldn't feel compelled to put the work in, any more than you should feel compelled to learn an unusually difficult sport. But people who do put the work in and who have a good time doing it shouldn't be made to feel guilty about it either. It's a pleasure to follow the interweaving lines of the Sirens chapter, for instance, and anyone who does it will see that the chapter is alive in a way that almost nothing else is in literature. Joyce is a terrific comic writer and a terrific creator of vivid, complicated characters. But he requires the reader to put in some extra effort to enjoy how good he is, and I can't blame anyone who gives up after a few pages and refuses to go any further. On the other hand, I've noticed that people who don't like Joyce's approach seem to want to attack people who do. This is silly. Again, it's like hating people for playing basketball just because you prefer skateboarding. Both the Joyce lovers and the Joyce haters should lighten up a bit."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"A book deserving to be thoroughly studied and a milestone in development of English language currently known, but a common reader like me can afford but a hasty and superficial eagle eye, and most references and connections would have been lost to me without the diagram by Stuart Gilbert quoted in the introduction of Penguin edition.A full and unique mastership of language results in a wonderful balance between fictional and technical , at ease with each employed style besides the contrasts between the different narrative techniques employed in the various chapters, which depicts the wide variety of microcultures composing the fragmented Irish society during British occupation.Many years ago I read a book, whose title The Cardinal, by Henry Morton, about the career of a Catholic American priest with Irish origins. The first half of the book is set in the Boston Irish community, and I have been impressed by how many \\"Irishnesses\\" in the book (which I read in an Italian translation) can be traced back to Joyce's Ulysses (I still remember the pun Rows of Cast Steel = Rose of Castille).An example of how a local tale becomes universal literature, and a mandatory step in understanding English language."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"I think there is one sentence in Ulysses that sums up Joyce's intention perfectly: \\"Any object, intensely regarded, may be a gate of access to the incorruptible eon of the gods.\\"This really is a great book, full of humor and insight and what I can only describe as those little sparks of recognition you get when you see your own life in great literature. And I think it even has something akin to a real spiritual revelation we desperately need in the West (see the quote above). But there's no denying that Joyce was a sadist, linguistically speaking. Like all Irish writers I've ever read about, Joyce had mixed feelings about English. It was not his true native language and, while he loved it, he was always knew that it was a kind of shackle on his country. The issue comes up in A Portrait (when young Stephen bristles that he knows the language better than the English priest who's teaching it) and it reappears very early in Ulysses.At breakfast, Haines confounds the old milk woman with his speech in Irish (it's French, for all she knows). In his mind, Stephen associates the old woman with all of Ireland, and Haines' command of the Irish language is emblematic of his status as conqueror (he's conquered the land and assimilated the language, and now he's come to plunder the culture! Haines is in Ireland to collect folk tales). Joyce may not have embraced the Irish cause like many of his contemporaries, but he had his own more subtle form of revolt. He wanted to bind the English speaking world with one of it's own shackles. In Richard Ellman's biography, someone tells Joyce he demands too much of his readers. He flatly replies that his only demand was that his readers spend their whole lives reading him. He wanted to make us all slaves! Just read those two mind-bending sentences near the beginning of the Oxen of the Sun chapter and imagine what sadistic pleasure Joyce must have felt writing them. You can almost hear him shout, \\"take that!\\" And any time you come to a particularly difficult section of the book, just imagine Joyce there beside you saying, \\"Hey, don't look at me. It's YOUR language.\\"I'm sure what throws most people is the third chapter that begins \\"Ineluctable modality of the visible...\\" Up to then, things have been pretty clear, except for the occasional shifts from dialogue to thought, which Joyce does without giving us those helpful little \`he said's and \`he thought's. He doesn't even give us quotation marks (he didn't use them because he thought they were ugly, by the way). We've seen-and \\"seen\\" is the key word...we have not been told by a narrator...it's as if we are there watching it all-we've seen Stephen have breakfast in the tower, walk with Mulligan and Haines to the bathing area, teach his class, and talk with Deasy. But suddenly we find ourselves inside his head along with Kant, Schopenhaur, Shakespeare, Milton, the Bible, the Catholic Mass, early Christian heresies, Irish mythology, on and on. It gets confusing to say the least.Do you have to know as much about all this stuff as Stephen to understand the book? It probably wouldn't hurt, but I certainly don't. The main thing is to understand that STEPHEN understands it all, and yet he is still struggling. His mother has died and he's asking a simple question, \\"what does it all mean?\\" This is the question of the book. What does life mean? How should one live? The answer the book gives is: life begins when you understand that we are all one. Stephen and Bloom, two completely different people, are one. Religion, myth, and all the great symbols that spring up across the globe are so similar because human life is essentially the same everywhere. Joyce told a friend that he chose The Odyssey as a model for his own book because Homer created the most complete character in all of literature: Odysseus is a father, a husband, a lover, a warrior, a politician. In short, he is Bloom: a completely ordinary man. Joyce showed us that ordinary life, \\"intensely regarded\\", is the stuff of myth.It's not always easy (although much of it is, if you read carefully...and compared to Finnegans Wake it's practically Dr. Seuss). But it's well worth the effort."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"James Joyce most of been a prankster.

It is the landmark that reaches into the pages of every novel written since, it is polymath.But it's a darned difficult read. Each chapter is written not just in a new form, but in a completely new style. It demands a shift in mindset as one progresses through the book. In some cases that shift is required from sentence to sentence, or indeed from word to word.It's not a novel for the casual reader. To get anything out of it, one must be experienced. The annotations do help, but a broad knowledge of international literature, and indeed international language would be a boon when working one's way through the time-honoured pages.Personally, I'd buy it just for the 'Ithaca' chapter.

Leopold Bloom is an example, I suppose, of the exception to the single mindedness of these Irish people. Dublin was a lovely city, however, clearly not diverse enough for Joyce.

I read it with the annotated version as a guide. It was work but it was fun work. Here are a few things people never talk about with Ulysses:1. It's a very, very funny book2. At it's heart, it's about a young man trying to recover from the death of his mother and a middle aged man trying to cope with his marital crisis and the buried sadness over his dead son and father. Nothing overly obscure or elitist or intellectual there, I don't think.3. The verbal pyrotechnics serve the story. Joyce wanted to describe one day and make it entertaining. All the literary references serve the purpose of adding richness, depth, timelessness and universality to a story about ordinary Dublin citizens wandering around on a warm early summer's day.4. Ultimately, this book is a love story--the least sentimental love story ever written but it's about Stephen's conflicted love for his mother, Molly and Poldy's conflicted love for each other, and Joyce's conflicted love for Ireland. The book is about, as Stephen says, \\"the affirmation of the human spirit\\". He's not being sarcastic when he says that.Ulysses is a novel in brilliant technicolor. I've read nearly all the major literary classics and they are all in black and white by comparison."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"When I started this book, I must admit it was slow going. I was never a big fan of Joyce. \\"Dubliners\\" was cold and a bit too precious for me. \\"Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man\\" was likewise nothing to crap your pants over. So it was solely with a sense of responsibility to literary tradition that I finally opened my age-old copy of \\"Ulysses\\" to see what all the fuss was about.Immediately I hated it as I've hated few books before. Dense and uncommunicative. Sure it had stream of consciousness and all that - but this really was perfected by Faulkner, etc. - or so I thought.I kept reading - and reading and reading and reading. There came a time about 150 pages into this almost 700 page monster that I seriously considered doing my book physical harm. I thought of throwing it or ripping it or even burning it. However, good sense prevailed and I just kept at it.Then, the epiphany!Joyce's \\"Ulysses\\" doesn't just mirror Homer's epic but the reader actually reenacts it in the very process of understanding the book. Sure, the text is hard and Joyce doesn't take you by the hand - but it's meant to be that way. In the very difficult process of making meaning out of the text we become an integral part of the text and its meaning. The book is about the experience of literature more than it's about Mr. Bloom or Stephan Dedalus. In effect, you become Ulysses, yourself, and your very difficulties in understanding parallel the hero's difficulties finding his way home.What emerges after such a discovery is still a difficult and - at times - frustrating book. However, it is unquestionably a work of genius. Moreover, it goes far beyond the generation of stream of consciousness. The modes of communication are so varied here that each chapter almost reads like a new book. View points are important as well as the parallel structures they build cumulatively, however, the very mode of communication, itself, is of the story. Moreover, the honesty of the character portrayals is shocking. These are real people to a degree we rarely if ever see portrayed. We see everything Bloom does - from pontificate to use the bathroom.To anyone having difficulty with this book, I advise you keep reading. Promise yourself that you'll finish this book. Then you can hate or love it - whatever you want. Just finish.Now that Joyce actually makes sense, I wonder if I should go back to his early work or on to \\"Finnegan's Wake\\" - that monster of textuality that goes even further than \\"Ulysses.\\" I'm not sure I'm ready for that yet - but I will be. I will be."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"Joyce is the most talented user of the English language since Shakespeare. His use of language is dazzling in its inventiveness and sophistication, and the sonic qualities of his writing are the equal of any poet. 'Ulysses' is rich, beautiful, moving, and evocative; the cleverness of the novel is associated with a profoundly human and humane sensibility.Often, this 'modernist' novel is contrasted with 'realist' novels, as though Joyce was doing something strange and different, but I don't think that's true - on the contrary, if a realist novel is one that communicates reality, then the stream-of-consciousness passages of 'Ulysses' are the high-water mark of the realist prose tradition, because they do something that no-one else has ever really managed - persuasively communicate his characters' experiences and thoughts from within. And there's more about the reality of Dublin life in 1904 than you would get from a dozen other novels of the period. He's not writing something other than a realist novel - he's doing it bigger and better than anyone else.BUT - it's not an easy read. The density of the prose makes it like reading poetry, and it's hard work just as reading an 800-page poem would be hard work. Furthermore, it's not all equally good; some of Joyce's experiments with language are less successful than others - the surrealist chapter springs to mind as a weak bit. When you're half-way through one of the less successful chapters, and it's both hard work *and* rather boring, it can feel a little bit like banging your head against a brick wall.So - know what you're getting yourself into. This book isn't for everyone, and you're not going to finish it in the course of a a one-week beach holiday in Marbella. But if you think you're up to it - have a go. It may just really annoy you. Or it may be the most rewarding book you'll ever read.Harry"},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"While I think the Gabler edition of Ulysses is great, if you are looking to buy a new copy of it, please beware! In a class I taught, many students' books contained a considerable misprint in which 15 pages of episode 13 are reprinted in episode 14 (and 15 pages are missing from episode 14). The binding on recent printings is so poorly constructed, that within 4 weeks of class, 3/4 of my class's editions fell apart into a dozen clumps of roughly 50 pages each. We contacted the publisher, but Vintage customer service was indifferent to our problems. My own copy, from 1986, is still in one piece after years of use. If you want this edition (which I still recommend), try an older printing. Vintage's indifference to its own shoddy book production is unprofessional and inexcuasble. I'm posting this review Oct 2005, so I hope this warning will not be necessary at a future date."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"I am glad that I read \\"Ulysses\\" by James Joyce as part of a graduate level course so that I had a professor who could explain all the intricacies and idiosyncracies of Joyce's masterpiece. Had I tried to read this novel on my own, I'm sure I would've given up very early on. Its stream-of-consciousness style not only defies the laws of narratrion, but Joyce expected his readers to be as intelligent as he was, which is just not the average case in today's society. It is easy to see why this novel has been the center of such controversy and praise ever since it was published; it truly stands alone in the pantheon of modern literature. As challenging and frustrating as it can be, it is a rewarding and intriguing read.So how does one sum up a nearly 800 page novel that follows the seemingly mundance events of one day (June 16, 1904) in Dublin, Ireland? \\"Ulysses\\" is the tale primarily of two men, Stephen Dedalus and Leopold Bloom, whose paths propitiously cross late within the book. Stephen, a young intellectual, is stuck in an unrewarding job as a teacher. Bloom, a half-Jewish worker, is stuck in an unhappy marriage and who finds joy in the smallest and oddest of places. His day's journey through Dublin takes him to a funeral, a bar where he very nearly gets into a fight, a maternity ward, and a house of ill repute before he returns home for the evening. Along the way, readers are introduced to a wide cast of supporting characters who flesh out Bloom's adventures and play symbolic roles based on Homer's \\"The Odyssey\\". Readers are also given a vast insight into the history of the English language as well as questions that concern the very essence of humanity. The novel finishes with the perspective of Bloom's wife, Molly, who sheds some interesting light on Bloom's fears and presentiments.There is truly no other work like \\"Ulysses\\" in the history of the English novel and there will likely never be another quite like it. Joyce's command of the English language was phenomenal and his powers are at full display in chapter after chapter, whether in parodies of various writing styles or mocking the vapid putrescence of romantic literature. Leopold Bloom springs to life and his journey, while challenging and difficult, is definitely worth pursuing."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"Five stars for Joyce and Ulysses, but boos to Amazon and Kindle, because the Kindle link provided with the ad for the Gabler edition leads to a Kindle version of the older Random House edition, which has many textual differences. Amazon, is the Gabler edition of Ulysses not available on Kindle? If it is not, please stop misleading your customers into thinking that it is. If it is available on Kindle, please replace the present Kindle link with the proper one. Thank you."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"Of course it's difficult; it was meant to be so. However, Joyce's desire to keep critics writing about him by making Ulysses a dense read is not reason to disparage what he was capable of doing. Another reviewer states that the book has neither plot nor story; this is false and misleading.Ulysses is not for the faint-hearted nor for the prudish. Certainly it remains on college reading lists because of its multiple layers of meanings, which few readers, if any, can grasp at first reading. To understand everything probably requires multiple readings, secondary sources, and/or formal study. Also, reading the entirety of Homer's Odyssey is a great help, just for seeing the parallels Joyce was driving at. But many jokes and innuendoes can be understood immediately, and if you are truly reading the text, you can determine what is going on. But this is never a book that you can comprehend by merely skimming along, waiting for the narrative to clear everything up for you.The effort is worth it, but don't attempt it if your motive is simply to add another title to your \\"List of Important Books That I've Read.\\""},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"Ulysses has got to be the most difficult thing I have ever read. Being as tough as it is to read, I can see why their is a lot of negative reviews about this book. Most people feel for a book to be good it has to be action packed and fastly paced with a bunch of characters that you like.Well Ulysses has really none of those things, unless you can identify with Bloom or Stephen then you'll probably like them. When you pick up Ulysses you need to get some help. I read the guide by Gilbert along with the text and it helped me a lot. Without a guide Ulysses can be even harder than than it normally is.You also should not expect any major or huge events to happen. Nobody dies or anything exciting like that.Lastly you need to get into a mindset that what your going to be reading is extremly hard, but with a little patience it can be extremly rewarding.Now, without further ado, I will review Ulysses. I gave the book five stars, but it is not an unqualified five star review. When reading Ulysses in it's entirety, some parts are classic while other parts just seem unneccesary. For example, the Hades episode is the best in the book and probably the best example of realistic writing in the english language. Most of the other episodes are also great, but a few are just a burden to read. The Oxen of the Sun episode in my opinion is pointless. Joyce seems to like the fact that he can write in middle english, so he does. I'm no expert on middle english, but it's damn hard to read and it disrupts any flow the book had. If you can sort out the slang at the end of Oxen of the Sun then I congragulate you, because it was totally lost on me. The Ithaca episode is another example. It is told with a series of questions and are answered in the most drawn out and scientific way possible. Maybe Joyce could have been best served using a diffrent style. Stephen's Shakespeare rant also seems unnecessary and the episode where Bloom is trying to sell an ad to the newspaper is hard to follow.Ever other episode is expertly written and is a delight to read. The pitfalls of a few episodes are more than made up for with the 14 or so episodes that are expertly written.What Joyce does with language in this book is amazing. He is a true master of the english language and a master of a multitude of diffrent styles. He writes magnificently but sometimes he can't seem to help but show off his skills.And to those who think this book is utterly impossible and if anyone says they finished this book is lying, well I swear to god in heaven that I read this book cover to cover. It was no easy task, it took me a long time, but I did finish it. I don't claim to come close to total comprehension but I did read it all the way through.I would recommend this book to anyone who isn't analytically challenged, has an attention span of at least one hour, and won't be offended if a writer changes styles every chapter. I highly recommend it. If you get through it you can be a literary snob for the rest of your life. Did you finish Ulysses, I did."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"I suppose it is pretty hard to add anything to this monstrous string of reviews. But I will comment because (obviously like so many others) I found this book to be very important. The fact that so many reviews exist shows that this book has effected a lot of people (enough to expend their precious energies writing about it). As you can see, not many really ride the middle ground about it. People seem to love it passionately or they hate it passionately. This should be enough to recommend it to anyone. We all should be after books that are going to change us, challenge us, effect our lives and loves. This is a book that has done that for a great many people. If you have not read it, take the time. I do not think that you'll sit in your easy chair and say 'well, it was okay,' and flip on the television.Personally, I found the book to be lively and entertaining. It was also challenging and arduous. Sometimes I couldn't put it down and sometimes I couldn't pick it up. Sometimes I thought it was a stupid book and sometimes I thought it was the best work of fiction that I had read. Ulysses is overall 'real.' It discusses truth, it changes a lot, like life. All the characters can be seen as stable in their lives, yet metaphysically sort of lost and wandering. That is like Ulysses. It is also a lot like you and I. There are jarring events, changes of style, unexpected devices and layers and layers of erudition. There are also normal everyday joes going about life as usual, to which we can all relate. It was not easy, and that is like life, also. Like life, it has a lot to teach you. And you can come back to this book many times and still find it fresh. It probably will seem an entirely new beast when you return.Unlike some of the reviewers, I wouldn't recommend annotations. Trust yourself and trust Joyce in undertaking the work. Perhaps you'll miss things here or there. That is okay. You'll still 'get it,' in the end, if you make it. Part of it is seeing if you can make it, so you sort of fail in your test of yourself if you immediately resort to consulting some sort of 'dictionary of Joyce.' For anyone that sees this book as too daunting, let me just say that I'm not an English major or in a literature related field. I'm a music student, just a plain old undergraduate joe that read this book. I read the book without annotations except for one period where I was stuck and thought I didn't understand. I checked the annotations out from the library and I found that I did understand (at least as well as the annotator) and that I just needed to keep going to figure it out, just like in finding out how a Dickens plot is going to unfold. I would recommend against taking that step. Leave the annotations on the shelf. I'd recommend that you, another plain old non - literature joe or jane, try it. Trust yourself and try it."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"There is no reason in the world for me to write a review for this except to say \\"I READ IT\\". I live in the boonies of SE Oklahoma where there's not a soul who has heard of Joyce much less care whether anyone has read him or not. So, reader of Amazon's reviews, you're my (un)lucky audience. Not only did I read it, but I have not moved it to my \\"Trade\\" shelf. I want it as a reminder of how damned goofy I can be.If you are reading this because you are wondering whether to read it or not, then the answer is that you probably won't \\"get it\\" any more than I did. If you do read it and actually enjoy it, then you can consider yourself goofier than me.Seriously: 1. I didn't particularly like it. 2. I AM glad I read it. 3. If I ever pick it up to read it again, shoot me."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"When you're dealing with a book as daunting to the casual reader (assuming there is such a thing as a casual reader of this particular book) as James Joyce's Ulysses, you're going to need every break you can get.For years I was put off by the Modern Library's 1961 edition of Ulysses, and with good reason. When Judge Woolsey decided in the 1930s to institute what Morris Ernst decreed \\"the New Deal in the law of letters,\\" making Ulysses legal to own and distribute in the U.S. (before that it was contraband, smuggled into the country as if it was bootleg scotch by, among other people, Ernest Hemingway), Random House, which had locked up the U.S. rights, decided to act fast, while the book was hot (Joyce even made the cover of Time magazine). So they rushed their now-legal version into print as quickly as possible, using in the process the ugliest, most unreadable typeface known to man.In 1961, they revised the text, getting rid of some obvious errors (if I'm not mistaken they were in such a rush originally that they used Samuel Roth's 1927 pirated edition as copytext!), but for some reason they kept the same repellent font, probably because resetting the whole book in a new font would have been too expensive.When I finally read Ulysses complete, it was in the 1960 Bodley Head edition, which is miles ahead of its American counterpart in elegance and readability. Unfortunately, the text is not nearly as good (Joyce scholar Hugh Kenner's comment on it is particularly apt -- suffice it to say that it's the title of Jacobean playwright John Ford's most famous work).So if you're planning on taking a stab at Ulysses, this is what I would suggest. Forget about the Vintage Paperback edition (as well as Hans Walter Gabler's so-called \\"Corrected Text,\\" for textual reasons too cumbersome to get into here), and go with the Everyman's Library hardcover. It may not be ideal (contrary to what I thought at first, they reprint the Bodley Head edition and not the Modern Library 1961 text), but it's published in a large and reader-friendly font. It's the edition to get if you've never tried Ulysses before (although Dover has recently put out a reproduction of Shakespeare and Co.'s 1922 First Edition that's worth looking into).And if you haven't read Ulysses before, I would suggest that before you do, you: a) read Joyce's earlier and simpler novel, A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, b) try a biography first (Richard Ellmann's is the authoritative one, especially in its 1982 revision, but I'm rather partial to Stan Gebler Davies' shorter biography from the 1970s, which sounds like it was written by a character in Ulysses). Also: c) find and read a good commentary first, such as Edmund Wilson's chapter on Joyce in Axel's Castle, or Hugh Kenner's book, entitled Ulysses or Harry Blamire's The Bloomsday Book. If you're a Joycean newbie, you will need help. Plenty of it.Even then it won't be easy. But Joyce, with the possible exception of Proust, wrote the greatest novel of the last century, and if you're any kind of a serious reader you really owe it to yourself to take a whack at it. Clifton Fadiman once compared reading Ulysses to climbing Mount Everest. Not many people make it to the summit, but the ones who get to the top are afforded a view that's hard to beat. Reading Joyce is less a matter of reading a book than of having a life experience, and a precious one (although some might wonder in which sense of the word) at that. Good luck."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"This book is a mystery and a masterpiece. The first time I read it, it was almost a quest of sorts. I had to find something to pass the time during a particularly tedious job that required me to wait against my will every evening for at least one hour. Bit by bit, I proceeded through the text, and found myself entranced and lost in the language. I was a writer at the time, and the attention to detail fascinated me. It also showed me how much I had to learn about language and lyricism. I have reread the book again and again, some sections more than others, and still love it. Every bit. Profane? Hardly. But it has its moments, even by modern standards. Still, the idea of creating such a thing is a thing to be admired."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"When I informed a co-worker of my intention to read Ulysses, he replied that his grandmother had read it (as it used to be requisite reading) and pronounced it, \\"300,000 words about a man crossing the street\\". That is the sort of dismissal about classical literature that makes me doubly determined to dive in.Much to my dismay, Ulysses turned out to be 300,000 words about a man crossing the street. Yes, the language is beautiful. Yes, the classical allusions are thought-provoking and on-point. Yes, there is a good deal of lewd behavior and avarice to carry the reader along. Unfortunately Ulysses reminded me why no one writes classical literature any more; its unecessary and outdated verbosity went the way of the Dodo long ago.When I finally reached Molly's narrative I felt like I was a drowning man finally coming up for air, and when I completed the last line I felt I could finally breathe deep. It's not that Ulysses is unreadable; only that there is little reason to read it in its entirety. Find someone who has edited out everything but the dirty jokes and famously coined phrases in their context and read their edition instead. You'll save yourself 40+ hours."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"I was intimidated at the bulk of ULYSSES, I must admit. But i found myself shocked by it's radiating brilliance. The book is a labor to read, one often has to re-read a paragraph or (god forbid) a chapter to allow the work to truly flow and make sense. Joyce uses beautiful detailed writing of the human mind, all of our peculiar little idiosyncracies and actions that define us as human beings.The greatest feat I've had in my young life is reading the last page and closing the book. You sit back and for hours are confounded as to the brilliance and success of Joyce to write the actions of two characters in a day. Each thought, each subconscious connection and little bits of thinking and reacting are somehow branded into the pages of ULYSSES. I dont think i will ever read such a significant work again. It is bold, it is at times monotonous, at times incoherent, but there are some golden pages were you are sucked into the writing, for the words on the page are your thoughts, your fantasies, your raw human nature.It took me a month to read the book, i read it in the midst of depression and suicidal thoughts. I was able to lose myself in ULYSSES, i was able to walk the streets with Dedalus and Bloom. I was able to sit on the beach and watch the dog sniff around for something he had lost in a past life time. It is a masterpiece while being imperfect, which is an awful lot like being a human being."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"I don't want to elaborate on how hard this book can be to read (I think the other 75 reviews have covered that), but I will say that with Joyce you get out of it what you put into it. Those who love this book rave about its groundbreaking techniques &amp; virtuosity of language. Those who hate this book complain that it is nothing but Joyce showing off &amp; taunting his readers with a book that has no unity or point. This book DOES have a point. All the style in it is only used as means to an end. There are characters. There is conflict (there are several, but I believe the basic conflict is each character struggling with the reality their lives as opposed to what they want their lives to be). There is a climax (and what a climax it is). There is a resolution. This is, at heart, a very sad and haunting book. I think the message in this novel is that we are at the mercy of our lives (i.e. circumstances control us, not vice versa), and that the only way we can deal with the fact that we have no control over our lives is by fooling ourselves. It is a study of the contrast between what we think we are and what we really are. It is saying that the only way people deal with their biggest problems is by running away from them (note the way Leopold Bloom constantly avoids confronting or even thinking about his wife's adultery, and note the way Stephen Dedalus reacts when confronted by his mother; I could cite plenty of other examples). This may be the ultimate truth of life, that we can never face the truth about ourselves. Joyce never states this directly; it is left up to the reader to find for himself. I would be doing this book injustice if I didn't mention that it fleshes out 2 of the most three-dimensional, complete characters in all of literature.This isn't a perfect book: the climax takes place about 200 pages before it ends. I also thought the last chapter, which is probably the most-praised chapter in the book, was disappointing. Joyce apparently tried to create a complete picture of a female character in about 50 pages, when it had taken him 700 pages to create 2 complete pictures of male characters. It threw off the pace of the novel to suddenly get inside the head of a completely different person. Ithaca could have easily been the last chapter, as it summed up all the day's events as opposed to going on to something totally different (which is what the last chapter did).Still, the characters, the themes, and the sheer scope of Ulysses make it as close to perfect as any book can be."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"I loved Don Quixote, still the greatest of novels. (6 stars!) I loved The Brothers Karamazov, the greatest work of the greatest novelist who ever lived. (5 stars) For sheer reading pleasure Crime and Punishment beats anything I have ever come across.(5 stars) I enjoyed War and Peace, though to me it was a bit dated and didactic and not nearly as convincing and satisfying as DQ, BK or CP. (4 stars)But for some reason after three tries I can't get past page 20 of Ulysses. I find it boring, mannered and well nigh incomprehensible. If it wasn't for the fact that so many learned people say it is a masterpiece I would say Joyce is a fraud. (I read Potrait of the Artist as a Young Man but didn't think it very enjoyable or profound.)Why is it that I can enjoy so many other classic novels yet find Ulysses so repulsive?"},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"This review is limited to notes on formatting.There is a linked table of contents. All entries in the TOC are in all caps (which always bothers me). But you can jump to any point in the book just fine by following a link.The only other disturbing formatting feature is that there is a blank line between each paragraph in the body text. So with a space = (normal interline spacing + blank line + interline), there's quite a big gap between paragraphs.I think this is required because all the paragraphs are in block indent style (ie, they have 0 left indent on the first line). If you didn't have blank lines between paragraphs, you probably couldn't see the paragraph boundaries easily.Anyhow, there seems to be a LOT (ie, a bit too much) whitespace on each page. I wish they used a normal paragraph indent for the first line, and removed the blank lines between paragraphs."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"As for translations of Ulysses, let me tell my Italian friends that Joyce is often hilarious; hope that comes through. (Nel questo libro, Joyce sta scherzando spesso. Spero che suo traduttore non ha tradito, non ha persolo. Alcune delle battute sono stilistica, ma alcuni sono larghi, divertente. Ero un assistente educativo in scuola di specializzazione, e ha contribuito a insegnare in una classe Jocye di Prof Chester Anderson.)I was fortunate to encounter this book after a full, excellent college English major*, so as I read it at leisure during grad school summer, I found it very amusing in the grandest sense. Funny, too. This is a book that benefits from the reader having read most anthology English lit before s/he readsUlysses. Otherwise, one must dive for the footnotes.When one has read Dubliners and Portrait of the Artist, Ellman's Joyce is also delicious. For example, Joyce received a better grade on his Italian exam than on his English, in official grades when he was qualifying to teach English in Italy (especially Rome and Trieste). He barely qualified in English, but was well qualified in Italian. This gives me pause in an era when we're told that Testing, Testing is the way to improve US Public Ed. This tidbit alone, from Joyce's life, makes one severely doubt it.*Such a major does not even exist now: for example, all of Shakespeare's plays was the standard sophomore English major course, a full year, nineteen plays per semester."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"To hold a copy of the original production of ULYSSES is a pleasure. The feel of the pages, the elegance of the typeface, the errors that are inevitable in a work of this magnitude and wit makes one wonder why it has taken so long for a publisher to do what Dover has done. To my mind, it's still the best way visually to read ULYSSES. We forget that when we read our eyes are made to dance with our minds, and to engage our heart in the dance...And Dover's unabridged edition of the original, as it was presented to the world, is a ballet!"},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"The really awful side effect of Kindle is that we are subjected to terrible editions. There's to business model, so the public domain books are only available as prepared by amateurs. In this edition the verse is missing, which ruins even the first chapter.

It contains the original, uncorrected text, page for page, precisely as it appeared in the original run. It's regular stock paper, bound and glued into a heavy-stock, glossy paper cover.It lacks any explanatory notes. It's really only useful for someone who wants to read it exactly as it originally appeared (thought not as Joyce intended it) but doesn't want to spend too much money.If you're reading this for the first time I suggest the Oxford 1922 re-print. It has some decent notes in the back of the book to help get you through the tricky bits (namely all of it) and also includes notes showing the Gabler corrections. It's also much more compact than most versions.Ideally, you may want to buy the Gabler text and Gifford's annotated Ulysses -- if you have the space to lug the two volumes around.This edition is little more than a souvenir and barely suitable as that.

This happens about once per page throughout the entire book.The font size changes from paragraph to paragraph. Punctuation is often missing or wrong. Commas sometimes appear as the number \\"3\\" in a subscript or something else fun like that. The letter \\"l\\" is frequently replaced by the number \\"1\\" (these look very different on a Kindle).Line breaks appear where they shouldn't, and spaces are often missing between words.I've seen similar problems with other books on Kindle, though usually only for freebies.

The introduction and forward, while in no way revelatory, are informative and interesting enough."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"Ulysses is the most astonishingly difficult work of fiction that I have ever read. It is also one of the most astonishingly beautiful books I have ever read. Certainly, reading this novel is not for the uninitiated or the faint of heart. But it's also not for those who believe they can understand everything in this book.Certainly a ton has been written on this site about the plot so I'll skip that and just give my suggestions about how to go about reading this behemoth. Find a website that gives you a chapter by chapter summary (wikipedia is not particularly good because the analysis is simply too short). Read the summary of every chapter before you read the chapter and once again after you finish reading the chapter. Also, keep a dictionary handy. James Joyce has the largest vocabulary of any writer I have ever read. I found that this method was sufficient for me to be able to understand a great portion of the book. If I had tried to use an annotated guide, I feel like I would have spent too much time looking at every reference and ultimately given up on the book out of sheer boredom. Literature is meant to be enjoyed and appreciated, so unless you are planning on teaching the book to others, read the book without an annotated guide.For those that are willing to abandon all hope of complete understanding and enter Ulysses, I think the experience is actually quite rewarding. The writing is top-notch, the humor incredibly funny, and the drama incredibly moving. James Joyce said more with this book than I believe has even been said about the human condition in any other book (his only rival being William Shakespeare). It is a work of absolute genius, the kind of book that even the best writers can merely kowtow to in reverence. Its triumph will probably never be equalled and for that reason, it is worth the challenge."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"I would not recommend this audio version as a substitute to the text, but as a very valuable augmentation. To get the most out of the Ulysses experience, one must employ all senses. Joyce's masterpiece is filled with the music of his own unique language. Reading the text without hearing it is tantamount to reading an opera. Hearing Ulysses read aloud by Donal Donnelly is like hearing that same opera performed by Caruso. The Sirens episode, in particular, is incomplete until it is given a voice. The text of Ulysses is frequently challenging as it drifts, without warning, between styles, languages, and points of view, but Donnelly navigates through Joyce's maelstrom with a confident hand firmly on the tiller. I can listen to these discs over and over the way I would my favorite music, and each time I hear something I missed before or make sense out of something that I didn't understand earlier. An audio companion to the text of Ulysses is invaluable, and I very highly recommend this particular version."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"I'm reading Ulysses and concurrently listening to audio CD's of a seminar on the novel by Professor James Hefferman produced by The Teaching Company.

All in all, if you're going to embark on reading Ulysses, you want this edition."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"\\"Ulysses\\" by James Joyce (1934) is a novel about the interaction of social responsibility and personal desires. It focuses primarily on three characters: Stephen Dedalus a self-absorbed scholar attempting to find his artistic voice, Leopold Bloom who tries to meet his social responsibilities in a culture that is not completely accepting of him, and Molly Bloom (Poldy's wife) who struggles with her feminine destiny.The novel parallels the structure of Homer's \\"Odyssey\\" that chronicles the 10 year struggle of Odysseus to return from war in Troy to his home in Ithaca. Ulysses, the Latin translation of the Greek name Odysseus, is Leopold (Poldy) Bloom who travels the streets of Dublin one Thursday on June 16, 1904. His goal is to accomplish his daily task of meeting his family's economic needs, forming social alliances with Dubliners (including Stephen), and satisfying his own drives for understanding and fulfillment. Odysseus sought to reunite with his wife and assess her fidelity in his absence, and Bloom looks forward to the end of the day when he returns to his home at 7 Eccles Street, concerned about his wife's unfaithfulness.\\"Ulysses\\" is remarkable in its descriptive detail of the physical and psychological environments of Dublin and its characters. The feelings related to immersion in the living Irish city are so strong that there may be some irrational fear of being unable to return to current life. The entrance into the reality of the lives of Stephen, Molly, and Poldy is uncanny as readers become physically and psychically connected to characters. It is a matter of proximity. You lose your own personality as you accompany these people when they converse, walk the streets, visit stores, drink and philosophize, reveal themselves in stream of consciousness monologues, argue, pursue bacchanalian extremes, and have private battles with loss and melancholy.The reader \`sees' everything that day, the external locations and the inner worlds of the characters, with the \\"ineluctable modality of the visible.\\" This is the direct and complete experience of Joyce's art without the restriction of our own frame of reference, history, obligations, and wants. It is intimidating to realize that your own life is changing, that part of your personal history now contains a new day of your own existence - you have extended your life for a day. Many people throughout the world celebrate a second birthday on June 16 (Bloomsday).After publication of \\"Ulysses,\\" I believe that James Joyce (like a few other artists) spent the rest of his life amazed at his creation. As he lay dying in hospital waiting for his wife to return to his bedside, he had to wonder where his inspiration originated, where he summoned the ability to give the gift of another day of life to us all.The reader can benefit most from \\"Ulysses\\" by preparing to read it. Read (re-read) Homers \\"Odyssey.\\" Pay close attention to the structure, the symbolic content, and the psychology of Odysseus. Odysseus was a flawed hero, externally brave but also self-serving and blind to parts of his own personality (like Bloom). Use \\"Ulysses Annotated\\" by Don Gifford to help guide you through the detail of theology, philosophy, psychology, history, rhetoric, and the physical layout of Dublin. This reference work is very good because it allows readers to have their own experiences by providing only supplementary content (facts) that help to understand the myriad allusions presented in the text. I suggest that you enjoy the many beautiful styles of prose presented in the 18 episodes pausing to quickly glance at the definitions in your opened copy of \\"Ulysses Annotated.\\" Then before reading the next episode, go back and read the complete explanatory entries in this reference book. Give yourself a couple of months to enjoy the novel and add this new day to your life."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"Notwithstanding disputes on the editorial choices, the main reason to get this particular edition is the fact that the guide by Don Gifford makes reference to its line numbering. The Gifford book is an indispensable companion to Ulysses. However, the large format, relatively small print and miserable binding are deplorable. Once you get to Molly's monologue, you almost have to detach the pages one after the other. Maybe not so great for the inescapable rereading of this masterwork!"},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"It's great fun to observe the rancorous--at times vicious--debate this book has engendered among and between its admirers and detractors. Whatever else might be said of &quot;Ulysses,&quot; it's clear that everyone who has read it (and even those who have not) has an opinion about it. But for those who are leery of beginning a book of this size and complexity without some guarantee that it is as &quot;GREAT&quot; as its admirers proclaim it to be, I offer these words of advice: take it slowly, don't get overly bogged down by the unorthodox style, and make a diligent effort to understand what Joyce is trying to say. It's easy to treat his ramblings as the workings of a drunk or inscrutable genius, and to &quot;force&quot; one's way through the book without getting anything out of it. I read &quot;Ulysses&quot; for the first time last summer, without annotations and with only a brief on-line summary of each chapter as my guide, and I'm sure I missed an awful lot. But I loved &quot;Ulysses&quot; nonetheless. The inventive style, the devious puns, the poetic prose--all of it amounts to a reading experience that will reward the patient and persistent with a tremendous intellectual and aesthetic (if not emotional) payoff. While it is not my favorite book of all time, I agree with those who say it's the most important novel of the twentieth-century. It so completely altered the literary landscape of its day that, 80 years after its publication, its effects are still being felt (but not always acknowledged) in the works of contemporary writers.If you want to read this book only because you've been told it was &quot;great&quot; or to tell others you read it (and thus sound &quot;intelligent&quot;), pick up the Cliffs Notes and save yourself some time. If you honestly want to understand *why* this book is frequently cited as the best of the twentieth century, dig in. I plan to revisit &quot;Ulysses&quot; myself in the not-so-distant future."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"Having read Joyce's Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man and also Dubliners, I decided last summer to tackle his novel Ulysses, to which several literary associations have deemed the greatest twentieth century novel. Today's sophisticated younger reader may ponder the accolades professors and scholars have showered upon a novel that rambles for well over 700 pages, but there are significant reasons that I would like to briefly elucidate.First, as many have pointed out this is a book of language, and specifically one that attempts to import all of English lexicon in order to examine where its vocabulary leads us and where we ultimately run up against road blocks. This monumental task had never been accomplished in the English language since the likes of Shakespeare and Chaucer.Second, this is a novel of experimentation. A 19th century staple, the novel was overdue for an update that would capture the complexities and anxieties of the 20th century. For too long, the novel reflected a mathematical plot line divided evenly into clear physical events, which, frankly, failed to detail the organics of human thought and development. Ulysses does the unthinkable: Our thoughts and actions cannot be explained away by chronology;there is a real-time universal presence to them, as some would later read in Faulkner's works.Third, there is an authentic examination of the individual. Reading his biography and Ireland's history, Joyce repeatedly hammers home the colossal battle between individuality and social conformity. In Ulysses, outside forces such as the Catholic church, parents, ignorance, politics, and peers attempt to squelch the voice of the individual by attempting to dictate what happiness and contentment are. It is through allusions to the mythological story of the Odyssey that our most heroic feat today is learning how our voice can Bloom in a world that too often expects us to conform.Fourth, it is an honest, realistic story about life in general. Whether we want to admit it, much of life is spent within ourselves, as Joyce unearths through the three characters' streams of consciousness. We do talk to ourselves; our thoughts are random, not linear; we scrutinize ourselves hoping to make connections among scraps of thoughts that only we and God have access to. No novelist up to this point had created what amounted to a confessional that was unafraid of society's taboos and mores. Where else could a young modern reader, for example, read about a character's sexual acts in unadorned detail?Finally, contrary to what critics have stated--i.e. several novelists of Joyce's age called the work a mess--there is a compelling story. At the time of its publication, virulent anti-semitism consumed not only colonized Ireland but the rest of the world. So enters our modern day Ulysses, Bloom, a baptized Jew who exhibits the attributes of Christ but is condemned by his society for alleged ancestral sins. And then there is poor Stephen, whose triumphant announcement to the world that he is an artist contrasts sharply with his doldrum existence, refusing to pray for his dying mother, rejecting his largely absent father, and holding a teaching position that is less than inspiring.There's Molly, a singer by trade who is blazed into sleeping with a talent agent so that she can further her career and can also help provide for Bloom when money is tight. Molly and Bloom may be jovial in name, but underneath is the tragic loss of their infant son who managed to live only eleven days. To me, this is an unflinching look at real life. And yet, epiphanies still happen, and new friendships such as what Stephen and Bloom display provide us with what really matters most: love and acceptance. Bloom is the father who unconditionally accepts Stephen, and Stephen is the son Bloom has dreamed of since Stephen clearly needs guidance.Many readers have pointed out that the traditional literary community has hailed Ulysses as the seminal novel of the twentieth century, and, therefore, today's reader must adhere to its proclamation. If Joyce were alive, I think he would be appalled simply because freedom of expression was his guiding principle. Joyce's main point is that the path toward freedom is not merely a straight line or even a winding one; rather, it is a confluence of thoughts, feelings, and relationships that eventually crystallize into an overarching personal epiphany. Ulysses certainly is a challenge, but then again so is life. Each day is worth a seven hundred page book--Joyce's merit is that he actually proved it."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"Many scenes stick in one's mind forever, for example when Leopold Bloom releases his bowels or when the coffin falls on the road. I finally came to understand the stream-of-consciousness technique and realized it's not Joyce's stream we're wading in but the carefully reproduced stream of the character's consciousness. I found this particularly effective and fun reading of Stephen Dedalus's morning at school. Other scenes like Molly Bloom's grand finale are simply beautiful and literally breathless, especially if you take punctuation as a breathing signal.And I'm especially glad to read it now that I live in Dublin. I've lived in Ringsend three months, I've visited a friend in Mullingar, and I've shopped at Buckley's butcher shop, all of which are mentioned in Ulysses. I even bought my copy of the book at the Martello tower featured at the start of the novel.But overall, one feels Ulysses is somewhat contrived. Crucify this humble critic if you will, but reproducing the structure of the Odyssey is a clever but artificial way of bringing epic grandeur to what is nothing more than a very ordinary day. Why go through all that trouble? I do agree with the lesson but find it rather long winded. In painting, a still life by Chardin is as realistic as an imperial coronation scene by David, but with much less fuss.And then there are the inside jokes. References to Walt Whitman and to Edgar Allen Poe (which I got only because I remembered Tom Hanks reciting Poe's \\"To Helen\\" in The Ladykillers) and other writers abound. Shouldn't a great work stand on its own, at least where its intended audience is concerned? Ulysses fails utterly in this respect unless we restrict the audience to academics.Vincent Poirier, Dublin"},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"I can say without reservation that this is the most amazing book I have ever read in my life. It sparkles with emotion and visceral force, thrusting you so deeply into the lives of its main characters that the medium between the reader and the protagonists is completely penetrated and we quite simply become the characters. Asking such questions as \\"well what would have happened if Bloom had decided to do this\\" is meaningless because we know Bloom so well that it is impossible to conceive him doing anything other than as he does it. We are privy to his innermost passions and longings: in the Circe episode we too forlornly cry out to the apparition of his dead son Rudy, his destroyed hope for the honor of his name, his heritage, and his love. In the Wandering Rocks we feel Steven's pain as he is approached by his rag-clad sister begging him for food:\\"She is drowning. Agenbite. Save her. Agenbite. All against us. She will drown me with her, eyes and hair. Lank coils of seaweed hair around me, my heart, my soul. Salt green death.\\"While some see the parellels to Homer as unnecessary pretentious obscurity, by recreating the Odyssey in turn-of-the-century-Dublin Joyce shows us that all of the heroic epics and action movies in the world are as shallow and meaningless filth before the only true glorious quest, that presented to us in the living of our lives each day.The Homeric parallel also underlies another of Joyce's major aims in the work, that of preserving what has come before. Stephen, the book's other main character, is an autobiographical University student obsessed with the great works of Western literature. Both his thought-stream and his conversations with other characters are rife with allusions to great literature from the ancient Greeks through St. Augustine (the Catholic Church is also very important), Dante, Shakespeare, Milton, Flaubert, and even Oscar Wilde. These many allusions are often seen as a reason not to read the book, but I can affirm that while one does lose something by missing them, the book reads quite well without them and often one can determine the significance of the allusion from the context without knowing its source.Essentially Joyce has taken everything that has come before and combined it into a stunning novel that I feel puts him solidly beside Shakespeare as a true master of the English language. Of course when we say the English language that is up to some debate because, like Shakespeare, Joyce in no way feels bound to correct grammar and is quite willing to sacrifice it whenever he feels it hampers his expression.Yes parts of it are difficult, but not so difficult that one shouldn't attempt the book because of them. I have a dirty suspicion that a lot of the reputed difficulty of this book stems from the exaggerations of those who have read it and want to look smart. You will have to do a little background research, and I strongly advise Reading Joyce's other two books, Dubliners and A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, so that you know the setting and the people. But that said, go for it! It is more than worth the reward of a little patience at the beginning. Also Harry Blamires' New Bloomsday Book and Anthony Burgess's Re Joyce are wonderful supplements to help clear up some of the initial uncertainty.The book took me almost a year to get through, reading several of the episodes more than once, but coming away from it I absolutely confirm that it was COMPLETELY WORTH IT!!! READ THIS BOOK!!!"},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"Right. Ulysses. The intellectual field of Joycewrit contains more essays, papers, doctoral theses, and professional articles than most libraries contain books. So much has been written about this book that I usually have to step back and laugh when contemplating the enormity. It is like fathoming the universal end when you are a child of ten.With that said, I do believe I have something to contribute to *this* forum. I can tell you what this book is. It is perhaps the best and most complete example of written reality in existence. If the world exists in a grain of sand, then it exists in a day full of sand many times.What I mean is that the book works on any level. At a closely read level one can find absurdly esoteric references to minutiae that only has relevance for June 16, 1904. The esoterica works, though. By making something obscure that is in essence very simple, Joyce makes one think about it in a new way. Look at Chapter 17 remembering that Joyce's goal is to make the simple obscure. Then ask yourself what happens over the course of the chapter. Never has less accomplished more. Ithaca (ch. 17), by the way, was Joyce's favourite chapter.At a broader level Joyce's expressive mechanism becomes clear and truly rises above any intellectualization. Perhaps you should not worry too much about that passage of Italian shouted in the street, or the odd bit of vaudevillian obscurity. Instead look at the scope and breadth of a single day and the myriad thoughts that pass through your mind. Could someone decipher your day from your thoughts with ease? And as in a real day, as in reality, a man's life is not so simple to pick apart as a speech in a novel may lead you to believe. A simple bit of dialogue spoken to a boaster may reveal a great amount:&quot;Force, hatred, history, all that. That's not life for men and women, insult and hatred. And everybody knows that it's the opposite of that that is really life.-- What? Says Alf.-- Love, says Bloom. I mean the opposite of hatred.&quot;And that, I am glad to say, is all we get."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"Joyce's Ulysses has been called a lot of things, most of them not flattering. I think the reason most people don't like Ulysses is that is is unlike any other novel, and cannot be treated as 'ordinary.'This day in the life of Leopold Bloom holds everything from insights into the nature of existence, opinions ranging from useful to mundane, and observations on, well, everything. Joyce manages to write a book which leads us through the minds of several characters as they live an ordinary, utterly unspectacular day. This technique is certainly unique, and utterly defines the concept of literary realism.To appreciate this book is to take it on its own terms. To gloss over the passages in which Leopold is daydreaming about triffles (as he does, as we all do. And that is the point.) does not hurt the reader in terms of understanding the plot. You don't so much as read this novel, as much as experience it. The reader is intended to be bored when Leopold is bored, excited when he is, and vaguely aware in-between. As one reviewer pointed out, the book is best understood when read aloud. I'm not sure if this is by design or simply because of Joyce's lyrical prose, but it's a good strategy especially in the tough passages.In all respects a classic, even if difficult at times. Influenced nearly everything else after it. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"Some people like to go for a stroll on the beach. Others like to climb Mount Everest. Reading Ulysses is much more like the latter than the former.I have now read this book four times. I must really be a glutton for punishment.Actually, the rereading is quite rewarding. When I first read the book in my youth, the only edition available was the one with all the printer's errors in it. Those errors made a difficult novel, much more so. So I found that my understanding and appreciation rose substantially when I could read the original version.As I grew older, I realized that I had had more experiences, read more books, and thought more thoughts. That meant that I found new layers of meaning in Ulysses.I plan to keep rereading this book on a regular basis for the rest of my life. I hope you find it this engrossing as well.What initially attracted me to the book was Joyce's ability to capture the inner dialogue that we all have. We alternate between thinking like angels and the basest animals. Joyce not only unveiled and portrayed that quality, he also imbued it with an elegance of expression that certainly exceeds my wit. It is almost as though an intellectual, well-educated literary comedian is invited along to make witnessing the internal dialogue more interesting.Of even greater significance is the reaction that many have to the novel. They simply do not want to plumb into someone else's mind, unless perhaps it is the mind of a saint. But who knows what a saint really thinks?The title, of course, is a dead giveaway (that few will need) that there are a literary analogy and symbolism involved. Those implications are enough to keep several Ph.D.'s busy for a career.Mr. Joyce was a most learned and observant man. What remarkable things must have gone on inside of his mind!If you are interested in extending your own ability to understand what is going on around you, I recommend Ulysses as a way to fill in the backdrop of what is not said when you are with others.If you are more than satisfied with surface reality, then by all means skip this book. You'll wonder what all the fuss is about.Perhaps the only exception to the latter is someone who loves a musical turn of phrasing, something Joyce excels in.Enjoy your journey!If you are like me, you'll find that it makes sense to keep your copy on the night table. You never know when you'll be ready for another trip to 1904."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"All the above reviews involve one person reading Ulysses in private, sometimes with help from notes and critics. This was a wildly new way of writing a book, so perhaps it calls for a wildly new way of reading it? I'm in an amateur group in Seattle that reads it together and does a staged reading of chapter a year of Ulysses. Our performances are free so this isn't a promotion! Many of the difficult things about the book are avoided with this method.....for example, it often seems obvious that voices are changing, and that becomes much clearer when one can hear the voices change. This includes jumps between different types of internal thoughts, or different literary styles. Also, the characters seem more real and easier to like when you can hear their voices. Plus, if something seems incomprehensible, you can't stop and perseverate about it during the actual performance.We spend several months reading together and listening to Joyce's prose and thinking about the different voices we hear in it, and researching the bits we don't understand, including esoteric references and pronunciations and mysteries. Then, on Bloomsday each year, the annual celebration of Joyce, but especially Ulysses, we read that chapter in public. The program includes that chapter's key features, a synopsis of the action, the analogy with the Odyssey, the symbols in Joyce's schema and the three or four most important of the intertwining themes within the chapter, and how that chapter relates to the rest of the book. People can bring along their copy of the book and read along.This is why Bloomsday was invented and is the best way to begin to appreciate Ulysses. Well, maybe I'm wrong. Perhaps Joyce meant us to struggle, as one other reviewer suggested, to recreate the travails of Odysseus and Bloom in our own minds as we try to understand this book with no help. BUT maybe he actually meant us to read it very slowly and thoughfully, relishing every turn of phrase, every comic and poignant moment and discussing all of the book's references, analogies and puzzles. Perhaps to overthrow the imperialism of English literature which includes telling us how a book should be read!?"},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"When I landed in Dublin a couple of years ago and the immigration officer at the airport asked me the purpose of my visit, I told him, \\"James Joyce pilgrimage.\\" He was bemused. \\"James Joyce?\\" he said. \\"You mean 'Ulysses'? That fella?\\" (This moment gave me my first lesson in genuine Irish pronunciation. The Irish pronounce the title of Joyce's great novel with an emphasis on the first syllable: 'YOO-liseez') I answered his questions affirmatively; he examined my passport, studied my face and said, \\"That's a hard book. Have you read 'Ulysses'?\\" I raised my eyebrows in surprise at the question and asked, \\"Will you kick me out of the country if I say no?\\" The immigration officer, still holding my passport, replied, \\"That's a distinct possibility, sir.\\" \\"Then yes,\\" I said, \\"yes, I've read it many times, yes.\\" He returned the passport and waved me through, saying, \\"Enjoy it anyway.\\"I actually have read this book six or seven times by now. When I first read it I was Stephen's age, and now I'm the same age as Bloom. As I have changed over the years, so has my understanding of the book. I still consider 'Ulysses' the greatest novel of the twentieth century, but I can now better appreciate its weaknesses. The \\"Oxen of the Sun\\" and \\"Eumaeus\\" chapters are tedious (the former, in fact, is a failure), but the book's many high points greatly outweigh its faults. And, by the way, it's a COMIC novel, and don't let the professors tell you different."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"James Joyce is a genius. Let's all say it together, loud and proud. Maybe he is so much of a genius that he has created in a novel, Ulysses, a work that is so far above anyone's heads that since the majority of the reading public doesn't understand, well then, by God, it must be supernova brilliant. Was it just me? Did my intellectual shortcomings not allow me to truly enjoy this work that makes everyone's top 10 books of the century list? Or was Joyce just playing around? A writer with mastery of the language decided to fool around a little and release a novel that is an exercise in experimentation on what you can do with language but nothing really more. To harbor my fragile intellectual ego, that's the theory I'm going with. Greatest book of all time or not, I just didn't get it.This book is supposed to be about Leopold Bloom and Stephen Dedalus and a day in the life of Dublin in 1904. I really had to read the other reviews or cliff notes to be able to discern what happens on that day despite reading the book thoroughly. I know I sure didn't get it from the book. If cryptic meaning, having to read other books so you understand the book you're reading, and spending months slogging through a book is what your looking for in a read, by all means tackle Ulysses. Should we have to labor so hard to enjoy a book? I don't think so. The unique language and wordplay stand out above the rest of the white noise fray making this book redeemable, like a 783 page poem with no plot, if you can imagine enduring something like that.Maybe Joyce, from an Irish heaven, 70 year later is having the last laugh, as the intellectual world hails his &quot;playing around&quot; as THE modern masterpiece. Maybe it takes an English Literary Doctorate and many years to get enjoyment out of this book. I don't have either though, so the enjoyment wasn't there. Joy is the reason I read. I didn't find it with Ulysses."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"Every time there's a verb of speaking and a colon, this kindle ebook simply omits what follows. Somebody must've been in a big hurry."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"Joyce defeats his purpose by making this book impossible for a reasonably well-educated reader possessed of a reasonably decent vocabulary to get through without having to reach for the dictionary every other sentence, causing the reader to break his rhythm and disrupting the author's stream-of-consciousness narrative. And Joyce's vocabulary isn't merely extensive, its obscure and often so archaic that most dictionaries weighing fewer than 20 lbs. don't contain the words he uses. Unless you're young, if you don't read a book sentence by sentence, understanding the meaning of most every word, you aren't really reading or absorbing it, and its a waste of time, which is sad, because Ulysses has been such an influential work. But ultimately who cares? I'm coming to the unfortunate conclusion that the work of almost every member of the Lost Generation is failing to stand the test of time. Its one thing to read these icons in your early 20s; its another when you're approaching 50. As you get older, you realize Fitzgerald's and Hemingway's novels are terribly dated; Gertrude Stein's theories about writing are infinitely more interesting than her writing itself; and guys like Dos Passos are irrelevant. Now Joyce. Like Pound, he's interesting in the abstract, I guess. And I imagine that, years from now, apart from Portrait of the Artist and Dubliners, such will be his only legacy."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"uggghhhh, after nine months i finally finished this rambling, incoherent string of words.i took this book on because i'm reading the 100 best books of the 20th century (as defined by the modern library). i had read about 20 already before taking on this 'project'. so why not start at number 1? big mistake.when i bought it, i had no idea what it was about, and i actually became excited when i heard that it loosely followed the odyssey. was i ever disappointed. this book just kept rambling and rambling. 2/3rds of the way through i still didn't know what was going.the only reason i know anything about this book (even after finishing it) was because i went on the internet and found 'ulysses for dummies' - a cartoon depiction of the book. my suggestion, save yourself 9 months and read 'ulysses for dummies'whoever listed this as number 1 was smoking too much crack - since i can't afford a nine-month crack habit, i guess i'll never be able to truly appreciate it."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"Camus wrote--in \\"The Plague,\\" I believe--something to the effect that if one really wanted to comprehend every moment's passing, he or she should spend the whole of his or her life in lines waiting for theatre tickets. The point which Monsieur Camus was trying to communicate, I think, is that we should be somewhat happy for the passing of our lives, for it is when we are engaged in the most miseable of chores that we are most aware of time's pasage.I must conclude that Camus never read Joyce, for I am certain that if he had, he would have substituted \\"reading Joyce's Ulysses\\" for \\"waiting in line for theatre tickets.\\" This incoherent, gratuitously allusive, over-long monster of a novel is what English majors have canonized to prove to Engineers that they're smart too (and I write that as a not-too-bright Poli Sci major myself). In the interests of full disclosure, I admit that I have a special hate of this book: a sadist Yallie-Ellmanite English teacher of mine forced me to read it the summer before my senior year of high school.Ulysses has two great strengths. First, it steals the plot of the Odyssey in its entirety--thus, you're not really missing anything by not understanding it. Second, unlike other books in English, it does not discriminate--it it is equally incomprehensible to English and non-English speakers alike--little wonder that the touchy-feelies who dominate ivy league English departments love it so.Lemon soap; masturbate on the beach; stately, plump Buck Whocares?Sadly, though Ulysses is awful, Joyce was not without talent. One can see the glimmer of greatness--great lyrical streches of words, wonderful cadences here and there, etc. This book, however, is the literary equivalent of a Mondrian painting, it is the smug mocking of art(and in certain circles, those who dare to point this out are treated like the boy who observes that the emperor is not wearing clothes).

Find me one person who has both: a) actually finished reading Ulysses, and b) enjoyed every moment, and I'll show you a liar.Ulysses is a failed novel because Joyce was a bad writer (shown by his other works). And all the illerati who insist (as did Time magazine) that it was the best novel of the 20th century are simply trying to cover up their own shortcomings of character by trying to appear as that which they are not: literate and respectable.Art is not something you have to \\"get through.\\" It is not something you have to convince yourself and others that it exists in the form you behold.

I have to give Joyce points for being clever and kudos for verbosity. After struggling through it again, I had to ask myself what was the point? Most of the book strikes me as an attempt by the author to show how very clever he was with word play and analogy and practically every other literary devise under the sun.To me as a reader, literature requires something more than an exercise in erudition or diction. I may be in a distinct minority here, but I still dislike Joyce for inflicting such a circus upon readers."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"Not being an English Literature major, nor an avid reader, I nevertheless decided to read the entire top 100 novels. I would start with the top novel, Ulysses. In that fashion, of reading the best novel first, I could excite myself, that is to kickstart myself, into reading quality material. Prior to this adventure, I mostly focused on the books I could understand, like calculus or structural engineering. Ulysses is far more complex than those references.To ask: Did I finish the book? I must say yes, times one point five. And I accomplished the feat in under three years. After a severe mental breakdown from trying to choke down the book in two bites, I started over after being half finished. I was sure that I had missed something in the first half, so I wanted to return and see what I missed. I searched hard, taking time to savor every word, often looking up words that I thought I may be misinterpreting, But to no avail. But I persisted.I made it through the chapter about Stephen Dedalus for the second time, and was encouraged that more exciting events were sure to surface.Then, through the second chapter about Bloom, I began to get very worried that I would just give up my quest for fine arts. But survived, realizing that I only had several hundred more pages to wade through, to the climax, and forthcoming literary rewards.So I finally approached the end of the novel, reaching the last chapter, paragraph, or sentence, whatever it may be considered, being that it was devoid of punctuation for nearly 100 pages. Apparently it was the authors form of providing the run-on thoughts of a mixed up middle-aged woman, in the middle of non-fulfilling acts of sleeping, half sleeping, dreaming, or other non-physical event.In conclusion, Don't read the book.

Typically, this novel is a university favourite as there is so much to discuss, unravel and admire.I don't see how anybody can say that Ulysses is their favourite read. Like all of Joyce's works it is not particularly warm and, for me, wasn't a work to inspire and enflame the spirit.

With his other books you really did not mind the parts when nothing really happens and his heavy prose style.

I am glad I read it and finished it. If you want to read a book that goes straight to your heart, read Stolen Moments by Barbara Jeanne Fisher. . .It is a beautiful story of unrequited love. . .for certain the love story of the nineties. I intended to give the book a quick read, but I got so caught up in the story that I couldn't put the book down. From the very beginning, I was fully caught up in the heart-wrenching account of Julie Hunter's battle with lupus and her growing love for Don Lipton. This love, in the face of Julie's impending death, makes for a story that covers the range of human emotions. The touches of humor are great, too, they add some nice contrast and lighten things a bit when emotions are running high. I've never read a book more deserving of being published. It has rare depth. Julie's story will remind your readers that life and love are precious and not to be taken for granted. It has had an impact on me, and for that I'm grateful. Stolen Moments is written with so much sensitivity that it made me want to cry. It is a spellbinder. What terrific writing. Barbara does have an exceptional gift!

Without a plot, it's just a bunch of random thoughts thrown at the wall, which is what this giant pile of excrement truly is. Don't buy the hype, I've read dozens and dozens of books deemed 'classic' and I found most to be labeled so for good reason. James Joyce is NOT a great writer, and this proves it. Awful, just awful..."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"Despite its lofty status as a revered icon of English literature, one only has to fight through a dozen or so pages to reach the painfully obivious conclusion that Ulysses is, in fact, unreadable gibberish.The book has no plot, no dramatic arc, no message, a (literally) pedestrian structure, and sentences constructed by means of a random walk through the dictionary as well as through Dublin, Ireland. It has no discernable central thought. No one can tell you what the book is about, for it is about nothing. But wait, perhaps there is an underlying theme, albeit one well hidden.Remember the fable of the Emperor's new clothes? Guillible courtiers were induced to beleive that a charlatan tailor had sewn garments for the Emperor that only suitably refined folk could see. In reality, there was nothing there at all. Jame Joyce and generations of literary sycophants have convinced impressionable students that Ulysses is a worthy read.When the uninitiaed find the text incoherent, this failure is chalked up to insufficient literary maturity. It can't be the fault of the book's alcohol-addled author.\\"Press on,\\" the professors say, \\"Ulysses' gloss will be revealed if only one perseveres past the many opaque chapters, thus developing the right sensitivities.\\"However, looking longer at this nonsense only reveals the glaring absense of rational content and the transparent emptiness. The self-indulgent Emperor Joyce has no clothes.The most damming indictment of this over-wrought tome is the fact that it is impossible to find ten people who have actually finished it. Ulysses is one of those books that everyone has heard of, but no one has read. Hence the market for Ulysses crib cards for use at cocktail parties by poseurs with literary pretensions or by guys with dates with English Lit chicks whom they are trying to bed. Perhaps Ulysses has some tactical utility after all, as an example of inverse Chick Lit.One supposes that the stream-of-consciousness descriptions of nose picking, masturbation, and sex broke ground for serious literature when published in the 1920's. Joyce deserves some credit for expanding the gross horizons of writing, but today's target audiences find those subjects ordinary and routine. This taboo-breaking history is hardly sufficient reason to examine Ulysses now. To be timeless literature, a book must speak to fundamental truths about ourselves.But what, if anything, does Ulysses tell us about the human condition? I suggest its plot-free message is one Joyce didn't, or couldn't, intend. That is; to trust one's educated common sense. If, to you, a book walks like a duck, looks like a duck, and sounds like a duck, then it was most likely written by a quack.If this stream-of-consciousness genre appeals to you, for a much better read get anything by Hunter S. Thompson. Dr. Gonzo's book will be more coherent, make more sense, and will be better crafted. And, your eyes won't glaze over after ten pages, as they will with Ulysses."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"Considered such a masterpiece - I HAD to read it. What a waste of time...First - the language: extremely difficult and archaic. Even for English speaking people. Can one enjoy a book if one needs a dictionary every couple of lines ?Then the allegedly 'cultural' riddles Joyce planted in the book for the sole purpose of torturing generations of English literature students and their teachers. Ask yourself - are you going to enjoy a book that neccesitates your literature teacher lie next to you and explain its 'sophistication' to you ? Every other page ?Then the foreign languages quotes in latin, german, irish, italian and who knows what else...Did Joyce expect his readers to be THAT fluent in other dialects ?Personally - I think Joyce wrote the book being completely drunk.

At the moment I don't find it nessesary to read it any furder.But here are the conclussions I have made.Why this book is interresting:-The stream of consience idea is great, really. I love it.-I also love the idea that he descided to write about some of the things no sensibele writter would have ever written about. Like how Bloom went to the toilet or mastrubated.Why this book is a load of crap:-Way to long (I have nothing against long books and I have read quite a lot of books and I love Homer, Dante, Shakespear, Milton, Orwell, Huxley, Poe, Bulgakov, Plato, Swift, Nietzsche, Dickens, Asimov and many more so I do know a bit about litterature) this book should have ended whit the third chapter.-It lacks a plot. I am not saying that there has to be a overlingly complicated story behind it but it should have some directionlines.-The languege. Joyce seems to want to point out the whole time how good he knows English and that is very irretating.-It has no real meaning. I know that people have looked for one but all they have come up whit where some things like it is an epic of the body (well describing how someone goes to the toilet could hardly be discrived as epic. The also spoke about the complex intriging monologs and the praise of the mind (well the just say a lot of things and never seem to be able to think in a straigt line for longer than 3 min. And finally the the so cold new light that Joyce shines on myths. The mostly bring up Odysseus whit this one. Well people seek for Odysseus in this book because Joyce told them to do so.-Almost anybody could have written this book.I would also like to point out that when it was released all the people who love this book now (writters and proffesors) hatted this book. If it had never ben forbidden it would have just been forgotten like it perhaps should.I would like also to say that I didn't stopt reading tis book because it was to difficult but because it was borring.

The langauge varies from beautiful to impenetrable, with allusions galore. The themes were shocking in 1922, and portrayed in all of life's gory detail. But is it worth it?The time involved in reading (let alone understanding) this book is enormous, easily on the order of fifty hours. What does this steep admission price buy? Simply put, not enough. Their are a multitude of insights one can draw from Bloom's day, but their are none that aren't easier to gleen from other writings. The language, while beautiful at times, does not justify the investment, in my opinion. For a passionate lover of English langauge and literature, this book may be for you.

But it wasn't until college that I was able to read this book and make sense of it (spent a whole semester doing so in a course by a superb professor).But let's get back to the novel. Told a single day, the tale of Leopold Bloom is one that was unprecedented in its time. So much flap followed this book's publication in Europe that it took a ruling from our supreme court here in the states to allow the publication of Ulysses in America. The story, by Joyce's own admission, is modeled after Homer's Odyssey. Joyce himself admitted to, and I paraphrase here, including so many \\"enigmas and puzzles\\" he would keep scholars busy for years and solidify his own immortality. So much for being a humble writer. Of course, one might argue that no writer, by the very act of writing, can exercise humility.Ulysses, since it was first serialized in a mag back in 1922, has always been more about people celebrating Joyce's supposed genius rather than about the book itself. It is, for the most part, a very poorly written book with prose, when the author is busy playing the old \\"look at how clever I am with wordcraft\\" game, is rather dull and empty.Considered the modernist book of the ages, I recommend reading it first in a structured environment like a college classroom; even if you have to audit the class (maybe you can find a Joyce class at your local college). And if you can't do that it's best to hunker down withUlysses Annotated: Notes for James Joyce's Ulysses [Revised and Expanded Edition] otherwise you might get lost like I did.With that said, if you are looking for a beautifully written, compelling story I would look elsewhere.

As a student, you have to read it(like Shakespeare of course - but he's slightly better). And every book that you HAVE to read is already suspicious. Why is it a 'must'? Because if you would not be forced, you wouldn't read it?So true because this is a waste of space. How wonderful such space can be used, other longer books like 'The Lord of the Rings', 'Dune' or 'Catch-22' prove. They aim for entertainment, for fun, for joy in reading and all the same, they deliver perfect writing and characterisation. Now what is wrong with entertainment? Nothing! Even the bible wants to entertain - but Joyce is of course above such unnoble things like 'fun' or 'entertainment'. He's into style. And that's what he delivers:Dry, boring and self-satisfied style. He might be a good writer but he should have used 'Ulysses' as a starting point, as a construct in which he could fill a story. There are passages where his style is fantastic - short, journalistic style, the one I always use, the one I like. But these are LINES in a book of hundreds of pages... now if that is not a waste, I don't know what is."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"I challenge any so-called critic to read Ulysses out loud, in an auditorum full of listeners and explain, page by page, without notes or the extensive annotations available, just what each and every sentence and word means. Those effetes who proclaim this the greatest novel of all time are kidding themselves and us. It isn't. The fact that JJ state, in writing, that he had loaded up his novel with so much foreign words, obtuse references and effermeral meanings to keep academics busy for years say it all. The fact that he had to provide a schema to his closest readers also says volumes. And HE CHANGED that schema more than once. So, obviously JJ himself didn't understand what he meant! Nice book for literature students and prof.s to OOO and AAAH about, but the fact is it is boring to the nth degree and simply not up or even close to anything by Tolstoy or Dostoyevsky or any number of other competent writers. Some time in the future it will become one of the least read novels of all time...perhaps then folks will start to take a more realistic view of what JJ really achieved."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"You can't understand this book without a study guide. That fact alone should be enough to scare you away. One reviewer asks why a reader should have to work so hard to understand a novel and it is a good question, in my opinion. I think that a work of art which is not self-explanatory but which demands an additional volume and commentators in order to comprehend it is a failure. I heard one professor suggest that we should all take three years out of our lives to go through this book and to appreciate it fully. Yeah, right. I have never been too keen about anyone who thinks they know what I &quot;should&quot; do with my life. There are far too many other great and rewarding pleasures available to me in my life which are more easily accessible for me to waste my time deciphering what looks like the work of a schizophrenic. The modernist conceit is that Joyce and other non-linear novelists have captured the actual mental processes of man's daily life. Perhaps if you need medication and are plagued by mania, yes. My mental processes are not a mad jumble and I do not see how anyone with a professional occupation could function if this were true. It simply isn't so. There is a famous sex scene in this book where the mental thoughts of the individual coming to climax fills many pages. I asked around and no one I know thinks about anything while climaxing except for a sexual fantasy. Totally unrealistic."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"Woolf was right.

For all the hard work I had to do to figure out what he was talking about, I did not get one moment's enjoyment. Down with pretentious male modernists who feel we should all spend our lives &quot;working&quot; to unveil the &quot;true meaning&quot; in their words. For all you Joyceans out there who like to mock the &quot;commoners&quot; for not &quot;getting&quot; Joyce, I am working on a PhD in English--and I &quot;get&quot; him just fine, thank you.

No work in which the style causes the vast majority of the readers (even of the highly educated readers) to become disallusioned and pretty much sick of can be considered a true masterpiece.

This monstrosity of hideous prose confirms that Joyce had no style and certainly no class. The novel can rightly be blamed for being the originator of the misguided notion that the squalor-and-filth quotient of a story is directly proportional to its artistic merit.The very least one might ask of a book is that it be readable. With this is mind, Ulysses, ludicrously canonised as the greatest of all novels, is a failure in the most fundamental respect. It is the only book I can think of where the reader deserves more credit for finishing it than the author. In the words of a *real* writer (H. L.

Even the people who don't &quot;get it,&quot; and feel compelled to give this miserable piece of trash 5-star ratings let some of its true character seep through.In the 5-star reviews alone, we see: &quot;my head aches after reading it,&quot; &quot;one will never be able to understand,&quot; &quot;a vast, complex book about nothing,&quot; &quot;when I finished Ulysses, I felt an emptyness,&quot; &quot;meaning that vanishes in the distance of one's ability to comprehend it,&quot; &quot;Ulysses is not Ulysses,&quot; &quot;sometimes the narrative line just seems to dissapear.&quot;Anyone with respect for themselves should skip this &quot;book about nothing&quot; and find a book about _something_ instead."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"The only real reason to tackle the massive burden of Ulysses is to become aware of the stark reality that it expresses regarding the \\"spirit of the age\\", essentially a rampant nihilism. Then one can possibly adjust one's outlook on the current world society and proceed accordingly, perhaps avoiding being a lemming going over the cliff.Before entering the cavern of this work, one has to decide the \\"why\\" as above, then the \\"how\\". For me, after much diddling, false starts and self deceptions, this excellent CD set became the obvious answer. I had heard the comments of people far more intelligent than I on how difficult the work was to plow through. Therefore, I would have even more difficulty than they if I chose to continue reading it (a false start at reading the 735 page tome got almost nowhere). Also, I would be displaying a gracious nature in accepting the much-touted idea that \\"Joyce's prose must be HEARD to be truly appreciated\\".The production here is an excellent way to expose oneself in a leisurely manner to the book's wily trap without becoming totally enmeshed. The trap is simply that one thinks the work is \\"going to say something\\", but the fact remains that it really says nothing, albeit in a brilliant way.One can be tired but still listen to part of a CD, repeat passages at will, turn it off, reflect, then continue. It is MUCH harder to read this work than to listen to it. The CD set also contains very valuable and detailed notes about each section as well as overall enlightening critical information, and relevant musical selections are also present throughout.If one is truly serious about attacking this work, I would recommend the sort of \\"Joyce for Dummies\\" approach that I followed: purchase the DVD of the film version of Joyce's A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man (although the film doesn't boast a very good screenplay and is unrestored, the performances are excellent), as well as the CD audio book of the same title (abridged, but all the important parts are there). Absorbing these will give you a central clue about Ulysses, mostly in the Stephen Dedalus character that appears in both (hint: Stephen is a boring, cold, emotionless prig). Then purchase the DVD of the 1967 film version of Ulysses (excellent photography in a pristine black and white print). Although set in 1967, it will give you a reasonably OK overview of the \\"story\\" of Ulysses which is set in 1904.Having taken in these, you are almost ready to proceed to the CD set of Ulysses, and you can already rightly claim to have listened to the prose of Joyce, definitely a feather in your cap at certain parties (where you may also want to rhyme off a few memorized lines in the appropriate accent).Avoid the millions of words contained in endless musings about the book, and read only one essay, that of Carl Jung entitled Ulysses in the book The Spirit in Man, Art, and Literature. If read carefully and more than once before listening to the Ulysses CD set, you'll find that it does indeed contain the golden key to truly understanding the nature of this massively influential book."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"As a devout modernist, I put off the pleasure of reading this book for years. I wanted to have the time and leisure to give it proper attention. I had taken a seminar with Anthony Burgess on ULYSSES at CCNY in the early seventies. We did a close reading of the Nighttown chapter and were supposed to read the rest of the novel on our own. I never did. But Burgess' enthusiasm was impressive and though I wasn't entirely convinced, I was certainly intrigued. In earlier years I had read DUBLINERS and PORTRAIT and even some of FINNEGANS WAKE and was especially impressed by Joyce's mastery of language and the poetic quality of his prose.An early retirement offer finally had me reading the \\"GREATEST NOVEL OF THE 20th CENTURY\\" last month in Riverside Park. Some nice cigars added to the mix.The first few chapters were stunning. The powers of description, the playfulness and musicality of language, the wit and intelligence of Stephen and Buck were a delight. I was obviously in the hands of a master. Shakespeare even came to mind.But then something happened. The humanity and poetry seemed to drain out of the thing as we were treated to yet another chapter of theoretical \\"experimentation in narrative technique\\". The idea of writing a novel, each chapter of which is written in a parodistic or borrowed style seems to me a doomed one (and more postmodernist than modernist). Apparently even Ezra Pound objected. I found myself asking, \\"Couldn't Joyce have found his own voice and style to narrate this section?\\" An entire narrative chapter in the question and answer form of a Catholic Catechism seems affected at first. After thirty pages it is deadly and even embarrassing. And then another in the style of a men's sporting magazine, and then another in the style of a women's magazine? What's the point (other than showing off)? And the Freudian/Surrealist kitsch of the endless Nighttown chapter was downright infantile. Talk about dated! This is novel writing from the outside in. First you have an \\"experimental\\" concept and then you fit in some narrative stuff. It's no wonder academics use this book as major fodder. It seems to be written with them in mind.Likewise the useless tie ins with Homer's ODYSSEY. One can't help thinking of them as a desperate attempt to add structure, incident and theme to a book fairly bereft of them. Not to mention adding a bit of literary pedigree to offset the \\"obscenity\\".Which brings me to my main point. The fancy smorgasbord of styles cannot disguise the fact that as a novel, ULYSSES is sorely lacking. Involving narrative, depth and development of characterization , thematic focus, depth of feeling etc. seem totally absent. Basically what we have here is a brief Balzacian \\"realist\\" sketch, padded out and styled-up beyond belief.Now this is really a minority opinion: not only is ULYSSES a failure, but the reason I think it is a failure is that it is a transitional work. Joyce was obviously bored with novelistic narrative but still felt obliged to accommodate. With FINNEGANS WAKE, he hit stride and finally found his m&eacute;tier - a book as a place to play with language and psyche for his own pleasure, without regard for traditional novelistics.A NOTE ON EDITIONS: The huge academic controversy about which edition of ULYSSES is \\"authentic\\" or \\"correct\\" is, as one might expect, much ado about very little. Serious textual issues are minimal. Most of the typos in the 1922 edition were corrected in 1960/1 by the editors of the Modern Library in consultation with Richard Ellmann. That text was also used for the Bodley Head and current Everyman editions. Gabler later went overboard, making some highly questionable decisions. His edition is also difficult to read due to small print, layout, line-numbering etc. Danis Rose's edition went even further and \\"corrected\\" Joyce's compound words etc. - a disgrace.I ended up reading an online version edited by Jorn Barger - a very sensible amalgam of the best work of previous editors. It took some time and expense to print out, but it was definitely worth it."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"The best introduction to James Joyce is James Joyce. He did everything so well he only had to each thing once. One short story collection: Dubliners. And one great novel: Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man. On the basis of these two works alone Joyce would be legend. But he did not stop there, he went further than anyone had ever gone with literature and wrote a new kind of novel, Ulysses. And after that another new kind of novel, Finnegans Wake. Ulysses is a work which every reader must face once in his life. Or twice. No other novel so sums up the reason novels are written. Ulysses is an epoch about culture but told lyrically through two characters, the familiar Stephen Dedalus and Leopold Bloom. Both will win you over. Dedalus for his scholars apprenticeship at life, and Bloom for his well versed walk through the very reaches of modern life. Irish this is in the very best sense. The language is real but the words are not coming from everyday talk but from the inside, the waking consciousness' dialogue with itself. That is the magic of this book. It is completely original born from nothing but inspiration. It is a great move to have Stephen, the character from his last novel, collide with Bloom, this new novels creation. Joyce has the teachers good will to introduce you to the new work via an old companion, brilliant stroke. The modern world really makes no sense is Stephens Tragedy and Blooms comedy. If you are a young man you will probably share Stephen's sentiments and if you are beyond youth you will share Bloom's. Or both which makes it all the more wonderful. No book is more insightful in leading to an understanding of the western predicament and no book has yet come close. Joyce writes in a sometimes hard to decipher prose but it is all worth it. In the end you will feel you have collided with the one who understood first what it was to be a modern life. Make it easy on yourself and read this after Dubliners and Portrait of the Artist as a Young man. For the best readers there is no other way. As for Finnegans Wake, I am still preparing."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"My discussions about ULYSSES bring out a similar comment from others--no matter how many times we return to the novel, we find something new. This richly rendered piece proves that virtual reality existed long before computers; it required a rich imagination, a good eye for detail, and a finely tuned ear for the music of voices and everyday sound. We find these things in ULYSSES. It deserves the praise it has earned for these many decades."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"This is a book that can't be ignored if you want to be considered by anyone to be a &quot;serious&quot; reader, but it shouldn't be ignored. The truth is it is endless entertaining and enlightening. Though you need to spend many hours with it, you'll leave with a lot more than a great name to add to the list of authors you've read. You'll never let it go."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"Preface by stating difficulty of full appreciation and fair comment on Ulysses on first reading. One proceeds ungrounded in the various contexts exposed to the author's unique and various styles wherein apparently Joyce attempts creation of reality by limiting his writing to the thoughts and communications of his characters without the crutches of traditional literature. Unknown to me why Joyce chose this particular style, though I speculate he must have wanted to illustrate the irrational nature of the thought process, and perhaps to show off the workings of his own mind. Joyce combines this method with what seems a deliberate effort of obscurity rather than clarity, complexity rather than simplicity, often degenerating into incoherence. He flits about continuously over dozens of subjects within the same page, and most often seems unwilling, or perhaps unable, to bring it all together causing frequent head scratchings for the skeptical reader. But in all this is an author so obviously brilliant that you chug on even when hopelessly lost, always expecting the bells to chime and lights to come on. There are many well done scenes, for me--the first chapter of young men bantering, the classroom in chapter 2, poignant expression of husband and wife relations with bloom and molly in the bedroom, and bloom back in bed after a night of carousing; an ending soliloquy that finally puts women in their place, and could that have been done more effectively--all rendered in writing flashing ability equivalent to the all time best. An imperfect book, but as many reviews note, it is a book on so many levels that generalization is impossible. I will appreciate Ulysses for what I believed it was, which is a lighthearted humorous thought provoking exposition in the style of the author of his own significant gifts."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"A stylistically sprawling, richly symbolic, discursive fresco, &quot;Ulyssess&quot; remains the one book that has pushed the form of the novel to explorative extremes. Not to be perused at leisure, but to be studied with diligent effort, it will be regarded as a death sentence by the average reader, but for the genuine lover of literature it's a treat. &quot;Ulyssess&quot; is an elephantine, pedantic, sometimes self-indulgent novel. At first reading, one might feel intimidated by it, which is why student guides and annotated editions are so essential. In reality, it's a very touching and candid book and not as bullying as it seems at all, but an encounter with the most familiar and daily incidents, embedded in the intimacies of lived experience. For all his dense allusiveness and linguistic acrobatics, Joyce's message is so simple that it almost seems a commonplace: the human need to love and be loved. At the same time, though it has been proclaimed as possibly the most individual and innovative novel of the century, one will discover that it's neither individual (with its polyphonic multiple registers) nor innovative (with its reliance on mining pop culture, Celtic traditions, literary precedents -- which were already extant). The really innovative novel of this type was &quot;Tristram Shandy&quot;."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"I often compare Joyce to an epoch: The Ancient Greeks (collectively), Shakespeare, and Joyce. These are the masters that produce works whose breadth is overwhelming. It is a shame, on the one hand, that a mind such as Joyce's only surfaces every few hundred years. However, it is fortunate (especially for Literature majors and graduate students) that the frequency is so minimal. When I first read Ulysses, I had prepared myself with years of literary training and hours upon hours of reading. The first impression was numbing yet inspiring. In the aftermath of having read the work, I find myself reflecting back upon this work more than any other (this is saying quite a bit coming from a student of American literature). Be prepared with numerous secondary sources, including Ellmann's biography, and expect nothing short of extraordinary for this is one work a reader can never overestimate and one can never relive the first encounter with Ulysses."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"Yes, OK, it's always easy to say you don't like something (therefore, you are better than that particular work of art) Having recently arrive from Dublin, the Ulyses experience is understood different: now I can see why Life can happen in just one day.

I'm more of a &quot;The Triumph and the Glory&quot; or &quot;Stones From the River&quot; type.

It is an adventure for the mind. The reader is taken to a journey through the minds of three everyday individuals and discovers hidden thoughts, desires and guilts. It is not an easy journey though, as the reader is confronted with obstacles that challenges one's own intelligence and understanding of the story. The book is written in several different ways which will confuse the reader. I feel that when James Joyce wrote the book, he wanted to go beyond just writing a regular novel. He wanted to show us the true nature of the mind the way it really is in a variety of forms. I must say that is was very hard for me to get through the book at times and so I used the cliffs notes to help me. All the characters are excellent and some of them remind me of people I know. It is a book I will read over and over again with great pleasure. I have read many other books and this is one of my favorites. I found it funny how many people were complaining about how difficult it was and how Joyce was wrong in writing it the way he did. I don't see a problem with it. Ulysses wouldn't be great if it was written in any other form. I'm just a normal teenager who simply became interested in Joyce. If I could get through the book alive, anyone can.

Reading Ulysses is quite a challenge to the late twentieth century attention span, but if you can get through the maternity ward (recapitulation of the history of the english language) and circe/whorehouse (the abandonment of the rational) episodes, I think you're rewarded with the hilarious, exremely erudite yet still accessible catechism of the penultimate chapter, as well as Molly's freeflowing stream (of thought). On a bookmark I received with an order from Amazon, there is a quote by Elizabeth Drew positing that the &quot;test of literature&quot; is whether or not we live more intensely for reading it.

I won't pretend to understand this book fully. I won't pretend that I caught all the nounces and themes. The fact is that quite a few chapters were incomprehensible to me, although that had not lessened my enjoyment of the book. I would have to say that the most difficult chapter was \\"Circe\\", which I struggled through like a sapper going through a mine field. Most enjoyable chapters, not to mention hilarious ones were \\"Hades\\" and \\"Cyclops\\". For these two chapters alone, this book is worth reading. Hey, I would read anything that would put me back in Dublin. Joyce's mastery of English language is unparalleled and I think he was an absolute genius with words ( a lot of them indecipherable, as it were, but that's okay).In conclusion, I liked the book quite a lot, and would read it again in ten years or so.

Today, we can seethat his fiction worked on much higher levels: his portrayalof sex (and other things) is more inventive than Miller's,more subversive than Mappelthorpe's. Joyce's intention is noless than to create an entire mental universe; his novel isa potent artistic answer to the philosophical question, &quot;Do we really exist?&quot;Leopold Bloom, the hero of the story, is a completelyordinary man; but Joyce's combination of words and theproliferation of cross-connections between the current word andthe next illustrate that there is often little connectionbetween *what* we think and the *words* we think. So Joyceis in effect trying to write a novel without words; he wantsto get into the stream of Bloom's thought directly, withoutpreface or interference.Though most would agree that this is a &quot;difficult&quot; novel --perhaps the first book to attempt to break the limits oflanguage -- it is a must-read.

Far away in the west the sun was setting and the last glow of all too fleeting day lingered lovingly on sea and strand, on the proud promontory of dear old Howth guarding as ever the waters of the bay, on the weedgrown rocks along Sandymount shore and, last but not least, on the quiet church whence there streamed forth at times upon the stillness the voice of prayer to her who is in her pure radiance a beacon ever to the storm-tossed heart of man, Mary, star of the sea.\\"So, we must assume that he has primarily written Ulysses for some purpose other than to entertain and to provide the kind of pleasure that would be expected from a typical novel. Ulysses is more along the lines of a textbook (in the form of fictional examples) about the philosophy of writing and language, but was decades ahead of it's time. The impact of writing and language on our perceptions of the world appears to be his true goal, with all other considerations a distant second (excepting perhaps the magnificently created character of Leopold Bloom).Ask yourself why you read. If it is for the pleasure of opening up a book and getting lost in it and enjoying the ride, then go elsewhere. If it is to expand your mind on the ideas of writing, language, and reality and perhaps to expand your own writing then this book will be very much to your liking.The best comparison I could think of was with Nabokov. Multiply Nabokov's wordplay and games by a million, but remove most of the the engaging and interesting aspects and the stunningly refined and smooth writing of every single sentence and what you have is Ulysses. But that's OK, because they seem to have had different goals for their writing, as mentioned above.Finally, to those of you who are attempting to read it for the first time and are wondering if it \\"gets better\\" (ie suddenly makes sense and settles down into a typical book once you get past a certain point), it doesn't, it wasn't meant to."},{"Title":"Ulysses.","review":"I received a copy of this for Christmas many years ago, but before that I used to have a copy of theUlysses (Gabler Edition)(which is the complete book the way that Joyce would have preferred were it not for censorious typesetters).

Believe it or not, this edition is the bowlderized one...and it still ended up being confiscated due to the Comstock Act! Strange, but true.As a historical document, the Forward is a wonderful reason to buy this version because it says so darned much about the times in which the obscenity trial took place. Just make sure you can get your hands on the Gabler edition as well to compare notes. You'll see what I mean about the difference between the two. But that's only because I'm a Lit nerd.

The latter might be true, because most books written afterwards have somehow used the stream-of-consciousness-technique and the non-linear storytelling. Mostly, the book is really about language and its relation to the modern world. Joyce wanted to use a different approach to language to make it consistent with the increasing complexity of every-day-life in a big city. I think that even modern movie experiments such as David Lynchs \\"Mulholland Drive\\" go back to Joyce' ideas to really dig deep in the complicated psyche of an individual, for which traditional storytelling is not sufficient.But is it really unreadable? The book certainly needs some preparation and some effort from your side, more than most other books. But once you are well prepared, the Ulysses is actually well readable, and at most time even a lot of fun. And often you do not wonder why it was heavily criticized at the time it came out. For example, most of modern literature which uses a lot of profanity and vulgarity looks like children books when compared to the Circe-chapter, a sado-masochistic fantasy of the protagonist. Joyce' language skill makes this chapter breathtaking, a pure adventure.At other times, the book is a pure delight, for example \\"Wandering Rocks\\" or \\"Penelope\\". If you listen to your intuition, even the latter (which is the most legendary chapter of the \\"Ulysses\\") is not difficult to read. But then, there are also parts where Joyce' experiment with language fails: For example the \\"Oxen of the Sun\\" is just bothersome and really unreadable.As I said, the book is only fun if you are well prepared for it. You should definitely read Joyce \\"Dubliners\\" first, which is an easy to read collection of short stories. It introduces some of the characters which return in the \\"Ulysses\\", and this gives you helpful background information. Even more important, read \\"Portrait of the Artist\\", which is a portrait of Steven as a young man. He has a main role in \\"Ulysses\\", and \\"Portrait\\" already introduces a lot of the central ideas of Steven and \\"Ulysses\\" in general.Other books which are comparable in style and intention but easier to read are Virginia Woolfs' \\"Miss Delloway\\" and John Dos Passos' \\"Manhattan Transfer\\", definitely two books which warm you up for the idea of \\"stream of consciousness\\".All in all, Ulysses is an experiment with language which is a lot of fun, but which does not work for all parts of the book."},{"Title":"40 Ways to Raise a Nonracist Child","review":"I was leary at first to read this book as racism is a hard subject to cover.

The book is laid out in a logical, easy to follow manner. The musical pieces progress from simple to more complex as the book goes on. At the beginning of the book, Noad explains the ornaments and notation of the Baroque style in simple language. All of the pieces are written in modern notation with helpful explanations of the origin of the composition, guidelines for playing, and composer backgrounds. I've had this book for five years, and I still am enjoying it. It's wonderful resource. If you are a guitarist wanting to get into the Baroque style, this is the book!"},{"Title":"The Baroque Guitar","review":"Most every classical guitarist should own at least a couple of the famous Noad books. \\"The Baroque Guitar\\" is one of my favorites, because of the composers and materials chosen for the book, particularly the Bach and Sanz pieces. As another review stated, this book is good for both instruction and performance, as the pieces in it are certainly worthy for the stage, and the duets are a nice touch, too.Any classical guitarist that goes through this book will definitely have a good knowledge of the great classical repertoire that is available, and to have it all in one book is a nice feature. Noad's books are always well organized, however I frequently do not agree with his provided fingerings, as there are other fingerings that would make more sense, but that is a minor issue. The tunes included make up for that. One of my absolute favorites to play is the beautiful Bach \\"Sarabande,\\" originally written for violin, but reproduced here in accurate fashion. Other tunes to check out in the book are the Bach \\"Double,\\" Sanz's \\"Canarios,\\" and the featured duets for two-guitars.Overall this is a great book and is highly recommended. The only thing I would suggest to the buyer is don't be afraid to figure out and try some alternate fingerings."},{"Title":"The Baroque Guitar","review":"I purchased this at a book sale in downtown Ithaca recently and it is worth its weight in halibut. The descriptions that accompany the pieces are a resource that will make you perform the piece better.

Something in here for everyone, sight reading pieces, concert pieces, guitar duets, vocal/guitar arrangements, you name it I'll play it.

One day, her uncle comes and carries her off to London, promising her a better life. Unknown to Katharine, her uncle has a hidden motive.In London, she attracts several admirers, including two brothers: one a gamester who works at her uncle's gaming house; the other an ex-soldier, nicer than his brother but still something of an adventurer. She also meets Judith, an old friend, now married.As she slowly realizes there is a price for her new life, she also finds it's one she can't bring herself to pay. Unfortunately, her uncle has no intention of letting her off the hook: He has debts, and intends Katharine for the first wealthy man who will pay them.Katharine is a bit exasperating, because she can't seem to grasp that every time she rejects one scheme, her uncle resorts to the next option, which is always worse. She is honest to a fault, and inevitably paints herself into a corner, where the only option is to fall in with the gambler brother's plan to trick an elderly lady.And what of the hero, the ex-soldier? He eventually comes to her rescue, of course, but shows an equally exasperating tendency to keep &quot;testing&quot; her honesty. This seems a bit overbearing, since he has good reason to know she is simply in over her head--and it's partly due to him that Katharine feels she has no option but to run off with his brother.This story has a nice feel for Regency London, though the plot is more dramatic than lighthearted. Katharine's uncle, cold and calculating, makes a believable villain. Her friend, Judith, is a fun character. I wish she'd had more of a role in the story. As for the couple, they are opposites in many ways, but you hope they'll be happy."},{"Title":"Not by Scripture Alone: A Catholic Critique of the Protestant Doctrine of Sola Scriptura","review":"As an ex-Evangelical Protestant who converted to the Catholic Church, I'm happy to see this book come out. I used to believe in the &quot;Bible Only&quot; view, but my eyes were opened by God's grace when I discovered how unbiblical it really is. Bob Sungenis, Patrick Madrid and the other co-authors have compiled a powerful refutation of sola scriptura.

A good refutation of the one-sided sola scriptura doctrine. The normative rule of the church is the living tradition of the gospel of the crucified and risen Lord. But of this living traditon the most important part is indeed the Holy Writ. Not every tradition is a tradition of men. Only anti-biblical (in the sense of being against the gospel)traditon is to reject. So every evangelical has to rediscover the tradition of our forefathers in the faith and the martyrs who died for the living god. This is essential for true ecumenism, overcoming sectarian schism and for facing the future in a more and more anti-christian society."},{"Title":"Not by Scripture Alone: A Catholic Critique of the Protestant Doctrine of Sola Scriptura","review":"I suppose that you'll read at least a few of these reviews and think that either the Catholics or the Prots are a bunch of nuts who can't recognize a logical argument if it hit them in the face. Well, as an Eastern Orthodox who used to be Lutheran (lcms) I can sympathize with both sides, since I used to hold to Sola Scriptura and now hold a different view (although it's not quite the same as the RC stance). What's important is that we all try to seek God's will together, even if that means we get a bit nasty sometimes. Dialogue is the key, honest dialoge, I should say. I love this book, since I think it is clear and presents many arguments against the catholic position without using straw man tactics. Congar's classic &quot;Tradition and Traditions&quot; is also a good one to read in this regard. Don't forget that sometimes we can't see the forest if we don't step back from the tree we're all climbing. take a chance to read a few general Church history books to keep in context.

My suspicions have been confirmed. After reading some of the very uncharitable reviews and ad hominum attacks against Mr. Sungenis, I was compelled to read this book and find out why our Protestant brothers were so worked up about it. Now I know.\\"Not By Scripture Alone\\" has thoroughly refuted one major principle of the Unfortunate Insurrection aka the Protestant Reformation.Sola Scriptura? Maybe the contributors to this book were attacking a straw man as far as some reviewers were concerned. That's only because Protestants can't agree among themselves what they mean by the term. Sungenis, et al. couldn't possibly address all conflicting definitions of Sola Scriptura. Some denominations recognize some tradition but which tradition? Some recognize the \\"teaching Magisterium\\" of the Church. But as Patrick Madrid would constantly ask in his debate with Douglas Jones: \\"Which Church\\"? Questions for which no Protestant that I know of has a cogent answer.Newsflash! The Protestant Reformation did not occur immediately after the death of John the Apostle. \\"To be deep in history is to cease to be a Protestant\\". So says John Henry Cardinal Newman. Let's face it. It was the bishops of the Catholic Church who were responsible for the New Testament table of contents - those same bishops that Protestants love to quote to defend Sola Scriptura. Why don't Protestants ever quote fourth century Bible-Only non-Catholic Christians to support their positions? BECAUSE THERE WEREN'T ANY! So they must ignore the historical reality and rely on out-of-context quotes from the unquestionably orthodox Roman Catholic hierarchy to try to prove Sola Scriptura and its existence in the early Church.One reviewer sarcastically remarks, \\"Because Rome Says So.\\" You've got that right! Since it is the Church that is the \\"ground and pillar of truth\\" (1 Tim 3:15). (Oh, how the Protestants wished it read, \\"the Bible is the ground and pillar of truth\\".) We look to the Church and the successors of the Apostles for the correct interpretation of Scripture. There's no circular reasoning here. The circularity lies in quoting 2 Tim 3:16 before proving the inspiration of 2 Timothy. (A separated brother certainly can't appeal to the say-so of the 4th century Catholic Church). So what's his authority? Scripture can't authenticate itself. Since Martin Luther didn't acknowledge any authority outside of the Bible, he was well within his right to reject books he didn't agree with (e.g. James). A Protestant would be hard-pressed to explain why a book like Philemon should have been included in the Canon without an appeal to Sacred Tradition. Or does he accept all NT books simply \\"Because the Bible Says So\\"?The book makes a very intriguing case against Sola Scriptura and the bankruptcy of its defense. Even RC Sproul - the respected Protestant scholar - admits, almost despairingly, that all Protestants can say is that all they have is a fallible collection of infallible books in their Bible. I think Mr. Sproul is being honest but he didn't go far enough. I would say that since Protestants don't recognize any infallible authority outside the Bible, all they have is a fallible collection of *hopefully* infallible books. Not very comforting.\\"Not By Scripture Alone\\" is an in-depth treatment of all the arguments for and against this most important tenet of the Protestant faith.

(1) As Vatican II asserts, Rome alone can interpret the Bible, thus Romes says Matthew 16 demonstrates that the Roman Catholic Church is the true church, therefore Rome is the true Church. Thus the book essentially argues Rome is the true church &quot;because Rome says so.&quot; This circularity is unavoidable. (2) Romes states that it alone can interpret the Bible and for anyone else to interpret the Bible apart from Rome is a sin. But then they expect Protestants to interpret the Bible and agree that Matthew 16 (or any other text) teaches Rome is the true church. But how can anyone rightly come to such an agreement unless they first presuppose Rome is the true church, who then interprets Matthew 16 (or any other text) for them? They would do best to argue that the Roman Magisterium is a transcedental necessity to establish that Roman Catholicism is a knowably true because it alone establishes the necessary precondtions for intelligability.

Unlike the constant state of flux of \\"Tradition\\", I found the stability and welcome refuge in the Bible because like God, the author, the Holy Bible is the same yesterday, today, and tomorrow.Sola Scriptura (Scripture Alone) is quite simply the doctrine that the Holy Bible, being the Word of God, is the only infallible rule of faith and practice for Christians in the post-apostolic age.

The book's mission resolves to supplant God's Word with that of the Roman Catholic hierarchy's teaching that THEY are that ultimate and infallible authority concerning man's fate.There is good reason for the author's motivation. Beside baptism, there are six more sacraments in Roman Catholicism teaching plus rosaries, alms, Mary's suffering for our sins and none of these find support in sound Biblical exegesis. Therefore, it becomes an overriding issue for Roman Catholicism to sully the authority of Scriptures in order that they may displace The Word with their own authority and teachings.The Gospel According to RomeThis is why Roman Catholicism and the author are so intent on dismissing or minimally confusing God's Word, --- because it does not support the author's theology.Talking with Catholic Friends and Family: UnderstandingHow They Think and Feel, Why They Trust in Tradition, What the Bible TeachesMoreover, Mary's intercession with Christ, the merits of the saints, one's own suffering for one's sins in purgatory, etc. these too, have no Biblical support.

Most folks really don't care less about their tired arguments - they worship in the tradition they were born into. Some are comfortable with Roman Catholicism because they appreciate the ritual and tradition, finding Protestant services too boring and void of emotion. Conversely, some are uncomfortable with Roman Catholicism because they find the ritual forms alien and inexplicable, and distracting from a focus on scripture.The disagreements over Mary and the Pope are many and too well known to recite here. But it seems to me that far more unites Catholics and other Christians than divides them. Obviously, people from both traditions can love their neighbor as they love themselves...

Mr. Sungenis is fair to an extreme and I come away from his work with the belief that he truly wants to discover the authentic meaning of the issues and texts he has exhaustively examined. I would highly recommend his book on several levels: intellectual honesty, insightful and original thinking, willingness to listen, insistence on loving his neighbor, even when his neighbor disagrees to the point of having a disparately different theology and, more importantly, a different way of living.

Each writer was given seemingly as much space as he wanted, so that some essays are about 30 pages while others over 100 pages. This allows the writers to be able to develop their case in detail.One of Sungenis's essays deals with the so-called \\"biblical evidence\\" for sola scriptura. This chapter is extremely detailed in going over the contexts of all possible passages along with the Greek to make an airtight case that the popular passages that are often appealed to in defense of sola scriptura do not warrant such an interpretation. It is a very strong chapter, which, alone does indeed refute sola scriptura since it is shown to be a non-biblical doctrine. In particular, the absurdity of using 1 Cor 4:6 as biblical proof of sola scriptura is made painfully and even humorously obvious in this chapter.Sungenis also wrote an essay over 100 pages called \\"Point-Counter Point\\" in which he considers quotes of actual objections to the Catholic doctrine or defenses of sola scriptura from Protestant authors like Geisler, White, and others. There are over 70 of these quotes, and Sungenis gives a full, well-thought answer to each one. This is especially helpful because he is answering very directly the actual arguments put forth by the main Protestant apologists, using their very own words, arguments, and definitions.The chapter on the belief in scripture and tradition of the early Church Fathers is simply overwhelming. It begins with a list of common \\"proof texts\\" that are often used by Protestant apologists to \\"show\\" that the early Church taught sola scriptura. It is quickly pointed out, however, that these same Church Fathers who supposedly taught scripture alone also have many other quotes where they talk about the Church and tradition in the same kinds of terms. What is conceded is that many Church Fathers taught the MATERIAL sufficiency of scripture as opposed to FORMAL sufficiency of scripture, which is not the same thing. The chapter then goes on for nearly 100 pages, offering lengthy quotes of many Church fathers showing that they had BOTH a very high view of scripture and a high view of the Church and tradition. In short, that the early Church Fathers did not teach sola scriptura.The last appendix in the book was a short debate between Patrick Madrid and a Protestant gentleman. It is a friendly debate, and a good way to see how actually Protestants defend their doctrine, as opposed to reading Catholics try and explain the best Protestant arguments before tearing them down. Here we see again the many problems with Sola scriptura, as Robert Sungenis provides commentary through out the debate, pointing out the places where the Protestant apologist dodges questions and gives unsatisfactory answers. Lest one thinks that the Protestant apologist is incompetent, he makes the distinction between sola scriptura and solo scriptura. In this sense, those who claim that this book only addresses the \\"false\\" notion of scripture alone (solo scriptura) and not the REAL Reformers doctrine of sola scriptura are incorrect. Even if you are farmiliar with the book \\"The Shape of Sola Scriptura\\", which quotes this book numerous times and attempts to rebut it, it still seems to me that \\"Not by Scripture Alone\\" does a fine job of making a much more convincing and rational case for the Catholic position."},{"Title":"Not by Scripture Alone: A Catholic Critique of the Protestant Doctrine of Sola Scriptura","review":"A superb book! Second best (behind Not By Faith Alone) in the 'Not By ___' trilogy.The book gets a bit bulky in the last chapter, but that's also how the author likes to do things. His work is known for being thorough, fair, and solid. On top of that, it's thoroughly Scriptural!This book shows you how key Protestant proof texts for Sola Scriptura - especially 2 Timothy 3:16f - simply don't teach what they are alleged to teach. The doctrine of Sola Scriptura (which teaches scripture is the only inspired authority and thus all doctrine binding on the Christian must be found in the Scriptures alone) is quite simply never taught in the Scriptures! There is really nothing complicated about it. You would imagine that a doctrine so critical to the Reformation was expressly stated in the Scriptures, even one verse saying something in the form of \\"all doctrines binding on the Christian are to come from the Bible,\\" but such a command is nowhere found. Sure you could make a philosophical argument along the lines of \\"the bible is all we have today,\\" but that doesn't excuse the fact the doctrine of Sola Scriptura ITSELF is not mentioned anywhere in Scripture.So why the need for this 600 page* book? The reason is because there are tons of ways Protestants argue for the doctrine of Sola Scriptura...and this book handles em all quite nicely. You'd be amazed at all the angles Protestants try, but not only do they fail the test of history, logic, and church fathers, they fail the Scriptural test as well.Look at three of my favorite lessons in the book:(1) From 2 Tim 3:16f, \\"All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness, so that the man of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work.\\"The term \\"thoroughly equipped\\" applies to the \\"man of God\\" (a term meaning one in authority, not a layman); it does NOT apply to the \\"Scriptures.\\" The term that IS applied to Scripture is that it is \\"useful,\\" which in English and Greek is NOT at all the same as \\"sufficient,\\" in fact it is a far weaker term than \\"sufficient.\\" So the passage is really saying the Man of God is thoroughly equipped to act by means of teaching, rebuking, correcting, and training...AND Scripture is \\"useful\\" (\\"profitable\\") towards learning how to teach, rebuke, etc. That's a far cry from saying Scripture is the only means to learn those qualities and it is an even further cry from saying \\"all Christian doctrine must be found in Scripture.\\"(2)One of my favorite quotes comes from Page 128, quoting Protestant apologist James White. Rather than directly quote the book, here is the full quote from James White's own webpage:\\"You will never find anyone saying, \\"During times of enscripturation--that is, when new revelation was being given--sola scriptura was operational.\\" Protestants do not assert that sola scriptura is a valid concept during times of revelation. How could it be, since the rule of faith to which it points was at that very time coming into being? One must have an existing rule of faith to say it is \\"sufficient.\\"\\"http://vintage.aomin.org/This%20Bereans%20passage.htmlNot By Scripture Alone brilliantly points out that here White has just undermined any attempt to use any Scriptural text, including 2 Tim 3:16f as a Sola Scriptura proof text. Why? Because if Sola Scriptura was not \\"operational\\" during times of revelation (ie while the Apostles were alive), then Paul could not have been teaching Timothy Sola Scriptura because it was not operational when 2 Tim 3:16 was written by Paul and read and applied to Timothy.(3) Protestants like to point to the \\"Noble Bereans\\" of Acts 17:11 because they \\"searched the Scriptures to see if what Paul said was true.\\" This gives the impression that the Bereans 'verified' every doctrine that they came across, but that is NOT actually what Acts 17 is saying at all. Look at the context:\\"2As his custom was, Paul went into the synagogue, and on three Sabbath days he reasoned with them from the Scriptures, 3 explaining and proving that the Christ had to suffer and rise from the dead. \\"This Jesus I am proclaiming to you is the Christ,\\" he said.\\"The OT was all these people had at the time, without a guide like Paul they could have never put all the prophecies together regarding what would happen with the Messiah. The Jews never dreamed the Messiah would have to suffer, die and be resurrected, because this is not something that is easy to see in the OT if you don't know what your looking for. This shows us that without a guide they could not have arrived at the full truth with the \\"Scriptures alone.\\" More importantly is verse 17:4 where Paul says the Messiah's name is \\"Jesus,\\" something the OT never tells us and this required faith in Paul as preacher to accept. The Bereans were \\"noble\\" because unlike the rowdy crowd Paul talked to in the previous verses, the Bereans gave Paul a fair hearing. This \\"nobility\\" had nothing to do with the Bereans turning to Scripture while others refused to. Thus, Acts 17:11 is not advocating Sola Scriptura at all.I have yet to see a Protestant apologist take on any book of the \\"Not By\\" trilogy, and I'm not that surprised after reading the books myself.*Don't be afraid at the size of this book, 600 pages might be a lot, but it reads very easily and doesn't take as long as you might think. The time you invest will be well worth it.As for the price, it's refreshingly reasonable: about $20."},{"Title":"Not by Scripture Alone: A Catholic Critique of the Protestant Doctrine of Sola Scriptura","review":"This book is complete, thourough and easy to read.

After reading some of the recent reviews on Amazon.com, I had to look at it again to make sure they were reviewing the same book. I'm not even sure \\"a reader\\" from Rosemont has actually read the book. He appears to believe Mr. Sungenis wrote the entire book when he actually contributed only two chapters to it. He gets top billing because he conceived the work and then edited it. \\"A reader\\" then takes exception to the different possible definitions of what the word Tradition means. The book goes into great detail on this topic in, among other places, Chapter 4 (written by Mark Shea) and Chapter 8 (by Joe Gallegos).The Greek scholarship in the book varies with the authors of the different chapters.

It makes obvious how forced, unreasonable, unworkable, unhistorical, and ironically, how unbiblical, this reformation-invented idea is.Since the books of the Bible were canonized by the Catholic Church, you'll even hear the most prominent Protestant apologists claim that the Bible is &quot;A fallable collection of infallable books.&quot; It is by this disturbing notion that Martin Luther decided to remove James &amp; Revelation (among others) from the New Testament until some of his followers decided that maybe they shouldn't.I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Not by Scripture Alone: A Catholic Critique of the Protestant Doctrine of Sola Scriptura","review":"Well here's one Protestant at least who's not going to bombard this book with criticisms and complaints--seeing as how these reviews are meant to discuss the book, not the plethora of beliefs held by whichever reviewer. I'm not really sure what some of these Protestant reviewers were expecting when they picked up the book.That being said, I'm in no danger of converting, and yet I definitely think this book warrants 4 stars. Prompted by discussions with my Catholic roommate I was referred to this book. It didn't dispell all the historical and theological \\"myths\\" that Protestants propagate (most of which I would say aren't myths), but it did lay out a very solid argument from historical, theological, and biblical grounds. Any Protestant looking for a solid Catholic critique on those three grounds of the Protestant position should definitely pick this one up and be challenged by fairly solid scholarship. I especially appreciated hearing a thoughtful critique of 2 Timothy 3:16 and other scriptural passages used to defend Sola Scriptura (Chapter 3).Bottom line, I don't think Sungenis and his companions are right, but I think he makes a good argument that Protestants need to hear and address.

By saying this, the Protestant assumes that everything concerning faith and morals is WRITTEN explicity in the pages of Scripture. But is this assumption itself a biblical teaching?. To the surprise of most people the answer is no! The Bible nowhere states or implies that the Bible alone is the only rule of faith for the believer. Do you think differently? Then you must read this book. &quot;Not by Scripture Alone&quot; is a thorough review of how Scripture should be used in the life of a believer. Those who hold to the idea of Sola Scriptura, have rejected the biblical teaching of an authoritative Church (Matt 18:17) and Apostolic Tradition (2 Thes 2:15). This book handles all the issues one by one and demonstrates that a true Bible-believing Christian can not believe in the Bible Alone theory. I congratulate the authors of this fine book. I know that this book will help people come home to the fullness of the Christian faith that can only be found in the Catholic Church.

I heard many arguments on both sides of the debate before I read this, and every one of them and more is examined in detail in this book. Bible verses are thouroughly examined in their context, and varying translations are even discussed rather than quoting from the English translation that best supports the apologist's point of view, as many others have done. Frequent quotations from Protestant authors throughout the book and the inclusion of the transcript of a formal debate between Patrick Madrid and Douglass Jones in the appendix allows the reader to hear arguments on both sides of the story. The size of the book may be a turn off to some, and there is some redundancy from the multiple authors, but the book is still very much worth while. For someone who is new to studying Catholic/Protestant dividing issues, I would recommend first reading a conversion story such as Scott Hahn's or David Currie's, to get your feet wet before plunging into the deep end with this book."},{"Title":"Not by Scripture Alone: A Catholic Critique of the Protestant Doctrine of Sola Scriptura","review":"Recent scholarship on the subject is brought in and analyzed. Among these works is most notably the books Sola Scriptura! edited by Don Kistler and Roman Catholics and Evangelicals: Agreements and Differences by Norman Geisler and Ralph MacKenzie. However, several other sources of Protestant apologetics are utilized as well. The best Protestant arguments from these works are shown to be based on flawed pre-suppositions and circular logic. This work is not perfect either as Patrick Madrid's work in chapter one is weak in spots. (Hopefully Bob Sungenis will edit out the 'canon fodder' argument of Madrid in subsequent releases.) But the rest of the chapters amply compensate for this. That is really the only complaint I have with the work as Madrid's work in the two written debates is more in tune with the rest of the book. As this work shows in detail, the arguments of Protestant apologists prove to be either:a) Developmentally challenged. (The good arguments are always stopped short of a logical conclusion that is fatal to the Protestant position.)b) Logically self-refuting orc) The foundation of the Protestant position is shown to be purely arbitrary.While there is a bit of overlap; nevertheless each author covers a different angle to this topic which makes for very interesting reading. The tone of the book is charitable also, which is important with any work dealing with a topic this finely nuanced. This book is detailed, complete, and almost too much in a way (it leaves no stone unturned) but this is important considering the division that has resulted over the centuries because of the subject of sola scriptura. As far as I am concerned Catholics and other Apostolic Christians cannot go far enough in exposing this doctrine for what it is. Sola Scriptura is an unbiblical (Scripture doesn't teach it), unhistorical (no one in the first 1500 years of Christian history held this doctrine who was orthodox), illogical (the doctrine is internally contradictory and arbitrary), and unworkable (the ecclesial problems have created thousands of warring sects within Protestantism) man-made tradition. It should thus be rejected by anyone who claims to be a &quot;Bible-believing Christian.&quot;If you are Protestant I would ask you to please approach this subject prayerfully and with an open mind. If you do this and apply the simple rules of logic and reason consistently, the evidence speaks for itself. You will find inexorably that Sola Scriptura implodes!"},{"Title":"Not by Scripture Alone: A Catholic Critique of the Protestant Doctrine of Sola Scriptura","review":"This compendium of critiques of sola scriptura is not for the faint of heart. At close to 600 pages, including appendices, it delves into minutiae in a way that only a debate society member could love.At issue: If Scripture is the only infallible authority for resolving matters of faith and morals, and is formally sufficient for teaching, where does Scripture teach this doctrine?We are treated to arguments by no less than seven different (obviously intelligent and well-informed) authors, expounding the Catholic position that Scripture does not teach this. The Church affirms that Scripture is materially, but not formally sufficient, and therefore requires an infallible interpreter (the Magisterium) to avoid the chaos of denominationalism that results from individual interpretation (as evidenced by the splintering of Christianity since the Reformation).Robert Sungenis spends close to 60 pages on 4 verses (2Tim 3:16, Acts 17:11, 1Cor 4:6, and Mk 7:5-13) in the chapter entitled &quot;Does Scripture teach Sola Scriptura?&quot; That's a lot of exegesis!Then there's Point/Counterpoint: Protestant Objections and Catholic Answers, where 75 objections (mostly by James White, and Geisler and MacKenzie)are addressed in excruciating detail in close to 90 pages (with detailed explanatory footnotes).Patrick Madrid addresses the issue from a logical perspective, Philip Blosser from the philosopical and practical, and Joseph Gallegos from the Tradition and Church Fathers viewpoint.A particularly interesting contribution by Robert Fastiggi discusses the history and view of sola scriptura held by the leaders of the Reformation. This encompasses the Lutheran, Calvinist, Anglican, and the so-called &quot;Radical&quot; or Anabaptist perspectives.This book (or collection of books)makes essentially the same argument from many perspectives using essentially the same evidence; and that is what makes it somewhat tedious. There is no doubt that it is well researched -- the information is certainly complete and it is an indispensible reference if you are inclined to head-butting. The results, I fear, would be the same as those documented in Appendix 3 -- a formal debate between Catholic Patrick Madrid and Protestant Douglas Jones.Madrid asks where Scripture teaches sola scriptura, and Jones asks why an infallible Church. Each claims to have answered the other, and the debate continues."},{"Title":"Not by Scripture Alone: A Catholic Critique of the Protestant Doctrine of Sola Scriptura","review":"I am currently a non-denominational Christian. Who through the guidance of God the Holy Spirit is searching for the True Church. Mr. Sungenis and his fellow authors in this book have indeed taken me a step closer to this truth. First of all I would like to respond to the Protestant who wrote that this book was completely ridculous. I will by no means judge someone or their character. But I would like to say that this book is one of the BEST ever written on the matter of is Scripture Alone the final authority on Faith and Morals. I say it is the best ever that I have read. And I have read numerous Protestant commentaries upholding the doctrine of Sola Scriptura. Through this book and my study of Tradition and the early Church Fathers I have come to see that Sola Scriptura is a novel idea. If you are a Protestant and express disbelief then please do not judge your Catholic brothers in Christ but read this book for yourself. I would also like to respond to the man that equated Catholocism with a cult like the Mormons and Jehova's Witness. If you have any knowledge of Church History you can easily see that this claim is completely ABSURD. As the authors of Not By Scripture Alone are so kind to point out. That the Catholic Church is the church that has the longest historical background. As well as firm roots in the Bible. Matt 16 shows this, as does 1 Thess 2:15. It is a Protestant church that can easily be equated as a cult. I say this with complete love for my Protestant brethren to see. Just look! their our currently 28,000 Protestant denominations now. 28,000 Protestant denominations! Which one is the true denomination? Let my Protestant bretheren provide answers to that. IF by some chance Sola Scriptura is the truth. Then answer me? Which of the 28,000 denominations has the correct interpretation. Is it the Calvinist denominations that hold to absolute predestination. Is it the Luthrean denominations that hold to Baptismal Regeneration and the Real Presence of Jesus Christ in the Eucharist? Or is it the Free Will Methodist denomination. The Free Will denom and Calvinist hold mutually exclusive views. IF Sola Scriptura is true then why are their 28,000 denominations. Why cannot everyone agree? Please my Protestant brother that equated Catholocism with a cult, recant this charge. Or provide true biblical, or traditional evidence that can back up this claim. If you cannot or any other Protestant cannot. I reassert my claim that Sola Scriptura is just a myth.

This book is a great &quot;next step&quot; for those who have only read primers on the issues, such as Keating's Catholicism and Fundamentalism. What you will find here is about 600 pages of intense interaction with the Biblical and historical data pertaining to the proper role of Scripture in the life of the Christian believer.The best part, to me, was the section dealing with the famous verses in Scripture that protestants often use to show that the Bible teaches this doctrine. The arguments are more than adequately refuted, and in some cases, the reader is shown how these verses (especially the case of the Noble Bereans) actually support the Catholic doctrine! Did not the &quot;less noble Thesselonians&quot; also look to Scripture alone? Did they, based on their private interpretation, reject the *oral* teaching of Paul? Yet it was the Bereans, who although very wise to make sure Paul's oral Tradition harmonized with Scripture, ultimately accepted a Truth that was not explicitly there: that Jesus Christ of Nazereth is the Messiah.To all those who say that the authors rely on straw-men arguments in the point-counterpoint section, I say this: try reading the book! The points given in the Point-Counterpoint section, far from being straw men, are VERBATIM quotes from Protestant apologists! If these protestant apologists do not fairly represent sola scriptura to you, the point of this book is all the more enforced: sola scriptura = doctrinal anarchy. In the very beginning of the book, the authors acknowledge that there are many definitions of Sola Scriptura. It would have been impossible to cover them all in detail. Rather, they provide arguments that refute all possible definitions of sola scriptura by implication and logical deduction.A very highly recommended read for those who are serious about learning the true Catholic position.

Unfortunately, they contend against a doctrine which does not exist.Sungenis wastes 629 pages, and does irreparable harm to God-only-knows-how-many forests, arguing against a doctrine of &quot;Sola Scriptura&quot; IN ALL CIRCUMSTANCES. He argues against those who have rejected tradition and the teaching magisterium of the Church to cling solely to uninterpretted Scripture, as the ONLY authority for life and faith. However, except on the lunatic fringes of religion, such radicals do not exist.Even among the least &quot;(Roman) Catholic&quot; of Protestants, worship is still recognizable as Christian precisely because some core of tradition has been preserved.Sunday School, Vacation Bible School, Bible Studies, sermons, etc... are universally present among so-called Protestants precisely because the teaching magisterium of the Church has not been rejected. Its focus may have shifted from the Vatican to the local community of believers, but the teaching magisterium itself continues to be affirmed.In other words, Sungenis structures his arguments against a position that does not exist. His is a theological debate by caricature.Even among the earliest of the Reformers, other authorities were recognized along side of Holy Scripture. In 1580, the writers of the &quot;Epitome&quot; to &quot;The Formula of Concord&quot; stated, &quot;Other symbols and other writings are not judges LIKE Holy Scripture...&quot; The point being that even at that early stage of the Reformation, tradition and teaching were valued, but Scripture was more highly valued as the ultimate arbiter in all matters of faith and life.Tradition and teaching are not rejected by Protestants as Sungenis claims. They are merely subordinated to the authority of Holy Scripture. That's a subtle distinction: apparently too subtle for Sungenis to delineate."},{"Title":"Not by Scripture Alone: A Catholic Critique of the Protestant Doctrine of Sola Scriptura","review":"The authors of this book have shown themselves to be somewhat unfamiliar with the definition of Sola Scripture (SS) and as such, have really distorted the belief. While the Catholic Choir and those unfamiliar with the real arguments were impressed by this book, note some faulty arguments touted by the authors:One series of arguments for why SS was impossible is because in the first century there were no printing presses, most people couldn't read, they had no leisure time to read, they could not provide Bibles to the poor, and they would need reference material for grammatical variances. Such shallow argumentation shows a lack of insight and forethought. Today there are probably hundreds of thousands of Catholics who can't read or own a Bible, etc., yet we doubt the CC would argue that their beliefs are not found in the Bible or on traditions they have not read. That is, if the Catholic priest teaches them Jesus died and rose again, that belief is based on the Bible even if no one in the church owns a Bible. Was is so hard for the authors of this book to realize that if the elders (priests if you will), who were appointed by the Church, taught from the scriptures, it wouldn't be necessary for others in the congregation to actually own/read the Bible for themselves before they could say their beliefs are based on SS? According to the logic suggested by these authors, no Catholic can even begin to claim his beliefs are based on the Bible until he has read the Bible through and through and learned Greek and Hebrew!Of course, what book against SS would be complete without arguing that the CC came before the scriptures and determined the scriptures? There are, of course, several issue with this point. First, the CC must realize that most Protestants don't believe the CC is or ever was the Church that Jesus set up. Most view it as an apostate offshoot that deviated from the truth, particularly when it got involved politically with the Roman Empire. Secondly, what scriptures are they talking about? Nearly 75% of the Bible was determined/canonized by the Jews before Jesus came to the earth. Thus, the CC can really only claim to have organized the writings after Jesus. Of course, they claim to have determined the whole Bible but we're not too impressed with their supposed work. It's obvious to most that the apocrypha are not inspired despite what the CC claims.In addition, the CC blew a few calls of their first inspired canon between the 4th century and the Council of Trent where they removed a couple of the original books they originally said were inspired. Maybe in time the CC will recognize the rest of the apocrypha as also not being inspired. When and if this ever does happen, should we thank her for clarifying matters for us, as if it were not already clear?Christians in the first century passed letters around and then by word of mouth the teachings spread since it was difficult to make copies. However, it's hardly defensible to claim that what they taught by mouth was different from what they wrote by hand! In addition, Paul, and Jesus quoted the scriptures dozens and dozens of times to strongly defend their teachings. Where do they quote tradition to defend their arguments? I agree that the Church can designate traditions, such as greeting each other with a kiss, etc that relate to some organizational measures. But where are fundamental beliefs necessary for salvation based on traditions?Of course,we have the few verses where Paul mentions traditions people heard and the authors feel this justifies their position. I suppose it never occurred to them that maybe a tradition Paul mentions that Timothy heard was a teaching written to those in Galatia a decade earlier. (as a for instance, not an exact claim) Since there were no printing presses much of the info in earlier writings had to be passed orally. Maybe the traditions they heard were in regards to Jesus and the apostle John DID write them down near the end of the century. This is, of course, all speculation but it's to highlight that the few verses that mention tradition in no way give leeway to teaching doctrine involving salvation that are not found in God's Word. Jesus and Paul heavily relied on scripture to defend their position.Another argument against SS is that not every doctrine was laid down by the time the apostles died. This is probably true. But as time went on, new understandings came from the written word. Note how Daniel was told that the words would be sealed up until the time of end (not the actual words but the meaning of them) and then knowledge would become abundant. (Daniel 12) As the words of Daniel became unsealed and the true understanding of his prophecy came to light, doctrines evolved. But...these doctrines were still based off the written word. 1st century Jews didn't understand the meanings to the hundreds of OT prophecies but as time went by it came to light and the meaning became clear. Still, these \\"new\\" teachings about the Messiah were based off the scriptures, not oral traditionsThe authors then argue that the Church has the responsibility to interpret the scriptures. We agree wholeheartedly. The issue, though, is that we don't believe the CC is the Church. Most believe it is simply another apostate religion that is as large as it is today because it killed (literally!) those who argued with it.The end result of this book is that it misstated SS and put up some pretty lousy arguments. Of course, these arguments sound good to a Catholic because, for many, they have not actually tallied how many times Jesus and the apostles went to the WRITTEN word to teach. I recommend starting there, then coming back and addressing this issue again."},{"Title":"Not by Scripture Alone: A Catholic Critique of the Protestant Doctrine of Sola Scriptura","review":"Alot could be said about this book, and unfortunately I can only provide a brief summery here. I thought Sungenis' work, &quot;Not By Faith Alone&quot; was really bad, but whow, did he and his associates out due themslves with this new work. While Bob Sungenis is not the only contributer to this book, as the editor he is chiefly responsible for this compliation of rather poor scholarship. Robert Sungenis simply searches through the writings of the early church fathers and looks for the word &quot;tradition&quot; and when he finds it he jumps for joy and says, &quot;See they did not support Sola Scriptura!&quot; Well Bob, I am sorry to inform you of this but you forgot one little thing. What you did all throughout this book was to ASSUME that what the church fathers meant by the word &quot;tradition&quot; means Roman Catholic tradition. Mr. Sungenis and his associates fail to understand the context from which he takes his citations, thus this work entails mostly citations which are out of context. This book provides a reader with a classic example of eisegesis and not exegesis. For example, I am an Evangelical Protestant and I use the word &quot;tradition&quot; often in my own works, and given that I am a staunch opponent of numerous Roman Catholic dogmas, it is likely that what I mean by the word &quot;tradition&quot; and what Rome means by the word &quot;tradition&quot; are probably not going to be the same. But with the new Catholic apologetical methodology, they would simply automatically assume that by the word &quot;tradition&quot; I meant Roman Catholic traditions, because that how Sungensis and the other writers understand the meaning of the word &quot;tradition&quot;. So they instill their definaition of the word &quot;tradition&quot; onto the early fathers. They never use sound exegesis in order to read through thses particular church fathers in order to understand what they meant by the word &quot;tradition&quot;. However, I would encourage anyone who is interested in this topic to go and buy a copy of this book, and look through his citations of the church fathers, and then get a copy of the works by William Webster, specifically, &quot;Holy Scripture: The Ground and Pillar of Our Faith, Vol. 1-3&quot;. These works by Webster utterly annihilate's Sungenis' thesis, and when you read these works side by side you will very quickly discover that Sungenis and his associates has for some reason failed to cite from numerous church fathers that specifically support the notion of Sola Scriptura, now why did they do that? Well you can come to your own conclusion..."},{"Title":"Not by Scripture Alone: A Catholic Critique of the Protestant Doctrine of Sola Scriptura","review":"Dear Friends, Just show us that the Pope is perfect..... If that can be done there is no reason for anymore lengthy books!"},{"Title":"Not by Scripture Alone: A Catholic Critique of the Protestant Doctrine of Sola Scriptura","review":"My heart goes out to Roman Catholic apologists trying to find answers to the questions of educated Protestants. I am familiar with the anxiety associated with discovering that your belief system is wrong. This book may bolster the faith of the lay Catholic that has not been seriously challenged. But to the wise Catholic that has been challenged by an educated Protestant, this book will only create more doubt about belief in the infallible Roman Catholic Magesterium. The argumentation is bad. Sola Scriptura is misunderstood. Why would these leading Roman Catholic apologists resort to this? The answer to me is clear. They simply don't have answers.The most interesting sections in this book are those by Blosser and the point/counterpoint from Sungenis. Blosser discusses the philosophical problems with Sola Scriptura. This section is packed with errors and misconceptions. One of the most common is that Sola Scriptura is self-defeating because it says you should believe only Scripture, but Scripture never says that. This is a frequent misrepresentation of Sola Scriptura. Sola Scriptura teaches that it is the only INFALLIBLE source of information regarding faith and morals. This doesn't mean it is the ONLY source of information regarding faith and morals. Further, the Bible does teach Sola Scriptura, so this isn't even an issue. One of the funniest things contained in this section was Blosser's reply to James White. The often-repeated argument against Protestantism in this book is that Protestant logic results in a fallible collection of infallible books. James White points out that Roman logic results in a fallible belief in an infallible magesterium, since you must use your fallible human mind to identify the infallible interpreter of the Bible. There are many that claim that right. So the same charge can be levied against Roman Catholics. If the Roman magesterium is known fallibly, it follows that anything they tell you that is based on nothing but their authority (the Canon) is also known fallibly. Blosser argues long and hard that White is wrong. Following his argument in a footnote he admits that essentially James White is right &quot;philosophically.&quot; Roman Catholics can not have infallible knowledge of an infallible magesterium. Apparently, in terms of rational thought processes and argumentation (philosophy), James White is right, but in terms of Blosser's feelings, he is right. I'll stick with the former.Sungenis repeatedly misses the point in his point/counterpoint section. For example, at Objection 59 Geisler and MacKenzie are quoted to the effect that we can't infallibly know the infallible magesterium. Rather than respond to the argument, Sungenis charges that the argument is &quot;mutually self-destructive.&quot; If it is valid, it proves both Protestantism and Catholicism false. Therefore it must be invalid. I don't understand how it proves Protestantism false, but even if it did, that doesn't make it invalid. This type of non-response is presented throughout Sungenis' section. How anyone could think this book contains a meaningful response to Geisler and MacKenzie is beyond me.The most compelling argument against Sola Scriptura is not presented, that being the existence of another infallible authority. Any Mormon can use this Roman logic to conclude that their prophetic authority is infallible. The Bible doesn't logically exclude the possibility of another infallible authority, therefore the Mormon prophetic authority is infallible. The Bible says the gates of hell will not prevail. This would be a problem, except the infallible prophetic authority tells me that that means it won't prevail for all time, but will need to be restored in the latter days. This means that the Roman authority couldn't possibly be the true authority.Roman Catholics really need to demonstrate that the pope is infallible to show that Sola Scriptura is false. George Salmon has already demonstrated that this position is untenable in his 1888 work The Infallibility of the Church, which still awaits a meaningful response from Rome."},{"Title":"Not by Scripture Alone: A Catholic Critique of the Protestant Doctrine of Sola Scriptura","review":"robert sungenis is up to his old tricks again...he attacks solo scriptura but not sola scriptura and is easily refuted by keith mathison's book &quot;the shape of sola scriptura&quot;....solo scriptura is the easiest pin to knock down, but the reformers never held to it, and it was the norm of the church for the first three centuries....this book, could be read, i guess as a primer for keith's book so you can see the legnths of a man who converted to roman catholicism with an obvious axe to grind is willing to go. when the Verbum Dei is replaced by man-made traditions...then our Lord asks us to condemn it...if you are a catholic who is convinced that the partim-partim view of rome is the path to surety, read keith's book and judge for yourself...as me for me, i stand on the rock of the apostolic sacred and infallible tradition..."},{"Title":"Not by Scripture Alone: A Catholic Critique of the Protestant Doctrine of Sola Scriptura","review":"As our friend from Ottawa wrote on June 6, 2003 regarding the Immaculate Conception, he proved why Protestants must read Catholic apologetics and why Catholics must read Protestant apologetics. Agologetics are nothing more than \\"combative\\" theology (some prefer to call it \\"faith defense,\\" but that expression is weak-minded). Good apologetic writing generates understanding of the other faith, an understanding that our friend from Ottawa does not yet possess. From his comments, I doubt he read this or any other Catholic apologetic book. If he did, he would know what we Protestants should all know: What the real Catholic doctrines are. The doctrine of the Immaculate Conception is not the belief that Mary was conceived in the womb of her mother (Anne) by devine intervention like Christ was. The Catholic belief is that Mary was conceived in the normal way by her biological mother and father. IC doctrine says that at the moment of her natural (as opposed to Jesus's \\"supernatural\\") conception, God interceded as He never did in human history, and immediately primed Mary to be the mother of His Son by cleansing her soul (which Catholics believe exists at the instant of conception) of sin, particularly original sin. Thus, she was blessed and purified unlike any human before her or since (save for Jesus Himself), and fit to be the \\"Mother of God.\\"Now, this belief may be unbiblical -- not found in the Bible (or if you are a strident anti-Catholic it may seem anti-biblical -- contradicted in the Bible, but that is not really true), but at least you should know what the doctrine means before mis-asserting an impression that implies that Catholics belief that Mary is, like Christ, of a devine nature, or the \\"daughter\\" of God.Good apologetics serve two purposes: it strengthens the faith you have now, or it convinces you that, for reasons unique to you, you should change religions. Either way, it should be accepted as good education that either confirms your faith, or changes it.To this end, judge apologetic works, from both sides, for their effectiveness, not just from the side of the fence that you are on now. I have read great Catholic apologetics, and lousy Protestant apologetics, and I have read lousy Catholic apologetics and wonderful Protestant apologetics. A good Protestant can appreciate good Catholic apologetics, and vise versa."},{"Title":"Not by Scripture Alone: A Catholic Critique of the Protestant Doctrine of Sola Scriptura","review":"In his characteristic style, Robert Sungenis leaves no stone unturned in his salvo against Sola Scriptura. The biblical verses (slim at best) that are marshalled to support the Protestant view of Sola Scriptura are examined under a microscope and shown that they cannot support sola scriptura. Arguments from Protestant authors (John MacArthur, James White, RC Sproul, John Armstrong, Norman Geisler etc.) are systematically debunked. I read this volume with doubts about the truth of Sola Scriptura, but I wasn't for fully rejecting it. Now I cannot accept Sola Scriptura as a valid rule of faith.The only real criticism that I have of this book is ironically the same criticism of one of the books this volume rebutts. Like \\"Sola Scriptura! The Protestant Position on the Bible\\" the essay format of the book tends to overlap ideas, making the book overly redundant. Although it is not as guilty of this as \\"Sola Scirptura!\\" (and to a greater extent, \\"Justification by Faith ALONE\\"), it still is a weak point, in an otherwise outstanding work.As a post-script, many critics of this book have claimed that the authors didn't understand sola scriptura. While this is the standard condescending response to any critique of Reformed theology, it must be pointed out that this conclusion is completely unwarranted. First, many of the authors themselves were of the Reformed persuasion and then converted to Catholicism (Sungenis himself went to Westminster Theological Seminary, a stronghold of Reformed theology). Second, before offering a critique on any aspect of Sola Scriptura, they quote what leading Protestant sources (i.e. RC Sproul, James White and The Westminster Confession of Faith) have said on that aspect before delivering their critique."},{"Title":"Not by Scripture Alone: A Catholic Critique of the Protestant Doctrine of Sola Scriptura","review":"This book is an EXCELLENT work that refutes the doctrine of sola scriptura. Numerous reviews stated that the \\"definition\\" of sola scriptura used wasn't the one any \\"intelligent\\" Protestants use..... One has to wonder if they even read the book! Numerous pages quote famous Protestants at length (MacArthur, Geisler, James White, etc) Defining sola scriptura the way they understand and defend it! The author does not attack a \\"straw man\\" but critiques the very definition given by leading Protestant scholars. I highly doubt the negative reviewers even read the book.I'm hearing a lot of fuss about the \\"canon\\" challenges. The allegation is that if a Catholic can't have infallible knowledge of the infallible Church (by means of each individual making a fallible decision to follow such a Church) then it isn't fair to ask a Protestant how they know what books should be in the bible since the bible doesn't tell them so. What a ridiculous rebuttal. Sungenis rightly shrugs off such nonsense in the point counterpoint chapter. Let's look at the difference between the Catholic challenge and the Protestants.Catholic challenge- is a legitimate challenge to Protestants pointing out that if sola scriptura is followed to its logical conclusion the Christian is left with an unsure or \\"fallible\\" canon of supposedly infallible books. This is obviously problematic and leaves the Christian on a terribly slippery rock, constantly having to question each book on the bible as only fallible men slapped it together. This challenge is valid because it is critiquing the actual RULE OF FAITH for the protestant.The protestant challenge- that each individual makes a fallible decision to follow the supposedly infallible Church in Rome is NOT legitimate because that question can be applied to ANYTHING! We're not really 100% CERTAIN that we aren't all plugged into the matrix right now...... How is that relevant?!? This question in no way challenges the Catholics rule of faith or explanatory scope but simply throws dust in the air in a silly temper-tantrum type fashion. The fact remains that the Catholic has an adequate explanation where as the Protestants has simply a blind leap of faith. Without all three legs of authority to aid each other any one can not stand in a meaningful fashion.This book is a death blow to current \\"protestant\\" apologetics and we will all have to await some sort of rebuttal"},{"Title":"Not by Scripture Alone: A Catholic Critique of the Protestant Doctrine of Sola Scriptura","review":"Robert A Sungenis has a foreward by Peter Kreeft, the essential Logician, Philosopher, and Debater, so you know that the content of this book is going to be profound and scholarly.SOLA is Latin for \\"only\\" or \\"alone\\". There are three SOLA formulas which we have inherited from the Reformation. Some of the SOLA formulas share common doctrine between Catholics and Protestants.SOLA FIDE = \\"only faith\\" or \\"faith alone\\"[Actually, Protestant and Catholic Doctrine is in agreement, that salvation is by a combination of Faith & Reason, and not by Faith Alone or Blind Faith.]SOLA GRATIA = \\"only grace\\" or \\"grace alone\\"SOLA SCRIPTURA = \\"only scripture\\" or \\"scripture alone\\"This book addresses the difficulties created when the Protestant Reformation adopted the SOLA SCRIPTURA doctrine, which claims that \\"only Scripture\\" is infallible divine revelation.This distinguishes Catholic doctrine from Protestant doctrine, because all the Catholic practices and tradition which are not objectively identifed in the Holy Bible itself, tend to be rejected by Protestants. Is this reasonable?No, not by reason itself it is not. The simple fact is that what Protestants and Catholics refer to as the Holy Bible, was not \\"canonized\\" or adopted as legitimate Christian scripture until the 3rd Century AD at the Council of Nicea.The Protestant doctrine simply dismisses all Christian tradition and doctrine which existed for 300 years, claiming that it is not overtly identified in the New Testament and Old Testament, therefore, it is not \\"infallible revelation\\".This is problematic. When protestants consider issues of doctrine, they adopt the practice of \\"proof texting\\". This means that if the doctrine can be identified in the Holy Bible, it is valid doctrine.Of course, the early Christian Church, which was essentially, the Catholic Church, existed for 300 years without a canonized set of scriptures, by which doctrine could even be \\"proof texted\\".Essentially, Protestants have decided to bury their head, Ostrich fashion, in the sands of time and history. I do not mean to offend Protestantism itself. Moreover, some of the finest theological exposition available today comes from Protestant theologians. Nonetheless, facts are facts, and ought to be addressed by reason itself, in spite of the causes of the Reformation.Moreover, Martin Luther himself should be considered carefully. To indicate that Martin Luther was no \\"saint\\" is a massive understatement. When one reads further, even on the Internet, Luther can be discovered as one of the most vile and profane men ever to undertake the work of the clergy."},{"Title":"Not by Scripture Alone: A Catholic Critique of the Protestant Doctrine of Sola Scriptura","review":"I recommend this book, with a single qualification: that the readers of it obtain other books on Ecclesial History, so as not to have this single volume (which is admittedly going near Catholic 'fundamentalism') as the sole resource. And I ask this NOT because I'm afraid that the authors of this book will be thus proven wrong; rather, that the reader might understand why they are right.The book itself manages to refute Sola Scripura quite easily...in fact, it does this several times over, i.e., it seems as though the job may have been accomplished with a mere 300 pages. The doctrine is examined within Scripture itself, the Early Church, and in light of its philosophical tenability and practicality. A brief glimpse into the teachings of the Reformers, along with an overview of the Catholic understanding of the relationship between Scripture and Tradition, and a mega 'Questions and Answers' section round off the volume nicely. Three appendixes are included: a surprisingly pungent dossier on the Early Fathers view of Scripture and Tradition, an excursus on the 'Traditions of Men', within historio-critical context, which were so scorned by Jesus, and to this day, so used as a proof text by fundamentalists and others who don't like the Catholic Church, or Eastern Orthodoxy. The final appendix consists of two brief debates between Pat Madrid and Doug Jones.Now for the complaints--1)as mentioned above, the book is too long, and sometimes repeats itself. 2)the concept of Sacred Tradition was never really examined in its own light, i.e., it was always included within a 'Bible-only is false' context, and this seems to welcome the 'Catholic fundamentalism' charge (though Mark Shea's chapter on Tradition is very good, and makes up for whatever else was lacking in this area).I rate the books' distinct themes thusly:Philisophical--BScriptural--AHistorical--APositive Case for Tradition--BNow, on to a gentleman who apparently didn't think much of this volume :-) The fellow from Mt. Juliet, it seems to me, wasn't awake when he read the book. For example, he says '...the Catholic priest teaches them Jesus died and rose again, that belief is based on the Bible even if no one owns a Bible', with the implication being that, likewise, the same mindset was operative in the N.T. and ante-Nicene Church. The reason the Catholic priest says the above regarding Jesus is because 1)it is an historical fact that 2)has been passed on, whether in writing or via mouth. In case Mr. Holt is wondering, the reason why we can be so certain that he is wrong in rejecting the Traditon claim outright is because the doctrines that Tradition teaches are corroborated by the earliest extra-biblical sources we have. Clement teaches apostolic succession, Ignatius the supremacy of the Bishop and the Real Presence, Justin Martyr the WEEKLY participation in the Eucharist, along with a Mass format that is followed, in its basic format, to this day by the East and the West. The earliest testimony we have of the New Testament, Papias, speaks of preference for the Oral Teaching of the apostles, and those close to the apostles.The champion of Mt. Juliet shows his ignorance in his comment about 'nearly 75% of the Bible being canonized' in Jesus day. Canonized by whom? The Sadducees only accepted the Pentateuch. In other camps, the Wisdom writings were not at all settled. Song of Songs was debated until and after the 'Council' of Jamnia, along with Esther and Ecclesiastes. The Ethiopian Jews of today still accept the 'apocrypha' as being canonical. Into the early years of the Church, the books were by no means settled.Regarding the New Testament, Clement of Alexandria apparently accepts the Gospel of Peter, the East rejects Revelation, Clement of Rome quotes from the Wisdom of Solomon, Athanasius from Baruch, Augustine quotes from Wis of Sol and Sirach more than any other OT books in formulating his Christology, Origen recommends Tobit for catechumens, etc., etc. The first 'canon' is formulated by a heretic named Marcion--consisting of a truncated assortment of Pauline writings accompanied by an edited version of Luke; the OT is rejected entirely. The New Oxford Annotated Study Bible, in its section on the deuterocanonicals, makes it plain that the Apocrypha was accepted, by and large, by the early Church. Anyone familiar with the writings of the Fathers knows for a fact that the New Testament was far from settled. The issue did not settle itself, and required the Church.The Cavalier of Mt. Juliet, as far as i can tell, operates with the assumption 'Now, given that we KNOW sola scriptura to be true, we will thus explain away the 1500 year hole in the argument', for i can think of no other reason why, after reading a very solid 600 page book, he conjectures that the reason why we needn't be bothered by the (admitted) lack of Scripture in the primitive Church is because what Paul didn't tell the Thessalonians, he did tell the Romans; what was passed on to Timothy as an unwritten Tradition was given to Galatia in Writing. (It must have worked this way, because, as we have shown above, Sola Scriptura is true). The reply to this, again, is the fact that the post NT writings give a picture of a definite Ecclesiastical form, with much appearing as ASSUMED and KNOWN BY ALL PARTIES. The only explanation for this is that the Scripture that comprises the NT, which is nothing more than crystalized instances of Tradition applied to PARTICULAR COMMUNITIES or individuals and THEIR SPECIFIC PROBLEMS, and NOT a text-book on doctrine, was cast by a uniform Community with shared assumptions and experiences that became Creeds and Scriptures insofar as was needed, and these realized within an existential community called The Church with rites and customs and bishops, united one with another in the Eucharist, and Rome as the basic head (which doesn't necessarily imply the Roman Catholic Papacy--see John Meyendorff's THE PRIMACY OF PETER for a balanced and sensible view from the East). That is why Irenaeus, in the late Second Century, well before the Canon was settled, can speak so surely about all Churches teaching the same doctrine, be it in France, Spain, Palestine, or Greece. And that is why we DON'T see anything like a community of primitive Protestants.That aside, I sincerely wish the Knight of Mt. Juliet his best, and i applaud him for taking the trouble to atleast buy, even though he doesn't seem to have read, a book which he passionatley disagrees with.To the rest of you, I recommend Johannes Quasten's 4 volume series on Patrology (Catholic), Jaroslav Pelikan's 5 volume series on the Development of Christian Doctrine (Eastern Orthodox), and Kelly's works on Early Christian Doctrine and Creed's (Protestant). Of course, the finest apologetic for Catholic Doctrine is to be found in Newman's Essay on the Development of Doctrine. The Philisophical problems of Sola Scriptura are more than amply set out by Richard Swinburne in his magnificent book entitled REVELATION: FROM METAPHOR TO ANALOGY (bring your thinking cap). From the East John Zizioulas' writings on Communion and the Early Church are a must, along with Bishop Kallistos Ware's 'The Orthodox Church'. The best critique available of the Catholic, and Eastern Orthodox Claim, is to be found in William Webster et al, HOLY SCRIPTURE: THE PILLAR AND GROUND OF OUR FAITH. And, of course, the original writings of the early fathers are advocated, especially Clement of Rome, Ignatius, Irenaeus, Origen, Athanasius, Eusebius, Gregory of Nyssa, Basil the Great, Gregory of Nazianzus, and Augustine.Anywho, back to the book in discussion, I truly recommend it. There are certain books which, as the chap from Mt. Juliet says, only convince those who are already convinced. I don't believe this book to be anywhere near that weak. The arguments are strong and basically cogent, and there is plenty of them. Much ground is covered, and, in my opinion, the damage done to the pillar of Protestantism by Sungenis and the gang is overwhelming, definitive, and permanent.

Beyond the consensus that the bible is God's word it is a free for all. Even such fundamentals as sola scriptura and sola fide are not accepted by many Prostestants in the form that the first Reformers employed them to seperate from the RCC.Thus, some modern protestants seem to reject both pre-reformation/catholic history and the philosophical pillars of their own fathers Luther, Calvin etc, in place they create communities with shallow roots held by the optimism of the HS.Identifying protestant beliefs is like nailing jelly to a tree.Interesting point on James bro of Jesus?

Some of these were escaping the Spanish Inquisition. Jews mostly came to America to escape religious persecution and be able to practice their religion freely, as the early English settlers did. Although the small minority groups of Jews faced prejudices from some quarters, in the colonies they found defenders. And in some cases they found high-placed individuals who integrated some of them into prominent positions with important public responsibilities. Though he had mixed feelings toward the Jews, the founder and leader of Georgia, General Oglethorpe, gave them land equally with the Presbyterians, Lutherans, Moravians, and other Protestant sects in the colony. In the War of Jenkins Ear against the Spanish in Florida, Oglethorpe appointed the Jew Benjamin Sheftall an officer in the Georgia militia. The varying fortunes of Jews as a group and individual Jews are recounted as a part of the larger story of the example of democratic principles George Washington set. The last chapter ties Washington's wish that his slaves be freed after his death with his vision of religious tolerance for all. Some of his clearest, most-cited statements on religious tolerance, freedom, and equality were made in synagogues or with unmistakable references to Jews in certain locales, in Newport, RI, for example. Down to today, Jews look to Washington as the particular Founding Father making America a place where they could practice their religion freely and be accepted in the society."},{"Title":"Tokyo Underworld: The Fast Times and Hard Life of an American Gangster in Japan","review":"This is a consummate book about a part of Japan that can be somewhat shocking especially if one is only familiar with the Japanese for their formalities and etiquette.

I enjoyed the writer's style immensely."},{"Title":"Tokyo Underworld: The Fast Times and Hard Life of an American Gangster in Japan","review":"Tokyo Underworld is a bit of a mixed bag -- part biography, part history -- and therein lies both its strength and weakness.As a biography, the book charts the career of Nick Zappetti, an American who came to Japan in the wake of World War Two and became involved in a range of illegal activities, including gambling (successful) and diamond robbery (spectacularly unsuccessful). His story, drawn largely from interviews with the man himself before his death in 1992, offers interesting insights into the essential lawlessness of the occupation of Japan in the late 40's and early 50's.As a history, Tokyo Underworld tries to draw parallels between Zappetti's story and the post-war relationship between Japan and America. In this, the book is much less successful, partly because it is so heavily dependant on source material from Zappetti himself. By the 70's, Zappetti had been run out of business by his partners and ex-wives, and was no longer a factor in the Tokyo underworld scene. The second half of the book thus labours under the strain of trying to include Zappetti anecdotes in its discussion of subjects like the Lockheed scandal.As either a biography or a history, this would have made a fresh and interesting take on modern Japanese history.

The author argues that Japan seemed like a well-ordered and well-organized society, but which was really a corrupt society, where national affairs were decided over sake in brothels. After reading the book, I concluded that the Japanese are just like the Chinese, but they're just more group-oriented and more nationalistic.The major flaw of the book is writing.

First, not once in 12 years have I had even a second hand encounter with the Japanese underworld. Also, this book is not so much an overview of the post-WWII Tokyo underworld but rather an in depth biography of one man who was mistakenly labled as the crime boss of Tokyo by the foreign press, and loads of great background material surrounding his experience. Finally, as the book does describe a man who admittedly involved himself in the seamier side of Japanese society, understand that most members of the foreign community do not experience his level of alienation (which you will read about). Personally, my foreign-ess has almost nothing to do with my successes or failures and I find that I am accepted almost as a native in all aspects of my life. Of course, I happen to be very fluent in the language and culture and have made a concentrated effort to actively participate in the community, according to the rules of the community. Those who experience alienation are usually the ones doing the alienating.So, if you are interested in modern Japanese history and the Japanese underworld in particular, this is a very exciting, revealing and entertaining must read, but don't let it affect your travel plans! :)"},{"Title":"Tokyo Underworld: The Fast Times and Hard Life of an American Gangster in Japan","review":"A bit long winded about the main person Nick, but very interesting of how goverment U.S.-v- Japanese goverment-v- the gangster element and how they worked together in many areas to make Japan what it is today, Robert Whiting did a bang up job as usual."},{"Title":"Tokyo Underworld: The Fast Times and Hard Life of an American Gangster in Japan","review":"The well-researched book discusses the history of the Japanese gangs.If you read between the lines, you can get an idea of what still exists in Japan if the reforms are not implemented.Whiting offers many examples of how the Japanese gangs can lobby for rights to organize. Some say the current reforms are not needed since Asia is recovering. If they don't implement the needed reforms, there's no guarantee that Japan's traditional approach to contracts will change.Whiting does an excellent job of discussing the double talk of Japanese contracts that change if the circumstances change. He gives the example of how Japanese businesses threw out their western employers once the company had been sold to another company. If the reforms aren't implemented, what's to say this behavior won't continue once the West finds out there are hidden debts and resell the company at a loss?The author talks about loyalty to company. This means that people will commit fraud and hide debts in subsidiaries if it means the company will flourish. If the reforms aren't implemented, what ensures western companies that there aren't hidden debts?Whiting leaves this question unanswered. One is left with the feeling that the fundamental problems that drove the 1997 Asian financial crisis not only exist, but lay in hiding for the unsuspecting Western firms who can't wait to buy at the bottom. If it was such a good deal, why are the Japanese selling?Whiting invites the readers to ponder such questions with his illuminating travel through Japanese business culture. Without reform, the gangs are still there with hidden debts, payoffs, and cheaper prices to get market access.What we call crime, Japan considers &quot;business as usual.&quot; Not much has changed in 1999.Well worth your time if you want to understand the real risks of doing business in an Asia that fails to reform."},{"Title":"Tokyo Underworld: The Fast Times and Hard Life of an American Gangster in Japan","review":"Despite all the positive reviews, I found this book to be barely readable. I was hoping to read a historical work on Japanese organized crime and ended up wallowing through a collection of anecdotes centered around Nick Zappetti, a frequently unlucky fellow whose restaurant was a crossroads for celebrities and criminals. All said and done, if you are looking for a reasonably scholarly work on Japanese organized crime, don't buy this book."},{"Title":"Tokyo Underworld: The Fast Times and Hard Life of an American Gangster in Japan","review":"This is the Japan your mother would have warned you to stay away from if she had known it existed. Most westerners don't. But journalist and long-time resident Robert Whiting peeks behind the shoji to show us a sleazeball world of crooks, both petty and big-time, operating hand in hand with Japan's pervasive government-industrial complex, often in cahoots with corporate America and the CIA.Tokyo Underworld opens right after the surrender, when a devastated nation, reeling from the shock of Hiroshima, clung precariously to life. Tokyo had been flattened by the bombing raids. Food was scarce, consumer goods nonexistent. In this barren soil a black market sprang to life within days of the surrender and was soon flourishing, trading in contraband wares smuggled in or diverted from the supply chains of the occupying forces.Enter Nick Zappetti, a small time hood from the Bronx, who remained in Japan after his discharge from the US Army. Operating on the principle that every calamity contains an opportunity, Zappetti made his first big score by smuggling a precious shipment of lighter flints into Japan.With Zappetti as the central figure, Whiting recounts the story of Japan's recovery and rise to superpower status, focusing on the netherworld of crime. Given his own background, growing up in the mean streets of the Bronx where mafia bosses were the most highly respected figures, it was only natural for Zappetti to forge links with shady characters. These included Rikidozan, the ex-sumo wrestler whose exploits as a professional wrestler made him a figure of mythic dimensions in postwar Japan. Rikidozan's staged triumphs over American adversaries helped, according to Whiting, a defeated and dishonored nation to recover its self-esteem, thus setting the stage for the economic boom of the 80s.Zappetti mixed out-and-out crime (he served prison time for armed robbery following an infamous diamond heist) with quasi-legitimate enterprises. The most noteworthy of these was Nicola's, a pizza restaurant in Toky's glitzy, cosmopolitan Roppongi district. At Nicola's, international film stars and the Crown Prince of Japan rubbed elbows with politicians and crooks. The intense and long-lasting popularity of Nicola's made Zappetti enormously rich and notorious, with a list of contacts ranging from gang bosses to members of the Japanese Diet.Other ventures didn't fare so well: a mink farm in Japan's northernmost island was a dismal failure. The reason? Japanese women didn't wear mink. Another farming venture ran aground. The same goes for Zappetti's marriages to Japanese wives. One of these, to a 19-year-old beauty queen, lasted only a few months and cost him 30 million in alimony.Whiting's previous books on Japanese baseball (one of which was named Sports Book of the Year by Time Magazine) are only superficially about baseball: they are insightful studies of Japanese society as seen through the window of the foreign game that verges on a national obsession. Whiting's analysis of how they have adapted the game shows us what makes the Japanese tick.The author brings the same bicultural sophistication and insider's insight to Tokyo Underworld as he does to baseball. His intimate relationship with Zappetti during the latter's last tell-all years adds a dimension rarely seen. No one but Whiting could have written this book, which makes it all the more valuable for its unique viewpoint. (Full disclosure: I was friends with Robert Whiting in the 70s in Japan before his first book earned him an international reputation).While Japan's criminal underworld may operate in the shadows, easily overlooked or ignored, it is impossible to underestimate its influence on the national life at every level--from sports, entertainment, and the mizu shobai world of bar hostesses and prostitutes, to government and big business. Politicians and businessmen with ties to the underworld were key players in the Lockheed scandal that rocked Japan in the 70s: Lockheed hired former drug smuggler, war criminal and underworld power broker Yoshio Kodama as a \`consultant' to grease the wheels in a deal where Lockheed paid more than $3 million in bribes to Prime Minister Tanaka and other government officials to insure that its aircraft was chosen over its Boeing rival for All Nippon Airways.Tokyo Underworld is a fairly dense read, exhaustively researched (over 200 interviews) and packed with facts and information (Notes and Sources runs to 45 pages). Though it isn't always light reading, Tokyo Underworld provides a fascinating glimpse of the seamier side of Japanese society, along with a view of postwar US-Japan relations that won't be found in most histories of the period."},{"Title":"Tokyo Underworld: The Fast Times and Hard Life of an American Gangster in Japan","review":"I think this book does one thing very well - explain just how penetrating an influence the mafia have in so many aspects of Japanese society. In New York you would have to go looking for mafiosos in their lairs but walk into any decent hotel in Osaka or Kobe and you'll find 2 in the lobby; their business tentacles are in everything, not just sanitation &amp; construction. While the fed government here has worked zealously (probably too zealously) to reduce the Italian mob to a few unglamorous rackets, it seems like every major real estate deal in jpn as some concealed mafia presence; even the gov't employs them for various unseemly tasks. I think whiting does a lot to unravel part of this mystery -- at least why the yakuza, who had been around for some time, flourished and became so visible. It's gross that the US helped."},{"Title":"Tokyo Underworld: The Fast Times and Hard Life of an American Gangster in Japan","review":"I found it hard to put this book down.Its more a story of the Japanese mob than Nick Zapetti and better for it. The way Whiting digs below the surface to show the corruption in Japanese business and politics is certainly a different perspective than the average gaijin usually sees. What was particularly fascinating for me was how obvious the yakuza have become in their activities yet how easily foreigners, some at the highest levels, have been duped into believing that Japan is \\"clean\\". The story about Bush Sr's brother being retained by the yakuza is a good tale of how big and powerful the yakuza have become.I would love to see what Whiting has to say about more recent Japanese politics - particularly about how clean / dirty Koizumi was. But since the book was published in 1999 you don't get much insight into any changes since the millenium.Still, that's a small point and I would highly recommend the book to anyone with the slightest interest in Japan."},{"Title":"Tokyo Underworld: The Fast Times and Hard Life of an American Gangster in Japan","review":"This is one of the most entertaining books I have ever read about Japan. And one of the most informative too. What really sets this book apart from most others on the topic is the detailed account of an American living through the post-war period and the excesses and hubris of the boom and eventual bust. I can almost imagine myself in Nick's shoes as he fights his way to the top of the pile only to slip under the weight of his greed. At the same time, this book imparts a valuable history lesson on just how much of Japan's economic boom was truly the result of hard work and how much was rigged. Until I read this book, I never fully appreciated the level of collusion and stunning, open-mouthed greed of Japan's ruling classes. It seems like another world, one that I can only see through this book."},{"Title":"Tokyo Underworld: The Fast Times and Hard Life of an American Gangster in Japan","review":"A very good writer tackling a little known (in the West) aspect of Japan and Japanese history. Although he did make errors when he discusses the historical background to his main subject (e.g., the author's assertion about the U.S.' view of Park Chung Hee of South Korea - actually, they were first afraid that he was a communist) does not detract from the readability of the book. Even the anecdotes are fascinating - I read every singly end note in the book and they are numerous and incredible."},{"Title":"Tokyo Underworld: The Fast Times and Hard Life of an American Gangster in Japan","review":"This book intrigued me and bored me.The vignettes Whiting spins were entertaining to read. He writes with an understated style thats suits each episode perfectly. In these instances, the people involved are not mere names, but people in action.In the space between these stories, Whiting lost me. He endlessly lists names, places, and events in passing, that, while it may be important to someone interested in straight facts, didn't appeal to me. I was glad to get to the end.But I have to say that after reading this book, I have a much better understanding of that side of Japanese history. Especially enlightening was the wounded nationalism displayed by the Japanese. They wanted to be the best in the world--at first militarily, then, after being defeated, the focus changed to business--to top the US (and the rest of the world) in something. All in all, a good book. Just get past the filler."},{"Title":"Tokyo Underworld: The Fast Times and Hard Life of an American Gangster in Japan","review":"Ran across this book on Japanese society New York, and had to read it.

I liked the history of the yakuza and the stuff about how Ropongi was formed and became a nightlife district, but I found all the content about the American pizza place guy to be sort of dull. (It's like the writer went to the trouble to find all this stuff so he felt like he should put it in.)The back story of the Japanese criminals and gangsters was fascinating and makes this worth reading, but don't expect to be totally glued to the pages."},{"Title":"Tokyo Underworld: The Fast Times and Hard Life of an American Gangster in Japan","review":"Nick Zappetti sounds like a proper name for a Mafia boss. What is unusual about this particular capo is his territory-the Roppongi district of Tokyo-as well as the time of his ascendancy-the fall of 1945, in occupied Japan. Tokyo Underworld is a half-century survey of the dark side of the Japanese economic miracle, the criminal empire born of the corruption which riddled the Marshall Plan. Part postwar history and part gangster movie, Tokyo Underworld is unfurled by its author with a melodramatic flourish:It is an alternate, separate layer of reality, a shadowy universe of characters-gangsters, corrupt entrepreneurs, courtesans, seedy sports promoters, streetwise opportunists, intelligence agents, political fixers, and financial manipulators-who have perhaps done as much in their own right to influence U.S.-Japan affairs as their more refined and respected peers. Significantly, it has not always been easy to distinguish the latter from the former.Drawing on police and press reports as well as personal interviews (Zappetti himself was interviewed extensively for this book between 1989 and his death in 1992 at age seventy-one), Robert Whiting, one of the few western journalists to live and write regularly in Japan, depicts an awesome cancer of corruption metastasizing behind the rigid veneer of Japanese society. From the smoldering ashes of postwar Japan (where things were so bad the Japanese had to fight for scraps with the Korean slaves they'd imported during the war), to the CIA's backing of yakuza gangs in the \`50s and \`60s as anti-Communist thugs, to the ruinous scandals of the \`90s, where prominent Japanese executives and politicians were implicated in vast criminal rackets as the economy plunged into a tailspin, crooked and straight men mingled freely across previously impermeable caste lines in an ever-expanding criminal sphere which Whiting calls \\"Japan's first experiment in democracy\\". And where was Nicola Zappetti during these halcyon days? Hailing from Prohibition-era East Harlem, Zappetti had chosen crime as a career during adolescence, skipping school to learn instead from thugs and racketeers like his cousin Gaetano \\"Three Finger Brown\\" Luchese. Whiting contends that Zappetti actually joined the Marines to give his budding criminal instincts room to expand, and delighted in the hell of postwar Tokyo, where he quickly made a stake running contraband whiskey, cigarettes, and military scrip to-who else?-Allied soldiers and small-time Japanese gangsters, the only people in Japan with money or goods to trade. Zappetti shrewdly played the gangs off one another, recognizing their tribal hatreds and the burgeoning Japanese market for narcotics. He did so on his own initiative, using his own brains and brawn, not relying on the American Mafia (except to get back to Japan after being deported by the authorities in 1950). Zappetti also made a smart long-term investment early on, introducing the Japanese to pizza in the up-and-coming honky-tonk district of Roppongi. He made some erroneous investments as well, including a fur factory, several Japanese wives, and Japanese citizenship, for which he sacrificed his U.S. passport, thereby stranding himself in Japan. Crime and politics make for interesting bedfellows, and Zappetti's circle read like a Who's Who of both worlds. There was the famous Rikidozan, a psychotic sumo wrestler who met his end on the point of a yakuza thug's knife in a men's room. There was \\"Killer\\" Ikeda, a notoriously violent thug with whom Zappetti once went knife-to-gun, and won. There was Hiyasuki Machii, head of the Tosei-kai, Tokyo's most powerful Korean gang, which controlled the clubs and rackets of the booming Ginza strip (Machii also worked for the G-2 intelligence unit of the occupying American force, as a strikebreaker and anti-Communist thug). There was Yoshio Kodama, right-wing political fixer and yakuza money man (also a onetime G-2 operative, rooting out Communist groups in Japan). Much of the mingling between these men took place in Zappetti's Roppongi restaurant, Nicola's, or at the New Latin Quarter, a nightclub straight out of a James Bond movie: \\"It was a favorite hangout of the international intelligence community, agents from the KGB, CIA and MI6 often vying with each other for the same hostess.\\" Zappetti died alone and penniless, unable to return home, broken by alcohol and diabetes, the victim of a new order of corporate criminals who used Japan's laws against him and his empire (known as keizai yakuza). Zappetti, who had survived knives, guns, and bombs, was mortally wounded by the sort of white-collar criminals who would carry the lessons of the street all the way up to the highest levels of the Japanese government, using corporate cutouts, money laundering, bogus investments, and the like. Zappetti had come up as the Mustache Petes in the American Mafia were going out; by the time of his death in 1992, Zappetti himself was the dinosaur. An exchange between Zappetti and one such new-wave crook showed the writing on the wall:\\"What the hell is the point of being a yakuza,\\" he asked one well-tailored mobster, \\"if you act like everyone else? You guys use electronic calculators instead of swords. You talk about derivatives. Your name cards say corporate vice president instead of captain or elder brother. You're trying too hard to be respectable.\\" The mobster gave Nick a strange look and said, \\"What about you?\\" Then he asked for the wine list.Whiting's book often veers away from Zappetti himself, panning out to focus on the big picture of Japanese crime during a given period. A far more concise summary of Zappetti's life and exploits appears in the book's acknowledgments, along with a thorough source list and bibliography. But the story tells itself, and it is a disturbing, thrilling account of U.S.-Japan relations and Japan after the Second World War."},{"Title":"Tokyo Underworld: The Fast Times and Hard Life of an American Gangster in Japan","review":"5 stars to Japan-journalist Robert Whiting (of \\"You Gotta Have Wa\\" fame). The title of the book says it all - a documented account of the life and times of an American gangster, Nick Zappetti, in Roppongi, Tokyo from the Occupation in 1945 to Zappetti's death in 1992. This is not fiction, nor is it a straight history book. It is more like a biography, but focusses almost exclusively on Zappetti's life in Japan, with asides on the political and criminal background, including the Lockheed scandal. This is serious journalism, written with panache and wit. Whiting has done an excellent and difficult job, which only someone fluent in Japanese could do (the footnotes and references are just as fascinating as the main story). And what a story! Despite the violence and scams, and Zappetti's final embittered years, Whiting had me laughing out loud in several places. An ageing, impotent Zappetti, embroiled in endless lawsuits, is losing money on his flagship restaurant while the ones he was forced to hand over to his wife are making money hand over fist. His shrewd wife offers her free advice - \\"change the decor, adapt to Japanese tastes, turn up the lighting\\" - which Zappetti consistently ignores. Finally, at his wits' end, he does as she suggests and invests his last millions in a complete overhaul. The new shiny restaurant opens - just as Japan's bubble economy bursts!This book will appeal particularly to people who live or have lived in Japan, but also to anyone who enjoys a lurid and seedy tale!"},{"Title":"Tokyo Underworld: The Fast Times and Hard Life of an American Gangster in Japan","review":"As you are reading this book, you will get the feeling that it can't be real, that it's all a fantastic work of fiction. However author Robert Whiting has provided an extensive list of notes and references in the back of the book to support his work. And the information that his book contains is frightening, and perhaps to those who are new to Japan, surprising.Corruption in Japan runs deep, and this book dives all the way to the bottom. Whiting has done a remarkable amount of research and has had amazing access to those people who really run Tokyo and by extension Japan, namely organized crime. Using a relocated New York Mafioso as his catalyst, Whiting exposes how deeply ingrained the Yakuza are, with influence extending as high as the Prime Minister's office and as far afield as the US and Indonesia.Nicola Zapetti knew and worked with some of Japan's most powerful Yakuza, and in Japan, many argue that the Yakuza are the most powerful group of all. Yoshio Kodama, a pardoned Class-A war criminal, ultra-right wing politician and well-known Yakuza once referred to himself as &quot;the worlds richest fascist.&quot; LDP kingmaker Shin Kanemaru was found with millions of dollars in cash, bearer bonds and gold boullion in his house, much of it bribes from the Yakuza.New Prime Minister Koizumi has been labelled a &quot;reformer&quot; by the media in the West. Those who have read Whiting's book know enough to doubt both his sincerity and his chances of legitimate success at changing this system which is corrupt at its very core.If you want to understand the Japan that they don't teach you about in Polical Science and Business classes, you need this book."},{"Title":"Tokyo Underworld: The Fast Times and Hard Life of an American Gangster in Japan","review":"This entertaining book delves into the seldom analyzed large parallel underworld of Japanese gangs and their links to politicians and \\"legitimate\\" businesses. It does so through the remarkable life of Nick Zapetti, a small-time American hood who found his niche in post-war Japan. Whiting sometimes has to stretch to connect Zapetti with the various themes and events that he describes (Zapetti's links to the Lockheed bribery scandal that brought down a Japanese government are pretty tenuous, for example), but he manages both to describe institutions such as sokaiya (corporate extortionists) who are important to the workings of the Japanese economy, and give the reader a sense of daily life in modern Japan.The amazon.com website is replete with scholarly studies of Japanese politics and economics. This book is an interesting and important companion piece to \\"serious\\" analyses of Japan and would be an excellent addition to undergraduate syllabi on modern Japan."},{"Title":"Tokyo Underworld: The Fast Times and Hard Life of an American Gangster in Japan","review":"An extremely engrossing look at a side of history most Japanese--and Americans--don't like to talk about.

As a gaijin who grew up in post-Occupation Japan and witnessed the scene which the author describes so vividly--and having had an encounter (thankfully, a positive one!) with Nick Zapetti, the King of Roppongi--I'd say Robert Whiting has captured the time and place and wooly cast of characters perfectly. A huge plus is the excellent commentary and cogent explanation of the backstage politics and the righteous criminal mentality of Japan, Inc. I give this book five stars and a haramaki."},{"Title":"Tokyo Underworld: The Fast Times and Hard Life of an American Gangster in Japan","review":"First off, I believe that this book is definitely worth the price of admission as it is an engaging encounter with a part of urban Japanese society that one rarely has the opportunity to become acquainted with. Having said that, the book suffers from some structural problems that leave the reader a little bit at loose ends by the time he reaches the end. This book, although ostensibly about the 'Tokyo Underworld' is actually composed of three distinct threads of discourse. Thread one is a semi-biographical tale of an extraordinary character from blue-collar New York City who, as a result of a post-world war II stint in the Army lands in and adopts Japan as his home and destiny for the rest of his life. The book is semi-biographical because the biography seems to be a fusion of a free association telling of a life's story to the author by this character, and the author's own haphazardly researched, yet thoroughly entertaining description of the characters and events that crop up in the course of this story. The second thread is an off-the-cuff social history of an area of Tokyo that went from urban blight to some of the most renowned and expensive real estate in the world, and is now somewhat equivalent to NYC's 'Great White Way,' or at least what an outsider imagines the GWW should be. The third thread is an anecdotal description of the notorious Tokyo Yakuza and its alleged massive influence and sway over Japanese society from dark alleyways all the way up to the halls of power.If this sounds like an awful lot of material to fit into one teeny tiny book, it is, and because it is the author has to make some compromises. The compromises come in the form of cursory treatments of all three subjects, but done in such a glib and insousciant manner that the reader forgives the author his dilatory story line in return for the verbal ride. This really is not a book about the 'Tokyo Underworld' so much as it is a fun topical read about a colorful 'GaiJin' of questionable character who, against all odds, becomes a notorious and successful figure during a particular era in a discrete section of Tokyo's entertainment district."},{"Title":"Tokyo Underworld: The Fast Times and Hard Life of an American Gangster in Japan","review":"The sub-title of Robert Whiting's fine book is a bit misleading. The American gangster in question often disappears from the narrative for long stretches while Whiting explains the long history of collusion between Japanese politicians and the yakuza. Nevertheless, the result is a fascinating social history with plenty of entertaining anecdotes and colorful character profiles. Chief among the latter are Nick Zapetti himself, the \\"gangster\\" who made a fortune with pizza parlors that became the hangout of choice for expatriates, entertainers, and, most significantly, those who make their living on the wrong side of the law, and then lost that fortune through a combination of stubbornness, bad luck, and ignorance. Another highlight is the career of Rikidozan, the former sumo wrestler who became a national hero and single-handedly established professional wrestling in Japan by defeating foreign wrestlers in scripted bouts, all the while hiding his Korean heritage. Often very funny, this book appeals to both a taste for the prurient and seamy and the desire for a serious, even-handed analysis of the role of organized crime, political selfishness, and short-sighted anti-Communism in Japan's rise to power and wealth."},{"Title":"Tokyo Underworld: The Fast Times and Hard Life of an American Gangster in Japan","review":"This book is a hoot to read. The author got sidetracked on his expose of the yakuza and ended up focusing on the life and times of a second-rate US dimwit who made and lost a fortune in post war Japan through a string of pizza parlors. His fortune rode high on the money spent by the expanding criminal expansion of Japan's underworld, only to as quickly be lost due to his inept understanding of Japanese divorce laws. A real enjoyable book, the story was so amusing that I actually visited the locale while in Japan while on business.

Instead, I wished the book would provide more alternative approaches in form of statistical test to test for causality. For this reason, I would recommend not to rewrite the complete book, but only include one additional chapter written in a more technical style. Then it would be close to perfect.Finally, I want to remark, that the historical notes given throughout the book are not only very intesting but also inspiring, because they remind not to oversee mathematical developments in the none mathematical literature.

Grammar with a Giggle for High School (Maupin House)","review":"I discovered (and bought) Jane's first two Caught'ya books at the national Differentiated Education conference last summer. I have used the high school level stories successfully in the two semesters since then. I wanted more stories so that I could keep my students on track throughout the year, so I ordered The Chortling Bard.What a resource! There are three fully-completed stories based on some of Shakespeare's most entertaining plays. Not only do my students get practice adn instruction in grammar, but they get exposure to Shakespeare without slogging through it all at once. They can experience the stories and enjoy the plots, since they're not doing the incomprehensible everybody-read-a-part-even-if-you-don't-know-what-you're-saying thing. They may not read the original Shakespeare, but they are involved in the story, which generates discussions, and by the end, they get it!"},{"Title":"The Chortling Bard: Caught'ya! Grammar with a Giggle for High School (Maupin House)","review":"I really like using this technique in my classroom. I'm a bit of a ham and love doing the sentences out loud. Some of my student teachers/subs haven't been so comfortable, though. (You really have to get into the act.) I like the fact that every student can get 100% on the assignment no matter what they're level.

I have used the &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; story from Jane's first book for my ninth graders, and I wanted to continue the &quot;caught'ya&quot; method with my sophomores. &quot;The Chortling Bard&quot; fits the bill nicely. My students loved the story &quot;A Midsummer's Nightmare,&quot; and I loved my students' improvement in writing conventions and sentence variety.

Grammar with a Giggle for High School (Maupin House)","review":"\\"The Chortling Bard\\" is an excellent way to reinforce grammar skill in high school students in a way that is not only educational, but fun. As a homeschool mom of three, I was familiar with the Caught'ya method, since I used the first book a few years ago when my kids were younger. This year I needed something for my 15-year-old, so I was thrilled to find the author had revamped three of Shakespeare's plays.The book is divided into sentences for three years of school. Along with ideas for lessons to carry over from the daily Caught'ya, the book has suggestions for mid-term exams, quizzes, and finals.I highly recommend this book and method. It really helps reinforce skills such as punctuation, capitalization, and much more. Plus the kids don't hate it presented in this entertaining format."},{"Title":"The Chortling Bard: Caught'ya!

Grammar with a Giggle for High School (Maupin House)","review":"A fellow high school English teacher recommended these to me for my daily warm ups, they are very fun and different! I teach 9th - 11th grade and use them daily. I would recommend making copies of them on transparencies and having them up for students to do on their own in their notebooks. It is little paragraphs and put together form a story. I'm sure my students wouldn't say they love this, but I pick a student to be the &#34;teacher&#34; everyday and go through and correct the paragraph with the class while I go around to verify completion."},{"Title":"The Chortling Bard: Caught'ya! Grammar with a Giggle for High School (Maupin House)","review":"I'm using this book with my 13 year old home-schooled son. I love the way it makes him think about the grammar he knows in order to correct the sentences. He's even using his grammar reference book! Plus, he is diligently researching the meaning of the Shakespearean insults. Anything that sends a 13 year old off on his own to look up words is worthwhile. :)"},{"Title":"The Chortling Bard: Caught'ya! Grammar with a Giggle for High School (Maupin House)","review":"This book is a great way to incorporate grammar if you don't have the time to teach a grammar unit.

I will continue to use this book!!"},{"Title":"The Chortling Bard: Caught'ya! Grammar with a Giggle for High School (Maupin House)","review":"This product requires a pretty thorough knowledge of English grammar to use it.

The series includes an accompaniment CD with pronunciation of texts read by native language speakers. Each song is also written in standard IPA and a glossary is also included to help with pronunciation. The songs in the German selection range from easy to challenging. The songs give the student the opportunity to grow in range, dynamic control, phrasing, technique, and other areas. I highly recommend the Hal Leonard Favorite German Art Songs, and the other Art Song books in the series. They are a most helpful collection of fine Art Songs for any singer!"},{"Title":"Favorite German Art Songs - Volume 1: The Vocal Library High Voice (Vocal Collection)","review":"This book and all others in the series recieve my highest rating as an opera singer and a teacher. The translations and IPA references make it a wonderful resource for any teacher, or college student who has taken a diction class. The CD comes with a reading of the poem and then a call and response part for you to perfect your pronuciation. The accompianments are also done beautifully, the sound quality is very clear with good volume. I have to rate these books the best all around books for my studio and wish the other publishers would follow their example."},{"Title":"Statistical Analysis in Climate Research","review":"I am a phd-student in spacephysics. \\"Statistical analysis in Climate Research\\" is the statistics book which has been most relevant for me that I have read until this time. The information density is very high in this book. It is necessary with some prior knowledge about statistics to read this book. It does not contain any proofs, but many references to other books. The most important thing about this book for me is that it provides solutions to many of the problems one encounter when analyzing data in geophysics. Especially good is it that it discuss situations where the \\"ideal\\" assumptions used in normal statistics books are not fulfilled."},{"Title":"Statistical Analysis in Climate Research","review":"People interested in the subject of why we know humans caused climate change will enjoy this book. It explains all one could possibly wish to know on the subject, including Dr. Mann's _Nature_ trick. Paleoclimatology methodologies cannot be understood without first reading a book of this sort.The book is an introductory work, written specifically for climatologists, but no attempt has been made to \\"dumb down\\" the subject: people with zero knowledge on the subject will not understand much of the material, and they will have to consult other reference regarding some methodologies, terms, and phrases.I got my copy for $35 in the \\"bargain bin\\" of a bookstore in Santa Fe. Amazon's price is what most copies are going for (about $80), so it is a fair market cost."},{"Title":"MERRY HALL","review":"One of the book catalogs that I occasionally get in the mail has been singing the praises of the late Beverley Nichols. Besides writing mystery novels, he also wrote about his adventures in renovating and resurrecting a home in the suburbs of London just after WWII. First published as a collection of magazine columns, he would later on assemble them into a trilogy of books.The first of the trilogy, Merry Hall details his search, at times frustrating, for the perfect house and garden. Very soon he became aware of what land agents (realtors for us Yanks) really meant in their ads, and he started to see his hopes plummet as his hopes were continually dashed. But one listing caught his eye, and with a good friend, he took the journey out of London to look the place over.The estate, spreading over five acres are a compendium of every gardening mistake. Ghastly ornaments litter the grounds -- the previous owner was very fond of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs). And the house, a lovely Georgian mansion, isn't much better. While it hasn't fallen down yet, there are 'additions' that are ugly and inappropriate, and decorating choices of colours that can be best left to the imagination. Not to mention the holly hedges, a stagnant stinking pond of unimaginable depths, and dire warnings from his friend that Nichols is about to step into a money pit that will sap his life and savings.Undeterred by such gloomy words, Nichols falls head over heels in love with his find, especially when he discovers the kitchen garden. Not only is it beautifully kept, but along one wall is a collection of exquisite lilies. Soon, he discovers why there is such order in the midst of such chaos. For along with the house and land comes Oldfield, an ancient gardener of superb talents. Smitten, Nichols signs for the house on the spot, and soon starts on that most dreaded adventure that most home owners endure -- renovations.With his 'valet,' Gaskin, and two cats, 'One' and 'Four' Nichols moves into Merry Hall, and starts the work with a great deal of gusto, and soon finds out that in his own little Eden, there's a few problems. For one, there are the neighbors, Miss Emily and Our Rose, forever scheming to get something out his prized gardens. And Oldfield, is quite another problem altogether. There are towering elm trees and their suckers, the dratted holly hedge (the solution to that one is not one that I would recommend!), and the question of what would you do if you could dream -- and dream big?I loved reading this book. I found myself entranced with Nichols writing about everyday life, the perils and delights of gardening, and living with cats. At times I was helplessly laughing at Nichols' searing wit and lofty views on post-War taste in Britain. He, quite frankly, doesn't give a hoot as to what people will think of him (save Oldfield, for very sensible reasons).Where this story shines, however, is not just in the language and Nichols' skills at writing. It's in his loving, vivid descriptions of flowers and plants, and I found my mouth watering, and desperate looks out at my own wilderness, wondering Could I do it too? The antics of his cats had me in nodding agreement, and plucking at my partner's sleeve and crying out, Listen to this --!Along with Nichols' wonderful prose, there are illustrations by William McLaren in black and white, along with several photographs of Beverley Nichols (including one with 'Four' in his arms). For this new edition, there is also a forward by Ann Lovejoy and an index of all of the plants by Roy C. Dicks. The book itself is a facsimile of the original edition published by Jonathan Cape in 1951. This new edition, only available in hardbound, is published by Timber Press books, and they can be reached at [...] for more reprints of Beverley Nichols books.In short, this is a book to delight any gardener, bibliophile or cat lover's soul. It's funny, at times sorrowful (I cried over 'Two' and 'Three's stories), and came away with a wistful hope that one day too, I would have a wee garden of my own. If you can't purchase this, do try to get your hands on this one at your local library. It is simply too good to miss.Five stars overall, recommended."},{"Title":"MERRY HALL","review":"Merry Hall by Beverly Nichols is a delightful book that should appeal to gardeners as well as others. The author\`s wit and humor are great. He is the Peter Mayle of gardening. The book tells of his purchase and renovation of an old English manor house, but he focuses on the garden instead of on food."},{"Title":"MERRY HALL","review":"I was surprised that I enjoyed a book about a British Bachelor in the 50's indulging his passion for plants but I did- a lot. Not only is the book an informative tool on gardening, but it is a great and funny read even if you have no interest in acquiring your own land any time soon. I intend to buy this book and reread it every year, especially in the dead dark middle of winter."},{"Title":"MERRY HALL","review":"Mr. Nichols' memoir tells the story of restoring the gardens of an old country house outside London just after World War II. His passion for gardens, bordering on obsession, crossing the border actually, is told with dry wit and some withering accounts of local ladies with whom he has gardening disputes. The book combines British wit with the memoir genre, gardening trivia, eccentric characters and rambling country house dreams.A sample: \\"I wanted a house. And I wanted a Georgian house. And I wanted a garden of at least five acres. A garden which, for preference, should be wrecked and lost and despairing...I was in a rescuing mood...\\" (p. 20)The author finds a house and it's the spectacular lilies that seal the deal. He must have those lilies. His friend tells him it's \\"lunacy\\" to buy the house, but his manservant Gaskin rises to the challenge of taking care of the mansion single-handedly. The gardener Oldfield conveys with the house along with his stubborn methods and gardening opinions and oddly inpenetrable accent, as is the stereotype for gardeners in English books. The neighbors are nosy and opinionated, especially Miss Emily and \\"Our Miss Rose\\" whose rivalry regarding decorating the church results in a comical confrontation during the Harvest Festival about whose flowers should adorn the altar.Fans of P.G. Wodehouse's English humor series and E.F. Benson's Mapp and Lucia series will enjoy this book.The scenes of English village life recall Bertie Wooster's visits to his aunts' houses in the country, or Lord Blandings dithering about the pigsty whilst admiring the porcine Empress of Blandings. I'm pretty sure the church decorating rivalry popped up in the Mapp and Lucia books, or if not, it's a familiar theme. However, unlike Wodehouse, Nichols' humor is arch and a bit mean at times, so be forwarned. Since \\"snarky\\" is in style now, perhaps Nichols is due for a revival."},{"Title":"MERRY HALL","review":"A great winter's read. Love the author's descriptive writing style and wit.

A bachelor writer's account of buying an old house and bringing its gardens back to vibrant life with the help of his two cats, One and Four."},{"Title":"MERRY HALL","review":"I want to give my honest opinion of this book. I have never read anything else by this author. While it was entertaining, I found it to get just a little more drawn out than I would have liked. I also did not like his viewpoints on some of the different plants. I guess you just need to take it in stride, but when he characterizes some of your favorite plants as nuisances (or more), etc. it is a little irritating. I did enjoy it, but I don't think I'll read him again. I wanted to give this review, since everyone seems to have LOVED this book but me."},{"Title":"MERRY HALL","review":"I grabbed this one from the New Books Shelf at the library pretty much because I liked the cover and the dustjacket said something about gardening. Beverley was an English gentleman who wrote popular fiction during the 40's. This one is the first in a series of books he wrote about living in Merry Hall, a run-down Georgian mansion that he bought after the war. I loved this little book, and now I'm going to read the whole trilogy. You should, too! At times you might find him irritating, but isn't that to be expected from an egotistical Englishman writing about himself? Besides, he's very funny in that droll way Englishmen have, and he even has two cats named &quot;One&quot; and &quot;Four.&quot; How can you not love that? Here's a bit from it: After breakfast I went along to the music-room, to spend half an hour on the waterfalls. By spending half an hour on the waterfalls, I mean practising the double descending cadenzas in Chopin's Third Scherzo. It is perhaps the most superbly 'pianistic' piece of music ever written; to be able to play it properly must give to any pianist a sense of almost god-like power... a feeling of floating on wings over a sea of roses. I do not feel at all like that when I play it; I feel as if I were stumbling, with bare feet and with considerable pain, over the sharpest pebbles of Brighton beach. So, no doubt, do my listeners. But I have been practising it for nearly ten years, and I shall go on practising it, flat by flat and sharp by sharp and natural by natural, with an increasing hatred of the fourth finger of my left hand, which has Communist tendencies."},{"Title":"MERRY HALL","review":"Beverly Nichols, author of MERRY HALL says the love of gardening involves the love of art, the love of love, and the love of death. Following his experiences in WWII, Nichols retired to the English countryside to restore himself mentally, physically, and spiritually. He doesn't inform the reader directly of his background (I know this from having read some biographical material from other sources), but he had another life before he bought the house and grounds describes in his trilogy beginning with MERRY HALL. He was a journalist and writer, and during WWII he spent some time abroad in His Majesty's Service.To the unknowing, Nichols narrative may seem a bit too cheerful, frivolous, or shallow, but his book is intended to entertain the reader--this is gardening mind you not the aftermath of war. To the extent he able to do so, Nichols kept the events in the DAILY MAIL out of his gardening books. As a result, some readers today can mistakenly think him an English prig who had no concern for life outside his own back yard.MERRY HALL begins one afternoon when Nichols and his 'man' Gaskin stumble across a derelict Georgian manor house and it's grounds. Nichols is overcome with a desire to restore the house and rebuild the grounds. He has been living in London and until that fateful day was more or less settled, but now he wants to &quot;move beyond the Tudor world&quot; and into the world of the Georgian Manor House. He buys Merry Hall and thus begins his adventure.MERRY HALL was written about six years into the project. By that time Nichols had undertaken the restoration of the foul smelling pond just off the music room and won the support of the able Oldfield, the gardener who came with the house and grounds. The book is an interesting mixture of personal anectdote, observations about the various neighbors who have their own opinions of what Nichols ought to restore the house and grounds, insights into elements of garden design, practical advice about various bulbs, shrubs, garden ornaments such as urns and benches, and observations about greenhouses and cats."},{"Title":"MERRY HALL","review":"It's wonderful that Bev is at last being remembered for his timeless, hysterical stories. This particular book is best remembered by me for the holly hedge burning episode &amp; reminds me of many of my own champagne enhanced escapades! His books are appealing to anyone who remebers the forties in Britain, gardeners, house buyers &amp; general lovers of gentle observational comedy."},{"Title":"MERRY HALL","review":"I first read Merry Hall over 30 years ago, and having recently re-read it I was impressed by how much an impression it had made on me. Many a time I have unknowingly quoted from the work, thinking the quote apocryphal!You must read for yourself how to deal with an overgrown holly hedge, and how to plant hundreds of trees without buying them, and what berberis can do for you, and why you should cultivate periwinkle...I'm sure you'll be delighted with the finely drawn sketches of the real people populating the story: the characters of gardeners, society ladies, and men who work for the government in a clearly covert and somewhat sinister capacity. You'll enjoy the cats, the lilies, and how to create an English country garden from a neglected and ill directed site.The gentle humor reflects the gentler times before the horrors of World War 2 brought violence, destruction, and death into the hearts and homes of most of Britain.This book is a keeper!"},{"Title":"MERRY HALL","review":"I howled with laughter till I cried. It's a book worth it's weight in gold, or at the very least, in fertilizer. I'm ordering the remaining two books of this trilogy, plus anything else this author has written (be it a book or a shopping list)."},{"Title":"MERRY HALL","review":"Just as Trollope passed the literary torch to Angela Thirkell, so did E. F. Benson pass his to this good fellow! Mr. Nichols' trilogy about Merry Hall is so entertaining, even though at times he comes across as a bit &quot;twee&quot;. As you get to know him and his neighbors through the books, you come to realize that yes, some things are more important in your own blinkered surroundings than in the big wide world. I would recommend these books to anyone who loves gardening (on a grand scale), gossip, and the minutiae of life."},{"Title":"MERRY HALL","review":"My wife and I took turns reading this delightful book out loud to each other. Several passages made me laugh so hard I had tears in my eyes. I recommend it highly."},{"Title":"MERRY HALL","review":"The first volume of a trilogy about the author's time at Merry Hall, this book is more humorous garden writing than strict autobiography. We know (primarily from the dust jacket) that Beverley Nichols was a widely-travelled journalist and prolific author, but aside from the occasional mention that he needs to keep working (hard) to pay the (very high) bills, Nichols doesn't mention his life outside of Merry Hall or, more specifically, its garden.The book begins after WWII, when Mr. Nichols returns from \\"a job\\" in India to a ravaged London and develops an overwhelming urge to move to the country and get back to nature in the form of a hopefully large and preferably derelict garden that he can \\"rescue\\". After a daunting (and amusingly described) search he miraculously finds what he considers to be a dream property - a Georgian manor house on 5 acres of truly hideous landscaping.With wry wit Nichols tells the story of acquiring the property against the better judgement of friends, and of what is involved in making a run-down manor house habitable, and in dismantling, re-ordering and re-planting 5 acres of gardens. Along the way we meet Oldfield, the very talented but taciturn and somewhat difficult gardener; Gaskin, the long-standing and nearly superhuman manservant; Miss Emily and Our Rose, nosy and perpetually disapproving neighbors; and the beloved cats One and Four.Although avid gardeners will no doubt love this book as they mentally compare notes with the author, one need not have ever dirtied one's hands with compost to enjoy reading it. The narrative meanders like a leisurely stroll in the garden, and Mr. Nichols' faith in the therapeutic powers of gardening is reminiscent of that in The Secret Garden (Frances Hodgson Burnett). The author's fond and poetic descriptions of the various aspects of his garden, intermingled with his sharp social observations and dry British humor make this a thoroughly enjoyable read. I have already ordered the other two books in the trilogy.An additional note: this is a facsimile of the original 1951 edition; it contains lovely line drawings throughout, and is printed on the nicest paper I have encountered in a long time."},{"Title":"MERRY HALL","review":"Where have you been all my life, Beverley Nichols?I stumbled upon this indescribably charming book in a quest for entertaining reading, having seen glowing mention of the gardening series in the Bas Bleu catalog for several years. When I found a used copy for small dollars on Amazon, I decided to give it a try. What a delight. How worth the full price of new volumes.I'm not a gardener, although I do enjoy other's gardens and I especially enjoy reading about gardens and gardeners. I've delighted in Gladys Tabor for years and thought I would never find anyone to surpass her. Nichols does the job.His prose is glowing. His descriptions of plants and people awaken the imagination with flights of fancy. I find myself cheering him on in his quest for objets d'art and flowering fauna and thrill with him as he watches them grow and his garden develop.What a shame a talent like this had to die! But we all do, and Ms Gladys Tabor did, as well. Surely heaven is blooming expansively because of these two. I only hope they met over tea, shared some of their gardening experiences and went on to enthrall the Heavenly Host as they develop their heavenly gardens."},{"Title":"MERRY HALL","review":"Anglophiles will relish travelling back in time with Mr. Nichols as he relates the trials and tribulations in restoring the house house and gardens of Merry Hall.

A gardener's delight.Valerie Curtiss"},{"Title":"Contracts Cases and Materials","review":"This book came in a timely manner, got it just like a day after it said it would be arriving.

Williston is harder to read but will help you deal with the terminology you'll find in most of the cases you will be studying in law school and reading law. Williston is the IBMPC to Farnsworth's Apple Mac; Moore's Manual versus Wright's Federal Practice; Shakespeare versus Grisham. His logic and terminology is timeless and precise. Farnsworth is easy to read, covers the bases, deals with more modern problems, and is very popular. Let me put it this way. If you want to read Hadley v. Baxendale to find out what it says, read Williston. If you want to find out what the bar review courses say about it, read Farnsworth. This really isn't meant as a knock on Farnsworth. Precision can be a pain. But Williston, like Louis Loss, was one of the greatest writers in the history of American jurisprudence, is still quoted by the Supremes, and he probably always will be. Farnsworth gives it to you in a slicker, smoother, slightly less analytical manner. Williston gives you the exact topography. Farnsworth shows you in pictures."},{"Title":"Contracts Cases and Materials","review":"So you have K and you have the book you have to read for K. Well 1st I must say that this is a great K book.However, it strays into some IP (I think) space with the ProCD case. Thus, my K teacher skips a lot of cases not out of time concerns but for content. There are a lot of international cases which are more or less worthless in my class.

Farnsworth's book is legendary. The selection of cases hits all the right points from drunken farm sales, to conniving socialites, and a classic selection of King's Bench tales.Not only are the cases well selected, but the budding law student gets to read Farnsworth's wry commentary and always salient observations. The only downside is his inclusion of foreign contract law representing his love of travels around the world but this is a minor flaw.There is but one legend of Contract Case Books and his name is Farnsworth!"},{"Title":"Contracts Cases and Materials","review":"I am a 1L and this book is so littered with errors it has become a running joke in our class.

There are times when you can read the case multiple times and be completely lost and 30 seconds on Westlaw or even Wikipedia will explain everything. For example try pages 386-390.If you are contemplating buying this book, it is because you are a law student. Please go to your professor and tell him/her to prescribe a different book. I could not do this myself, because my professor is the leading (surviving) author of the book.This book is in its seventh edition and I'm told an eighth edition is on its way. I can't imagine what previous editions were like. The authors and the editorial board should really own up and take a fresh look at this book.P.S. Please note that most positive reviews of this book are actually positive reviews of the seller for shipping the book on time and etc."},{"Title":"Contracts Cases and Materials","review":"I agree with previous posters that the cases are well selected. That is possibly the only saving grace for this book. Of all my first year books, this is by far the worst. It's lack of organization and direction is confusing and unhelpful, especially to a first semester 1L.First, it approaches contracts from a somewhat backward and non-linear direction. Instead of discussing what a contract is and its various parts in an ordered manner, it essentially presents the concepts in a jumble (similar to a large bucket of Legos dumped on the floor) and expects you, a poor oblivious fool of a 1L, to put them all together without any direction. I understand it's law school, and that if you can't figure things out you probably shouldn't be in law school. But this takes unhelpful to an unnecessary level.Second, Farnsworth seems overly taken with the Restatement (2d) position. Perhaps that's because he was the reporter for it. He presses quite forcefully at times for its position, without giving due credit to alternative views or opposing positions.Finally, while I see the reason for having three levels of case discussion (principle cases, secondary cases, and cases discussed in the notes), it's net effect is unnecessary confusion. If it's important enough to discuss, give the case. If the concept is all that's important, put it in a note. The way most other successful casebooks do.Farnsworth may have been a great teacher. However that does not make him a good textbook writer. Other's I've talked to have agreed. Perhaps it does take a very special professor to make good use of this text. If that is the case, then the book is largely useless to the general 1L population."},{"Title":"Contracts Cases and Materials","review":"This book is organized in the worst possible manner.

Having said that if you're reading this review you probably are shopping for a law book because it is on a reading list for a class. When I purchased this book through Amazon, with the expedited 2 day shipping, it was still cheaper than other comparable law websites (lawbooks.com, barristerbooks.com etc). Having said that the book was the right edition and brand new for a price that was slightly less than what I would have paid at the bookstore (considering I was in NY and the law school was in MA that wouldn't have been prudent). So if you are wary of buying used; stressing day-in-day-out whether the seller is going to send the book or if they'll send the right edition or numerous other problems that may run through your mind when purchasing a used book from an anonymous source without even seeing the product, then buy this new edition.

It's a tale of courage, morals, and combatting inner demons. I would also not hesitate to call it a fable. It clearly shows how a single person can disrupt a perfect little domain. It tells the story of a family that has lived alone on an Aleutian island for years, and are perfect, until a stranger comes to the island. The plot is well-paced, there aren't many characters, but they are very well written. This book also presents the plot from every character's point of view, making it great to read. Each character has distinct problems, and I think their mishaps could easily be applied to everyday life. The symbolism is also applicable, the stranger in the book could easily symbolize modern life, and the family could represent all that is traditional. How these two concepts clash is very real, and makes a wonderful story as well."},{"Title":"The Life of Samuel Johnson (Part 1)","review":"Where would we be without Dr. Johnson?

What makes this study so interesting is how the importance of food manifested itself so differentially among these separate groups once in the United States based upon the histories of the country of origin.Being of Irish extraction I learned for the first time, definitively, why unlike my Italian, Jewish, and Latino friends no Irish \\"ethnic\\" foods (other than soda bread) were part of my background. And, it helped me to better understand the critical, but differing, importance of food in the Jewish and Italian cultures I grew up along side.Readers should be advised that this is a serious academic work, one which would be an appropriate college history text. Therefore, the introduction and summary chapters will seem dry and...\\"academic\\" to those seeking a purely recreational read.

The author repeats, and repeats, and repeats, and repeats, and repeats her ideas and observations. Perhaps she was trying to meet a minimum word limit ordained by her publisher but that consideration shouldn't elicit anyone's sympathy. The constant re-iteration of points (and the author's desert-dry \\"voice\\" that exacerbates the repetition with its monotonous tone) makes for such a frustrating reading experience that I could not go past the second chapter."},{"Title":"Genesis 1948; the first Arab-Israeli war","review":"Make no mistake, reading \\"Genesis 1948 - the First Arab-Israeli\\" is no small undertaking. The book's 830 pages (without the preface) consist of some 793 pages with the text and accompanying maps while the remaining pages consist of extensive notes, a bibliography of more than 500 sources and a large and comprehensive index. The book is simply put, an epic of modern history and I highly recommend it as such.The story is told in one of the best ways possible... from the vantage points of the participants. Much like the much-acclaimed best seller \\"O Jerusalem\\" by Larry Collins and Dominique Lapierre, Dan Kurzman. The author of \\"Genesis 1948,\\" conducted extensive research into the history of the 1948 War for Israeli Independence consulting over 500 books, newspapers, periodicals, pamphlets, diaries and documents (written in a number of languages including French, English, Arabic and Hebrew) in addition to conducting a large number of interviews with participants from every side in the war (Egyptians, British, Israelis, Transjordanians, Americans, UN personnel, etc.). He ranged from the Arab League Library in Cairo to Government Press Department Library in Tel Aviv. He took all that information and cobbled it together into a dramatic human-interest story full of facts and referenced detail.Some have called the work biased and &quot;home team&quot; coverage, but I strongly disagree since you can look up any of the author's facts and read them for yourself. Having said that, I do feel that the author had more sympathy for the Israeli side, but it's also clear that he had considerable sympathy for the poor Arab farmers (fellaheen) forced to fight a war in Israel in which most didn't believe. I have been reading the history of the modern Middle East for many years (from both the perspective of the Arabs and the Israelis) and I don't feel that the author left out significant details of the history especially considering the work was originally written in 1970 before the climactic 1973 Yom Kippur War. Contrary to other reviews, Kurzman has no problem talking about Jewish terrorism during the pre-1948 period and also heavily criticizes the Israeli side throughout the book. On a likewise note, Kurzman was lucky to make contacts and conduct research in the Arab world before the 1973 Yom Kippur War after which the Arab world largely closed up foreign access to Arab libraries, media sources and interview possibilities.------------------------Dan Kurzman wrote the following of his book (on page xi of the preface):\\"I have checked every fact to the extent possible, and discarded any questionable information that could not be verified. In the case of conflicting and irreconcilable accounts of events, I generally present them with all of their sources. Quotations and reflections are taken from diaries, memoirs, and other documentary material or from personal interviews. I rarely use dialogue, the accuracy of which has not been confirmed by at least two of the participants in the exchange. Thus the language is as authentic as any that might be used in an autobiography of the person quoted\\"\\"Using the techniques of the novelist and biographer, I have tried to bring the history alive. To a large degree, history, is the story of people; and this book describes their role in one of the most poignant and important stories of our time.\\"------------------------What really makes the book work is its' honest and endearing first-person perspectives of the participants of the 1948 War for Israeli Independence. It's hard to not to find some admiration and respect for people like Abdullah Tel of Transjordan, Sayed Taha of Egypt, the enigmatic David Ben Gurion of Israel, or even Gammal Nasser, future dictator of Egypt. Their stories are told making full use of their own biographies, diaries and such. Lesser-known figures also have their stories told and it was the stories of some of these \\"minor players\\" that really endeared \\"Genesis 1948\\" to me.I highly recommend this extensively referenced history of the 1948 War for Israeli Independence.Review by: Maximillian Ben Hanan"},{"Title":"Genesis 1948; the first Arab-Israeli war","review":"I have read and re-read this book many times.I always get new insights each time.

The authors prose moves from describing the key parts of Israel to a massive cast of characters who took part in the hostilities from weapons purchasers in California, to Trumans advisors, down to the soliders on the ground, Jewish and Arab, including the wives of many and the survivors of such key clashes as the Etsion bloc and the Haddassah convoy. Those reading about 1948 for the first time will be enthralled, veteran students of the 1948 war and Israeli history will find hundreds of new facts that one never knew existed. The authors sources are beyond reproach, ebing key individuals on both sides, and including such interesting personalities as Abdullah Tel to Mordechai Raaanan. The book does not read as a biased text, rather the author puts himself into the midnset of each actor so that one comes away with a deeper understanding then one finds in a dry historical commentary.This is a wonderful book, a good introduction to Israeli history, as well as a classic text and a needed addition to anyones book shelf who specializes or enjoys Israeli, middle east history. There is a story for everyone in this book, from Ben-Gurions planning sessions to the woman whose family, half arab, half Jewish, was divided by the war.Seth J. Frantzman"},{"Title":"Genesis 1948; the first Arab-Israeli war","review":"This is the story of an unusual war, between Arabs and Jews in the Levant in 1948. While the war lasted from November, 1947 until March, 1949, the bulk of it was from the first big Arab operation against the Jews on January 14, 1948 until the final significant Israeli action (shooting down five British planes that invaded Israeli airspace on January 7, 1949).One curious aspect of this war is that prior to it, no Jewish army had ever taken, occupied, and held an Arab Muslim city, town, or village in the Levant. Not in the entire 1300-year history of Islam. That's why many people were surprised to see the Jews actually fight, and there were comments about it that were absurdly insulting to both sides, such as \\"Man bites dog.\\" Kurzman explicitly makes the point that the fighting on both sides was quite amateurish.This history may explain the shock it caused when the Jews broke their 1300-year losing streak by taking and holding Deir Yassin, on April 9, 1948. Many Arabs would have considered that an unforgivable affront even had there been no Arab casualties. But it was even worse when over 100 Arabs died in the battle, including quite a few civilians. This helped spur exaggerations of what had occurred, and this in turn contributed to the decision of a huge number of Arabs, including 40,000 in Haifa, to flee their homes in the ensuing weeks.These are some of the reasons why a few history books about this war are very strange, making it appear as if only one side fought in the war. And it is why a comprehensive, detailed, well-referenced, and well-researched book such as this one is so valuable.There's an enormous amount of fascinating material in this book, but I was especially intrigued by one small portion which listed seven Arab arguments against permitting a Jewish state to exist in the region, as well as the Jewish replies. To me, this truly showed the extreme weakness of the Arab cause. I agreed with the Jews on a couple of the points and with the Arabs on none of them. Here are the seven Arab points and my assessment of them, so you can see for yourselves:1) The Balfour Declaration had no legal basis, broke British promises to the Arabs, and could be fulfilled without a Jewish state. In addition, no international organization had a right to define territorial rearrangements.I disagree. While the Balfour Declaration had no legal basis, the League of Nations version did. And while a Jewish home could exist without a state, the British 1939 White Paper had rendered that impossible. International organizations were not defining borders by recommending a state.2) The Arabs, a majority in the region, were entitled to do what they pleased.Even the majority needs to allow for minority rights. And the Jews were the majority in the partitioned area earmarked for the Jews, even before any Arabs fled. In addition, one reason the Jews were a minority in the region was that so many of them had been kept out of the Levant by force. A Jewish state would permit many of them to enter.3) The Jews were descendants of Khazars, not Hebrews.Most Jews were actually descendants of Hebrews, not Khazars. But even had no Jew been a descendant of a Hebrew, the question should have been whether the Jews had purchased their land honestly, with a sincere desire to live on it. And they had.4) The proposed partition boundaries were idiotic and would start a war.Yes, the recommended boundaries were idiotic. But they were not unfair to the Arabs. And the Arabs were the ones demanding a war, not the Jews.5) Jews ought not be permitted to intrude into land that belongs to Arabs.It doesn't belong to Arabs when they sell it to the Jews.6) The Jewish state and Arab state recommended in the partition would not be able to cooperate economically.That could be true, but so what?7) Zionism was artificial and European and would corrupt Arab culture and tradition.This takes the cake. Arab aggressors were complaining that it is a crime against nature to change the status quo. But the Arabs were changing the status quo by demanding to reduce Jewish rights. Besides, it can't always be a crime to change the status quo, or it would be a crime any time anyone was born, anywhere. Or died, or moved.This is an excellent work, and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Genesis 1948; the first Arab-Israeli war","review":"In this volume Dan Kurzman produces a comprehensive step-by-step, detailed account of Israel's 1948 War of Independence. Based on secret documents, and over 1000 interviews with participants, the study is scrupulously unbiased.If the Jewish side comes off better, it is because of the Jewish respect for life which any objective observer will attest to, as opposed to the disregard of life by the Arab powers that be.What is clearly and unavoidably revealed is the perfidious role of the British occupying forces who frequently arrested Jews they found with arms, but usually looked the other way when Arabs attacked Jews.What I cannot understand is how the author is critical of the policy of the Lehi (the so-called Stern group) to resist the ruthless British occupation and the British alliance with the Arabs to prevent the rebirth of the Jewish State, as well as the British atrocities against Jews in the Palestine Mandate. The Lehi only killed British soldiers after the British had hung Jewish activists and often handed Jews over to bloodthirsty Arab mobs.British deserters took part in the bloody Arab bombings of the Palestine Post and the Ben Yehuda Street terrorist attacks of 1947.After the war had started the British attempted to drive the Jews out of Jaffa, leading to a battle between British tanks and Jewish soldiers.The War of Independence was effectively a war by the fledgling state of Israel against 7 Arab armies AND Britain.The United Nations, while voting for partition, refused to actually enforce partition after the Arabs attacked the fledgling Jewish State, and only intervened after Israel was en route to victory, exactly shat would happen 20 years later during the Six Day War.Bevin had been determined that the Jews did not control the vast, desolate Negev, which he wanted for British bases.After Israel was actually winning the war, the British, who had done so much to stop partition, suddenly thundered that unless the original United Nations terms were enforced, the UN should lift the embargo on the Arabs, isolate Israel economically and even blockade her.Attlee and Bevin also put considerable pressure on Washington to act against Israel.The diplomatic struggle is also covered, including the attempts by the American State Department for President Truman to reverse his support of partition, and how the revised plans by count Bernadotte essentially amounted to the strangling of Israel.The book shows the reluctance of Transjordan to enter the war, but both Transjordan and Egypt were pushed into war with Israel by Britain.The massacre by the Arabs of Jewish women and children in Kfar Etzion is detailed, making it very strange how Deir Yassin is always cited by anti-Israel polemicists while Kfar Etzion is forgotten.It is quite astounding how the Arabs have been waging a war for decades to physically eliminate the Jewish presence in the Land of Israel, but continually howl about their own casualties.Those who truly want peace and human rights should pressure the Arabs (and Iran) to live and let live and oppose the leftist-supported and Islamic-led global agenda that demonizes and wants ultimately to remove the Jewish state from the Middle East.The book outlines the role of the key players in both the war and the diplomatic struggle such as David Ben-Gurion, Yigal Yadin, Yigal Allon, David Shaltiel, Count Bernadotte, Ralph Bunche, Clement Attlee, Harry Truman, Ernst Bevin, Mufti Haj amin Al-Husseini, King Abdullah, General Mohammed Neguib, Gamal Abdel Nasser. Abdullah Tel and Glubb Pasha.This book is an extremely objective and non-ideological study, and is particulalrly important to read as it was written in 1970, before events were distorted by Leftist propagandists to fit in with the revisionist agenda of reversing the events of the history of the conflict."},{"Title":"Genesis 1948; the first Arab-Israeli war","review":"Kurzman has written a historical treasure filled with details and personal experiences of the first Arab/Israeli war. Anyone who has an interest in the Middle East would be well advised to read it, reread it, and reread it again."},{"Title":"Genesis 1948; the first Arab-Israeli war","review":"In style and detail, this book is a good read. Its views are somewhat outdated now and Kurzman's suppression of the more unsavory side of the anti-civilian violence from the Zionist/ Israeli side now seems quaint. (Example: he refers in one place to a killing of Jewish workers as raising Arab fighting morale in Haifa, ignoring the fact that this had no effect on morale as it resulted from a worker riot following a random terror bombing of Arab workers by Jewish extermists and was followed by an unmentioned murderous retaliatory night raid by Jewish militia into a peaceful village.) Modern Israeli press accounts reveal that Kurzman deliberately downplayed the massacres of Arab civilians he discovered in his researches in the Israeli archives. This is &quot;home team&quot; coverage and ot an unbiased account. But for useful information and good storytelling, it passes muster. Just don't take it as the final word."},{"Title":"A Team of Two","review":"I really enjoyed this book. Kate Ross is a very strong character in this book. Hiram is a hoot!!!

Kitty Ernst CNM MPHI was thrilled to hear of and read this much needed book. Dr Strong, a perinatologist, had the courage to remind us that we as a nation are doing a shameful job in attending to the needs of our childbearing mothers and their unborn children. He begins with the disturbing data on babies born too soon and too small, and goes on in a thoughtful and scholarly way to explore the issue.It seems to be human nature that when we recognize a problem, we knuckle down, determined to keep doing what we have been doing but doing it in a &quot;better&quot; way. That is exactly the problem with our system of prenatal care... and its not working. Its time to look at how we can serve pregant women in a different and better way.As a practicing nurse-midwife, i have long believed that pregnancy and birth must be addressed not as a medical event, but as a &quot;mind-body-spirit&quot; event, occuring within a social context, and that the &quot;midwifery model&quot; rather than the &quot;medical model&quot; of care is the appropriate approach for low risk women. Dr Strong suppports this point of view as one of the solutions to the problems he identifies in the delivery of health care during pregnancy and birth.I would recommend this book to EVERY student and practitioner of maternal-child nursing, midwifery,or obstetrics. THose people working within public health and public policy will also find it enlightening. Parents to be who have chosen nurse-midiwfery care for their pregnancies will be pleased to see the scientific and philosophical support for their decision coming from an expert in &quot;high-risk obstetrics&quot;.If I ever return to teaching, it will be required reading for my students; i am circulating a copy among the obstetricians and nurse-midwives with whom I work. Enjoy!!!"},{"Title":"Expecting Trouble: What Expectant Parents Should Know about Prenatal Care in America","review":"Thomas H. Strong has written an excellent account of the inherent flaws of prenatal care in the United States, highlighting where Western medicine succeeds and where it fails. Looking critically at other health care systems around the world, he demonstrates how alternative health care for birth when delivered by midwives has higher success rates in preventing premature birth and various birth problems. If anything prevented me from giving this excellent work five stars, it was the fact that Dr. Strong, while praising health care systems like the Netherlands, decided not to address the fact that those same praiseworthy birth traditions are delivered by lay midwives, not the nurse-midwives found in other countries. While both lay (or direct-entry) midwives and nurse-midwives contribute important care to pregnant women, Dr. Strong failed to address the prejudices surrounding direct-entry midwifery in the United States despite its affordability and accessibility in remote areas.I think this is an important book for mothers to read, but be aware that it presents research and, while well-written, is not written in the accessible format of many books destined for the expectant parent. It would be an excellent book for anyone interested in the sociology or medical anthropology of birth and its inclusion in women's studies classes would enrich any curriculum."},{"Title":"Expecting Trouble: What Expectant Parents Should Know about Prenatal Care in America","review":"This book supports with facts, figures and irrefutable statistics that our current system of delivering care care to pregnant women is failing miserably. Despite increased expenditures and so called advances in medicine and medical management, Strong presents a strong case for an illnesss based system. It fails to adhere to the &quot;do no harm&quot; oath and is not a system of health care. Rather it causes it's own problems in illness care and then congratulates the system when tyhe outcome is at least mediocre at best and then only in spite of the system, not because of the system.It validated and expanded on what I have believed to be true for the past 25 years of my experience as an advanced nurse practitioner.Judith S.

Although Expecting Trouble is a death knell for prenatal care as we know it, the book was reassuring to me. It let me know that I needn't feel out of the loop in caring for my own baby- the doctor isn't the real authority in this case. Virtually all prenatal problems develop regardless of the mother's prenatal care, whether a birth defect occurs before a woman knows she is pregnant, or it is caused by genetics. It either happens or it doesn't happen. So many women look to their doctors as magical people who will diagnose and treat any potential problem. During pregnancy, this just simply isn't the case most of the time. I feel more at peace knowing that this is the type of situation that there simply is no way to control, beyond maintaining good health and avoiding known dangers. The majority of pregnancies are (medically) problem-free, and I will feel less stressed knowing that I will probably have one of them. And if something goes wrong, I will know that I couldn't control it.I highly recommend this book, along with The Nature of Birth and Breastfeeding, by Michel Odent."},{"Title":"Expecting Trouble: What Expectant Parents Should Know about Prenatal Care in America","review":"It's such a no brainer that prenatal care is really wonderful, helpful and good. Strong, second generation in the medical care of pregnant women, has a lot of reservations and a lot of data to back those reservations up. He also has some suggestions for how things could be improved: involve certified nurse midwives in prenatal care to avoid the temptation to complicate a normal pregnancy and birth, keep NICUs regional (so they don't turn in to profit centers, complicating life for normal newborns and their new parents). He'd like to believe that preconception care would help (by getting women help to stop smoking and so forth before they get pregnant), but he's sensible enough to recognize there are some hard limits on what the medical profession can do in the face of widespread social problems."},{"Title":"Expecting Trouble: What Expectant Parents Should Know about Prenatal Care in America","review":"This book was enlightening to say the least.

This book is a sequel to her earlier book,Hidden Dangers of the Rainbow: The New Age Movement and Our Coming Age of Barbarism.She wrote in the Introduction to this 1985 book, \\"Since my first book ... was published in 1983, my life has been anything but 'normal.' I probably have 35 feet of unopened mail gracing my office... I will forever be grateful to the unknown benefactor who sent me a voluminous packet on the Club of Rome, Planetary Citizens, and other New Age groups... Then there was a painful matter of the public criticism. I received it from two sources: from the ranks of the New Agers and from some within the Christian community. The first I anticipated. The second I also should have expected, but that did not ease its sting... I also faced the disillusionment of hearing people I formerly admired tell outright falsehoods. Two who are widely respected in the field of cults made frequent statements on their radio programs that they invited me on their programs and I refused the invitations. They had never done so... Seeing (the New Age Movement's) prophetic and historic implications in context makes me realize that we are fortunate to live in a time that all the Old Testament prophets would have loved to see... This sequel to 'The Hidden Dangers of the Rainbow' are about about those signs and 'Hidden Dangers' to which we must remain alert.\\"Here are some additional quotations from the book:\\"Earlier publications of New Age groups including the Lucis Trust and the Theosophical Society indicate there may be more than just mere ideological similarities between modern New Age Movement and Nazism. It could well be a continuation of the very same thing and Nazism could very well represent an early failure of 'The Plan.' A 1934 Theosophical publication, 'The Aryan Path' gives strong evidence for this...\\" (Pg. 85-86)\\"After (Ronald J.) Sider and his friends in the Christian media claimed he had been 'misunderstood,' Ron Sider prepared a revised and expanded edition of his InterVarsity publishedRich Christians in an Age of Hunger: Revised & Expanded. Theoretically he would have toned down any content that people felt could be construed as 'New Age.' Logically, he should have, because he knew there were those in agreement with my analysis of his work. This did not happen. Instead, the content of his 'revised and expanded' version was unmistakably New Age both as to tone and recommended sources.\\" (Pg. 112)\\"There has been absolutely no effort by the 700 Club to acquaint their vast viewing audience with the facts of the New Age Movement... 700 Club personnel have attempted to have programs cancelled exposing the New Age Movement on other Christian networks... (Pat) Robertson's language inThe Secret Kingdomis very close to common New Age usage...\\" (Pg. 168-169)"},{"Title":"BOHICA (Negation, Book 1)","review":"During CrossGen Comics' run NEGATION proved to be one of its most pivotal titles. (Sorry for the repetition, if you already know the following.) Most of CrossGen's comic books ran with a common theme, that of the sigil, a mark which granted great power to its bearer. Plenty of CrossGen comics featured at least one character with such a sigil, although the abilities conveyed did differ. No surprise that folks tended to call CrossGen Comics the Sigilverse. Sigilverse's mythos relied heavily on the legend of Atlantis (CRUX), the bickering gods of CrossGen (THE FIRST), and these seemingly omnipresent sigils. And then there's the Negation universe...Over time the vile Negation Empirium has expanded its martial conquest to consume much of its known universe. Ever seeking larger dominion, the Negation's god-emperor Charon hungrily eyes the Sigilverse. Preparatory to invasion, one hundred denizens, culled from disparate alien homeworlds in the Sigilverse, are abducted and taken to a prison planet in the Negation universe, there to be mercilessly tested and experimented on. Constant CrossGen readers will readily identify character types from various titles: an Atlantean (CRUX), a Saurian (SIGIL), a goddess (THE FIRST), a sorcerer (MYSTIC), and a number of sigil-bearers. Now this is a damn formidable bunch of captives, and it's good, common-sense strategy on the Negation army's part to suss out the strengths and weaknesses of that which they're about to invade. Amongst the kidnapped powerhouses a smattering of ordinary humans is peppered in, to serve as the control element to the experiment. One of these ordinary humans is Obregon Kaine, and he turns out to be the most dangerous of this lot.Not that you could tell it, at the start. Absent of extraordinary power, Obregon Kaine is initially treated with disdain by his fellow captives and even mockingly nicknamed \\"the Pest.\\" But Kaine perseveres and, gifted with a brilliant tactical mind and boasting vast military expertise, he soon shows his mettle. It's Kaine who comes up with a daring plan for the prisoners to break out of their maximum security facility. And it's Kaine who finds himself the de facto leader of the escapees. NEGATION tells of the many adventures of Kaine and his ragtag bunch as they roam the Negation spaceways, all the while trying to stay one step ahead of the Negation forces. NEGATION Vol. 1: BOHICA! collects the prequel and the first six issues of this series. I consider it a must get.NEGATION went for 27 strong issues until the CrossGen company capsized. What sucks tremendously is that CrossGen's going under coincided with the launching of THE NEGATION WAR mini-series, which was to be CrossGen's big company crossover event and which was supposed to unveil some big truths concerning the Sigilverse. As it is, only the first two issues of THE NEGATION WAR were released. For what it's worth NEGATION goes a ways into fleshing out the background of that mini-series. &iexcl;Qu&eacute; l&aacute;stima!NEGATION is an epic action-packed space opera, and never better than when Kaine and his crew are up against it. It was the only ongoing title set strictly in the Negation universe, and, as such, the readers were made privy to that \\"behind-enemy-lines\\" vibe. Kaine and compadres certainly fall within the god-emperor Charon's peripherals, but two memorable villains are introduced and they're the ones against whom Kaine would predominantly contend. High Castellan Komptin is the prison planet warden, and it says something about Kaine's no-nonsense prickliness that he almost immediately makes a personal enemy of the warden. NEGATION isn't known for its comedy, but one of the funnier moments surfaces when Kaine awaits the arrival of the fearsome Komptin... only to find the warden falling short of expectations. Still, Komptin would prove to be a first class schemer and a survivor, even though he does get fixated with corralling Kaine.Few are thought to be as mighty as the assembly of gods known as the First. But in the Negation universe the Lawbringers are deemed to be equally powerful, and Lawbringer Qztr is Charon's most favored elite enforcer. This guy, Qztr, is insanely dangerous and goes around clad in form fitting black leather, so I guess he's also freakylicious. In menacing appearance and power level, he's pretty up there as a Big Bad.Obviously Obregon Kaine is the central character, and he's a good one. Kaine has a mysterious past and he's very much the underdog in the superhuman powers department. But he gets by on his wits and his military background. It's an ensemble cast, though, and writer Tony Bedard keeps it interesting with Kaine's band of escapees who tend to bicker and back stab and try to one up each other. Kaine's precarious leadership is most often challenged by Evinlea, one of the First and, therefore, ridiculously powerful and haughty and condescending. But getting stuck in the Negation universe has done some hinky stuff to those with superhuman talents, rendering full control of these talents an iffy thing. This forces Evinlea to cooperate with Kaine and the others, but she doesn't have to like it.Running now thru Kaine's desperate little band: After Evinlea, there's a mechanical genius, a sorcerer from the MYSTIC world, a reptilian female scout, an Atlantean woman who believes all this is a dream, a constable who can leach off her opponents' strengths (although her opponents don't seem to feel the loss); a healer who thru direct contact can also regulate other people's powers (Evinlea pretty much bogarts him for her own use). Other than Kaine himself, three characters intrigue me. Komptin, who is just a fun character to read about, even though he's a bad guy. I also dig the indestructible baby whose true identity ties into a momentous revelation all across the CrossGen universe. And then there's the audacious dread pirate Drake whose sigil grants him one of the more abstract talents out there: it lends him any ability he needs to take whatever he wants, providing he knows his target's location. Some of these characters are wise, some are clueless, some are subversive, some (most?) are out for themselves. It makes for an uneasy recipe, and a constant migraine for Obregon Kaine.Writer Tony Bedard keeps things making sense, even though there's a lot of characters and the story moves along at a hectic clip. Again, it's a shame that NEGATION ended before its time because this title reeked of potential, and only some of it was met (I guess you could say the same for CrossGen Comics as a whole). Penciller Paul Pelletier keeps up with the breakneck pace and turns in some very decent stuff. In fact, this TPB also comes with a flattering fluff piece on Pelletier, one quote from which is \\"Pelletier's hyper-detailed pages can reduce grown inkers to tears.\\"Okay, what doesn't work for me is when the story takes a weird turn by introducing the Kremmin Continuum, which is intentionally reminiscent of Star Trek's United Federation of Planets, and its hapless captain an obvious wink to Captain Kirk. This attempt at referential humor not only falls flat but takes something away from the tautness and suspense of the story. And that's really my only gripe.And for those wondering just what the hell \\"Bohica!\\" means, \\"Bohica!\\" being that expletive Kaine is always saying, well, it's an acronym along the lines of FUBAR. When Kaine finally explained what it stood for, my first reaction was \\"That's perfect!\\" And, in the Negation universe, it's very apropos and should be frequently uttered."},{"Title":"BOHICA (Negation, Book 1)","review":"Tony Bedard returns to comics in this all new monthly. The artwork is stunning and the story is solid as well. Several hundred beings from the Crossgen Universe are abducted by the Negation Empire. One character, Obregon Kaine, assumes the role of leader and uses his smarts to help himself and others escape but they are constantly on the run from the empire and must use their wits and powers to constantly elude them. The dialogue is wonderful and the part where the Kremmin appear is hysterical.

For fans like myself, who enjoy solving the puzzle, this book and Crux are absolutely essential. All of the diverse elements and intriguing potentials of the universe come together in these books. \\"The Negation\\" is about a band of characters from the CrossGen universe -- some from worlds we have visited in the other titles, others we have not -- who are abducted by the Negation and brought to their own universe for experimentation. A few of them break out and begin themselves to piece together the mysteries CrossGen readers have pondered since the company debuted -- What are the Negation? What do they want? What is the secret of the sigils?This is a book for any comic fan who digs science fiction, fantasy, mystery, military-style action or superheroics.

I leave it to the reader to substantiate what I have said concerning this book.

Krein gives you a basic overview of how every major controller works, so you know in what chapter to look for the answer in a more specific text.Krein is also not a control design book, what it will do is give an introduction to control useful to someone new to the subject, and allow you to approach a controls textbook able to relate the general concepts to power supplies.2. Mohan, Undeland and Robbins by and large gives more depth and Krein cites it frequently. It too is an extremely useful text, and fills in some of the gaps in Krein. I wouldn't recommend starting with it if you have no background in the subject as Krein gives overall a clearer presentation.3. Kassakian is the most math-heavy, as it was written for an MIT graduate class. I use it the least, though it has the advantage of being very affordably priced. Krein also cites it regularly. Kassakian goes into more detail on control design.In short all of these texts have a lot to recommend them, all of them cover a lot of the same material, and all three do it differently. I found Krein by far the most readable of the bunch."},{"Title":"Elements of Power Electronics (Oxford Series in Electrical and Computer Engineering)","review":"I was not impressed with this book. It seems that the author was going for breadth but in his attempt neglected to go into the detail necessary for someone unfamiliar with power electronics.

I have a BS in EE and wanted to learn more about switching power supply design. This book is useless. Instead of explaining the general operation of boost and buck converters with english words, Krein uses these convoluted switching matrices. It's like the following: here's a circuit, and here's its switching matrix, on to the next cicuit. Not insightful in the least bit. He should spend more time explaining with English words what is going on in a circuit instead of just throwing a uninsighful matrix at you.

That is the question raised once you hear about &quot;Hole in the Sun,&quot; one of talented artist Viggo Mortensen's many books. Yes, it's photos. Of a swimming pool. And Mortensen's exceptional photographic skill makes it all come alive.Mortensen displays different abstract photographs -- some color, and some black and white only -- in a sort of visual silence. At first he shows the quiet pool, undisturbed and photographed from many angles, even the reflections in the increasingly murky water. Then the pool is abandoned, and the wear and tear on it is revealed.It's a surprisingly poignant book. There's no poetry, not much but the pictures. And without anything to distract the reader, Mortensen shows us the many facets of the pool. As it deteriorates, his pictures become sadder and lonelier-feeling, like watching a beautiful old statue falling into disrepair.And Mortensen proves that yes, just about anything can be made interesting in the hands of a skilled photographer. He captures the eerie quality of cacti reflected in blue, and a little white butterfly drowned in the water. Some -- like the stark &quot;Blue 17,&quot; are so abstract that you can't tell what they are. His color photographs are startlingly vivid, so that readers can even see the splotches of green on the pool walls.Painter/poet/actor/photographer Viggo Mortensen again proves his skill with a camera, in a book that shows that anything can make a good photo. Beautiful and skillful."},{"Title":"Hole In The Sun","review":"Nice photographs of what life exists around that we take for granted...the lines, the shapes, the colors, and more.

Powerless religion says that \\"miracles aren't for today\\" and basically that everything but not going to hell \\"passed away with the apostles\\". Powerless religion blames God for sickness, problems, and calamity. Powerless religion always accuses God's true servants of being \\"of the devil\\". Powerless religion specializes in behavior modification and condemnation. Powerless religion causes people to judge others rather than themselves.Powerless religion comes up with terms like tongue-talkers\\" and \\"demon tongues\\", instead of realizing that God's Word says praying in other tongues magnifies God and builds us up on our most holy faith.Only a highly \\"educated\\" cemetery student would enjoy a book like this one.

There is no other way to explain the mountains of irrelevant information and lack of basic information.The book purports to guide you to \\"official\\" information. It lists a few websites like NORD and UBPN. It points you at NIH websites like PubMed.gov -- while showing examples of mostly irrelevant search engine hits. Those are the good points. Other tips are generic, such as to try the AMA and other directories to find a specialist.The samples of \\"official\\" information in the form of article citations and multimedia are nearly random and irrelevant to a patient. I have since read many \\"official\\" (i.e. journal articles) sources, following the trail of footnotes. I can't believe how unlike the real thing this book's samples are.The only content specifically about brachial plexus injuries is a statement from NIH which is infuriating to anyone who is dealing with this injury.The glossary is terrible. It defines \\"ankle\\" but no arm anatomy--in a book about brachial plexus injuries! Perhaps the authors have heard of the ulna, radius, and humerus? The book promises to define \\"unfamiliar terms\\" and gives you neurology, but not neuropathy; membrane, but not neuroma; etc. You want to laugh but you can't because you are suffering too much.Half of the book is filled with detailed but totally generic information on: medications, alternative medicine, nutrition, and insurance.Enough. A real guide to self-directed research would provide you with a conceptual framework, surveying the major areas of research and giving examples of worthwhile reading. It might even, dare I say, arm you with insightful criticism.In the end, I could not laugh at the awful train wreck this book is. I laughed only when a search on \\"brachial plexus injuries\\" on Pubmed Central returned \\"Injuries suffered by dogs from riding in the back of open pickup trucks\\". More than half of the content in this book is like that."},{"Title":"Performance : Creating the Performance-Driven Organization","review":"...from the CEO of yet another \\"Toxic Company\\".I bought this book from another bookseller as a closeout clearance book (for less than five dollars), and I think I paid too much!!Overall the book's writing stlye is disjointed, as if it was made up of a collection of other articles and websites, rather written as a book.As for the content: I'll borrow what another reviewer had to say, it's the obvious and the wrong. If you know anything about business, you don't need this book, because most of it is common knowledge. The rest of it is just plain wrong!You'd be better off readingStorey's Guide to Raising Pigs: Care/Facilities/Management/Breed Selection."},{"Title":"Performance : Creating the Performance-Driven Organization","review":"The only information in this book is the 'obvious' and the 'wrong'. For instance the author's insistence on his framework for performance (align, measure, reward, report, analyze):ALIGN: Kinda, obvious isn't it. There's no point in having duplicate departments or wasted efforts. Most businesses have gotten this problem solved at the Business Plan level.MEASURE: Dead wrong. There's no quicker way to kill morale than micromanaging employees down to the level of how long it takes them to answer the phone. Besides why are you wasting money employing people to \\"measure\\" your other employees?REWARD: \\"Pay for Performance\\"- Perhaps the worst idea in American Business since \\"New COKE\\". Good employees won't be motivated by extra money (sure they'll like it, but they'd do a good job without it). So the only thing this does is create a whole new crop of mercenary employees.REPORT: Because how else can you justify all that money you wasted on MEASURING. Besides nothing builds a team like telling them how they are different from their co-workers, right? WRONG!ANALYZE: Because those mercenary employees are really only interested in the money, so you have to tell them what the report means!!This book is bad ideas followed by worse ideas. Who edited this thing anyways??"},{"Title":"Performance : Creating the Performance-Driven Organization","review":"So I ended up with this book because of work, and while I'm reading it I keep thinking 'Where have I heard about this before??'. Then it hits me: ENRON!! They used this same system of incentives, reviews, and bonuses as what is detailed in this book. The end result for Enron was it destroyed the company.So, I definately disagree with a lot of what's in this book, but the bigger problem is what ISN'T in the book - namely the costs. Any plan has costs and benefits and in the end you have the weigh those costs and benefits to decide if you want to use the plan. But, Stiffler treats his \\"Action Plans\\" as if there are no real costs. It's typical salespitch clap-trap. What about employee turnover (a major expense for almost any business), or damage to employee morale and teamwork (difficult to quantify but very important to most businesses)?I'd have to say that the cost of this kind of \\"Performance\\" is way too high for the very small benefits it might offer."},{"Title":"Performance : Creating the Performance-Driven Organization","review":"I work in the HR department of a company that tried this type of system, and I can tell you from personal experience that it is a lousy idea. We eventually scrapped the entire thing and went back to a traditional pay/evaluation system.The 360 reviews were a disaster, we had to review each of the evaluations to screen out who was being honest and who wasn't (and you never really know for sure, I'm certain that we threw out perfectly accurate reviews in favor of dishonest ones that said what management wanted to believe).Many of our best employees quit because they felt like they couldn't keep up with younger employees who were willing to work long hours in order to get the bonuses. Then when the economy slowed down and we didn't pay bonuses, those people quit, and we were left with inexperienced workers who were totally overloaded.Finally when we scrapped the \\"Performance Management Culture\\" we had to pay big signing bonuses to get some of our old employees (who really knew what they were doing) to come back.My boss got this book because he thought that it would have some new or different ideas in it, but it's just the same old stuff. We aren't gonna make that mistake again!!If you care about your company, don't use this book as anything other than a doorstop.

Many contradict each other and the core premise of being able to prduce performance through motivation by tangible incentivization seems to run counter to most modern management thinking and current studies on behavioural patterns.

This line of thinking not only benefits the company so that it will be successful in driving revenue, but it is also effective in creating a motivating environment for employees. Employee morale is often linked to job satisfaction, and without a clear idea of how as an employee, you can contribute to the success of your organization, you will be unable to achieve your goals.There is a lot of valuable information as well as useful charts contained within this text.

The author clearly and articulately presents a framework for how to think about improving the performance of an organization and its people. Chapter 1 clarified and simplified for me what all the different performance management acronymns mean and Chapter 2 explained why there are so many different perspectives on performance management. The real meat of the book begins in Chapter 3 when the author lays out his framework, with each of the five sections that follow explaining why and how a company should align, measure, reward, report, and analyze performance of both the organization and the workforce. In these chapters, the author uses examples from his experience building his own company and from his experience working mainly with larger companies to illustrate the concepts, which helped me relate the concepts to my own business. I found the most useful chapter to be the one on creating an action plan because it made the concepts so easily applicable."},{"Title":"Performance : Creating the Performance-Driven Organization","review":"There's a lot of talk going on about \\"Performance Management\\" but nobody seems to really know what it means (or everybody thinks they know what it means but no two opinions are alike).

This book helps to use some free yet fully functional UNIX tools that help to achieve that goal. Those of us who have been system and network administrators for a long time are always looking for ways to make our jobs easier. The problem is that efficient solutions almost always cost money. Just ask the stubbornly (and foolishly) Microsoft-centric shops about that!This book covers a good amount of information regarding network methodologies like SNMP. But since the primary purpose of this book is dedicated to open source tools, the majority of the book focuses on those specific tools that the author thinks will be of value.Overall, this is a good book. Having a single point of reference for free utilities is always a good thing. Not only does the book cover some genuinely useful tools - there's a caveat on that later, though - but it also lists where to get the software and gives instructions on how to compile each package. For someone who is new to UNIX and doesn't really feel comfortable with the idea of compiling software, this book will help to alleviate those fears.There are some things with this book, however, that don't make it the open source panacea that network administrators might be looking for.The book assumes that IT shops have Cisco hardware. Whereas there is no doubt that Cisco is the current big boy, the technology market has proven time and time again that those at the top often do not stay there. Since there is no guarantee that competitors will be Cisco-compatible or will have the same functions, many of the tools in this book that rely on Cisco routers will most likely be incompatible with those environments. In some cases this means that entire chapters in this book might be useless.There is also an entire chapter dedicated to basic network functions, like telnet, ping, and traceroute. I have been working with Solaris for over seven years. I currently am in a position where I have to deal with AIX and SCO. In some cases the operating system revisions are several years old. With that in mind, I have yet to run into a version of UNIX that doesn't already have these commands available right from the operating system.The chapter on system automation and notification is very cramped. In a single chapter, the author attempts to cover shell scripting, Perl scripting, sendmail, and even text manipulation via sed and awk-like syntax in Perl. That one chapter alone will be a serious cause of brain explosion for someone who has never worked with these tools before. I have taught each of these topics (sans Perl) in my highly-regarded Solaris administration course, and I can tell you that each of these topics requires its own chapter. Compressing all of these topics into one chapter is like compressing &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;, &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, and &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; plus its appendix to a single 100-page book.Additionally, there are a number of other, very popular open source network tools that are conspicuously left out of this book. The most glaring omission that I noticed is Ethereal, a very popular GNU-licensed network analyzer. I'm sure that other administrators will be able to mention other tools that have been left out.The most discouraging thing about this book is that it carries what I consider to be a hefty price tag ($44.99 MSRP) for a book that is less than 250 pages long. In addition, this book is a compilation of information that is already available for free on the Internet and can be found without very extensive searching. Overall, this is still a respectable book. It's a good collection of open source network administration tools (albeit only a relative few). But if you aren't a Cisco shop you might find about one-fourth of the book to be useless, and if you are already an experienced UNIX admin some of the other chapters will be of no additional benefit.Given its potentially limited amount of usefulness based on your environment, I can't really suggest this book unless you are in a Cisco shop and are relatively new to the UNIX world - not because the information isn't valuable, but because the price tag doesn't necessarily justify its value even though the book itself is rather solid."},{"Title":"Open Source Network Administration (Prentice Hall Series in Computer Networking and Distributed Systems)","review":"Open source is the wave of the future, and James Kretchmar's &quot;Open Source Network Administration&quot; (OSNA) catches that wave in fine form. Although the book is only 238 pages, it contains several gems. I read the book specifically for its coverage of the Multi Router Traffic Grapher (MRTG), OSU's Flow Tools, and Sysmon. By following Kretchmar's instructions, I easily installed these three applications.I was able to accomplish these tasks because OSNA is a &quot;cross platform&quot; book. The author doesn't limit himself to discussing how to run the tool. He gives guidance on how to configure Cisco routers to export NetFlow records or enable SNMP reporting. Sometimes these simple steps are buried in Cisco's Web site, so I appreciated getting straight to business. I literally had these tools running in a matter of minutes thanks to Kretchmar's instructions and the FreeBSD package system (e.g. &quot;pkg_add -r &lt;package&gt;&quot;).On the down side I thought coverage of old stand-bys like tcpdump, traceroute, and netstat was unnecessary. I would have liked reading about more &quot;niche&quot; tools like MTR. If you like this book, keep an eye out for my &quot;Tao of Network Security Monitoring&quot; in the summer. I'll take a similar approach in several chapters by discussing security-related network monitoring tools."},{"Title":"Open Source Network Administration (Prentice Hall Series in Computer Networking and Distributed Systems)","review":"This book explains in detail, various open source programs used fornetwork administration.The author uses Solaris syntax for the majority of the examples ofinstallation, configuration and use of the programs.The book is arranged in 10 chapters covering the following subjects:1.

Custom ToolsI really liked the way the author methodically described all of the major&quot;W's&quot;. Who What When Why and Where. He gives a brief background on eachprogram, and tells you what is typically used for. The When/Why/Where isanswered as well, and the amount of detail is more than just a beginnermay need but not too much as to bore or confuse the reader.In each section, similar, alternative tools to the main one described arelisted at the end of each chapter to compare and contrast the strengthsand weaknesses of the tools.The author does a great job of referencing specific websites and RFC's toobtain all the tools listed. Regular expressions, shell scripting andPerl is touched on as well.If you're looking for an introduction to network administration tools,this is the book to get.A suggestion I'd have for a 2nd edition edit would be:Flesh out the section on the uses for MRTG(other than tracking bandwidth)as well as database options such as RRD, and do the same for the NAGIOSdescription."},{"Title":"Open Source Network Administration (Prentice Hall Series in Computer Networking and Distributed Systems)","review":"In this book, Kretchmar imparts a large amount of his experience at MIT in over 200 quick-reading, no nonsense pages. He tells you what a tool can do, how to get it and build it and provides examples of some typical uses. While beginning network administrators will feel comforted that he takes enough time to explain the tools he talks about, experienced ones can safely jump right to his equally well explained configuration examples without missing anything crucial.This book read so quickly and was so straightforward that it really inspired me to fix up some areas of my network monitoring that I knew were lacking but wouldn't be bothered to fix. While it's no bible, this book provides a great start on quite a few great tools - many of which I plan to investigate soon.The cover price of $44.99 strikes me as a bit high for this book - I'm glad to see Amazon take it down a bit. Also, if you don't already have it, any sysadmin should make sure to buy The Unix System Administration Handbook, too.

Kretchmar is efficient with his usage of words which makes for a nice light book, that tends to be a bit of dry reading. Not to say that the material covered isn't valuable, but the author wastes no ink nor paper on extra words for the sake of color or interest. While the first chapter goes into a down to basics approach that any beginner or management type could fathom, including one of the best descriptions of, and arguments for Open Source that I have come accross in a book, he quickly dives into the meat of the matter in Chapter 2. To put it shortly, his descriptions, and examples were, well, too short in many areas, and just right in many more.Kretchmar's use of first hand experience examples in a mission critical environment, and occasional discussions of real world applications are the gold nuggets that this book has to offer. Prescious and useful. I would ask for the next book on Open Source subjects that the author writes, that he include more real world examples to illustrate how an administrator might make use of, or protect from the subject matter at hand.If I had to rate this book on a 1 - 10 scale, I would give it a 7, only for the brevity. I would highly reccomend that users working with Open Source Network Administration tools get this book, and use it in conjunction with more detailed texts on the specific software or protocols you are interested in. Then take some time and do the reading, this isn't exactly light stuff to read on a Sunday afternoon.David B. HostetlerPresident.

Given my experience, I found this book to be fairly helpful. All of the utilities it covers are, as the name suggests, open source and can be obtained for free. On first blush, you might be tempted to look past such a book since you can learn how to use these utilities by reading the man pages or various FAQs and tutorials on the web. However, this won't help you if you don't know what tools are available to help you solve various problems.Open Source Network Administration covers SNMP, MRTG, NEO, Netflow, Oak, Service Monitoring with Sysmon and Nagios, TCPDump and basic services such as Ping and Traceroute. Each chapter has a section on what the utility can help you do, how to install it, how to use it and how to maintain it. This organization makes the book straightforward and helpful.If you're an experienced netadmin, this book is not for you. If you're completely new to networking, some sections might be a little dry and hard to get through, like SNMP, but nothing that is insurmountable. If you're somewhere in between like I am, I think you'll find this book useful.My only real beef with this book is the price. Suggested retail of $44.99 is way overpriced but I have heard of finding it at discount book sellers for $20 or $25, which seems quite reasonable."},{"Title":"Open Source Network Administration (Prentice Hall Series in Computer Networking and Distributed Systems)","review":"I am not a Network Administrator, and I took an interest in this book simply to learn the basic tools used to build and maintain an open source network. In my position there were a number of chapters that particularly stood out for meChapter 1: Introduction. I felt this was a very well-written and easy to understand introduction to the world of Open Source network administration. It goes through the basic reasons to use Open Source, answers many of the question that many people only familiar with closed-source software may have, including questions of quality and security, as well as smart reasons to use open source software.Chapter 9: Basic Tools. Need to know what a ping is, how it works, and why it's important? This book takes he time and effort to carefully explain how basic things such as ping. It explores telnet, netcat, traceroute, MTR, and netstat. It's a great chapter for reviewing these basics and exploring what you require.Chapter 10: Custom Tools. This chapter gets into explaining the basics of bash scripting, bash itself, basic Perl scripts and what they are commonly used for, and how to use cron. Again, these are basics, but vital to anyone looking for basic knowledge of the environment.The chapters in between cover subjects suh as SNMP, MRTG, Oak, and Tcpdump, all great tooks in network administration. The author gives detailed explainations of all these tools, how to use them, how to set them up, and offers tests and examples of them in action.I would recommend these to anyone who is new to putting together an open source network. The instructions and descriptions of all the tools are at a level that I feel most moderately computer-literate people can follow."},{"Title":"Time Wars: The Primary Conflict in Human History (A Touchstone book)","review":"I'm not quite sure what I think of Jeremy Rifkin's Time Wars except that I know it makes me think. I just don't know if he's right, but it doesn't really matter.What Rifkin tells us is that there is a war developing or even already going on, between the advocates of speed and efficiency--almost speed for the sake of speed--and those who prefer, as he puts it, a &quot;more empathetic union with the rhythm of nature.&quot; In that latter category he puts many members of the environmental , holistic health, biological agriculture, animal-rights, economic democracy and other movements, who may just think that they're a little bit lefty, not engaged in a struggle for our souls.Rifkin outlines a history of time, as it were, or more specifically, a history of how people have viewed time. He analyzes different cultures' views of time, which are considerably different, the sense that humans can have power over time, which has not been the belief of all cultures in the past, and the rise to domination of Western views of time (along with pretty much everything else, at least right now).If you are white and ever been immersed in black or other minority culture, you may hear references to &quot;CP time&quot; or &quot;Indian time&quot;. This has often said as a joke but refers to the very different sense of the importance of time and punctuality. It's a smart observation, really, that points out that not everyone is driven by the need to meet a deadline, arrive precisely when expected, operate in a way that those of us in the West feel is the right way. And it's at the heart of what Rifkin is saying about our attempts to capture and define time.Though the book is written in a very clear style, this is not a book to be read while watching TV or while otherwise distracted. There are Big Thoughts here about who we are as a society and how humans will view their responsibilities, the concept of progress, the Information Age and more, now and in the future."},{"Title":"Time Wars: The Primary Conflict in Human History (A Touchstone book)","review":"Rifkin explains why people feel alienated from nature based on changing perceptions of time over the course of human history. From nature time, to clock time, and now to computer time. Relevant to how people respond (at work, for example) to highly-planned and highly-scheduled work. Good historical explanation of how we got to where we are today, and what the consequences are. Not so good in the last chapter about how to go about fixing it. Predictions about artificial intelligence in computers taking over didn't really come true. But still interesting reading.For a different, perhaps complementary, view, read Ishmael by Daniel Quinn."},{"Title":"Illinois!

She gets a civil servant job with the Australian Labor Relations Service Department Industries Branch whose unpopular director Rae Evans was a friend of her deceased mother.However, her peers except for the zany Ivan Semyonov make it evident they do not want her here; each fears for their job with the government changing parties as this branch is probably going out of existence. Canberra Times reporter Gail Tremboth calls Sandra as they were college cronies to ask about Rae. An email the paper received insists that Rae embezzled $900K by adding a zero to a grant check and has committed computer fraud. Sandra, remembering her mother's motto of loyalty to friends, believes her boss is innocent and tries to prove she is right with only Ivan helping her as everyone else in the office wants Sandra to take the fall even if she proves to be innocent.THE TROJAN DOG is a terrific Australian amateur sleuth starring a delightful protagonist, a fabulous support cast who makes the office seem real, and a fantastic look at Canberra. Though Sandra feels the world caving in on her with her spouse overseas, her son struggling with school, and her new job probably ending when the government switches leadership, she believes strongly in doing what she perceives is the right thing by not just standing loyally with Rae, but actively proving she did not commit the crimes.

Still, Chris Nickson provides extra substantial information for everyone interested in the young artist.

Sometimes lyrical and poetic, sometimes harsh and unstintingly realistic, the play captures the vitality and turbulence of life-and love-in the barrio and the dynamic intermingling of the old and the new that characterizes it. \\"What makes this more than another genre picture of an ethnic lowlife is Sanchez-Scott's poetic sensitivity, which comes out in her fully-rounded and sympathetic treatment of her characters as much as in her language.\\" -Village Voice. \\"...a wistful study of adolescent yearning...Ms. Sanchez-Scott has a theatrical flair and a lyrical command of language...\\" -NY Times.THE STORY: Working on a project for his high school science class, Junior Rodrigues scans the night sky with his telescope, searching for comets and shooting stars, while his shy teenage neighbor, Olivia Pena, stands dutifully by, hoping that he will take notice of her. Meanwhile Junior's sister, Lilly, Olivia's classmate, wrestling with the sudden, sobering realization that she is pregnant, wonders how she will tell their harassed, overworked mother. Shielded from the harsh reality of the streets by her overprotective, old world grandparents, Olivia is as hopeful and nave as Lilly is brassy and disenchanted, but when Lilly goes into premature labor it is to Olivia she turns for help and forebearance. And, as the action of the play moves toward its affecting conclusion, it is punctuated and commented on by the street vendor, a seller of magic potions and charms who acts as a link between the old ways and the new, and whose presence edges the play towards a mystical level as those involved seek his help in finding a higher meaning in the stark, earthly events that confront them."},{"Title":"Stalking the Wild Resnick","review":"Being a Resnik fan, I take pride in my specially numbered edition!

For instance, Isaac is a \\"type\\" (foreshadowing) of Jesus and Abraham is a \\"type\\" of the Father -- in that he was going to sacrifice his son. When water appears in the Bible, it represents death and spiritual rebirth (such as the parting of the Red Sea or the crossing of the Jordan). The book is divided up into categories such as \\"The Earth\\" (Land, soil, moutains, stones, earthen vessels) or \\"Substances and Colors\\" (Blood, bread, honey, incense, metals, the rainbow, blue, gold, purple), or \\"Creatures\\" (The beast, birds, dogs, donkeys, fish, horses) and so on.In my opinion, this book is designed for someone with at least passing knowledge of the Bible, both Old and New Testaments.Although the examples in my review are from the Old Testament, the author includes real Biblical examples from the entire Book to support his claims -- sometimes with a direct quotation and sometimes with a simple citation of chapter and verse.

If that was going to be the result of his presence, he could just as easily have died years ago and the reader could have done without the ridiculous macho rantings. I suggest that parents read the book; if my concern doesn't bother you, at least you'll know.Case, his sister Lily and their mother have moved away from their home after Mr Hill's trial and conviction for robbery. His father calls every Sunday, an event that each member of the family responds to differently. Case has other, more immediate problems. He's starting sixth grade in a new school and not making friends very easily. Ms. Yardley, his English teacher, assigns the class a project - they're going to collaborate on a class newspaper. Case decides to create a comic strip called Dog Years, inspired by Lily, lettered by his only friend, Ned. When the most popular boy in the class starts to notice him, Case makes some terrible choices, hurting people and losing friendships. Downstairs from the Hills, there is Buddy Haynes, a friend of the family who helps Case see where he's gone wrong and get back on the right track.The story of doing the right thing, of being honest, is nice. Mr Hill seems to exist for only one reason: to serve the author's \\"concern for the families of prisoners\\" (mentioned on the jacket). The story is simply mediocre, with a few funny moments and a nice message. It's not a terrible thing, it's just a little above average and dragged down by the superfluous Mr Hill.- AnnaLovesBooks"},{"Title":"Dog Years","review":"Dog Years is a very fascinating book about life in the sixth grade. It portrays the life of young Case, a boy who has just moved to a new school, and to top it off, has a dad in jail. Personally, I wouldn't know how to cope with this, but Case decides to make a comic to express his feelings. The comic, titled &quot;Dog Years&quot;, is really a hilarious twist to his school life , featuring himself and his friends as cartoon dogs. I loved reading them! In the end, these comics turn out to be insanely popular, but get him into trouble. Even though I won't give away the ending, I'll tell you that IT IS GREAT!All in all, this book was extremely good, but was too short.

In it, Cherry and her entire class from nursing school join the army to serve during World War II. We see them go through basic training and serve in military hospitals in the United States and Panama. Combat comes in a later book. Some reviewers have suggested that this series is dated, but World War II was dated. It occurred during the 1940's and this book tells how things were then.

The book makes me sad because it references relationships where the step mother and mother are doing things together with their \\"duaghter\\" and I really don't think the two mothers will ever be mature enough for that type of relationship...and I know that would mean the world to their daughters. But the inspiration and the thought that this one day would be possible gives me hope in a situation that sometimes hope takes a back seat in.

I have been a step-parent for 30 years. The rosy, lovey descriptions in this book are in no way accurate in my own circumstances and many others I know that are step-parents. It does not truly address the step-mother that is raising her step-daughter right along side her own daughter of same age. Fathers do get custody. Bio-mothers do abandon their children. Step-mothers do have to discipline their step-children. There are many absolutely horrendous times with screaming fits and defiance. There seems to come a time when the step-child marries and has her own family that things improve and the step-mother is appreciated. But don't let your guard down, abandonment and divorce issues never go away completely. They still have issues as adults and who do you think they blame ~ dad and step-mother. I would not recommend this book."},{"Title":"Stepmothers and Stepdaughters","review":"This book was okay, but a little confusing. The book caught my attention in the beginning by the author's explanation of her own relationship with her stepmother. The author used a number of stepmothers and stepdaughters for examples; however, she did not organize her story subjects as well as she could have. There were so many stories and names given, that eventually I couldn't distinguish who was who and who did what in their personal sagas. I gave the author the benefit of the doubt and finished the book, but I did not learn much from it. I would like to remind you that the author's motivation to write the book was partially based on the fact that her own stepmother is an author and encouraged her to write it. My recommendation to the author is: don't quit your day job."},{"Title":"Curious Facts","review":"This book has everything for those who love useless facts!

I would not sell it for 500 $ American dollars!!! This an awesome book of the techniques of motor racing, technical and sportlike! And then, it goes a lot further than that... It gives us stunning Grand prix pictures of Senna and F1 in general. For the pics alone it is easily worth it. It also gives a great a fantastic scholarly and &quot;I do it this way&quot; how to of motor racing. But the best parts are how Ayrton prepares for not only a race, but a season, a championship, and life in general. Senna was a truely analytical, psychoanalytic, and spiritious person. His wrtings remind me of FReud and JUng. Yes, he is that deep and well thought out! He is special, intellectual and combative. And charismatic.

Don't be. What this book will teach you is much more valuable. It deals with everything you need to know to be faster than anyone, and gives you the rules of the game. Throughout the book Ayrton Senna states his view on all subjects wich is valuable.

His well chronicled life (mostly chronicled by Durrell) begins with the hilarious, and very succesfull, \\"My family and Other Animals\\". It is ably followed up with the equally hilarious \\"Birds, Beasts and Relatives\\". Both books are full of tales from the Durrell family's years on the Greek Island of Corfu, pre WWII. Little Gerry dives right into the flora and fauna of the island, including its human fauna. I own very few nonfiction books with such a plethora of memorable characters. Now, of course, we get to the volume in question. It is plenty good, and worth multiple readings over years, as is \\"A Zoo In My Luggage\\" and several other books detailing trips to collect animals. A word of warning, don't go nuts and buy all the zillion Durrell titles. Some of them are out of print for a reason and were most likely dashed off by Durrell to finance a collecting trip or two. If you read a sampling of Amazon.com reviews you will sniff these out and avoid wasting you hard earned lucre. And please, get \\"My Familiy and Other Animals and \\"Birds, Beasts and Relatives\\" right now, if you dont have them already."},{"Title":"The overloaded ark","review":"This book is about a business that, for the most part, no longer exists - the business of collecting animals for display in zoos. Wildlife conservation has changed a lot since then so the kind of expedition that Gerald Durrell and his companion, John, undertook in 1953, described in this book, just could not happen now.Gerald describes how he and John spent several months in Cameroon collecting a variety of animals, birds and reptiles and some of the adventures they had, including the triumphs and disappointments. He acknowledges right at the beginning that the expedition may seem more exciting than it really was, because all the boring aspects have been omitted. Even so, there were enough exciting moments to fill this book.He describes some of the local people, who he mostly got on well with - but of course he did have some problems and we are told about these. He describes some of the creatures he collected, and the disappointment when some died or escaped.My favorite (both at school and now) was a chimpanzee that had already been domesticated. Gerald was asked to look after him before he could be shipped to London. This was no ordinary chimpanzee, as he not only enjoyed smoking cigarettes but was able to light his own using either matches or lighter, and also displayed other characteristics more normally associated with people than with chimpanzees. Always remember that this was 1953.This is a highly entertaining book, which I first read at school, where it was compulsory reading - and it was the only such book that I enjoyed. I still enjoyed it when I read it again recently, after discovering (to my surprise) that it is still available in the UK."},{"Title":"The overloaded ark","review":"Durrell's descriptions are so enthralling, I actually read the entire book in one night. If you like books about animals, such as the All Creatures series, you must read this book. I first read this book when I was 10, and this was probably the first adult book I read. The way Durrell describes the catching of animals and the way he captures each character's essence is incredible. You will fall in love with this book. I strongly recommend it."},{"Title":"The overloaded ark","review":"This was the first of Gerald Durrell's (yes, he's the kid brother of novelist Lawrence--who appears in several of his other works, such asMy Family and Other AnimalsandBirds, Beasts, and Relatives) long string of animal books that I ever encountered, and over the next 30-odd years my mother and I literally read our copy to pieces. Durrell was the youngest collector ever commissioned when he set off for the British Cameroons in search, chiefly, of the less spectacular examples of African fauna. With a mixture of near-lyricism, earthiness, and the kind of humor that will have you gasping for breath, he describes the people he met (primarily native villagers), the creatures he caught (and how he did it), and the land it all took place in. Even at this early date, long before his famous Jersey Island zoo was more than a faint gleam in his eye, his deep love of nature shines out on every page, and he's an author every animal fan should know. (Don't miss the tale of his next expedition,The Bafut Beagles, which is equally as good.)"},{"Title":"The overloaded ark","review":"This one is the first of Durrell's books and details his first visit to Cameroon and Africa, where he went about collecting animals for a zoo in the UK. The first half of the book is a little slow and lacks the general sense of observational humor that seems to peek out from Durrell's other books. The second half makes up for it though, for here, Durrell is in top form - humor, situational comedy and narrative flourishes abound. Slightly longer than the others that Durrell has written, a read I thoroughly enjoyed."},{"Title":"The overloaded ark","review":"It was very enjoyable to re-read this tale of animal collecting.

But no one knew they had been stolen from Judith's shoulder bag.' The plot, a bit convoluted (probably because of so many bodies) lands flat at times is still okay.

There were too many characters, and none of them were likable, so it was hard to care when they got killed off, and almost all of them did. That was not a very credible plot at all. This could have been a great cozy whodunit; snowed in at a mountain retreat, a number of suspects, no one getting in or out, etc. The background of the characters just wasn't interesting or identifiable to the reader.

For courses, I highly recommend Oztopcu's Elementary Turkish. This title is unlike any course I have seen or own for any language. It is a model course, in my opinion.

Perfect as a grammar companion."},{"Title":"A basic course in modern Turkish","review":"Pikkert's A Basic Course in Modern Turkish is hardly a COURSE in Turkish, basic or otherwise. It is essentially a grammatical overview of Turkish, but not one that I would recommend for a beginning student. To discuss all the reasons why would require the length of a journal review. Just to mention a few key points, however: grammatical structures are, in a sense, cataloged rather than explained (although the illustrative examples are translated quite well); the major topics covered are presented in very brief chapters, which often cover a host of daunting inflectional forms; and there are no exercises, dialogues or reading selections. Rather than including a chapter on the formation of relative clauses, an especially problematic structure for English speakers, this topic is primarily treated in a chapter called \\"Participles and Verbal Nouns,\\" largely by means of example sentences.This small book is very reminiscent for me of the short introductory grammars I used when studying ancient Semitic languages (e.g., W. B. Stevenson's Grammar of Palestinian Jewish Aramaic); i.e., there is no attempt to be entertaining or to assume that a student may be overwhelmed by the wealth and diversity of the material. There appears to be an underlying assumption that the student is capable of digging into the material, memorizing as much as he/she can, and later tackling the actual usage of the language, whether it be reading, translation, writing, or oral/aural facility. In spite of the above, the book is useful for someone who has already acquired a good foundation in Turkish and is in need of a quick, but substantial review. I would, however, caution the average beginning student to stay far away from this book. For the zealous student, you may find Pikkert's book useful along with other materials, such as the Pimsleur course and &Ouml;ztopu's Elementary Turkish: A Complete Course for Beginners. Aside from its many faults, including misleading printing errors, this grammar does contain several attractive features: a list of frequently-used verbs, a full indexed list of Turkish suffixes, and the presentation of a number of sentence/phrasal types and expressions that are absent in all but the most exhaustive Turkish grammars."},{"Title":"A basic course in modern Turkish","review":"One of the hardest things with Turkish is that while the patterns have a logic, it's a logic that has to be felt and experienced. Knowing the rules is not the same thing as knowing how to apply them. This little book is a gem for starting to internalize the rules. Mind you, this is more of a grammar than a text book. But unlike many grammars, the example sentences are focused on core structures, not bizarre exceptions. If you've already learned some Turkish, say with Pimsleur or Teach Yourself, but you're still struggling to make sentences of your own, by going through this book you'll have countless a-ha moments where the clearly explained rules and simple examples bring to light exactly what is going on."},{"Title":"Dirty Sugar Cookies: Culinary Observations, Questionable Taste","review":"As a professional cook and boringly-avid reader of coobooks and food memoirs, this one--dare I say it--hit the spot.

So fun!"},{"Title":"Dirty Sugar Cookies: Culinary Observations, Questionable Taste","review":"Ayun Halliday remembers the details, and relating them brings humor and poignancy to her writing. I've relished each page of the three books of her's I've read, because she is clever, wide-open and specific - if you relate to her, boy, do you relate. I am a crunchy progressive Mommy who is also a child of the 70's, and Ayun Halliday speaks my language. I will read anything she writes."},{"Title":"Dirty Sugar Cookies: Culinary Observations, Questionable Taste","review":"I loved this food memoir, it made me think about growing up in the 70's and brought back many good food memories."},{"Title":"Dirty Sugar Cookies: Culinary Observations, Questionable Taste","review":"Ayun Halliday is one of my all time favorite writers. Her style cracks me up and I love her cooking flair in this book. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes to cook and also has a sense of humor. Ayun rules!"},{"Title":"Dirty Sugar Cookies: Culinary Observations, Questionable Taste","review":"Every one of Ayun's books has been a can't-put-it-down-er for me, and i go into withdrawal in between books, waiting for a new one to come out. Luckily, her zine, The East Village Inky, keeps me going in between new books. I love her funny ways of sharing recipes and appreciate learning how to make a quiche in the quirkiest of ways. Ayun's ability to recreate her past experiences with food through stories is unique and well worth a read by all."},{"Title":"Dirty Sugar Cookies: Culinary Observations, Questionable Taste","review":"Loved, loved, loved this book. Picked it up on a whim and then couldn't put it down again. Halarious! One of those snort-out-loud kind of books....I completely reccommend it if you are looking for something completly different from all the other books out there. So good in fact that now I am half-way through her travel book called \\"No Touch Monkey!\\" and it's right up there with \\"Dirty Sugar Cookies\\". Ayun Halliday doesn't hold back on anything and for that I say, thank you!!"},{"Title":"Dirty Sugar Cookies: Culinary Observations, Questionable Taste","review":"As devout foodies, we bought blindly Ayun's book from the food section. While we may have been expecting an Anthony Bourdain description of food, we found ourselves laughing out loud to the point of tears remembering our own childhood. This book is not about gourmet food but it was about how food shapes our lives. A definite must read!"},{"Title":"Dirty Sugar Cookies: Culinary Observations, Questionable Taste","review":"I have to admit that generally speaking I suffer from picky eater syndrome and would not normally pick up a book pertaining in any way to food. Nevertheless, there I was figuring that if anyone could make this topic interesting for me it would be Ayun Halliday and hoping that I would not be let down. Thank God I picked it up. This book is witty, interesting, and never has a dull moment. Her style is fast paced, continually honest, perpetually funny, and always entertaining. From discussing her grade school cafeteria experiences through dealing with her children's like (or dislike) of given dishes, there is no topic she will not cover. I never knew that I would find a book about food to be so interesting. Ayun's enthusiasm is catching and I will be the first to say that I will actually venture into trying at least a recipe or two of the many she provides at the close of each chapter."},{"Title":"Dirty Sugar Cookies: Culinary Observations, Questionable Taste","review":"I read it slowly as to savor it! I especially liked reading about the quest for Gran-Gran's recipe box!!!!! I enjoyed Ayun's sugar cookies, dirt and all, every evening for over a month. I read a tasty morsel each night (to help me unwind after a crazy day of summer library program) as long as I could keep my eyes open. Sometimes I stayed awake long enough to mark the page with my new magnetic monkey bookmark recently acquired from a friend who is scared of monkeys. Sometimes I was just conscious enough to dog ear my page before nodding off so I could find my spot the next night. (Don't tell anyone a librarian would do that to a book, but hey it's my book, not the library's copy!) Sometimes I passed out before marking my spot only to roll over and squash my glasses and kick the book onto the floor.Anyhoo. I woke up this morning determine to finish this long, delicious meal. After enjoying the index, (Ayun, you crack me up! Did you index it your ownself?) I flipped through to the two pages before the last page to find an amazing replica of a squashed pill bug. I thought, dang, whoever designed this book has quite a sense of humor...realistic drawings of flies lighting on the first page of each chapter and now this life-like bug at the end. Jeeze it looks so real, it's almost 3-D. Wait a minute...it was 3-D...I flicked the squashed pill bug out of the back of my copy and just had to laugh. Very ironic. He must have crawled aboard on one of those nights the book got kicked to the floor. The pill bug skeleton is lurking with the dust bunnies under my bed, but the stain remains!Anyway...thanks again for another great read, Ayun!(P.S. I loved the cover!!!!! Disgusting AND sweet. You should have seen the looks I got in the doctor's office waiting room...)"},{"Title":"Dirty Sugar Cookies: Culinary Observations, Questionable Taste","review":"One of my favorite books is Halliday's \\"the Big Rumpus\\" so I thought I'd check this one out. I enjoyed it, especially as I'm used to, and enjoy, the author's almost stream-of-consciousness writing style. Dirty Sugar Cookies seems a bit more all over the place than Rumpus, jumping all over her life and habits, but I still liked it. I think I expected it to be more \\"food-related\\" sometimes, but it's fun none the less. I haven't tried any of the recipes from the book yet, as intriguing as a cake that looks like a kitty-litter tray is, but they do look worth-while to attempt....plus it's so good to know I'm not the only one with a child whose whole acceptable meal plan is exhausted in less than 48 hours....!"},{"Title":"Dirty Sugar Cookies: Culinary Observations, Questionable Taste","review":"Ms. Halliday delights yet again with her particular brand of hilariousness that gets me every time. I had the pleasure of hearing her read one of the chapters in person on her book tour. I wish I had the whole book on audio because Ayun's theater background made for a really riveting reading. I could almost taste the sensation of white sugar between two slices of Wonder bread - Ayun's meal of choice in her early picky years - as so vividly and lovingly recounted in the book. I love how the book spans in memoir fashion her life so far, with the focus being on various stories centered around food. The fun recipe (at times inventive or simply homey) at each chapter's end is a perfect closer."},{"Title":"Dirty Sugar Cookies: Culinary Observations, Questionable Taste","review":"As a graduate of the same private school as Ayun and I continue to live in the same city I found her book a great walk down memory lane. Sprinkled with recipes and stories of growing up in an age when things were just beginning to change, the society page was still in bloom, and her mother was a writer for same, and little Ayun was quite the rebel.It is a great read and I have now digested all her books in short order finding her travel read the best."},{"Title":"Dirty Sugar Cookies: Culinary Observations, Questionable Taste","review":"When I heard that Ayun Halliday was writing a book on food, I wondered why. While she seems to have a bit of cooking awareness, I didn't picture her as an authority. And what new could she bring to the over-populated world of food books? I feared she had erred in her choice of topics.I was wrong. Dirty Sugar Cookies presents food in new ways and with new attitudes. Moreover, these ways are fun and accessible. Too many of my fellow cooks seem to have lost the concept that food is for the people and not just the people who must have the costliest of everything, even if it means shaving the server's tip. Ayun's outlook reminds us that food is all about the joy. Her recipes are fun and seemingly reliable. Further, she provides down home instructions.The blurbs on the back cover tell you that you will laugh at Ayun's Ms. adventures and this is true. My favorite parts are how she illustrates, through food, her life's development and how four generations of primarily female Ayunians have grown - and show every sign of continuing to do so.But in addition to what Ayun says, please also notice and praise how she says it. Her always unique voicing seems to have reached a new level of consistency, ease and phrasing. When I read a chapter on a segment of her teen years, I felt as if I had attended high school in Indiana during the early 80's. It is this sense of time and place she provides that makes this book so much fun to read."},{"Title":"The expedition of Humphrey Clinker","review":"I challenge anyone to read this picaresque travelogue and not be overcome with laughter in at least three places. I don't care how jaded and well-read you may (or may not) be. If you have even a pittance of sense for the absurdities of the human situation, this book will catch you unawares in its jabbing yet light-hearted apercus to which every mortal can relate---Unless you are one particular reviewer who seems to have stepped out of Victorian spinsterhood to berate Smollett for a Swiftean obsession with dirt, which is twaddle and tripe. This aspect forms only a small part of the novel as a whole. But I digress; this review shall not become an assault on Victorian spinsterhood.If this book reminds me of anything (besides earlier Smollett works), it is the lighter plays of Shakespeare such as Much Ado About Nothing and All's Well That Ends Well, particularly the former, full of coincidences bordering on farce, and ending, well, like Much Ado about Nothing ends, if you'll recall the last scene.I'm not equating Smollett with Shakespeare. But I AM saying that Humphrey Clinker is just as funny, warm hearted and insightful regarding the human condition as these plays, just perhaps a bit less profound and virtuosic.Enough said, these long-winded reviews drive one batty. Read this book and have some fun, and come away reflecting on the foibles of us all."},{"Title":"The expedition of Humphrey Clinker","review":"I just received this book. What a disappointment.The book I ordered is pictured on Amazon having a cover depicting a pile of old books. On the page for the product the publisher is given as CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform. So the product received is a handsome paperback with a handsome cover. Inside there is NOTHING but the text of the novel. That is, there is not even an indication of the publisher! The title of the book, and its author, are displayed three times on two otherwise blank pages. Then the first page of the novel appears. On the last page of the book is displayed \\"Made in the USA. Lexington KY. 26 December 2012\\". Note the date. This is the day I ORDERED the book. Hence, it was printed after I ordered, and mailed to me.Look, this novel, first published in 1771, is not a particularly easy read, if someone is coming at it with little or no knowledge of the author, the year that it was published, difficult words in the text, what have you. Other editions of the book available on Amazon universally have some sort of introduction, or forward, or glossary or SOMETHING to help the reader get oriented. (These from real publishing houses, of course.)The only reason you should CONSIDER purchasing this product is if price is your ONLY criteria. It probably is the cheapest print edition of the book available on Amazon. (BUT NOTE: if you have a Kindle, the e-book is available FREE, and the Kindle edition (presumably a bare-bones text) would have absolutely NO LESS information than this edition.)Follow up: Amazon agreed to refund the price I paid for the book. Can't complain about that sort of customer service!"},{"Title":"The expedition of Humphrey Clinker","review":"Smollett could dream up some amazing characters!

But to anyone who still writes letters, this book is a must. It will delight, inspire, instruct, and thoroughly amuse you. Syndicated columnist, Colin Campbell - The Newspaper Priest. www.newspriest.com"},{"Title":"The expedition of Humphrey Clinker","review":"Perhaps it would be a little too much to ask someone who does not feel at home in Georgian literature to enjoy this book, which I daresay does have it's share of limitations, but as an example of what it is-- an epistolary novel-- it is anything but dull. Richardson expects us to rend our hearts over the numberless touching or pathetic scenes which fill the mass of volume after volume of Clarissa or Pamela. (Now tell me--Who has read those in their entirety? I salute you!) Unfortunately we of this age can no longer do so-- we can merely laugh at those brave heroines' when their backs are turned. And that is precisely why Humphry Clinker, Lismahago, and above all that incessently complaining country squire Matthew Bramble (I believe that is his name-- Forgive me, I read it a few years ago) are all able to captivate us-- We are able to laugh at them without any sense of guilt, for Smollett asks us to. When the book does start slipping during the expedition's stay in Scotland, it is because Smollett demands us to stop laughing and hear what he must say. Luckily for us, by this point the book is near over. Self-conscious humour is what makes this book, a very decent book, and an important book in showing us how not very different from us at times the XVIII Century could be."},{"Title":"The expedition of Humphrey Clinker","review":"The world of Tobias Smollett is one of dirty people with dirty minds in a dirty world. These atavisms are not the stinky throwbacks of Swift's Yahoos; they at least had the excuse of being not quite human. Smollett's world is full of those who were much like himself. As a doctor, he was intimately associated with dirt and grubbiness. It was his personal idiosyncracy that this knowledge of dirt led to an obsession with dirt. Beginning with PEREGRINE PICKLE, then extending to RODERICK RANDOM, and then finishing with HUMPHREY CLINKER, his warped self-image led him to see the world in much the same way that he saw himself. He simply could not describe anyone, including his protagonists, in ways that somehow did not smack of dirt or dehumanization. For Smollett, it does not matter whether that character is being held up as a paragon of virtue; the fact that he is there is an offense to both eye and nose. After reading HUMPHREY CLINKER, one can see that the plot which is supposed to be an epistolary novel based on the picaresque tradition involving a loosely-connected series of improbable adventures, that behind the assorted misadventures of the Bramble family guided by their loyal servant Humphrey Clinker, lay a world view of a dirt-obsessed man who tried to unite the honorable genre of Life On the Road with the dirt that lay underfoot every step of the way.The England of Smollett's day was an era that prided itself on intellectual supremacy, which manifested itself in both literature and culture. But behind Smollett's consummate skill to individualize each character as a fully-fleshed round individual (no mean feat there), he not only overly emphasized that character's tendency to assault the senses with sight and smell, he persisted in lifting the delicate veil that covered the outhouses of the day. It is impossible for a reader not to inhale the effluvia of his words and images. This then is the enduring legacy of Tobias Smollett."},{"Title":"The expedition of Humphrey Clinker","review":"Humphry Clinker is a fairly hard book to read. If English is your second language it may be quite a challenge, but having the Oxford dictonary on hand helps, as about four words per page are dated and obscure. I had to read Humphry Clinker for an English course and understand that the Professor picked it because it is a &quot;snap shot&quot; of English life in the 1760's. The politics, health trends, religious choices, entertainment and family affairs of the time are described by the cast of people you come across in the story. The book is a series of letters written by the charaters while they travel through the country. Once you get the hang of each character's personality and level of education (which is reflected by their letter writing) you can follow the story fairly well. I just found the book to be a little boring and convoluted, but in it's time it would have been interesting and even funny in places. Remembering that there was no TV or radio at the time helps to see how the book would have captured the imagination. Today it is just a &quot;historical&quot; interest piece. I suggest Cliff Note's with this book....."},{"Title":"The expedition of Humphrey Clinker","review":"Yes, this novel is Smollett's way of experimenting with the &quot;novel&quot; form. Not only is this book confusing and irrational, but it is full of weird wordings and gaps. I had a hard hard time reading this novel and after several reads and some Cliff Notes help, I was still as confused as before. I couldn't imagine a teacher assigning this book without being fully prepared to answer the reader's confused state of mind after the first few chapters. Perhaps I am not as literary trained in novel reading as some people, but for me, a good novel must capture the reader's attention and emotions. This book didn't. I flipped through this novel in utter confusion and doubt I'll be rereading this anytime this century."},{"Title":"Monsters Giants and Little Men from Mars","review":"Generic Charles Fort.Covers a decent range of creatures but is very biased leaning toward the skeptical side.Nice book to introduce cryptozoology or folkore to kids on."},{"Title":"Sunday Dinners: Seasonal Menus to Enjoy with Family and Friends","review":"&quot;Sunday Dinner&quot; offers a concise, but by no means meager, selection of complete meal menus designed for a cook who wishes to serve something more than the same-old same-old to family and friends. As the authors point out, this collection is entitled &quot;Sunday Dinner&quot; because this is the one meal of the week which, ideally, entails a little more time in the kitchen; however, one can easily adapt these to everyday use (for instance, by substituting chicken for the cornish game hens in one recipe). Recipes range from the sophisticated (Roast Duck with Port and Plum Sauce) to the sublime (Chocolate Cake with Chocolate Cream Cheese Frosting and Raspberry Sauce), from hearty (Farfalle with Tomato and Vegetable Sauce) to healthy (Roasted Acorn Squash Soup).However, I feel that the real beauty of &quot;Sunday Dinner&quot; lays in its presentation and design. The book's well-conceived layout organizes the menus by season, with each season's recipes providing a showcase for timely and highly-complimentary fruits and vegatables. While we might be accustomed, in this age of supermarket produce, to year-round fruits, berries, and vegetables, the menus in this book prove that nothing fits the spirit of any time of year better than in-season produce. Further, in regards to design, &quot;Sunday Dinner&quot; has no lavish (but somehow generic-feeling) photographs of high-gloss food, but rather takes on a simple, clean air of sophistication with its white pages, ornamented by Robbin Gourley's lovely color illustrations, plus seasonal quotes, gorgeous scripted fonts, and tastefully-done parchment-look menus at each dinner's head. Recipes are presented cleanly and clearly, with italicized ingredient listings and 1-2-3 instructions. Make no mistake, this book is a short but sweet, can't-miss collection of recipes.Additionally, I would like to point out that I do not feel that the previous Amazon reviewer was fair to this lovely book. While this cookbook is certainly not geared toward the novice cook (for those new to cooking, I recommend something like the Better Homes and Gardens Cookbook), its recipes are well-rounded and easy to follow.Finally, it appears, as this book is now listed in Amazon's Outlet section, that the title will soon no longer be available. This is a shame, and I encourage anyone reading this review to purchase a copy, new or used, anywhere they may find it. And I do hope that the publisher (Chronicle Books) will keep this book in print. It is a job well-done for both authors and the illustrator, and provides a lovely compliment to anyone's recipe collection."},{"Title":"Sunday Dinners: Seasonal Menus to Enjoy with Family and Friends","review":"This is a grrreat book!

However, as the first painting of Jackson in this volume clearly shows, no one could look more imperial than Andy By-God Jackson. This ninth volume in excellent series The Drama of American History focuses more on the Age of Jackson rather than just the two terms Jackson served in the White House. After all, Jackson was a major political figure before that time; in fact, he was the first candidate to win three consecutive popular votes for the Presidency.This volume covers the Age of Jackson in seven chapters: (1) A Man for an Age previews Jackson's impact on American History and how he is clearly one of those figures that who validates the Great Man theory of history. However, while Jackson serves as the defining figure of his time, he is not the focus of most of these chapters; (2) The Industrial Revolution Comes to America looks at the social and economic transformation of the nation that happened during this period; (3) The New Transportation System covers the importance of being able to move people and things from one place to another by canal and railroad; (4) The Rise of the Market Economy looks at the creation of the \\"blue collar\\" and \\"white collar\\" class system that originated at this time.Jackson's personal impact on the nation's history highlights the next couple of chapters: (5) The Beginning of the Two-Party Political System erupted after the \\"Era of Good Feelings\\" that defined the administration of James Monroe. The bitterly contested election of 1824 between the National Republicans of John Quincy Adams and Henry Clay and the Democratic Republicans of Jackson gave birth to the political division that continues to plague us today; (6) Andrew Jackson and the Modern Presidency looks at not only how he played an important role in creating the national Democratic Party, but how his political philosophy of believing in a strong president while not believing in a strong government can best be seen in the public argument over the national bank; and (7) Pushing the Indians Back Again details Jackson's policy of moving the native tribes west to allow white expansion. This chapter has a map that pinpoints 68 major Indian battles between 1829 and 1866 and certainly the Colliers provide a contemporary perspective on the Age of Jackson by ending it with the shame of the Trail of Tears.The chief value of The Drama of American History series is how the Colliers establish what they call the \\"central core\\" of the subject under discussion. \\"Andrew Jackson's America\\" shows how the nation changed during this quarter-century and what hand Jackson hand in the nation's peculiar evolution at that point. The volume is illustrated with historic paintings, etchings and political cartoons, although if anything there are too few of the last on this list (there are some really choice examples I have seen elsewhere that would have enriched this volume). Even if this series proves too expensive to work as a complete set for students in the classroom, as I suspect is almost always going to be the case, teachers can still benefit from the organizational structure of these volumes and the emphasis it provides for understanding the period."},{"Title":"The Hermit's Story: Stories","review":"Rick Bass is a phenomenal nature writer, and though I have not yet read all of his books, The Hermit's Story is my favorite out of the others I have read. Rick Bass writes about simple life, and the influence of the wilds on people who still live with the land, instead of just on it.In The Hermit's Story, Bass reveals another ten stories that cut straight to the heart, and bring the reader into a new world, one where people love and care for the land they live on, and where the outside world of today's developed society is strange and unforgiving.As an avid reader of nature writing, and an outdoors lover, I am enticed by Bass's writing, and it inspires me to write, and to spend time in the wild. I could not ask for more out of a book."},{"Title":"The Hermit's Story: Stories","review":"I don't know Rick Bass. I have been to a couple of book signings, but I have never really met him.

At first you think he is just a nature writer, and his nature descriptions in this book are amazing, but this collection of stories harkens back to his beginnings with the short story collection \\"THE WATCH\\".The characters in those stories were just beginning to find out what was important in life and love. The characters in these stories have put in the years in work and relationships and have pared their existence down to a sparse measure of what is important to them. In my favorite story \\"the Fireman\\" you hear about a marriage pushed to the edge and brought back stronger for the struggle. Kirby & Mary Ann are older versions of Kirby and Trish from \\"THE WATCH\\".\\"The swans\\" talks of Billy & Amy a couple who have dug in so to speak in the Yaak valley and created a life which while isolating satisfies all their needs of their love for each other. Only toward the end does Billy acknowledge the friendships around him. If you have ever been young and starting out in a tough spot and wished you could look 20 years into the future and see if you survived this the book.

One can only wait another 20 years to see where the characters end up."},{"Title":"The Tornado: Nature's Ultimate Windstorm","review":"I strongly recommend this book for anyone interested in tornadoes and wishing to learn more about the subject. Topics covered include nearly every aspect of tornado development and subsequent evolution, forecasting and warnings, the Fujita scale for rating damage, and tornado risks by geographical region. As a meteorologist, I think he does a great job communicating core scientific concepts to the reader in an easy-to-understand manner, and the chapters &quot;Tornado Myths&quot; and &quot;Tornado Safety&quot; contain valuable information and are must-reads, esp. for those less familiar with severe storms/tornadoes.In short, a good read for anyone interested in tornadoes, and definitely a book you will want to have on your shelf."},{"Title":"The Tornado: Nature's Ultimate Windstorm","review":"Lets start with the few negatives about this book. Grazulis does use the term, &quot;I&quot; fairly often in this book. This doesn't bother me as much as it does some people. He has to use the first person as he explains what brought about his interest in tornadoes and he has been involved in much of the research he talks about. The only real drawback I can find is that he gets a little too technical for the average reader on occasion. Still, considering the complicated nature of his subject I think he does a fine job of getting his point across and helping someone like me began to understand these killer storms.Grazulis leads us down the path of tornado history making stops along the way to point out interesting facts. The reader is given stories of survival as well as tragedy. We even get a story about the one of the 18th century's most famous scientists chasing on horseback after what may or may not have been a tornado. I can just see Ben Franklin charging down the road in hot pursuit. Grazulis also spends some time trashing some tornado myths and giving some safety tips. There is also a very interesting chapter on tornadoes in other countries. I have even begun to understand what straight line winds and downbursts are because of this book.Best of all the reader will be treated to an inside look at the progress science has made in understanding and predicting tornadoes. The new equipment, the new ideas, and the ever present danger of trying to get too close to a tornado to study it. Science has come a long way since early April, 1974 when forecasters all over the eastern U.S. watched the &quot;Super Outbreak&quot; on surplus World War II radar.No matter if you are a weather junkie or are just in awe of the power of nature I feel sure you will find this to be an interesting read."},{"Title":"The Tornado: Nature's Ultimate Windstorm","review":"Persons interested in tornadoes will recognize Tom Grazulis as the Director of the Tornado Project and author of the massive tornado tome \\"Significant Tornadoes 1680-1991.\\" In this new book, appropriately published by the University of Oklahoma Press, Grazulis discusses the long history of tornadoes in the United States (and, rare for books on the subject, includes a listing of major tornadoes outside the US), covers the process of observation and research that led to today's understanding of these chaotic storms, discusses tornado oddities, tornado safety, and tornado myths (no, that trailer park on the edge of town is not a dangerous tornado attractant). Grazulis is not a particularly stylish writer, but the book is clear and interesting and will serve as a good introduction to both the trail of terror left by these storms and the current state of severe storm research..... While Grazulis does on occasion refer to himself, it is not excessive and provides his own view of events and personalities in the field.My only disagreement with Grazulis is his soft-pedaling of the state of government funding into severe storm research and warning systems. While he comments mildly that the government just can't fund everything (which of course is true), I would observe that there always seems to be money for congressional porkbarrel, like the mysterious ordering every year of C-130 aircraft that the Air Force didn't want but which were built in a certain well-known former House Speaker's district at the same time that Weather Service offices were being closed and research money drying up. As one who lives in a NEXRAD \\"hole\\" (a city that is well below the horizon of the nearest WSR-88D radars and hence in danger of being struck unexpectedly by tornadoes), I tend to object more than mildly to this kind of thing, and Grazulis should as well.If you find this book interesting, check at your local library for a copy of Grazulis' \\"Significant Tornadoes.\\" It is huge and fascinating."},{"Title":"The Tornado: Nature's Ultimate Windstorm","review":"In 1953, the University of Oklahoma Press launched its biggest seller to date with &quot;Tornadoes of the United States&quot; by Snowden D. Flora. For its era, it was unique -- a thorough, multifaceted but concise (194 pages) treatment of tornadoes, liberally sprinkled with photographs. Tom Grazulis, a friend, colleague in science and fellow tornado enthusiast, has created the same with a modern flavor: the first worthy successor to Flora's tome in 48 years.Strongly reminiscent of Flora's framework, Grazulis effectively blends powerful personal anecdotes from tornado survivors with sharp graphics, summaries of the most recent scientific thinking on tornado development, and short synopses of tornado events through history. Grazulis explains and debunks tornado myths, including safety misconceptions like the suicidal tendency for people to hide beneath bridges in advance of a tornado. This work pays due attention and respect to the immense contributions of Ted Fujita without the undertone of hero worship in the author's previous book, &quot;Significant Tornadoes.&quot; The text is quite straightforward -- rightfully so -- about the inconsistencies, varying methods, and flat-out-wrongs in the &quot;official&quot; tornado database -- such as a deadly November 1989 New York downburst (as surveyed by Fujita) which remains on the records as a tornado. Without confusion, Grazulis covers tornado risk in several ways, thanks to his enormous database of significant (deadly and/or F2 or greater) tornadoes. Also, commendably, there is an entire chapter devoted to tornadoes outside the United States, which (from personal communication with author) played a big role in scuttling his original plans to adopt Flora's title for this book as well.The major problem with this work is in its blatantly first-person writing style. While not a fatal flaw, the appearance of the word &quot;I&quot; in hundreds of places lends a striking, if unintended, aura of self-importance detracting from the abundance of solid science behind the information. Why must an author talk about himself so much, unless this is supposed to be an autobiography? Also, many of the photos in &quot;Tornadoes of the United States&quot; were reprinted here, in lieu of many more recent, higher-quality tornado pictures from the 1980s and 90s which better illustrate the concepts written by Grazulis. Without these encumbrances, Grazulis' book gets 5 stars, easily. Still, all severe weather enthusiasts should have a copy at the core of their libraries. It will be stunning if this volume doesn't become OU Press' biggest seller, as did its forebear."},{"Title":"The Tornado: Nature's Ultimate Windstorm","review":"Thomas P. Grazulis has obviously dedicated a good part of his life to studying Tornadoes. This book has &quot;labor of love&quot; written many times over between its pages. And yet, it is an odd book. Grazulis combines tornado anecdotes, tornado science, tornado safety and even tornado mythology into a strange hodgepodge of information. This is not the book to buy for great narratives of tornado destruction. Grazulis' accounts are second hand and mostly used to illustrate his other points. Nor is the book packed full of great pictures. It has some, all in black and white photos and some that are more than a century old. This book is really an encyclopedic account of everything there is to know about tornadoes. I learned a lot, even if I found the book's style a bit bemusing. If you love tornadoes on more than a superficial level, I would recommend it. Otherwise, I would look elsewhere."},{"Title":"The Tornado: Nature's Ultimate Windstorm","review":"Many readers in Oklahoma know the scenario all to well. Typically the spring or summer day begins warm and clear with a sometimes hazy blue tint to the sky shimmering with humidity. By all accounts, another good day to wash the car, have a cookout, or attend to the myriad of chores that seem to demand attention. Sometime during the mid-afternoon a careful observer will notice the clouds beginning to rise in the southwestern sky as the heat and humidity build. Sometime between three and seven p.m., according to official records, the National Weather Service will broadcast a warning and residents in the midwest typically began another evening in Tornado Alley. All to often, some will never live to see the light of day. Thomas P. Grazulis, a tornado research meteorologist and director of The Tornado Project and Fellow of the American Meteorological Society, has written a gripping, spellbinding book for the general public that is a must read for anyone remotely interested in tornadoes and weather related phenomenon. Surprisingly, this is the first book of it's type written since 1953 when OU Press published what was until now the standard general text on tornadoes. This book is a fit replacement. The book is a careful blend of scientific findings and common sense explanations on one of the most deadly, and feared, forces of nature. There is an enlightening chapter on tornado risks, the numerous misconceptions and contradictory theories surrounding tornadoes, how the Fujita Scale was developed and what it means, and a host of stories and findings that will provide the reader with a better understanding of what has been described as &quot;...little more than a mixture of insubstantial air and water vapor.&quot; In addition to a most helpful series of graphs and tables explaining everything from the frequency of tornadoes, not only by location but time of day, to tornado risks at specific points east of the Rocky Mountains, there are also chapters on tornado history, forecasting, formation, safety, and myths. The chapters dealing with safety and myths are especially noteworthy. For example, the author argues there is no evidence that tornadoes seek out trailer parks or that the southwest corner of the house is the safest location. That, of course, is contrary to everything I was taught about Tornado safety. This is the best available book on the subject for the general reader that I have read. It has a bibliography, index, appendix, easily read charts and graphs, photographs, and is reader friendly given it's sometimes necessary technical nature. It is a must have for residents of Tornado Alley."},{"Title":"The Tornado: Nature's Ultimate Windstorm","review":"I wanted a book for by granddaughter who is 10 and who had expressed an interested in tornadoes. It was, perhaps, a little above her level, however it can be read in parts. I ended up reading the entire thing before I could let go of it to send it on. Puts the tornado,the incidence of seeing one, and the likelihood of experiencing damage all into perspective. Knocks down the myths of tornadoes, when, where and what they strike. A must for any library on meteorology. Sufficient statistics and hard science to satisfy even the already knowledgeable storm chaser."},{"Title":"The Tornado: Nature's Ultimate Windstorm","review":"From the intorduction, you read that the author's intent with this book was to write a modernized edition of Snowden D. Flora's 1953 book &quot;Tornadoes of the United States&quot; -- which was billed at the time as the first general reference book on tornadoes. In that respect, Tom Grazulis has fully succeeded.&quot;The Tornado&quot; covers all the basics about tornadoes, like the highly complicated (and still enigmatic) process of tornado formation, forecasting, historical aspects of tornadoes -- as well as major tornadic events of the past, safety, climatology/frequncy, international frequency and major events, the Fujita scale, myths (more than you might think), and a pleasingly non-sensational chapter on storm chasing.The text is never too complicated, and even the more technical points are easy to understand. The fact that the book is up-to-date is also a plus, as is the scope of the book's coverage. It's also somewhat more relevant to an American audience than Arjen and Jerrine Verkaik's &quot;Under the Whirlwind,&quot; which -- though good, and including some of what this book covers -- was written with a Canadian audience in mind. (In which case Canadian readers are advised to read that book before this.)About the only real minus is that there are limited illustrations, and those in the book are black and white. This text accompanied with more -- and color -- illustrations might have been more useful, although in moderation so as not to draw attention away from the text; at any rate a section of color plates would have been a nice addition.That aside, this is a terrific guide to all things relevant (or even just the stuff you might have thought of once!) to tornadoes."},{"Title":"The Tornado: Nature's Ultimate Windstorm","review":"The Tornado: Nature's Ultimate Windstorm by Thomas P. Grazulis is an easy to read book that discusses and analyzes almost every aspect of tornadoes. The book covers all the basics about tornadoes, including the highly complicated process of tornado formation, forecasting, historical aspects of tornadoes, as well as major tornadic events of the past, safety, climatology/frequency, international frequency and major events, the Fujita scale, myths and storm chasing. He introduces most chapters with stories of past tornadoes, which adds interest to a potentially uninteresting subject. He clearly states the facts about tornadoes and doesn't sensationalize any aspect of them. Grazulis uses only the facts to inform the reader, and he disproves many tornado myths along the way.This book is a comprehensive, easy to understand guide about tornadoes, accessible even to the non-scientist! Grazulis is clearly well researched, as he shares his abundant knowledge and passion for tornadoes throughout the book. While the illustrations are limited, the overall content of the book manages to cover all bases of the tornado phenomenon."},{"Title":"The Tornado: Nature's Ultimate Windstorm","review":"Since there's a lot of science going on behind tornado occurances -many myths have developed since the phenomena is so scary & hard to explainThomas P. Grazillus manages to do just that in this book - explain the science behind the tornado so the average joe could undertand it, while explaining the truth about myths, while trying to understand where these myths have risen from."},{"Title":"The Tornado: Nature's Ultimate Windstorm","review":"This book is an excellent introduction into the whole phenomenon of tornadoes. Grazulis presents an extremely well-written and researched work which is a superb primer for anyone who is fascinated by severe weather and tornadoes. I have all his books and videos and this one is a terrific addition. keep 'em coming Tom!"},{"Title":"The Tornado: Nature's Ultimate Windstorm","review":"Out of all the books on tornadoes, and severe weather, this is the most comprehensive book on tornadoes to date. T.P. Grazulis explains the way tornadoes develop (tornadogensis) like no other book does before. This book goes so deep into tornadoes, but on the otherhand it is so easy to understand. This was a very well written book. This book also helped me to further my knowledge in severe weather. I am already starting to see improvment in my storm spotting. This book is like a a storm spotter's handbook. It's a must for any severe weather or tornado enthusiast, and any storm chasers or spotters!"},{"Title":"The Tornado: Nature's Ultimate Windstorm","review":"I was very impressed with the great lengths the author took to document and verify all the tornados in this book.If you find storms,ecspecialy tornados,fascinating,then this is the book for you.Tom grazulis has a great writing style,that comes across very easily to those of us who are less technical about storms. Great work tom!"},{"Title":"The Tornado: Nature's Ultimate Windstorm","review":"There are several tornado books on the market, and for a person interested in the subject, it can be hard to know where to start. In my opinion, if you were to get just one book on tornadoes, this would have to be it. It covers almost every facet of the subject of tornadoes. To show this, I will list the chapter names here.I: Tornadoes Past and PresentII: In The Wake of a TornadoIII: Tornado Life CycleIV: Tornado FormationV: Tornado Forecasting and WarningsVI:Tornado Wind SpeedsVII: The Fujita Scale of Tornado IntensityVIII: Tornado MythsIX: Tornado SafetyX: Approaching the UnapproachableXI: Tornado Numbers and RecordsXII: Tornadoes by DecadeXIII: Tornadoes Outside the United StatesXIV: Tornado RisksXV: Final ThoughtsSound comprehensive to you? Well, it is. In his book, Mr. Grazulis not only gives accurate scientific information about the subject, but he cites his sources for almost everything and even gives recommendations for learning more about tornadoes in the back. At the same time, he does not politicize the subject like so many other meteorology books do. Whether you are a student of meteorology, a person living in tornado alley, or just someone interested in nature's ultimate windstorm, this is the definitive book on tornadoes."},{"Title":"The Tornado: Nature's Ultimate Windstorm","review":"Tornado science is tough, and still very much growing. So it must be difficult to compile an overall book on the topic, as opposed to just describing the aftermath. A search on Amazon will not reveal many books, and very few reviews for the ones you do find. If you are looking for a good technical discussion on how tornadoes form, their internal structure, and how they move - you likely need to focus more on an internet search or through industry/academic journals. Why? Simply because we don't know enough yet.This book includes some gripping and interesting descriptions of tornado strikes and their effects, but, not to be callous, but they get repetitive after a while. I am saying this as someone looking for how tornadoes work though - so take that with a grain of salt. There are several sections of the text that deal with what we know about tornado mechanics, data from significant strikes, and questions on how to move the science forward. We just can't write about what we don't know. Why the 3 stars then? It was the overall delivery of the book. My opinion, I just found it choppy. Some sections tried to get technical, but without good setup or definitions or graphics and I felt lost. Other sections seems very simplistic. It was a bit of a slog at times, to get through it.If you know nothing at all about tornadoes, I would recommend this at a Used Book price. There are some neat things in there. I do look forward to another book by the author on the matter in the future though!"},{"Title":"The Tornado: Nature's Ultimate Windstorm","review":"Thomas P. Grazulis did a phenomenal job constructing this book. His passion for meteorology is evident and he uses his immense knowledge on the subject to accurately inform the reader. He gave a broad range of information, which kept my attention throughout the book. This book is helpful for anyone wanting/needing to learn more about tornadoes. One critique I would give Grazulis is his tendency to assume the reader has studied meteorology. Details and precise information about the tornado itself got to be excessive at times, and an average reader could very easily lose focus. Overall, the book was well written and organized, and I recommend it to anyone wanting to broaden their knowledge of tornadoes."},{"Title":"The Tornado: Nature's Ultimate Windstorm","review":"Anyone wanting to learn about tornadoes would find this read very useful. Thomas Grazulis covers all aspects of tornadoes from the tornado life cycle, historical records of tornadoes, dismissing tornado myths, all the way to the present tornado conditions. While books of this kind can often drag on with facts and statistical data Grazulis mixes it up by adding historical accounts from others. These shared experiences really help the reader engage and for some connect more to what Grazulis is describing. There were several great illustrations and pictures; the only down-side of this is that the pictures were in black and white which at times made it difficult to make out what Grazulis was trying to show. Overall, this book is an excellent source of information. Grazulis obviously knows what he is talking about and wrote it so well that anyone could not only understand it but also become engaged and excited about the subject of tornadoes."},{"Title":"The Tornado: Nature's Ultimate Windstorm","review":"This book is quite simply my favorite book on tornadoes. It's a reference book of sorts, but reads better than most of the \\"novel\\" style books on historical tornadoes and outbreaks. I wish Mr. Grazulis would write 5 more just like this one."},{"Title":"The Tornado: Nature's Ultimate Windstorm","review":"This book was interesting from cover to cover. I enjoyed the narrative parts of the book. I am not sure I understood all the weather science but this was a clearest description of it I have read."},{"Title":"The Tornado: Nature's Ultimate Windstorm","review":"If one is looking for a single book on all things tornado, this is the one. Chapters cover tornadoes by decade, tornado formation, chasing, safety, wind speed estimates and much else. One of the last chapters looks at tornadoes outside the USA, something rarely mentioned in other works. I find it hard to believe any tornado enthusiast or weather freak could dislike this book.Grazulis also knows how to write a piece of this kind. Boring meteorological lessons are avoided and specific examples included wherever possible. And although not a science text by any means, technical weather explanations are provided.As with so many good books, though, one wishes this one were longer. I suppose we have to get his significant tornadoes volume for that."},{"Title":"The Tornado: Nature's Ultimate Windstorm","review":"Grazulis states, \\"Awareness is the key to tornado safety\\" (163). The best way to understand safety measures in the midst of a weather emergency is to become educated on a particular subject. The Tornado: Nature's Ultimate Windstorm thoroughly explains tornado history, formation patterns, and safety patterns that are necessary to the understanding of a tornado. Though the subject matter may seem particularly dense or difficult to understand, Grazulis writes in such a way that every reader can comprehend the importance of tornados and the way they have impacted society. A common theme throughout the whole book is the idea that tornadoes, as a whole, are still a nebulous meteorological phenomenon. In spite of this, the author still is able to flush out a complicated topic and does so with great ease. This book shatters fears that may surround the tornado. Grazulis is certainly skeptical of the news media's coverage because of the way it sensationalizes tornadoes. After reading this book, one will have a much more realistic idea of tornado behavior. For me, I will no longer become paranoid when I see tornado watches on television, see pictures of tornado wreckage, or watch Twister or The Wizard of Oz. Instead, safety strategies will trump fear and understanding of this superstorm will overcome the unknown."},{"Title":"The Tornado: Nature's Ultimate Windstorm","review":"Written primarily for the layperson, The Tornado: Nature's Ultimate Windstorm won't disappoint you if you're curious about the most enigmatic of atmospheric phenomenon. Grazulis is well known for his historical tornado data work (and has done a stellar job of it too) and has taken much of his knowledge, put it into this book, and made it accessible for the non-scientist. People like myself who are knowledgeable in the atmospheric sciences may find the book a bit basic, but we're not the target audience. Regardless of your knowledge, this book is an attractive read. In the light of the revision of the old Fujita scale of tornado intensity, I'd like to see a revised edition published."},{"Title":"The Tornado: Nature's Ultimate Windstorm","review":"For a relatively small number of Americans each year a tornado will threaten life and result in a life-changing loss of possessions and property. A greater number will observe the phenomenon but, as luck would have it, remain scared but unscathed. However to the vast majority a tornado is nothing more than a compelling news item on television which highlights the casualties, personal losses and structural damage. This is reinforced by the compulsory 30 second sound bite by someone who has lost everything but survived and another who lived nearby but remains intact. The video from the chasers is breath taking but accompanied by the standard script of 'Oh my god...Oh my god...guys...Holey crap...guys...'As I write this (May 2008) the tornados currently in Oklahoma have all of these elements. So far this year America has had 103 tornado deaths and this is alarming.Grazulis has written with a wonderful balance of narrative and scientific text. A reader is drawn through the chapters and will come away better informed on tornados, their cause, observation, classification, magnitude and probability. The relatively small probability of any one person or any one building being struck in any year seems to be a risk acceptable to this conditioned society and to the insurance industry. The declining trend in the number of fatalities is attributed to improving meteorology, warning systems and improving design of structures. There is however a hint those tornados could become more frequent and severe with climate change.Tornados are now better understood because of Grazulis.Perhaps the book will be the catalyst that motivates scientists, engineers, architects and urban planners to come together to build improved structures and communities so as to better resist the destructive forces of tornados. Otherwise it seems that society will continue to believe that a tornado is an irresistible force. I promote the idea of engineering-out the likelihood of devastating loss. Perhaps we can diminish the likelihood of Americans following Dorothy and Toto to the Land of Oz."},{"Title":"Trading in Wings","review":"I don't know if there's a senior citizen alive that sees a little Betsy Guidry in themselves - I sure hope not. I wouldn't want my grandmother regaling me with stories of how she had sex in the back of a car because of peer pressure. This \\"novel\\" reads as little more than a 17 year old's poorly written diary, with the names changed to protect the not-so-innocent. I couldn't even finish it, it was so poorly written. Betsy Guidry didn't conform to peer pressure so much as become an alcoholic and wannabe sexpot and there's no evidence that this was caused by peer pressure. It was caused by a one-year bender after getting dumped in high school. Why would anyone want to read about that, much less read about that topic by an overly flowery, pretentios author who is in love with herself? The main character is completely unlikable because I know the author, know that the main character is in fact the author (with a stupider name) and the author herself is unlikable."},{"Title":"Trading in Wings","review":"This is a fantastic novel about a teenage girl's experiences growing up around peer pressures and self-discoveries. Any reader can find something to relate to within these pages. Whether you are in high school or a senior citizen, we have always seen a little of Betsy Guidry within ourselves.

When you buy a Macintosh, you get an operating system and an impressive set of most useful applications with it. You should have a book about using the Mac OS X operating system. You also need a guide for using the applications that came with it.The Little Mac iApps Book is about the separate applications that come with Mac OS X that were not covered in Robin Williams' The Robin Williams Mac OS X Book, Jaguar Edition. In this one book you will find a helpful guide to:* iLife applications -iPhoto, iTunes, iMovie, and iDVD* OS X apps - Mail, Address Book, iCal, iChat and Rendezvous, and Safari* .Mac apps - iDisk, HomePage, WebMail, Backup, iSync, Slides Publisher, and Virex* More Cool apps - AppleWorks Word Processing, Database, Spreadsheet, Painting, Drawing, and Presentation, plus OmiGraffle, FAXstf, and Inkwell.More complete coverage of the iLife applications is available elsewhere, but this first section is enough to get you using these applications. If you want more information or to see a demonstration you might consider The Macintosh iLife with a DVD by Jim Heid.The section on Mac OS X apps is, I believe, the only source that covers all of these applications and it does so with enough information to really use them. It is presented so that it is easy reading and the beginner can understand it.Safari is still in Beta but is quite stable and has already become the favorite Internet browser for many of us. This is the only book I know of with Safari information like these two examples: To save or e-mail a link, drag the icon that is immediately to the left of the URL. To open a link in a new window behind the current window shift-Command click on it. &quot;I can go to a search results page and open a dozen windows in five seconds.&quot;The section on .Mac apps may be enough to get you to sign up to become a .Mac user.The section on AppleWorks applications is presented as a tutorial. For example the chapter on the AppleWorks database compares records to recipe cards and tells you how to construct an address book which you can easily modify to fit other collections. There is a minor error where it advises you to use a character field for a telephone number and a number field for a ZIP code.

He lived every moment of his life to the fullest extent and loved every second of it! He embodied the same ardent zest in the boxing ring, watching birds, being a cowboy, traveling the world, and leading America to its debut as a superpower. Yet, the one role that brought him the most satisfaction among the many diverse parts he joyously played was that of family man. Although he sedulously guard their privacy, enough references exist to reveal the power he derived from his family's love.The timelessness of ideals can be witnessed again and again in Roosevelt's detailed autobiography, and the parallels to modern day America as are striking as they are plentiful.In one instance of foresight Roosevelt lambastes so-called \\"party bosses\\"--those who manipulate a community, \\"a man who does not gain his power by open means but by secret means and usually by corrupt means.\\" He points out that \\"in communities where there is poverty and ignorance, the conditions are ripe for the growth of a boss,\\" and this type of reprobate will be \\"especially common in big cities (because the boss) fulfills toward the people of his district in rough and rowdy fashion the position of friend and protector.\\" From these snippets of his dissertation, it's easy to wonder if somehow President Roosevelt boarded a time machine and met Al Sharpton. A more thorough description of the unordained reverend (and his many counterparts throughout history) cannot be found than this astute indictment.He expounds at some length on the president's scared privilege of dispensing clemency and stresses the there \\"nothing more necessary from the standpoint of good citizenship than the ability to steel one's heart in this matter of granting pardons.\\" (How he must have spun in his grave at Clinton's going-out-of-business pardon sale.) Talking about the anguished imploring of family members (which caused him great anxiety) and the bumptious attempted influence by friends of celebrated criminals (which caused him great anger), Mr. Roosevelt realized that this presidential prerogative should only be used to advance the cause of justice. The remote possibility that pardoning could be abused (a reality that did not develop at the presidential level until 100 years after his term) made him think that life imprisonment was a poor substitute for the death penalty. In a related vain, he saw the insanity plea as a scurrilous cop out; \\"I have scant sympathy with the plea of insanity advanced to save a man from the consequences of crime, when unless that crime had been committed, it would have been impossible to commit him to an asylum for the insane.\\"Spotlight-adoring Senator John McCain routinely invokes the memory of President Roosevelt, presumptiously implying that he is somehow the heir apparent to the early 1900's maverick. Examining Teddy Roosevelt's life shows that those similarities exist almost solely in the Arizona senator's mind. While Roosevelt's unwavering integrity made him unpopular, at times, with many in his own party, McCain fluctuating political postures seem to occur primarily to generate headlines. The former president justifiably felt tremendous self-respect--a byproduct of adhering to probity's rubrics. The Arizona senator self-serving pandering for popularity would be comical were it not so insulting that the philodox so willingly slanders a bona fide American icon to further his own career.Ironically, this reviewer read Roosevelt's disdainful view of abortion on January 22--the anniversary of the Supreme Court's infamous Roe vs. Wade decision. Discussing the crimes where even receiving a request to consider a pardon assaulted his sense of decency, he listed, \\"rape, or the circulation of indecent literature, ...\\"white slave\\" traffic (prostitution), or wife murder, or gross cruelty to women and children, or seduction and abandonment, or the action of some man in getting a girl whom he had seduced to commit an abortion.\\" To President Roosevelt there was no other plausible reason why a woman would kill her unborn child. Some would call him sexist today, but the venom he felt (and the punishment he unhesitantly administered) to the men who committed these crimes should show the fallacy of such a ridiculous accusation.Topical comparisons can be found in his discussion on the importance of both corporations to maintain ethical practices and for the government to refrain from needless meddling in business matters. Futhermore he offers a reasoned dialectic on immigration, strongly supporting it but trenchantly articulating that establishing tight limits can be sensible rather than xenophobic.It is also refreshing to know that the irresponsible peaceniks vociferously denouncing America's full-scale war on terrorism have had their equally harebrained doppelgangers throughout history. To all of these possibly well intentioned pacifists, Teddy Roosevelt admonishes \\"the true preachers of peace...never hesitate to choose righteous war when it is the only alternative to unrighteous peace.\\"Similarly regarding the current threat America faces, Mr. Roosevelt puts forth some comfort and assurance with an unforeseeable but apt reference to President Bush; \\"no man can lead a public career really worth leading, no man can act with rugged independence in serious crises, nor strike at great abuses, nor afford to make powerful and unscrupulous foes, if he is himself vulnerable in his private character.\\" Every American should be thankful that the terrorists did not strike during the previous administration and also grateful the example of heroes like Theodore Roosevelt stands as everlasting inspiration to our nation's current and future leaders."},{"Title":"Theodore Roosevelt, an autobiography (The library of the presidents)","review":"That was Theodore Roosevelt's description of the plutocrats of his era - bankers and railroad barons chiefly - and it suits the bankers and oil barons of our era just as aptly. What a bizarre moment it was, last night, watching the second presidential debate between John McCain and Barack Obama, to hear McCain declare that Theodore Roosevelt was his \\"hero\\"! Of course, only a few minutes earlier, he'd proclaimed Ronald reagan as his \\"hero,\\" but he had a lot of bases to touch. One has to wonder if McCain knows anything about TR apart from the quote about carrying a big stick. One of the uses of that big stick was to flog those malefactors of great wealth, Senator McCain. Roosevelt was a regulator. There's no doubt which side he would have taken in the recent debate; he would firmly have urged Congress to enact a package of regulations that would make Obama's plans seem quite moderate.To confirm my impressions of Thoedore Roosevelt as the direct progenitor of much of the New Deal and of Democratic platforms from Wilson's to Obama's, I turned directly to his Autobiography, published in 1913, after he left the White House and around the time when he abandoned the Republican Party to join the Progressives. Chapter XII - The Big Stick and the Square Deal - or chapter XIII - 'Social and Industrial Justice' - are both good places to start examining Roosevelt's thoughts about America's subjection to plutocracy, about the necessity of a strong labor movement, and about financial regulation in general. Here are some of his words:\\"By the time I became President I had grown to feel...that government agencies must find their justification in the way in which they are used for the practical benefit of living and working conditions among the mass of the people.... For this reason I felt that all that the government could do in the interest of labor should be done.\\"\\"We passed a good law protecting the lives and health of miners... We provided for safeguarding factory employees... We passed a workman's compensation law...which did not go as far as I wished, but which was the best i could get, and which committed the Government to the right policy. We provided for an investigation of woman and child labor in the United States. Where we had the most difficulty was with the railway companies engaged in inter-State business.\\"\\"It is unjust that a law which has been declared public policy by the representatives of the people should be submitted to the possibility of nullification because the Government leaves the enforcement of it to the private initiative... It should be the business of Government to enforce laws of this kind [regulations! Think ahead to the second Roosevelt's issues with the Supreme Court!] Ever since the Civil War very many decisions of the courts...as regards the application of great governmental policies for social and industrial justice, had been nothing more than ingenious justifications of the theory that these policies were mere high-sounding abstractions... The tendency of the courts had been, in the majority of cases, jealously to exert their great power in protecting thsoe who least needed protection and hardly to use their power at all in the interest of those who most needed protection.\\"\\"It was an instance of the largely unconscious way in which the courts had been twisted into the exaltation of property rights over human rights, and the subordination of the welfare of the laborer when compared with the profit of the man for whom he labored.\\"If you have access to this book, I'd also suggest reading Appendix B, Roosevelt's essay \\"The Control of Corporations and 'The New Freedom'.\\" For John McCain to identify Teddy Roosevelt as his \\"hero\\" demonstrates either utter ignorance of Roosevelt's thought or else utter political opportunism and sloganeering.Roosevelt's Autobiography is spacious, a five-hundred page volume in the somewhat pontifical literary style of his era, but many readers have found it enjoyable and enlightening, myself included. Except for his benighted attitudes concerning race, reflecting the near-universal 'social Darwinist' racism of his era, Roosevelt was economically and environmentally a good deal closer to the positions of Barack Obama than to John McCain. If Roosevelt is to be someone's hero, I claim him for myself."},{"Title":"Theodore Roosevelt, an autobiography (The library of the presidents)","review":"Sorry to be the pooper but this party is so extremely overrated it's sad. Teddy Roosevelt is a man's man and one of my favorite presidents but, at least in this instance, he's a pretty poor writer. I'm sorry to say that I just couldn't stomach the book it was so poorly written and I had to close it after choking down a little over half its contents. I know it must have been very painful for Teddy but he doesn't even mention his first wife, the love of his life, Alice. How can an autobiography be complete with valuable pieces of information missing?If you're looking for a good book try his biography written by Nathan Miller, \\"Theodore Roosevelt, A Life.\\" Miller is a far better writer and seems to capture the Roosevelt that we all know and love.

One should also read Candace Millard's River of Doubt to understand what a magnificent human being he was."},{"Title":"Theodore Roosevelt, an autobiography (The library of the presidents)","review":"There is probably not a president in our history with a more varied background than Teddy Roosevelt. From his early start as a sickly young boy to his rise as President, his life took him through more experiences than most will ever see.There have been many accounts written about Teddy but reading of his personal look at life gives you a totally different look at what happened to him in all those years.It was especially interesting to learn of his early days in the Dakotas as a rancher and basically, a cowboy. He loved the west, hunting and riding.His ruggedness helped him later when he led the \\"Rough Riders\\" in Cuba during the Spanish American War. His experiences during that event are incredible as he fought bravely and led his men to victory.Later years traced his move into politics and his climb up the ladder to Governor of New York and then President.He was a man of his word and fought against corruption and monopolies in business. Yet, he was not anti-business but just fought for fairness. He was also a big supporter of a strong military and spoke out against those who thought they might take advantage of any weakness we might show. To that end, he strengthened our Navy and had them sail completely around the world, showing all nations we were strong. As his famous saying made clear: \\"Speak softly and carry a big stick.\\"One his biggest foreign policy decisions was the building of the Panama Canal. The problems at that time with Columbia's control of the Panama area caused very difficult international problems. You'll find it extremely interesting as to his involvement and eventual completion of that whole affair.His story ends with a look at some writings of a later President, Woodrow Wilson, who was very critical of Teddy's years as President. Roosevelt shoots him down on almost every accusation. Teddy, as always, defends his decisions and years as President very strongly.This is a long read and, at times, a bit slow. But, I guarantee you will find a lot of interesting information and a really wonderful look at one of our most remarkable Presidents."},{"Title":"Theodore Roosevelt, an autobiography (The library of the presidents)","review":"HISTORY REPEATS ITSELF! It takes an extraordinary man like Teddy Roosevelt to take the country from the trusts, the barons of distrust, et cetera. We see the same circumstances after every Republican administration. They take us to war and the Democrats clean up their mess."},{"Title":"Theodore Roosevelt, an autobiography (The library of the presidents)","review":"I am only half way through the book but it is well written and very appropriate for our times.This is a scanned in book and much better cleaned up then the last scanned book that I read."},{"Title":"Theodore Roosevelt, an autobiography (The library of the presidents)","review":"If you've never understood why Theodore Roosevelt is on Mt Rushmore reading his autobiography, published in 1913, will give you a clue. I've read several Roosevelt biographies, but this is the first time I read his words, and I thoroughly enjoyed the book.President \\"T.R.\\" Roosevelt left us in 1919, too young at age 60, but he packed into his adult life an incredible amount of achievements, any one of which could have brought him legitimate acclaim. People remember Roosevelt came to the presidency through tragedy, President William McKinley's assassination. Some remember he was only 42 years of age, the youngest president ever. Some may even remember his \\"Rough Rider\\" days during the Spanish American War of 1898 or his later guiding the construction of the Panama Canal. Maybe some remember him as a big game hunter and founder of the Boone and Crockett Club.Most probably don't remember Roosevelt was a prolific writer, authoring the most books of any president until surpassed by Jimmy Carter. Or do people remember this list of achievements? Roosevelt was nominated by several and should have (but for politics) won the Congressional Medal of Honor for his part in battles in Cuba. As Civil Service Commissioner and later as Commissioner of the New York City Police he led extensive reforms replacing the old spoils system with a merit system for employment. He won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1906 for brokering the end of the Russo-Japanese War.Note: in 2001, Roosevelt was posthumously awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor, making him the only person, let alone president, ever to have won both the nation's top award for bravery in combat and the globally recognized top award for peace.Yet beyond all this, perhaps Roosevelt's greatest legacy can be summarized in the word \\"conservation.\\" Roosevelt contemporary Senator Robert LaFollete paid tribute: \\"And then, there is the great and statesmanlike movement for the conservation of our National resources, into which Roosevelt so energetically threw himself at a time when the Nation as a whole knew not that we are ruining and bankrupting ourselves as fast as we can. This is probably the greatest thing Roosevelt did, undoubtedly.\\"For the record: Roosevelt established the United States Forest Service, 150 national forests, 51 federal bird reservations, 5 national parks, 4 national game preserves, 18 national monuments, 24 reclamation projects, and 7 conservation commissions. He placed approximately 230,000,000 acres of land under public protection, an increase during his presidency of over 400%. As importantly, he nearly single-handedly launched the forest movement, which became the conservation movement, which later developed into the environmental movement. In a word, his record on conservation alone is astounding.Interestingly, several times in his autobiography Roosevelt referred to what he called the \\"right stuff,\\" a set of virtues he believed made people ready to care for their families, to contribute to society, and when the opportunity arose, to lead. In this he predated Tom Wolfe's popularization of the term, The Right Stuff, in his 1979 book on the space program.There's much about Roosevelt's theory and practice of leadership in this book. He speaks at length about taking action, even in the face of risk, and about adopting what he calls a Lincoln-Jackson school as opposed to a Buchanan-Taft view of power, the latter being what today we'd call \\"strict constructionists.\\"Roosevelt said, \\"I declined to adopt the view that what was imperatively necessary for the Nation could not be done by the President unless he could find some specific authorization to do it. My belief was that it was not only his right but his duty to do anything that the needs of the Nation demanded unless such action was forbidden by the Constitution or by the laws...I did not usurp power, but I did greatly broaden the use of executive power. In other words, I acted for the public welfare, I acted for the common well-being of all our people, whenever and in whatever manner was necessary, unless prevented by direct constitutional or legislative prohibition.\\"Roosevelt also said, \\"I bound myself more than ever to treat the Constitution, after the manner of Abraham Lincoln, as a document which put human rights above property rights when the two conflicted.\\" Together with his expansive view of the use of executive power, this concern for the common man, Roosevelt's desire to assure them a \\"Square Deal,\\" and his lifelong interest in helping people--children with physical limitations, Indians, immigrants, and laborers--makes Roosevelt a different sort of Republican than those who dominate the party today. When Roosevelt fought the big trusts and monopolies he noted that he supported corporate leaders when they were \\"right\\" and departed from them when they were \\"wrong.\\" In other words, he aligned himself with principle, not given categories or groups of people, regardless of what they did or how they behaved. Contemporary pols on both sides of the aisle could learn from this.Perhaps the oddest thing about Roosevelt's autobiography is what's missing. While he refers to his family and names at least one of his children and while he speaks glowingly of family life, there's nothing in this account about his losing his first wife and mother on the same day when he was in his mid-twenties. There's nothing about his leaving his daughter, Alice, behind with his sister when he went west to ranch in North Dakota and nothing about later marrying Edith or the five children coming from that union. In contemporary autobiographies family plays a central role. Perhaps in the day when Roosevelt wrote this was not the case. In any event I consider this the one major flaw in the record because readers are not permitted to glimpse how his family life influenced the man or his achievements.My favorite quote: \\"A vote is like a rifle; its usefulness depends upon the character of the user.\\"Contemporary Republicans could learn from Roosevelt: while he affirmed individualism, he did not believe in unfettered individualism or laissez faire. Roosevelt was not afraid to align, when needed, with labor versus management, and he stood up for the common man. He said he'd rather government help a poor man feed his family better than to help a rich man earn more profit for his company. He worked to protect minorities like Indians and immigrants and he had a soft spot for children.Roosevelt's autobiography contains long renditions of things that don't carry present-day import, but mostly it's an engaging read offering some timeless wisdom about politics, leadership, the greatness of America, and the public welfare. I recommend it heartily."},{"Title":"Theodore Roosevelt, an autobiography (The library of the presidents)","review":"Normaly I do not like autobiographies.I would just read them for school.

The read will familiarize you with both the deeds and motivation of President Roosevelt. A biographer can only guess motivation - the autobiographer can make it plain and T.R. does, and this is what makes the read a pleasure. His deeds are familiar to most all and require no reiteration in this review. Regardless of the contemporary reader's political affiliation, most will agree that Theodore Roosevelt was a very remarkable man.Even with the above however, the book reads long for it's 380 pages. And the reason is President Roosevelt's tendency to succumb to sermonizing. Given the criticism any President must suffer, it is not surprising that an autobiographer would use the story as a vehicle to answer, or justify or just enlighten. T.R. was not a man to offer a sentence when a paragraph or page was available, and editing the great man may have cowed his publisher. Even so, by all means read the book if the era or the man is your interest, but be prepared for a slog when T.R. feels that others have it wrong, or need enlightenment. An example:\\"There can be no nobler cause for which to work than that of peace and righteousness; and high honor is due those serene lofty souls who with wisdom and courage, with high idealism tempered by sane facing of the actual facts of life, have striven to bring nearer the day when armed strife between nation and nation, between class and class, between man and man shall end throughout the world.\\" T.R. (page 337)There are chapters that are a delight - e.g. IV \\"In Cowboy Land\\" and those that are drudgery e.g. XIII \\"Social and Industrial Justice\\". The book's value merits five stars, its editing only three, I'll compromise with four.-----kindle edition-----Well done - without the oddities that creep into an e-book format from slap-dash preparation. There is no index or notes, but probably none were composed for the hardcopy either (?). The Table of contents PAGE is not available from the \\"GoTo\\" menu, rather the latest software update displays it right in the \\"GoTo\\" dialog box - an otherwise clever implementation, clumsily negated by omitting the chapter titles - leaving only a Roman Numeral indicator and a page number by which to navigate. Still, this very important book is free - consider the above an observation not a complaint!"},{"Title":"Theodore Roosevelt, an autobiography (The library of the presidents)","review":"Outstanding! This book is a tome of philosophy, adventure, intrigue, and above all, inspiration. Notwithstanding these encomia however, the reader should beware before making a hegira into its noble pages that this autobiography does not follow the traditional structure of a &quot;biography.&quot; Rather it can be described as being a compendium of T.R.'s philosophy on life. The true strength of its pages being found in how T.R.'s experiences and actions staunchly uphold and support his 'vigor of life' and probity which he so often addressed as being fundamental to all good Americans. Accordingly, I suggest a first-time reader of T.R. would be best served by initially reading a more &quot;objective&quot; biography of T.R. (I suggest Nathan Miller's Theodore Roosevelt, A Life) in order to become familiar with the events and time frames involved. This will allow the reader to more appreciate the nature, values and beliefs of the great man as told in this book by the ultimate authority, himself.Along with being completely inspired by a man of such high moral values, the factual anecdotes related in this book comfort you in the knowledge that this hero practiced what he preached. In a speech by his own hand, T.R. embodied his own life; &quot;The credit belongs to the man in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood;...who strives valiantly...who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who have never known neither victory nor defeat.&quot;T.R. was a naturalist, legislator, cowboy, businessman, soldier, author, conservationist, U.S. President, world explorer, and above all an inspirational &quot;doer of deeds.&quot; This book eloquently tells the reader why he felt he needed to perform these deeds and what was going through his mind all the while."},{"Title":"Theodore Roosevelt, an autobiography (The library of the presidents)","review":"Having read several books about TR, I have heard a lot about his writing. Other than reading some of his letters and quotes in books, I had never read any of his work but picked his autobiography up from a used bookstore. I was looking for the Naval War of 1812, but ended up with this instead. I was not disappointed. Some parts of the book definitely dragged and if your patience for legislative maneuvering prior to 1900 in the New York legislature is limited, you might want to skip to the back half of the book. But what comes through in the book are TR's passions: books, the outdoors, conserving the outdoors, and the Navy.The first half of the book is essentially told chronologically. But when TR gets to his presidency, he tells the tale thematically. There are chapters on conservation, trust busting and other industrial issues, and two chapters on international affairs. Unfortunately, the book ends with his presidency and does not go into TR's world travels or his comeback bid in 1912. TR's dislike for his hand picked successor, President Taft, permeates the presidency chapters.As with any autobiography, especially a presidential one, TR views himself as always right and his opponents as always wrong. His views on Taft are a good example of that. But that can hardly be viewed as a failing of the book, since that is a standard characteristic of these types of books.If you want a first hand view of the man in the arena, what he tried to do and how he tried to lead his life, read the book."},{"Title":"Theodore Roosevelt, an autobiography (The library of the presidents)","review":"Witty, quirky, profound, lyrical--this is one of the great American memoirs.

I didn't hate it and if I had the option to give it 2.5 stars, I would take that option.I just finished the book yesterday. TR's long sentences make this a difficult read. If you want to know how TR thought and why, this is the book to read. TR will tell you just about everything you want to know, including every piece of art in his house, furniture, how he plays with his kids, and so forth. If you want the rest of the story about the trust-busting, you really have to read beyond TR's autobiography.TR was constantly referred to as a Socialist and he did not like it. And he tells you so in an appendix but I doubt he really understands what a Socialist is or why the label stuck. All he does is refer you to someone else's work to read about what a Socialist is. Really, TR was a moderate, more like John McCain and Lindsay Graham today and possibly like even Bill Clinton and Evan Bayh. TR advocated big government, not a restricted or limited government, as standing up for the small consumer and using government to come to the rescue to punish the evil corporations. But you do not really know what drove Teddy to think this way, but you do see traces here and there of that Progressive/Liberal ideology starting early in his career in NYC when he told a businessman he would petition to raise his taxes and then throughout the book. You just don't see single instances that shaped Teddy's ideology during his life that made him so nearly anti-business.He takes offense at being called a Progressive but comes back into the spotlight after four years and challenges his former vice president, Taft for the Presidency in 1912. What the hell was he thinking??? In doing so, the Bull Moose put the Republicans out of business and helped put Woodrow Wilson into office. None of this is covered in the autobiography. In fact, the book stops immediately at the end of his presidency. But at the appendix there is a letter penned in 1913 after Wilson's inauguration where Wilson slams TR as a friend of the trusts. Wilson even goes so far as to claim that TR courted corruption from big business interests and TR has to add the appendix to quote Wilson's words and explain the truth according to Teddy.Teddy certainly needs a wordsmith for his book or hire an editor to do that. Too much of the book is just rambling and preaching which made me go through page after page in despair wondering if I would ever finish this book!

In a time when both genres seem to have collapsed into a state where one rarely finds work which isn't some sort of commercial advertisement for childrens toys and tv shows, Jack Vance stands out like a beacon of pure genius. The dying earth is a series of vignettes in the fantasy realm of the same name invented by Vance. Humorous and brilliantly witty, yet darker and in many ways more believable (on a human level) than his space operas, the dying earth presents characters and situations using Vance's unique and eclectic mastery of the english language which sweep the reader away into another world from which it is hard to escape. This, ultimately is what good fantasy should do, and so often fails to accomplish.

This may be a bit too much in the beginning, but it passes quickly.So, here are some things that impressed me in dying Earth.Very impressive spells. Original, inventive, sometimes funny, and always used with perfect timing to push the story forward.Very impressing gore, for a 1950's novel. Deaths of humans (or deodands) are Mr. Romero's dream, and a certain necklace of one's own toes that one has to sew around his own neck sounds like a very creative punishment for any crine.Very impressive landscapes, buildings and flora. Usually, when a writer starts describing the landscape, there's d&eacute;j&agrave; vu and monotony, but not in dying Earth where Jack Vance makes you almost reach out and touch the entropy.One thing that did not impressed me too much in dying Earth: there is a quite simplistic motive throughout the book. If you are good, you will survive (and get the girl). If you are bad, you will die. If you are somewhere in between, you don't belong here.Having said that, 4 stars. Of the 6 stories, Turjan of Miir, Mazirian the Magician, T' sais, Liane the Wayfarer, Ulan Dhor and Guyal of Sfere 2, 5 and 6 are a cut above the rest."},{"Title":"The Dying Earth","review":"The Dying Earth is the first of Jack Vance's Tales of the Dying Earth and contains six somewhat overlapping stories all set in the future when the sun is red and dim, much technology has been lost, and most of humanity has died out. Our planet is so unrecognizable that it might as well be another world, and evil has been \\"distilled\\" so that it's concentrated in Earth's remaining inhabitants.But it's easy to forget that a failing planet is the setting for the Dying Earth stories, for they are neither depressing nor bleak, and they're not really about the doom of the Earth. These stories are whimsical and weird and they focus more on the strange people who remain and the strange things they do. Magicians, wizards, witches, beautiful maidens, damsels in distress, seekers of knowledge, and vain princes strive to outwit each other for their own advantage.What appeals to me most is that The Tales of the Dying Earth are about how things could possibly be in an alternate reality. All speculative fiction does that, of course, but Jack Vance just happens to hit on the particular things that I find most fascinating to speculate about: neuroscience, psychology, sensation, and perception. These are subjects I study and teach every day, so I think about them a lot. One thing I love to consider, which happens to be a common theme in Vance's work, is how we might experience life differently if our sensory systems were altered just a bit. I find myself occasionally asking my students questions like \\"what would it be like if we had retinal receptors that could visualize electromagnetic waves outside of the visible spectrum?\\" (So bizarre to consider, and yet so possible!) They look at me like I'm nuts, but I'm certain that Jack Vance would love to talk about that possibility. And even though The Dying Earth was first published in 1950, it doesn't feel dated at all -- it can still charm a neuroscientist 60 years later. This is because his setting feels medieval; technology has been forgotten. Thus, it doesn't matter that there were no cell phones or Internet when Vance wrote The Dying Earth.I also love the constant juxtaposition of the ludicrous and the sublimely intelligent. Like Monty Python, Willy Wonka, and Alice in Wonderland. [Aside: This makes me wonder how Johnny Depp would do at portraying a Jack Vance character...] Some of the scenes that involve eyeballs and brains and pickled homunculi make me think of SpongeBob Squarepants -- the most obnoxious show on television, yet somehow brilliant. (Jack Vance probably wouldn't appreciate that I've compared his literature to SpongeBob Squarepants. Or maybe he would!)Lastly, I love Jack Vance's \\"high language\\" (that's what he called it), which is consistent and never feels forced. This style contributes greatly to the humor that pervades his work -- understatement, irony, illogic, and non sequiturs are used to make fun of human behavior, and I find this outrageously funny. As just one example, in one story, Guyal has been tricked into breaking a silly and arbitrary sacred law in the land he's traveling through:\\"The entire episode is mockery!\\" raged Guyal. \\"Are you savages, then, thus to mistreat a lone wayfarer?\\"\\"By no means,\\" replied the Castellan. \\"We are a highly civilized people, with customs bequeathed us by the past. Since the past was more glorious than the present, what presumption we would show by questioning these laws!\\"Guyal fell quiet. \\"And what are the usual penalties for my act?\\"...\\"You are indeed fortunate,\\" said the Saponid, \\"in that, as a witness, I was able to suggest your delinquencies to be more the result of negligence than malice. The last penalties exacted for the crime were stringent; the felon was ordered to perform the following three acts: first, to cut off his toes and sew the severed members into the skin at his neck; second, to revile his forbears for three hours, commencing with a Common Bill of Anathema, including feigned madness and hereditary disease, and at last defiling the hearth of his clan with ordure; and third, walking a mile under the lake with leaded shoes in search of the Lost Book of Kells.\\" And the Castellan regarded Guyal with complacency.\\"What deeds must I perform?\\" inquired Guyal drily.If you want to find out what three deeds Guyal had to perform, you'll have to get the book!I listened to Brilliance Audio's production of The Dying Earth and the reader, Arthur Morey, was perfect. He really highlighted the humorous element of Vance's work. It was a terrific production and I'm now enjoying the second Dying Earth audiobook (which is even better than this first one!). By the way, I want to say that I'm extremely pleased with Brilliance Audio for publishing these stories!Jack Vance is my favorite fantasy author. His work probably won't appeal to the Twilighters, but for those who enjoy Pythonesque surreal humor written in high style, or for fans of Lewis Carroll, Fritz Leiber, and L. Frank Baum, I suggest giving Jack Vance a try. If you listen to audiobooks, definitely try Brilliance Audio's version!"},{"Title":"The Dying Earth","review":"This is an unusual book. Considered by some to be a novel, it was nominated for the Retro Hugo in 2001 for novels written in the year 1950, it is really a collection of short fiction works based on a single premise and all of which were published for the first time together. This book clearly had a large influence on the fantasy role playing game, Dungeons and Dragons, as the way wizards memorize and use spells seems to have been taken directly from these stories, and even some of the spell names are similar. The series of stories was also ranked 15th in 1998 on the Locus All-Time poll for fantasy novels before the year 1990.The book consists of six shorter works of fiction. In some cases, characters will appear in more than one story, but there are other stories which do not contain any common characters at all. While it gains some notoriety from the influence it has had, the stories themselves are not all that special. Some of the marketing for this series seems to imply that there is a blend of science and fantasy, but that really isn't the case. The stories are good solid fantasy stories, but there are no scientific themes included.1) \\"Turjan of Miir\\" is the short story which opens the book. Here we meet several characters which will appear in some of the other stories. In this story, Turjan is seeking the key to bringing intelligence to his vat creatures, and that leads him to seek out Pandelume in the land of Embelyon (which is not on Earth). There he also meets T'sais, a beautiful creation of Pandelume who suffers from a defect which causes her to see only ugliness and evil. He makes a copy of her (T'sain) without the defect, and the two of them return to Earth. This story introduces key characters, but isn't much of a story in itself.2) \\"Mazirian the Magician\\" is a novelette length story. It opens with Turjan as the prisoner of Mazirian, who is seeking the knowledge which Turjan learned in Embelyon. He becomes distracted by a woman (T'sain) who appears to be spying on him, causing him to delay his torture of Turjan as he pursues T'sain. T'sain artfully leads him into danger, forcing him to use up his powerful spells to stay alive. This is an enjoyable story, and the perils through which she leads Mazirian are clever, however, the lack of the reader's knowledge of the world is problematic.3) \\"T'sais\\" is another novelette length story, detailing T'sais journey to Earth to try to find beauty. There she finds evil and ugliness until she meets a man (Etarr) who hides his face, due to being cursed with the face of a demon. In him she finds beauty, and she helps him in his attempts to recover his lost visage. An interesting premise, but the story loses some of its focus near the end.4) \\"Liane The Wayfarer\\" is a short story based on a character that appears briefly in \\"T'sais\\". Liane is determined to have a beautiful woman (Lith) and to do so he intends to serve her and then turn the tables on her. His service requires the recovery of half of a golden tapestry which has been stolen by Chun the Unavoidable. This is a very clever short story, and is certainly one of the best in the collection.5) \\"Ulan Dhor\\" is a novelette length story which is completely separate from the others in the collection. Ulan Dhor is the nephew of a prince, and is sent to try to recover some ancient magic in what is supposed to be a lost city. There he is to find two tablets which when put together will reveal the magic that is there. The information which he is given is supposed to be thousands of years old, and tells of two rival factions each of which guards one of the tablets. When he gets there, he finds that little has changed. This is an interesting story, and is well setup. The ending is perhaps a bit weak, but it is entertaining.6) \\"Guyal of Sfere\\" is a novella length story, and like \\"Ulan Dhor\\" it is completely separate from the rest of the collection. In this story, Guyal is on a quest to find the Museum of Man and its curator who is purported to have knowledge of all things. He carries with him a charm which protects him as long as he stays on the path of his quest. He makes it through most of his journey, until he meets the Saponid. When he accidentally breaks one of their laws, he finds that he is forced to be part of one of their rituals which will send him into the Museum he seeks, but also to his likely death. Once again it is a well setup story, but I did find the end to be somewhat predictable.This is a decent collection, although I do not consider it to be more than a 3-star book. Those who play or have played Dungeons and Dragons might enjoy reading the stories which inspired some of the game mechanics. It is true that Vecna from the game was chosen as a name because it is an anagram for Vance. There are some good solid early fantasy stories here, but nothing to measure up to Tolkien."},{"Title":"The Dying Earth","review":"I am a great fan of Jack Vance, but this is not one of my favourite works. I find the characters opaque and unlikeable. Vance's verbal pyrotechnics remain spectacular, of course. But I far prefer later Vance such as the 'Lyonnesse' series, the 'Cadwall Chronicles' ('Araminta Station' et seq.), and the 'Alastor' novels. These contain heroes who are likeable as well as dauntless, and romantic interests who are loveable as well as beautiful. For people who like 'The Dying Earth', I suggest 'Cugel's Saga', 'Eyes of the Overworld', 'Rhialto the Marvellous', and 'Showboat World'. People who find the characters of 'The Dying Earth' repellent, or the language over-elaborate, should try 'Araminta Station' (SF) or 'Lyonnesse I: Suldrun's Garden' (Fantasy) before they give up on Vance."},{"Title":"The Dying Earth","review":"Any attempt to convey even a vague sense of the wonder and beauty of Jack Vance's writing in this book is doomed to failure.

Read and be enchanted."},{"Title":"The Dying Earth","review":"At last a fantasy world that is not a pale imitation of The lord of The Rings or Conan. its amazingly good and unique."},{"Title":"The Dying Earth","review":"A exquisite exotic, as terrible in beauty, and sweet in dreamworlds as any penned since Poe, very much it's shadow. Vance weaves a world as bejeweled in color and fantastique as readers could imagine, in a earth perched at the end of time, while the sun sputters its last gasp. Magic rules, and poor Cugel, its hero wanders from the lilac-flavoured poisons of Mazirian's garden to the autumn-cut glass palaces of the Dying Earth. He is betrayed, bewitched, and perplexed by his environs, all to our joy, and such is his adventures that we hope for more, but it takes a genius such as Vance to realize it. Some say NIGHT LAMP is his last, but his readers, his children, will reimagine the lost lands of this book long after he is gone, perhaps to the end of this incredible, dream-haunted journey."},{"Title":"The Dying Earth","review":"_The Dying Earth_ (1950) is a \\"fixup\\" novel of six related stories set on an exotic, colorful, far future Earth. One of the stories, \\"Liane the Wayfarer,\\" was originally published in _Wolds Beyond_ in 1950. The other five tales first saw the light of day in _The Dying Earth_ itself.The original book publication by Hillman attracted little attention when it first appeared. Today, I find it incredible that a book as hauntingly beautiful as this one could have escaped instant fame-- but it is so. Gradually, however, its reputation grew. It is now considered a fantasy classic-- and rightfully so.The Earth is the \\"character\\" that dominates all of the stories. The planet is now incredibly old. The sun is now feeble and red, flickering in a purple sky. Continents have changed. Most of the old cities have crumbled to dust. There are a few thousand individuals left on Earth, some human and many nonhuman. There is ancient evil and and distilled decadence afoot:Turjan hesitated and then opened his eyes. It was night in white-walled Kaiin, and festival time. Orange lanterns floated in the air, moving as the breeze took them. From the balconies dangled flower chains and cages of blue fire-flies. The streets surged with wine-flushed populace, costumed in a number bizarre modes. Here was a Melantine bargeman, here a warrier of Valdarine's Green Legion, here another of ancient times wearing one of the old helmets. In a little cleared space a garlanded courtesan of the Kautchique littoral danced the Dance of the Fourteen Silken Movements to the music of flutes. In the shadow of a balcony a girl barbarion of East Almery embraced a man blackened and in the leather harness as a Deodand of the forest. They were gay, these people of waning Earth, feverishly merry, for infinite night was close at hand, when the red sun should finally flicker and go out. (9)Yet there are a few who seek some kind of goodness against the coming night. Turjan of Miir strives to find it in magic. \\"I find herein a wonderful beauty,\\" he says. \\"This is no science, this is art, where equations fall away to elements like resolving chords, and where always prevails a symmetry either explicit or multiplex, but always of a crystalline serenity\\" (13).Young Guyal of Sfere, though he he is not fully aware of it, is practicing the long lost discipline of science:As Guyal grew to youth, this void in his mind, instead of becoming limp and waxy, seemed to throb with a more violent ache. And so he asked:\\"Why do people die when they are killed?\\"\\"Where does beauty vanish when it goes?\\"\\"How long have men lived on Earth?\\"\\"What is beyond the sky?\\" (89)The beautiful T'sais has been created with a warped personality which causes her to see all things beautiful as ugly and all things good as evil. But when she meets her sister T'sain, she has a revelation that changes the course of her life:T'sain stepped forward, put her arms around T'sais, and kissed her.\\"You are my sister and I will love you.\\"T'sais' face froze. Rend, stab, bite, said her brain, but a deeper surge welled up from her flowing blood, from every cell of her body, to suffuse her with sudden pleasure. She smiled.\\"Then--I love you, my sister. I kill no more, and I will find and know beauty on Earth or die.\\" (16)The sharp-eyed reader may have noticed that Vance employs a baroque style of writing similar (but not identical) to that of Lord Dunsany. One story in particular seems to be fairly imitative of Lord Dunsany in terms of of plot as well: \\"Liane the Wayfarer\\" (chapter 4 of the novel). It's the one in which a clever, ruthless thief seeks a fabulous prize but is betrayed in a rather nasty double-cross. Liane reminds me a lot of Cugel the Clever of later Dying Earth tales.Most of the stories in _The Dying Earth_ are quest stories. Sometimes the quest is made as the result of a bargain with someone else. Liane agrees to a quest in the hopes of winning the favors of the beautiful blond witch Lith (though with a name like that, he should have been warned). Turjan accepts a quest to gain knowledge from the magician Pandelume. Prince Kandive the Golden sends his nephew, Ulan Dhor, on a quest from their home city. Some quests (like those of Guyal and T'sais) are personal in nature and are undertaken in order to resolve an internal conflict or defeat a personal demon. A few quests fail. Many eventually succeed, though not in a manner that the questers might have predicted. Two quests are resolved by a _deus ex machina_-- a god who comes out of the machinery to mete out justice. But most of the time, conflicts are resolved in a less arbitrary manner.The last two chapters of the novel-- \\"Ulan Dhor\\" and \\"Guyal of Sfere\\"-- are novella length stories that are much more originally plotted than chapter 4. They are the best tales in the novel. Both stories end with a hint of hope. To be sure, Vance does not follow through with this ray of hope in his later Dying Earth tales. But that qualified optimism is here, sure enough. And it enriches the book."},{"Title":"The Dying Earth","review":"This is one of the all-time great classics which every reader of science-fiction and fantasy should have. In many ways it is a brilliant example of what one could term science-fantasy sharing aspects of both genres.

The Pocket books paperback you're probably looking at is a reprint from March 1977.The six stories are interrelated and share many of the same characters.It's fantasy fiction, with wizards and monsters and so forth. It's a short book, though: 146 pages. One thing that's kind of annoying is that there's one of those heavy card stock cigarette ads right in the middle of the book (for Kent and Newport) that can't be removed. They used to do this with mass market paperbacks in the 70s. Thank God that went out of style.It's a bit confusing at first: Vance gets right into his world and all the names and allusions can be quite disorienting, especially when you realize that no clarification will ever be forthcoming (e.g., you never get any specifics on why the world is \\"dying\\").However, the writing is superb. If you can get into it, it's quite a feast for the imagination and Vance proves himself a capable wordsmith. I am not alone in my high opinion of this book: in 2001 it won a \\"retro-Hugo,\\" an award designed to recognize superlative SF that was overlooked or unappreciated at the time of publication.I actually read this through twice. It's not that it contains a lot of deep, subtle lessons. It's that it's such a pleasure to be in the hands of someone who's got such a disciplined style with English.Note that Vance's conception about how wizards know and use spells was seminal in the Gygax's conception of them when he created Dungeons and Dragons with Dave Arneson."},{"Title":"The Dying Earth","review":"The Dying Earth represents Volume 1 in 'Tales of the Dying Earth' and provide stories packed with fantasy settings and ideas.

I am an abstraction, an emotion, the ooze of terror, the sweat of horror, the shake in the air when a scream has departed.\\" I can't think of a better, more arresting sentence than this, and the book is filled with prose in this highly polished style.

Reading it again I am not quite as impressed.

The author's reply to Freud's criticisms is devastating.I found it interesting to learn that Freud was a Lamarckian. According to this book, Freud felt that the genetic theory of inheritance hadn't caught up to his theories. Science knew then and it certainly knows now that psychic trauma cannot be inherited. Freud's theory of iherited guilt feelings resembles in a way Augustine's theory of inherited Original Sin.The Jung section was interesting but ultimately unsatisfying. He views Jung as a Berkleyian or Kantian idealist reducing everything to experience. I don't think this is fair to Jung. Jung's thought is not so one-dimensional.My take on Jung is that the spiritual quest is fundamental and that the quest is mythic in scope. The occasional Berkelyian or Kantian window dressing Jung gives his quest are inconsequential and not important to Jung's thoughts. I can understand why those who would like to pigeon-hole Jung latch on to this aspect of his thought, but it is like dwelling on the frame of the Mona Lisa and forgetting about the content of the picture.Jung regarded himself as trying to pursue a middle way in spirtual matters, not literal like the fundamentalists or reductionist like Freud or 19th century materialists. The author's arguments that Jung failed in this endeavor are not entirely convincing.There are books that are more sympathetic to Jung and also better books in my opinion. I highly recommend -- Transformation of the God-Image by Edward F. Edinger and Jung and Christianity: the Challenge of Reconciliation by Wallace B. Clift. Wallace B. Clift is very critical of Jung's views that God has a dark side but is also very informative.Having said all this; I must say Palmer's book was a very enjoyable read, a real page-turner in fact which is rare for a philosophy book, written extremely well and with great clarity."},{"Title":"Virtual Beauties 2020: The Ultimate 3d Graphic Collection","review":"This is a great galley of Japan's most talented CG artists.

This story was written in the late 1800's so the wording may be a little different from modern books, however, when I read it at 9 years old I had no problem with it what-so-ever.

Savio's style is nearly arrived, but his voice is fully developed. The stories, while mixed in subject, all bear the kind of savage melancholic imprint I associate with masterpieces of modern remembrance literature, particularly Latin American ones like Fuentes' Distant Relations and Elena Poniatowska's Querido Diego.... Don't get me wrong, the Fairy Flag is it's own thing and you won't find in it a writer who has carefully mimicked anyone. But Savio has managed to strike that rare zone in me that is usually only stirred by scents from my past, old photos, once loved songs, obituaries of ones I knew long ago. Read this book."},{"Title":"The Brave Bulls","review":"A page turning novel that was delightfully filled with love, gore, deceit, disappointment, and honor. I fell in love with the story, the countryside, the matadors, and the life of all those who watched, who veered, who cried, who cheered, and for the men - their friends and families - as each stood facing into the mirrored eyes of their destiny. You must pick it up and read it for yourself if you're a thrill-seeker!"},{"Title":"The Brave Bulls","review":"I first read Tom Lea's The Brave Bulls in a Penguin edition in the middle 1950s and was captivated by its description of the life of an itinerant pair of Mexican bullfighter brothers as they travel and work around the bullrings of Mexico in the late 1930s or 40s. The description of the ritual and significance of the bullfight and the contrast between the poetic ideal and the gritty reality is very strong, but it gives the gringo reader an idea of the appeal of this rather one-sided sport. I bought a recent copy through Amazon to give to my son who had just seen a bullfight in Madrid and wanted to know more about the subject. Highly recommended, though maybe a period piece by now."},{"Title":"The Brave Bulls","review":"I was a little surprised to receive a book marked &#34;discard&#34; and the public library that discarded the book.

Again, the fact that the bulls never see a human on foot until they meet in the ring I personally found very interesting."},{"Title":"UNDER THE BRIGHT LIGHTS","review":"Daniel Woodrell is probably not a household name unless you are at my house. I confess up front that Woodrell is top five on my list of living crime writers. So even though this, his first novel, may have a few holes, I enjoyed it nonetheless primarily due to his fabulous gift of prose.Rene Shade, a retired professional boxer of dubious talents, is now a detective on the Saint Bruno police force. His family has strong ties to the community with one brother a city attorney and the other the owner of a rough and seedy watering hole frequented by the who's who of local criminals. Shade's mother operates a pool hall (above which Shade lives) and his father is only a rumor, having long ago abandoned the family to pursue his gambling career.In this story our hero is assigned to investigate the murder of a local black political boss. Within moments of surveying the crime scene in the victim's home he knows that this was a premeditated kill and not a burglary gone wrong, the conclusion the Mayor wants drawn. However, rather than following his superior's instructions to find it a random shooting, Shade and his partner, How Blanchete, investigate what they know to be a political hit.The plot and pacing is good but leaves a few fizzled plot lines such as the conflict between Shade and his attorney brother who expects the investigation to be quickly resolved to the Mayor's satisfaction. This confrontation is set up early but is never revisited or resolved. Other seemingly important characters are introduced and then disappear without re-emerging.However, the somewhat pedestrian plot is far outshined by Woodrell's words. He is such a powerful writer that the other shortcomings seem unimportant. The sharp dialogue is authentic, blending nicely with the steamy, fetid southern bayou atmosphere that is also done so well by James Lee Burke. While Shade himself is a strong main character, the rookie hitman, Jewel Cobb, is equally terrific as a best supporting actor. Woodrell paints the perfect picture of a nieve young country boy who thinks he has what it takes to dish out violence and crime in the big city. The brash and foolish Cobb soon collapses under the pressure of actual violence meted out by actual bad guys.Under the Bright Lights is a strong start for a terrific writer. The contrast of lyrical wording and raw violence are well mixed for a fabulous read. Even if you never go on to enjoy any other works by Woodrell (and I strongly urge that you do) this book can stand on its own as a terrific example of southern literature or what the author refers to as \\"Country Noir.\\""},{"Title":"UNDER THE BRIGHT LIGHTS","review":"Not long ago a friend of mine, who is a famous writer and great writing teacher, told me that Daniel Woodrell deserves to be listed among the best contemporary English language writers. Not in the U.S., but the world. Not in crime, mystery or thriller, but all categories.I've now read everything Woodrell has written and I agree that he is something else altogether. I started at the beginning and read each in order and he gets better every book. When is he going to be famous and sell like mad? I don't know, but it has to happen. Read him now, so you can tell your pals that you knew him when."},{"Title":"UNDER THE BRIGHT LIGHTS","review":"Reason for Reading: I am in the process of reading all of the author's works. This is his first book.Being Woodrell's first book, this is very different from what he has become known for, that is his Ozarks fiction of poverty ridden families. \\"Under the Bright Lights\\" is the first in a trilogy of hard-boiled Philip Marlow-esque, deep south, southern fiction, police procedural crime stories. Quite a mix of genres there that is a little clumsy for a first time writer, but pulls together nicely by the middle of the book and shows where Woodrell is going to go with his future books. Set in fictional Saint Bruno, the state is never mentioned, but the geographical clues lead me to believe we're looking at Louisiana.Rene Shade is the main character, a police Detective, once former boxer, who made it to the championship, but lost. Small rather rural town-city where everyone knows everyone Shade can't live down his boxer reputation which has its perks as wells as cons, being an upholder of the law now. This is a mystery where we are first introduced to the killer, his kill and his flight and we then follow the police as they search their way through the clues and intuitions to discover that killer. But as often happens, one murder leads to another and Shade has his hands full. We are sent into the underbelly where we find semi-crooked politicians, porn kings, gangs (the new mafia-type controllers of the city) territorial gang fights and those who get involved in this seedy world. A violet book, sad and brutal. It did take me some time to get into it but once I did I was hooked. The main theme revolves around the French gang versus the Black gang with Shade and the police caught in the middle trying to catch the culprit behind all the killings, not necessarily just the trigger man.A good book if you enjoy noir mysteries or Southern fiction mystery. Word to the sensitive though, the book does contain a lot of racist language (the n-word and equally offensive descriptors for other ethnic groups) which while unpleasant is totally in sync with the times and these particular characters. I've enjoyed the two Ozarks books read so far, but this was interesting and shows the author's raw talent. Will be interested to see how he develops as an author over the course of the next two books in the trilogy."},{"Title":"UNDER THE BRIGHT LIGHTS","review":"Real people with bones, sinew and brains. Not exceptional brains, just some local ability to think. Humans. Woodrell writes to us, we're in the bar, smelling the dank smoke, sweating in the heat, tasting the tension and the drinks. Maybe this gift is the difference. Writers that don't invite us in behind the curtain, that use words and method to obscure the story, like a Hollywood fog machine, don't have the gift to change reality. One scene in particular reflects this. A character is about to be killed, knows it, and rather than write the scene to horrify us with the means, we get to shut our eyes with the victim and accept that end. Over. Nasty, brutal, but the reader is released, too. All the characters in this piece are drawn straight out with a thick drawing pen, no smudging, no gaussian blur, no fog machine. I'll read everything Woodrell has out there, and be glad he shares his gift."},{"Title":"UNDER THE BRIGHT LIGHTS","review":"A great start to a great series!

In fact, considering that English was his fifth language, I believe, he is a beautiful and spell-binding writer. As a writer myself, I am amazed by him.This was a revolutionary book which launched the revisionist work of such men as Courville, Bimson, Rohl and James in rewriting ancient Egyptian history.Velikovsky's work was condemned for several reasons: 1) he was the first since Isaac Newton to do it (Really!); 2) he dared to use the Old Testament Scriptures as historical texts (If you can imagine!); 3) after publication of his catastrophist theory in Worlds in Collision, everyone \\"knew\\" he was a crank; and 4) he was obviously wrong.Well, as his appendix to Peoples of the Sea adequately demonstrates, the conventional dating scheme has no basis whatsoever; the Old Testament has been amazing verified and vindicated by archaeology back to the middle chapters of Genesis, and no archaeological discovery has ever proven a biblical passage wrong; in some ways he may have been a crank, but so was Newton (who believed in alchemy); and he has as much chance of being right as anybody else, and more than most.The only point I quibbled with was his identification of the Papyrus Ipuwer as an Egyptian version of the Exodus story written by Moses in the Book of Exodus. This was critical because it was the pivotal point of his entire reconstruction. In that, he was correct, but my analysis of the Papyrus Ipuwer (read it on my website at [...]) showed that it was not exactly an Egyptian version of Moses' story. Ipuwer wrote Act II of the drama about which Moses had written Act I and skipped town across the Red Sea.So Velikovsky's identification of the papyrus was wrong, but his use of it was correct. He makes an excellent case for the Hyksos being the biblical Amalekites, for Hatshepsut being the Queen of Sheba, and for Thutmose III being the pharaoh who sacked the Temple in Jerusalem after Solomon's death. Dr. V also did a fabulous analysis of the El Amarna letters and connected them to the Egypt of the Pharaoh Akhnaton.Highly compelling reading, as are all of his books."},{"Title":"From the Exodus to King Akhnaton (His Ages in chaos)","review":"Although Ages in Chaos was written in the 1950s, it is very convincing in explaining the need for science to synchronize the chronology of Middle East nations reaching back to 1500 B.C., and especially the chronologies of Egypt and Israel in Old Testament times.Current archeological studies in the Holy Land indicate catastrophic events did occur throughout the Middle East sometime around 1200 B.C.that caused the collapse of all cultures for centuries. This author has linked the cuneiform clay tablets of other cultures with events recorded in the Old Testament and has found events can be synchronized down to the names of rulers involved on both sides. To me it was a fascinating study."},{"Title":"From the Exodus to King Akhnaton (His Ages in chaos)","review":"This is Velikovsky at his best. Ages in Chaos reconnects the disjointed strands of Egyptian and biblical history in a masterful way. This book is a joy to read, and should have formed the foundation-stone of the reconstruction of ancient history. Ages in Chaos does contain errors, but these are of a comparatively minor nature, and called for fine-tuning, rather than complete rejection. In choosing the latter course, the critics threw out the baby with the bath-water.Throughout Ages in Chaos Velikovsky demonstrates the need for a five-and-a-half century reduction in Egyptian Eighteenth Dynasty dates, to bring them into line with those of the Old Testament. His identification of Hatshepsut, for example, with the Queen of Sheba (who visited Solomon) was absolutely correct, as was his equation of Thutmose III with Shishak, the pharaoh who plundered the Jerusalem Temple. Attempts by the critics to pick holes in these pivotal synchronisms have proved futile. The suggestion, for example, that Punt (the destination of Hatshepsut's famous expedition) was in Africa (made by David Lorton and John Bimson), is fairly easily refuted, as I have shown in several places. The \\"African\\" creatures shown on the Deir el Bahri reliefs, which the critics made so much of, were all anciently found in Syria/Palestine, and most especially in the Jordan Valley. To this day, the flora and fauna of the latter region, with its tropical climate, is described as typically \\"African\\".The only significant misidentifications in Ages in Chaos came in the chapters dealing with Akhnaton and the Amarna Letters. Velikovsky argued that Abdi-Hiba, the King of Jerusalem at the time, was the same man as Jehoshaphat, and that the King of Hatti who threatened northern Syria in the time of the Letters was Shalmaneser III. Neither of these identifications can be sustained. In fact, a veritable mountain of evidence shows that the King of Hatti in the time of Akhnaton was Suppiluliumas I, whilst the King of Assyria, who actually wrote several letters to Akhnaton, was Ashuruballit. Neither of these characters can be identified with Shalmaneser III. However, although Velikovsky got it wrong here, it is important to stress that he was wrong by only a couple of decades. As I have demonstrated in some detail in various places, Ashuruballit of the Letters was the same person as Ashurnasirpal II, the father of Shalmaneser III. In the same way, Abdi-Hiba of Jerusalem was not Jehoshaphat, but Jehoshaphat's father Asa. Furthermore, Labayu, the troublesome king of Shechem, whose activities caused much harm in the region, was one and the same as Baasha, the warlike king of Israel who caused so much trouble for Asa.The layout of Ages in Chaos was therefore broadly correct with regard to biblical history. However, it was not, as can easily be shown, correct with regard to classical history: For the classical and biblical histories are not accurately aligned and are out of sync with regard to each other by two centuries. Thus all the characters and events described in Ages in Chaos, Vol. 1, need to be moved down the timescale, lock, stock, and barrel, by a further two centuries, to make them synchronize properly with ancient history as recorded by the Greeks. This can be illustrated most easily with regard to the Mita or Mitanni, the Indo-Iranian rulers of Upper Mesopotamia in the time of Egypt's Eighteenth Dynasty. These folk can only have been the Medes, whose Great Kings dominated the Near East during the seventh century BC.This then is the correct location of the Theban pharaohs of the Eighteenth Dynasty, as well as the Early Monarchy of Israel, with whom the latter interacted. Hatshepsut therefore did not visit Solomon in 940 or 930 BC, but closer to 700 BC."},{"Title":"From the Exodus to King Akhnaton (His Ages in chaos)","review":"Velikovsky's thesis in Ages In Chaos is that the history of Ancient Egypt is out of synchronisation with Biblical and Scriptural history by around 6 centuries. By comparing the history of Egypt from the Exodus of the Israelis in around 1495 BC which was accompanied by global cataclysm that changed the surface of the planet (see Worlds In Collision & Earth In Upheaval) to the time of Akhnaton with Biblical and Scriptural, and other, sources, Velikovsky is able to prove the truth in his assertions and thus answer many questions the answers to which have long been considered unsolvable riddles by historians.Like Velikovsky's other works Ages in Chaos is hugely absorbing and makes such perfect sense, and is backed up by so much evidence, that it is impossible to ignore. It is easy to see now why Velikovsky was seen by the academic community as such a threat to the status quo - quite simply because the corrected version of history he presented is far more believable, more complete, and backed by more evidence than the accepted - obviously incorrect and certainly incomplete - version of history on which so many academics have built their reputations.

Ages in Chaos reads like a mystery, with the author attempting to find the link, the place where the two histories come together. With a breathtaking depth of research, he places the Exodus at the end of the Middle Kingdom, and connects the Biblical stories with events known from Egyptian history.

He understood everything about how to write a book but didn't understand his subject: Humans. Humans tend naturally to evil (Sorry :-( ) He intended for man to better himself but how? Have you ever read \\"Notes from Underground\\" written by Dostoyevski? That's the real human being driven by his own base instincts!For those of you who equal this book to Hitler and his nazis you are wrong! Nietzche intended a superhuman endowed with celestial qualities not a bunch of thugs and murderes as Hitler and his \\"friends\\" were. He, I'm certain, would be horrorized by what the nazis did and interpret and to what use they put his famous work. In my humble opinion, Nietzche didn&ntilde;t live long enough to understand how vile humans can be."},{"Title":"Thus Spake Zarathustra","review":"To start off with, the Walter Kaufmann translation is by now well known to be probably the authoritative edition of Zarathustra (although the excerpts I've read from the Del Caro Cambridge Texts edition seems to be perhaps a more beautiful style). One of the reasons I originally picked up this edition was because the only translations available over the web were the droning and pedantic Thomas Common versions which are not only dull but muddled. Walter Kaufmann's translation gives a degree of clarity that far surpasses the Common translation, cannot speak to all the differences (however large or small) between it and the Del Caro version.The book isn't particularly long, but Nietzsche fills it with metaphors and parables in addition to simple narrative and merriment. This is one of the challenges of the book: you're forced to figure out what is meaningful from what isn't and on top of that what each metaphor means. Nietzsche has never been in the habit of going into intricate detail or clarifying what he's saying to the same degree as some other thinkers, and although the book is a stylistic masterpiece (with narrative deliberately done in a biblical style and herein lies one of the advantages over the Common translation, namely that Common translated everything to mimic the King James version with an overabundance of \\"thees\\" \\"thous\\" and \\"ests\\") the philosophy is at times difficult to comprehend. Again, it's not difficult in the sense that the Critique of Pure Reason is difficult, or at least not nearly to the same degree, it is difficult because it is at times cryptic.Additionally, I've seen a lot of reviews suggesting reading Nietzsche just for the pithy phrases or the beauty of the work. And while the work is indeed a very beautiful piece in places and is often quotable (and even considering Nietzsche was very big into each individual making his own meaning, creating his own path or values), I'd caution you against that approach. Although the book has a strong \\"make your own way\\" line of thought, that doesn't preclude understanding the ways of others.I will admit that this is a contender for one of the more difficult books I've ever read (up there with Kant, though Nietzsche's previous and subsequent books are by far easier to understand). I've noticed that numerous readers recommend reading the book a second time. I'd say that might be useful, but it would take someone with either a lot of free time on their hands or someone with a very great degree of insight to grasp the meaning of each part of this work. What I found useful was having read other works by Nietzsche first. Before reading Zarathustra (which I read for the first time when I was 15 at the urging of a friend who was taking political science and philosophy in college) I had already read On the Genealogy of Morality and Human, All Too Human. My recommendation is to read at least one of Nietzsche's other books, preferably a couple. I'd suggest making Beyond Good and Evil one of your choices. By doing this, you will have already been introduced to Nietzschean philosophy and will be able to more readily grasp the symbolism used.Even if you don't choose that approach, you should get the main lines of thought, specifically the eternal recurrence of the same, the overman, and the glorification of struggle, in the work. Either way, this book is a landmark work in the history of philosophy and deserves to be read."},{"Title":"Thus Spake Zarathustra","review":"Friedrich Nietzsche was a &quot;failure&quot; in his time. He was branded a nihilist and heretic and his works dismissed as the ramblings of a mad man. After the Great War many philosophers such as Heidegger resurected the works of Nietzsche and Kierkegaard (to name a few) and studied them with greater admiration. We should be thankful that the works of such an imaginative genius such as Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche was called into the spotlight. Nietzsche constructed one of the most original and radical philosophies in all its history, as challenging to everyday life as Karl Marx. His ideas still send shockwaves through the Christian community because so much of what he says is blatantly obvious and true. Most people dismiss Nietzsche's slogan that &quot;God is dead&quot;, but in this work Nietzsche truly refines this statement and incorporates brilliant ideas about living for the Earth, striving to become Der Ubermensch and the path to release from Christianities chains. The main theme of this book is that which Nietzshce will probably be best remembered for, but for all the wrong reasons. Nietzsche's vision of the &quot;Superman&quot; (der Ubermensch) was an idea that his sister, in co-operation with Hitler, twisted to begin the Nazi experiments for the Superrace. The Superman is at the centre of this book and Nietzsche gives a perfect description of his vision and furthermore what it will incorporate and help to abolish. It soon becomes clear that Nietzsche's Superman is far different from Hitler's, furthermore because it is not as brutal and inhumane and lastly because it centres around completely different principals: HItler wanted a physical Superman, but Nietzsche's Superman would be MENTALLY strong rather than purely physically. THe language in this book is amazing. Whether Walter Kauffman's translation has buttered it up or not is beyond my capacity to comment on, but the poetry (not prose) that Nietzsche uses is comparible to the likes of Shakespeare. The ammount of metaphors that Nietzsche draws is immense, and he beautifully illustrates all his main points without a single drawing. This is a brilliant masterpiece, whether you agree with every point that Nietzsche makes (and few do) you will still be able to appreciate the beautiful poetry. And still, how ever much you may disagree, this book is thought provoking and seems to shake your entire world upside down. It is far more preferal to Anton Scanzor LaVey &quot;interpretation&quot; of the Nietzschean philosophy in &quot;the Satanic Bible&quot; and is a must-read!"},{"Title":"Thus Spake Zarathustra","review":"Nietzsche's Thus Spoke Zarathustra is probably his most famous work as well as being the work least popular among readers. This is probably partially because it is written in fictional form. Zarathustra is well designed to frustrate twentieth century philosophy of the analytic tradition, which seeks conceptual clarity at the expense of rhetorical form, indeed often insisting on the separation between a concept and the vehicle of its expression. Moreover, the utilization of the work by the Nazi war effort did little to improve the books reception in the Anglo-American world.The book is philosophically interesting, in part because it does employ literary tropes and genres to philosophical effect. Zarathustra makes frequent use of parody, particularly of the Platonic dialogues and the New Testament. This strategy immediately places Zarathustra on a par with Socrates and Christ--and as a clear alternative to them. The erudite allusions to works spanning the Western philosophical and literary traditions also play a philosophical role, for they both reveal Nietzsche's construct of the tradition he inherited and flag points at which he views it as problematic.Much of the book consists of Zarathustra's speeches on philosophical themes. These often obscure the plotline of the book. The book does involve a plot, however, which includes sections in which Zarathustra is &quot;off-stage,&quot; in private reflection, and some in which he seems extremely distressed about the way his teaching and his life are going. Zarathustra attempts to instruct the crowds and the occasional higher man that he encounters in the book; but his most important teaching is his education of the reader, accomplished through demonstrative means. Zarathustra teaches by showing.Zarathustra stands in he tradition of the German Bildungsroman, in which a character's development toward spiritual maturity is chronicled. Zarathustra can be seen as a paradigm for the modern, spiritually sensitive individual, one who grapples with nihilism, the contemporary crisis in values in the wake of the collapse of the Christian worldview that assigned humanity a clear place in the world.In the popular imagination, Nietzsche's idea of the Ubermensch is one of his most memorable and significant ideals. However, the concept of the Ubermensch is actually discussed little in the book. The topic is the theme of the first speech in &quot;Zarathustra's Prologue,&quot; which he presents to a crowd gathered for a circus. The audience interprets Zarathustra as a circus barker and the speech as an introduction to a performance by a tightrope walker. The concept is mentioned recurrently in Part I as something of a refrain to Zarathustra's speeches. But the word Ubermensch rarely occurs after that.Additionally, the notion of the Ubermensch is presented in more imagistic than explanatory terms. The Ubermensch, according to Zarathustra, is continually experimental, willing to risk all for the enhancement of humanity. The Ubermensch aspires to greatness, but Zarathustra does not formulate any more specific characterization of what constitutes the enhancement of humanity or greatness. He does, however, contrast the Ubermensch to the last man, the human type whose sole desire is personal comfort and happiness. Such a person is the &quot;last man&quot; quite literally, incapable of the desire that is required to create beyond oneself in any form, including that of having children.Zarathustra's opening speech, besides proposing the Ubermensch as the ideal for humanity also places emphasis on this world as opposed to any future world. In particular, Zarathustra urges that human beings reassess the value of their own bodies, indeed their embodiment. For too long, dreaming of the afterlife, Western humanity has treated the body as a source of sin and error. Zarathustra, in contrast, insists that the body is the ground of all meaning and knowledge, and that health and strength should be recognized and sought as virtues.Another prominent theme in Zarathustra is its emphasis on the relative importance of will. In part, this emphasis follows Schopenhauer in claiming that will is more fundamental to human beings than knowledge. However, Nietzsche stresses the will's attempt to enhance its power, whereas he views Schopenhauer as placing greater stress on the will's efforts at self preservation. Nietzsche's famous conception of will to power makes one of its few published appearances in Zarathustra.Much of the plot of Zarathustra concerns his efforts to formulate his idea of eternal recurrence. At times, the idea possesses him in the form of visions and dreams. At others, he seems reluctant to state it categorically or to accept its implications. During a particularly despairing moment, he shudders at the implication of his doctrine that &quot;the rabble,&quot; the petty people who comprise most of the human race, will also recur. The fact that Zarathustra objects to the recurrence of the rabble is indicative of Nietzsche's elitism. Consistently, Nietzsche and Zarathustra contend that human beings are not equal. Nietzsche objects to the democratic movements of his era in favor of more aristocratic forms of social organization that would place control in the hands of the talented, of necessity, not the majority."},{"Title":"Thus Spake Zarathustra","review":"This is one of those books filled with those ideas that you've thought all your life but few have the courage to admit, even to themselves.Nietzsche takes a brutally honest look at human nature including the uglier things. He rightly shows no mercy towards clergy and the morality of self negation and pity. All is done in a beautiful, poetic style.The moral of the story is to be above the masses, to go above your limits and to enjoy yourself while doing it. Its a positive philosophy that if implemented can make someone that rare person who rises above the herd and makes their short time on this earth worth it."},{"Title":"Thus Spake Zarathustra","review":"This translation is quite old (now public domain) and riddled with substantial errors.

More enjoyable, too..."},{"Title":"Thus Spake Zarathustra","review":"Nietzsche advocates social change in order for humankind to rise above its present deplorable condition. He says that God is dead and is no longer a model for moral leadership. He counsels us that redirecting our focus from the unknowable to the knowable will guide us towards the journey to humankind's next incarnation - the Superman. In order to begin this evolutionary journey we will first have to experience a great revulsion at the current human condition. In this \\"hour of great contempt\\" we will deny all of our previous, favorable conceptions concerning happiness, reason, virtue, justice, sympathy, and sin. Instead, we will embrace over-going, down-going, despisers, earth-worshipers, seekers of practical knowledge, workers, inventors, true virtue, altruists, achievers, and free spirits.Nietzsche believes that all of the present, negative social trends will culminate in the most contemptible of all beings - the last man - who is no longer capable of despising himself. This last man will live in a condition which he has helped create of fear, false happiness, pleasure-seeking, working as a pastime, over-concern for the feelings of others, egalitarianism, and cleverness without wisdom. Further, once the last man evolves, the social environment that has created him (and he has also, reflexively, created this environment) will be somewhat permanent because it will tend to absorb all differences of opinion, merge them into a consensus, and reflect them back into society through an opinion-shaping filter of egalitarianism voiced in politically correct terms. In a moment of irony, the crowd called-out to the sage, Zarathustra, to \\"make us into these last men.\\"It is arguable that the last man is alive and well in contemporary society, and that the intellectual, social, and regional diversities which once generated the rich and vibrant hues of the American canvas are being replaced with a drab, homogeniety of sterile sameness. Nietzsche feels that the ultimate, inevitable revulsion against and overthrow of the kingdom of the last man will give rise to its polar opposite - the spiritually elevating, authentic world of the Superman.The author has an almost compelling thesis, however, his bipolar construct ranging from the last man to the Superman seems to minimize the fact that objective reality represents only a small group of choices from an infinite pool of alternatives. The world will not long march to the tune of a single drummer, be he the last man or Superman, because of how unchanging human nature is constituted. A first constant of human nature seems to be that we are well aware of our own situation, but only remotely aware of others' concerns. A second constant seems to be that we will, on the average, tend to maximize our chances for immediate personal benefit over chances for potentially greater long-term gain. Therefore, we will, on balance, tend to act in ways which maximize our own short-term self-interest. We probably always have and likely always will. If history is any guide to the future, attempts to reshape the world modelled after the vision of a Superman (or even the last man) will be morphed to unrecognizable dimensions by the unfolding, collective self-interest of individuals in the day-to-day process of following their own, personal stars.Although I feel that Nietzsche's prescribed alternatives are distortions of reality through oversimplification, misdirection, and projection to a whole from a subset, his work is a highly-influential, excellent read."},{"Title":"Thus Spake Zarathustra","review":"This book is a cheap knock-off of a classic text. No translator. No editor. No indication that the book is an authoritative resource for serious readers of Nietzsche. Don't be fooled by the price, because you really get what you pay for in this case: a very poor quality book."},{"Title":"Thus Spake Zarathustra","review":"Thus Spoke Zarathustra, which was distributed among the German army and read by Hitler, has been long misunderstood. Walter Kaufmann, whose translations of Nietzsche's works are the best available, has been somewhat successful in helping us interpret this great book.Friedrich Nietzsche tried in this book and others to undermine the prevailing ethics, namely those of Christianity. Christianity, Nietzsche (and later, Martin Heidegger) believed, stemmed from the moral teachings of Socrates; even modern science is derived from them.Nietzsche is the great critic of modern times. He worried that communism would lead to a horrible homogenization of culture and an overextension of the bourgeoisie (which he hated). Throughout Zarathustra, he praises war, the warrior's spirit, cruelty, vanity, etc.- all things denounced by Christianity. This is not so much to bring about &quot;new&quot; values but rather a re-evaluation of all values! Both Nietzsche and Heidegger went back obsessively to the pre-Socratic philosophers, searching for alternatives.But Nietzsche does not scorn Socrates; on the contrary, he praises him as the &quot;pied piper&quot; full of &quot;prankish wisdom,&quot; terms Nietzsche also applies to himself. And Nietzsche really is on the level Socrates: both are great, prankish, wise, critics of their times and both are philosophers. Both help us understand how to live (and, more importantly, how to die), though there are disagreements between the two. But Nietzsche brings up the great questions of our times: are OUR values the best? should we find others? should we begin anew? Read Zarathustra if you care to explore these things.Also, for those interested, I recommend Werner Dannhauser's &quot;Nietzsche's View of Socrates,&quot; the section from Allan Bloom's &quot;The Closing of the American Mind&quot; called &quot;From Socrates' Apology to Heidegger's Rektoratsrede,&quot; Heidegger's &quot;Being and Time,&quot; and of course, the rest of Nietzsche's books."},{"Title":"Thus Spake Zarathustra","review":"The only other western philosophical text as importnat as this book is Plato's &quot;Republic.&quot; We have once again arrived at the cross-roads of Heraclitus v/s Paramendides. I wouldn't recommended jumping into it without a good knowledge of the Western philosophical traditon and religious traditions. (Zarathutra himself calls learning ALL this backround information &quot;the spirit of the camel&quot; or first taking on the burden of knowledge before going about anything else. To not take on this &quot;burden of knowledge&quot; is the main flaw of most Nietzsche critics and mis-understanders.) Also, Nietzsche was an anti-systemic philosopher so it demands to be viewed/critiqued in a different way than traditional philosophy. To begin to grasp Nietzsche's &quot;Zarathustra&quot; I would to recommend first reading his earlier works starting with a couple of short essays. The first one is &quot;Truth and Lie in a Non-Moral Sense&quot; which is about human language, logic and the all-too-human need for these &quot;lies.&quot; The other essay is &quot;Homer's Contest&quot; which reveals his legacy as starting from the early Greek tradition.Some important things to know about this book to avoid the common misinterpretation that Nietzsche is just a Atheist/Nihilist with a superiority complex:-pay very close attention to his critque of mind/body dualsism and what he proposes otherwise.-The &quot;Overman&quot; is a conception that only looks toward the future. Later in the book Zarathustra supercedes the &quot;Overman&quot; idea with the cyclical concept of &quot;Eternal Recourence.&quot; Even Zarathustra himself has a hard time confronting this view of life and existence. Also, don't make the mistake that eternal reccourence is just a &quot;telos,&quot; it is not. Zarathutra speaks in parables not absolutes.-One of Nietzsche's most favorite authors was Emerson (who also used the name &quot;Zarathutra&quot; in his some of his writings) and their ideas/project have mainy similarities.-The idea of the world/life not being worthy without a metaphysical world behind it is exactaly what Nietzsche was aimed at overcoming.-Don't over-simplify will-to-Power as will-to-Overpower.-Think hard about this being a &quot;book for all and none,&quot; think very hard.-Plato's &quot;Sun&quot; is replaced with &quot;sun&quot; of the Self. This &quot;sun&quot; is the &quot;dancing star.&quot; For some odd reason, I see few people mention the signifcance of Self-love in &quot;Zarathustra.&quot; This is KEY in understanding where Nietzsche is going/taking us.-Nietzsche isn't worldly political like the Republic, instead he symbolically speaks of the battle of modern human soul in political terms.As far as translations go, I prefer Kaufmann over Holingdale because he pays more attetntion to the nuances of Nitezsche's word play. But I would recommend reading more than one translation and getting the best out of all of them.I also would recommend getting some familiarity with the symbols of alchemy and other mystery traditions. Just as Nietzsche turns Plato's &quot;Theory of the Line&quot; and &quot;Allegory of the Cave&quot; upside-down, he also turns these &quot;mystery&quot; symbols inside-out. No longer is it a connection with anything &quot;beyond&quot; the world that makes it valuable. Instead,It becomes conections with body and the world. &quot;The mind is a herald of the body.&quot; For example, consider the &quot;ouroboros&quot; as a symbol of &quot;Eternal Recurrence.&quot; In some sense, Zarathutra was very much a prophet of holism as opposed to strict dualism. Carl Jung's 1,500+ page incomplete study of &quot;Zarathura&quot; is a testement to the richness of Zarathustra's symbolism.If you can catch a deep enough glance, this book will change your life. And if you keep re-reading it, it will keep on changing your life."},{"Title":"Thus Spake Zarathustra","review":"This book does not have any easy answers. It is not the purpose of the book. The purpose of the book is to make the reader think for themselves. I find the book a comforting read - it gives hope and meaning to everyone that is dissatisfied with the answers given by organized religion, political parties, or just the usual howling mobs of sheep that think that just because they are members of a group they are wolves.Nietzsche probably understood suffering and loss better than most, but he also understood hope better than most. True spiritual strength does not come from religious dogma or membership of a group. It comes from within, we all have it. For Nietzsche the only eternal truth is that we should always work for our betterment. We need no God or Leader to tell us what to do. In the end Nietzsche wants us to reject even him - he cannot tell us what we should do!It can be said that horrible crimes have been committed in Nietzsche's name, but can we ignore that even more horrible crimes have been committed in God's or Allah's name? Or in the guise of \\"the common good\\" so favoured by our politicians?"},{"Title":"Thus Spake Zarathustra","review":"When Friedrich Nietzsche published THUS SPOKE ZARATHUSTRA in 1883, his readers did not know exactly what to make of it. It seemed to be a hybrid of philosophy and literature, both of which were presented in a further hybrid of prose fiction, biblical parody, and even poetry. It did not sell well--at least at first, but before too many years had passed his readers acknowledged it as his masterpiece. Its influence on future writers and intellectuals--like Shaw, Mencken, Dreiser, London, Kierkegaard, Dostoevsky, Derrida and others--has been unmistakable. Its basic plot--if one may call it that--relates to a man called Zarathustra who has spent the last ten years in seclusion meditating atop a mountain. He descends so that he may impart his accumulated wisdom to the world of ordinary folk. It is the content and mode of his interactions with his listeners that form the structure of the book.In the book's four sections, Nietzsche through Zarathustra discusses, relates, and enlarges upon such diverse topics as the death of God, the Will to Power, the Ubermensch (\\"Superman\\" or Overman), the revaluation of values, and the doctrine of eternal recurrence. In Nietzsche's mind, these topics are not so divergent at all. At various points they merge, overlap, and interweave into a tapestry that forms the basis of Nietzsche's essential world view that for far too long the human species has been running downhill since the classical Greeks and Romans. Humanity as he saw it then was badly in the need to regenerate itself into a higher order of being--the Ubermensch. THUS SPOKE ZARATHUSTRA is the working out of this transition between homo sapiens and homo superior.When Zarathustra descends from the mountain top to begin Part I, he declares that God is dead. But he does not mean that he is expressing some new form of atheism. Rather, he suggests that whatever God may have been in the past or what kind of support He may have once provided, man now must not rely on any hope of divine intervention. Thus, the only salvation that man can expect must be from within himself. Man himself is presented as a species in progress. The future man which Zarathustra calls the Overman is one that must purposefully be bred into existence. The Overman is the hope of present day man: \\"I teach you the overman,\\" Zarathustra exclaims. \\"Man is something that shall be overcome.\\"In Part II, Nietzsche elaborates on the will to power. This \\"will\\" is a direct result of man's realization that with the death of God and the resulting requirement that man must look only within himself for support that man must exercise his will over himself. There is an unfortunate current belief that Nietzsche meant \\"will\\" only in the context of dominion over others, but for him, the ability of the Overman to control his own base passions was the key distinction between the exalted self of the future Ubermensch and the lowly rabble that he despised.The third part introduces a full explanation of eternal recurrence. Nietzsche believed that this universe was one marked by an inbuilt lack of order, structure, and design, thus positing that man himself is neither good nor evil. In fact man is doomed or fated to relive each moment of existence in a cycle with no beginning or ending. And what keeps getting repeated is everything--matters of the highest import, of the lowest and all else in between. It then becomes incumbent for all human beings to act as if they are worthy to relive each moment of repeated life. It follows that this entire theory implies that humanity thereby affirms the worth of its collective existence.The fourth and final part emphasizes Nietzsche's belief in the wholeness of his entire philosophy. One cannot accept this part or that part and reject some other part. For man even to hope to make the transition from his current lowly state of bovine existence to the higher realm of the Overman, he must prove worthy by acknowledging that the death of God is a brutal necessity to spur him on to bravery, independence, and unyielding will. The very end of the book is a stark reminder that in the symbol of the donkey god man no longer needs the falsely comforting illusion that he needs an omnipotent deity to control his destiny. The Nietzsche of popular culture may believe in the need for a dominant and superior mind as charged, but the Nietzsche as a proto-Nazi is simply unwarranted."},{"Title":"Thus Spake Zarathustra","review":"Not the easiest book to read, but the ideas contained within it are well worth the effort of trying to understand them."},{"Title":"Thus Spake Zarathustra","review":"I am not a student of philosophy and this is my first book to read by the author.

I liked the parts where Zarathustra says that \\"Man has killed God with his indifference,\\" and also, on a more sociological note, \\"It is not that our institutions are no good anymore; it is we who are no longer any good for our institutions.\\" I can sort of relate to those sentiments, at least, and whether one agrees with many of Zarathustra's statements or not (and actually, despite my reservations about the book's style and presentation, I found I often agreed with what Zarathustra says) the book certainly stands as one of the most dramatic, visionary, and uniquely personal philosophical works ever written."},{"Title":"Thus Spake Zarathustra","review":"Coupled with the Gay Science, Zarathustra reveals that there is more to Nietzsche than anti-liberal and anti-Christian no-saying.

Nietzsche's seminal work also provides insight into his views on his own status vis-a-vis &quot;the new philosophers&quot; he describes: he sees himself as the bridge to the overman, but only a bridge because of his inability to totally escape Christian-dominated metaphysical constructs.

However, I find his works, particularly Zarathustra, lacking in 'philosophy' and more as evidence of a man who led a very sad life.There are certainly elements from the work deserving to be preserved, if not simply for their historical significance. Among other things, the almost Kantian criticism of belief in the supernatural in Part One still bears relevence.A chief complaint, however, is that the exact character of the Superman is vaguely defined. He is a man who must assign his own meaning to life and define his whole existence by his own 'virtue', and thus grow beyond good and evil. However, how is one to choose his own virtue, and what is to happen when virtues conflict? Zarathustra speaks of going to war for one's virtue, but what exactly are we to interpret from this?More than anything, though, I find this book lacking in style. It is very hard to comprehend because of the tedious metaphors, allegories and symbolisms. Every point is also expounded in excess. Once I finally dragged myself through this text, though, I found myself disappointed at what was to be found in the writings of this 'great philosopher'."},{"Title":"Thus Spake Zarathustra","review":"Nietzsche has been said to be one of the greatest influances on modern philosophy, especially the existentialist movement and Zarathustra shows the reader just why he was a large influance.

I do enjoy Nietzsche's argument against modern Christianity and the herd mentaility of the masses, but I think those two things would have to be my favorite philosophical views of Nietzsche. I give this book and Nietzsche in general, three stars because, while he will be an influance and is a good read, his philosophy is not the greatest at many points and is often misunderstood by people."},{"Title":"Thus Spake Zarathustra","review":"Thus Spoke Zarathustra (R.J. Hollingdale's translation) is quite simply one of the least enjoyable classics I've ever read. It was a chore to get through the 330+ pages and what I was constantly hoping would get better, never did. TSZ attempts to espouse many aspects of Nietzsche's philosophy through, for the most part, meaningless riddles and analogies. You won't understand even half of what Nietzsche's trying to tell you. When I read a book I expect to be able to at least understand the plot or message. TSZ was overall a waste of time.There are a couple of redeeming points to consider. Nietzsche's &quot;Superman&quot; philosophy is interesting and he goes into some detail on the inadequacies of man today and what the future Superman will be like. According to Nietzsche, God created everything but then died sometime in the past out of pity for humanity's imperfections. The Superman race will one day come out of man and be perfection in mind and body. Also, Nietsche has unique viewpoints on many aspects of life: work, family, friendships, etc. The fraction of a time that Zarathustra speaks coherently, he's interesting.The problem is, Zarathustra spends the vast majority of his time preaching in gibberish and poor poetry. 80% of the dozens of topics in TSZ are practically unreadable. I understand that the original work is German and many of Nietzsche's plays on words cannot be translated properly. However, I can't imagine even the original German prose making much sense to a fluent German speaker.Here's an excerpt typical of the prose found throughout the novel, from the section &quot;On the Blissful Islands&quot;: &quot;Truly, I have gone my way through a hundred souls and through a hundred cradles and birth-pangs. I have taken many departures, I know the heart-breaking last hours. But my creative will, my destiny, wants it so. Or, to speak more honestly: my will wants precisely such a destiny. All feeling suffers in me and is in prison: but my willing always comes to me as my liberator and bringer of joy. Willing liberates: that is the true doctrine of will and freedom - thus Zarathustra teaches you. No more to will and no more to evaluate and no more to create! ah, that this great lassitude may ever stay far from me!&quot;Hmm, so he wants to will and create, but doesn't want to feel? What's his point? He's not making sense here. Now imagine 80% of the book written in mediocre prose like that and you have an idea of what you're getting into. It would have been far better if Nietzsche had simply written a clear one-paragraph summary of Zarathustra's point at the end of each section. Then you could go back and interpret better what Z was talking about. I've read a whole bunch of classics and have a large library of them.

But no price is too high to pay for the privilege of owning yourself.\\"-NietzscheNietzsche, the man who predicted the war and chaos that resulted from Europe's enthusiastic unchecked embrace of nihilism, is presenting the basics of his philosophy through Zarathustra.This mock-gospel, philosophical work is Nietzsche's criticism of mass movements or dogmas in general, and in particular he mocks the concept of a holy scripture through the story of Zarathustra. After ten years of solitude, Zarathustra, like a modern day Moses, descends from the mountain with the hope of teaching the people love and wisdom and helping them become ubermensch. . To become an ubermensch, one has to be free from all human prejudices, group moralities and create his/her own values and purpose.Zarathustra's teachings include the ubermensch or the enlightenment stage, the concept of will to power, the fear of the pointless eternal recurrence, and the understanding that mass movements are for the weak who can't think for themselves and as a result they take the easy escape route to religion, nationalism, democracy or some other movement.By the end of the day, Zarathustra is saddened by his inability to move this \\"herd\\" of people and decides to focus on those who choose to separate themselves from the \\"herd\\".Zarathustra ends up teaching his philosophy to people who choose to follow him and work toward achieving the ubermensch/overman stage. In \\"Beyond good and evil\\", Nietzsche covers the same ideas in more depth and completes this philosophical theory.Understandably, in a time when Christianity lost people's faith to Nihilism and science, Nietzsche like others, saw an urgency to restore faith and values, but unlike any other he tried to create a new set of faith and values.For the longest time Nietzsche was accused of being an atheist, but when the believers are acting contrary to the morals of their religions, only the courageous, such as Nietzsche, dare to question and seek the truth. Doubt is the road to faith just as uncertainty is the motive to search for truth. Nietzsche, the man who said: \\"In truth, there was only one Christian, and he died on the cross\\", wouldn't dismiss religion itself, only the practice of its adherents.Thus Spoke Zarathustra, which was written during a time of physical and emotional deterioration in Nietzsche's life, is as chaotic and unpredictable as his health. At a time, when humanity needed a moral code, Nietzsche's ideas were a bright beacon of hope that no one believed or understood, \\"Thus spoke Zarathustra.\\" is indeed \\"A book for none and all\\"."},{"Title":"Thus Spake Zarathustra","review":"In a sometimes manic delirious style, Friedrich Nietzsche expresses, now vehemently than poetically, his vision on life, man and woman, good and evil, freedom, \`natural' laws and institutions (State and Church).LifeReal life is selfishness, the lust to rule, the will to power and sex. One should do nothing \`for', \`in order of'' or \`because'. War and courage have accomplished more great things than love of the neighbor.Good and evilMan should create his own laws of good and evil. He must destroy the existing values: \`Can you be your own judge and avenger of your law? Beware of the good and the just!

We should prepare the emergence of an \`bermensch'.Eternal recurrence (contradictio in terminis)Nietzsche's theory of the eternal recurrence is in contradiction with his wish of the emergence of the \`bermensch'.With an unforgiving, arrogant, haughty, foaming and aggressive voice, using shining metaphors (sun, moon), pastiches (sermon on the mount) and poems, Nietzsche shouts his anger with and disappointment of the lack of courage of mankind.Some of his viewpoints (the extermination of the weak, his misogyny, his worship of war) are unacceptable.Nevertheless, this is a great text, a cry for freedom, a head-on attack against the fetters of religion and statism, which had an enormous influence on world philosophy, politics and literatureA must read."},{"Title":"Thus Spake Zarathustra","review":"This product was in great condition and arrived on time.

He calls not just the ideal of Social-Darwinist evolution, but also all liberal &quot;progress&quot; into question.I also recommend that one read most of Nietzsche's earlier works before this one, particularly Human All-Too Human or The Dawn, and perhaps also The Gay Science. Otherwise one is bound to midunderstand most of Zarathustra. Also, I recommend that one abandon all ideals before reading this utterly un-idealistic book: those who search for ideals in Zarathustra, who try to make an ideal out of the superman or anything else in it, will be wrong; this is from Nietzsche's mouth, or rather, pen.This book exhibits for the reader descriptions of various psychological states: esoteric and profound states, which almost none of you are likely to have experienced. Therefore you are almost invariably going to misunderstand the whole book.Nietzsche told his friend Peter Gast that the ability to understand six sentences of Zarathustra is a mark of distinction beyond all others, and one which no modern man is likely to earn."},{"Title":"Thus Spake Zarathustra","review":"To fully appreciate the book, one must first accept that \\"man is the bridge between ape and Overman\\". Nietzsche's core views revolve around the concept that we (the human race) are a mere rung on the ladder of evolution. From ape, to man, to Overman.

Walking among the trees of the forest, he met with a saintly wise man, who had left his holy cot to seek boring knowledge about trivial things: in order, perhaps, to obtain a degree. When the wise one Zarathustra saw this old hermit, he laughed to himself with contempt and pity. Then he cried out in a loud voice: \\"Hath this poor fool not heard?

Thus Spake the Reviewer."},{"Title":"Thus Spake Zarathustra","review":"Neitzsche's writings helped inspire and were used/ misused by the greatest force for Evil the twentieth century knew. This is not a minor charge that can be dismissed by pointing out how the boorish Nazis misunderstood the complex philosopher. There is in Neitzsche an elitist arrogance, and a prophetic superiority, a tone of contempt for the ' masses' and a suggestion that truly it is only for the ' few ' that real life and thought are possible.True, this is one strand and it does not do justice to a great thinker's complex paradoxical and often remarkably insightful thought. But the evil that men do lives after them, and in the file of Neitzsche must too be registered the ' evil done' by those who took his ideas and misused them.That said what is there really to give heart and hope to in 'Thus Spake Zarathustra?\\" Do we want to say Neitzsche is a prophet because like Ray Kurzweill he sees Mankind as a bridge between the ' ape' and the ' super-computer'? Do we want to linger on his cultural definition of Western civilization as being godless and point to the church- empty Europe today as sign of his sociological acuity? Do we wish to look at the Cosmos and say that his 'Eternal Recurrence' shows some kind of possible connection with our sense of ' alternative universes' or with the Indian philosophical understanding of time as vastly beyond our conventional Western frameworks? Do we want to see profundity in the poetical paradoxical or perhaps muddled meaningless utterances of the pseudo - prophetic voice?My sense is that in the deep bottom line of things Neitzsche has not given Humanity ideas, dreams, understandings that can truly help us realize our G-d given goal of sanctifying the universe as a whole, of making a tikkun olam in which we improve the lives and the quality of well- being of individual human beings. What Neitzsche has done I think, is to give the human mind another treasure of thought and poetic brilliance. In this sense I see his gift if to use Kierkegaard's terminology far more in the aesthetic realm than in the moral. In the moral realm I do not have much sympathy for his critique of Christianity, of slave - morality .And this because I believe human kindness and goodness are at the heart of what we are as human beings. And that it is not through contempt of others but rather through helping of them that we most live. For me then the man on the mountain can never be Zarathustra. For me the only mountain is Sinai where the most humble of men, Moses receives the Divine Revelation and then goes forth the second time to help Mankind walk in a way which is kinder."},{"Title":"Thus Spake Zarathustra","review":"Nietzshe's sister, who edited this version, distorted his ideas.

This book operates by association, or more specifically, the associative, and this is the reason it is so powerful. It is reflexive in so far as this operation becomes its subject. If one bears in mind Nietzsche's influential training as a philologist and the burgeoning field of linguistics in the 19thc, as well as an aesthetics of 'performativity' tied to the 'force' of artistic subjectivity in amongst some of those of Nietzsche's circle, such as Richard Wagner, then the allegory he employs can be argued as a kind of acute armature for exploring the obliquity of thought tied to symbols, statements, metaphores, etc, but it is that act of exploration that constitutes the work, not the facts of allegory. This is his persuasiveness, and it comes from Nietszche's study of rhetoric, classics, etc. It is a book about forces, not power, discipline, history, or even subjectivity. The forces or valency of allegory and concept - an immanence within thought - the book does nothing else. The catchy phrases that make it so memorable serve this function. This is not his best work though, as much as it is a step above the 'Birth of Tragedy' which rightly got him ridiculed.

Nietzsche does a remarkable job of presenting many compelling ideas through the words of his prophet Zarathustra: the problem is that atheism is not a base on which any completly rational base can be built. For instance, Razi Zacharias's book, Can Man Live Without God? presents a powerful counter-arguement to Nietzsche's ideas, while it is not centered on Nietzsche so much as Nietzsche's basic philosophy of atheism."},{"Title":"Thus Spake Zarathustra","review":"Nietzsche espouses a desire to create Supermen, who will be superior to modern humans. He vilifies pity, charity and sympathy as being weak and glorifies the warrior and those who would be cruel to create strength in themselves and others. His character Zarathustra speaks in a stilted, medieval way which, I suppose, is supposed to call to mind biblical passages.While I accept the importance of this work as philosophy and classic literature, I have to mark it as 3 stars because I felt this was, to a great extent, the philosophy espoused by Nazi Germany - at any rate, I could see where this formed part of the backbone of their society. I did not really enjoy reading it, although I feel it is important to read as many and as varied works as possible in order that I might learn something new all the time. Read it as a classical work, and as a philosophical masterpiece, but if you are troubled by the history of the Nazis, you will likely find the ideals espoused in this text to be uncomfortable."},{"Title":"Thus Spake Zarathustra","review":"This is the Thomas Common translation of the text. I was redirected here from the much more widely acclaimed Parkes translation. I don't know if this was a mistake or deliberate subterfuge. But FYI, here is what Wikipedia has to say about the various translations available (this entry accords with common scholarly opinion on the translations):English translations of Zarathustra differ according to the sentiments of each translators. The Thomas Common translation favors a classic English approach, in the style of Shakespeare or the King James Version of the Bible. Common's poetic interpretation of the text, which renders the title Thus Spake Zarathustra, received wide acclaim for its lambent portrayal. Common reasoned that because the original German was written in a pseudo-Luther-Biblical style, a pseudo-King-James-Biblical style would be fitting in the English translation.The Common translation, which improved on Alexander Tille's earlier attempt,[10] remained widely accepted until the more critical translations, titled Thus Spoke Zarathustra, separately by R.J. Hollingdale and Walter Kaufmann, which are considered to convey more accurately the German text than the Common version. Kaufmann's introduction to his own translation included a blistering critique of Common's version; he notes that in one instance, Common has taken the German \\"most evil\\" and rendered it \\"baddest\\", a particularly unfortunate error not merely for his having coined the term \\"baddest\\", but also because Nietzsche dedicated a third of The Genealogy of Morals to the difference between \\"bad\\" and \\"evil\\".[10] This and other errors led Kaufmann to wonder whether Common \\"had little German and less English\\".[10] The translations of Kaufmann and Hollingdale render the text in a far more familiar, less archaic, style of language, than that of Common.Clancy Martin's 2005 translation opens with criticism and praise for these three seminal translators, Common, Hollingdale, and Kaufmann. He notes that the German text available to Common was considerably flawed, and that the German text from which Hollingdale and Kaufmann worked was itself untrue to Nietzsche's own work in some ways. Martin criticizes Kaufmann for changing punctuation, altering literal and philosophical meanings, and dampening some of Nietzsche's more controversial metaphors.[11] Kaufmann's version, which has become the most widely available, features a translator's note suggesting that Nietzsche's text would have benefited from an editor; Martin suggests that Kaufmann \\"took it upon himself to become his [Nietzsche's] editor\\".[11]Graham Parkes describes his own 2005 translation as trying \\"above all to convey the musicality of the text (which was not a priority for Walter Kaufmann or R.J. Hollingdale, authors of the best English translations so far).\\"[12]"},{"Title":"Thus Spake Zarathustra","review":"This is cleary a work of passion from a philosopher who said \\"yes\\" to life.

Nietzsche had a torn yet brilliant mind, due to his excessive solitude and health problems.I have read this book three times and I never read a book more then once.

Who do you suppose topped the list? Why, Fred Neitzsche (we're on first names after all those years). Just to be clear, I went to Catholic school. I doubt there are many secular private or public schools that care enough about what students are reading to worry about banning any authors, let alone something as powerful as Neitzsche. (I presume they're more interested in banning books that refer to nipples, racial name-calling, or popular drugs.)Buy this book now, and buy it in a hard cover edition (like this one). This, contrary to what other reviewers suggest, should be your very first Nietzsche. It is a powerful, allegorical tale that will sweep you in with its powerful tone and ideas.

I've read numerous critiques, analysis, and interpretations from scholars on &quot;Thus Spoke...&quot; Understanding Friedrich, his life, and his constant pains, give some insight into what may have underlined his beliefs. I think to best understand &quot;Thus Spoke...&quot; a person should read it at least twice. I believe a reader can take many of the themes and metaphors and apply them to his or her belief system, or personal philosophy. We all perceive things in different ways, and we can take what we want out of this work. Individuality, and the constant question and resistance to organized institutions is what I like to take from &quot;Thus Spoke Zarathustra&quot; as Zarathustra walks along the mountains, trails, hills, and towns, in his quest to think for himself and tell others of his thoughts. The style is direct and the many exclamation points give Nietzsche's points a &quot;shout!&quot; Nietzsche notes the importance of individuality and the dangers of becoming one of the lemming-like sheep that follow the herd, whether it be nationalism, religious zealotry, or the unquestioning acceptance of basic societal norms. Nietzsche rakes Christianity and organized religion over the coals, with knockout punch after knockout punch. Another theme I take from &quot;Thus Spoke...&quot; is that one person's vice is another's virtue, and we should focus on ourselves and what we believe in, and not spend time attempting to have others accept our ways, and certainly now want them to accept us. We should simply do our &quot;own-thing.&quot; One person's goals and values can be, and often are, abhorrent to another person.There is certainly much more to his works, and any person can go deeper than myself, because I read non-fiction primarily. If a person reads this when they are in their late teens or early twenties, perhaps it can help them reinforce who they are. Anyone can benefit from &quot;Thus Spoke Zarathustra&quot; if they allow themselves the opportunity."},{"Title":"Thus Spake Zarathustra","review":"There's nothing I can really add to the number of reviews for Thus Spake Zarathustra.

The book is cryptic, metaphoric, and employs heavy symbolism that will be easily misinterpreted by those who have not invested in Nietzsche's thinking.Better to begin with Genealogy of Morals, or even Beyond Good and Evil (which recounts Zarathustra, but is more accessible), or Kaufmann's \\"Philosopher, Psychologist, Anti-Christ,\\" or begin from the beginning with Birth of Tragedy and follow the chronology of his writings.

To truly understand it you must understand the evolution of his thoughts. Thus Spoke is a culmination of his life, and to realize what Nietzche means, beyond the surface and any preconceived notions you might have, you have to know what built up to this book. I suggest reading: &quot;Nietzche: Philosopher, Psychologist, AntiChrist&quot; to gain perspective on what formed this amazing thinker. The thoughts may seem harsh when they stand alone, but as you begin to see the picture that Nietzche paints, you will find it hard to deny the reality of his thoughts and their implications on your view of the world. In one way he can be seen as a pessimistic &quot;nihilist&quot;; at the same time his thoughts are beautiful, full of hope. Ironic, isn't it?

In many respects, that symbolizes the encounter that most people experience with the typical work of philosophy. The author displays none of his own flesh and blood, but serves as a disembodied brain who analyzes the world as \\"objectively\\" as possible. What is worse, whereas at least the three Gamesters of Triskillion granted Captain Kirk his human impulses, most philosophers demand little flesh and blood from their readers. Instead of having a dialogue, the philosopher simply communicates dryly from one brain-in-a-vat to another. Even though the topic of the communication is often the life and times of mortal man, the nature of the communication is wooden, which means that the readers can feel free to study all sorts of \\"truths\\" but implement as few as possible into their own flesh-and-blood lives.Fortunately, none of the above applies to Nietzsche. His works are as moist as most philosophers' are dry. And nowhere is he more lively than in his creation of Zarathustra. The choice of names of his title character was brilliant, as was the philosophy expressed in this story. But above all elsel, Nietzsche's desire to teach philosophy in the form of a story told by a poetic, passionate character is an inspiration to all of us who wish to write about philosophy but to do so in a way that connects with the human heart, and not merely the disembodied mind.Thus Spake Zarathustra is the prototype of the philosophical novel. I cannot imagine anyone reading it without being touched on all possible levels, regardless of how much of Nietzsche's theses the reader agrees with. Truly, Nietzsche doesn't expend agreement from his reader so much as engagement. If you're not engaged by his prose, you probably need to check your blood pressure."},{"Title":"Thus Spake Zarathustra","review":"In a world of cheap thrills and fast money, Thus Spoke Zarathustra offers an eciting journey into a path very often left dark.

It is not a book for scholars who would simply like to master one more book to add to their arsenal and then to be able to bring it up in coversation to impress people. Zarathustra written in beautiful prose, means everything and absolutly nothing all in one. It challenges all values and offers ideas for one to discover oneself. Never telling one how to discover oneself, but simply that one must leave behind many things to rise out of the depths that are ones emotions, Nietzsche gives anyone looking to enjoy a good book what they want."},{"Title":"Thus Spake Zarathustra","review":"Nietzsche's Thus Spoke Zarathustra remains one of the most powerful and cryptic tomes in the history western thought. Is this a work of philosophy or poetry? Due to the immense power of Nietzsche's writing, it remains highly readable, even for those who are not usually comfortable reading philosophy. In the prologue, Nietzsche describes Zarathustra's isolation in the mountains and his intention to descend so that he can teach mankind. Zarathustra proclaims that God is dead and the overman, the sort of man who has overcome his own nature. Zarathustra proclaims: \\"The time has come for man to set himself a goal. The time has come for man to plant the seed of his highest hope\\" (17). Nietzsche is passing his philosophical project onto Zarathustra as an author might pass his personal impressions onto a fictional character. Zarathustra is a new symbol of wisdom in the modern era; he teaches that man is now burdened with the task of creating a meaning for himself. In Zarathustra's speeches, he speaks of the \\"three metamorphoses of the spirit\\" (25), which include how the spirit becomes a camel, the camel a lion, and the lion a child. For Nietzsche, even the lion of freedom is not sufficient; the child who can create represents the possibility of an overman. Zarathustra says: \\"The child is innocence and forgetting, a new beginning, a game, a self-propelled wheel, a first movement, a sacred \`Yes.' For the game of creation, my brothers, a sacred \`Yes' is needed: the spirit now wills his own will, and he who had been lost to the world now conquers his own world\\" (27). Zarathustra teaches man that God is the result of an act of creation, that man is capable of willing new gods and goals. He says: \\"this god whom I created was man-made and madness, like all Gods!\\" (33). Zarathustra might be called the God of the Body as he claims that it was originally the sick and decaying who hated the body and nature and subsequently created heaven. Zarathustra provides and alternative: \\"Listen rather, my brothers, to the voice of the healthy body: that is a more honest and purer voice. More honestly and purely speaks the healthy body that is perfect and perpendicular: and it speaks of the meaning of the earth\\" (33). Zarathustra warns man of the power of \`Good and Evil,' of preachers of virtues and the soul. However, for all of man's creative efforts in conjuring systems of value, man still is left without a clear goal. Zarathustra concludes the first book by insisting that he will only return when his listeners have denied him, for he desires to cultivate an independence of thought.In the second book, Zarathustra returns and begins to speak about creation and pitying. In the second section (Upon the Blessed Isles), he argues that \\"God is a conjecture; but I desire that your conjectures should not reach beyond your creative will. Could you create a god? Then do not speak to me of any gods. But you could well create the overman [...] of the overman you could recreate yourselves: and let this be your best creation\\" (86). For Zarathustra, creation is the solution to redeem man from his suffering. Additionally, man's will to power is a potentially liberating capacity. In the fifth section, Zarathustra critically examines different conceptions of traditional virtue. He says: \\"you are too pure for the filth of the words: revenge, punishment, reward, retribution\\" (94). After much vivisection and refutation, Zarathustra moves into a discussion of the possible meaning of existence for man in the section On the Tarantulas. Here, he makes a proposal: \\"For that man be delivered from revenge, that is for me the bridge to the highest hope, and a rainbow after long storms\\" (99). Zarathustra warns man to mistrust all who have a powerful inclination to seek revenge and enact punishment.In book three, Zarathustra continues his prophetic teachings to mankind, though he insists that he is \\"Godless\\" (170). He reflects about the absence of having a true audience; one gets the impression that Zarathustra is echoing Nietzsche's loneliness as a largely unrecognized philosopher and writer. He continues with a transvaluation of all values wherein Zarathustra declares the \`three best cursed things,' which are: \\"sex, the lust to rule, [and] selfishness\\" (188). He condemns Christianity's disapproval of these things, arguing that sex represents a happiness of the body, the lust to rule is a variant of the will to power, and selfishness is a mode of self enjoyment. Zarathustra is concerned that the dominant institutions of our time have conditioned human beings to hate and fear themselves. Additionally, he teaches man about man's ultimate purpose, which he describes in the third section of \`The Old and New Tablets,' where he writes: \\"There it was too that I picked up the word \`overman' by the way, and that man is something that must be overcome-that man is a bridge and no end\\" (198). For Zarathustra, a going under is a crossing over, a transition. In this way, mankind is taught to confront his own mortality.In \`The Convalescent,' Zarathustra rests for seven days after a collapse in his cave. He is upset with the animals for watching him in pain, for pain and cruelty (whether it is directed inward or outward) is the greatest flaw of man. It is here that Zarathustra gives his most profound teaching: \\"Alas, man recurs eternally! The small man recurs eternally!' Zarathustra has established his reason for being: to teach the eternal recurrence of the same. All events and beings of the universe have existed an infinite number of times and will continue to repeat eternally. Zarathustra claims: \\"I myself belong to the causes of the eternal recurrence. I come again, with this sun, with this earth, with this eagle, with this serpent-not to a new life or a better life or a similar life: I come back eternally to this same, selfsame life, in what is greatest as in what is smallest, to teach again the eternal recurrence of all the things\\" (221). It is because of the eternal recurrence of the same that mankind should affirm life and will subsequently overcome nihilism. Zarathustra expresses a desire that mankind embrace himself as such, and to be willing to act as a bridge for something greater. He declares: \\"You are mere bridges: may men higher than you stride over you. You signify steps: therefore do not be angry with him who climbs over you to his height\\" (283). According to Zarathustra, it is only since God has died that mankind can be resurrected. In \`On the Higher Man,' Zarathustra announces the life of the overman, an indication of a higher being able to climb over man. Zarathustra announces: \\"O my brothers, what I can love in man is that he is an overture and a going under [...] Overcome these masters of today, O my brothers-these small people, they are the overman's greatest danger\\" (287). Human beings must, in accordance with their nature, be willing to go down in order to go across. They are the bridge to something higher. The thought of eternal return contains many facets and implications. One the one hand, the notion of eternity without the trajectory of a goal and without a definitive close could be viewed as the essence of nihilism or pessimism. However, this is not a complete thought of eternal recurrence. Yet if the thinker understands the relation between nihilism and the eternal recurrence of the same, he can fully affirm life."},{"Title":"Thus Spake Zarathustra","review":"Throughout modern history Nietzsche has been a badly misquoted individual. In real life he has been a profoundly humanist philosopher, urging people not to look into afterworlds for consolation, but to themselves and what shall be their own creating. He is asking the impossible from today's society: that people should acknowledge themselves as their own creators and evaluators, a self-sufficiency feared by today's petty power structures. The length which was taken to express this view on mankind was phenomenal, and Nietzsche stayed undeterred by the fascism of his day. If you have enjoyed any works on existentionalism, you will love this book, quite possibly his finest collection of discourses ever published."},{"Title":"Thus Spake Zarathustra","review":"For those who like to read what a person really said (in context) and not just judge someone based on something that they read about them in time magazine.

The only book I've read recently to rival it is &quot;Notes From Underground&quot;."},{"Title":"Thus Spake Zarathustra","review":"One of the more interesting things about Nietzche is that, as a philosopher, his ideas were always changing - yet popular culture remembers him chiefly as a nihilist. It is in Thus Spoke Zarathustra that he proposes an answer to questions of meaninglessness and devaluation; The Superman. He also touches on eternal recurrence, but only briefly, and only as a means to further justify the Superman. I liked the loose-narrative format of the book - much easier to digest than a pure dissertation, and Nietzsche seems an apt writer of prose. The book itself is a bit on the lengthy side, and feels lengthier still do to excessive reiteration - Nietzche often repeats the same ideas, or explores them multiple times, in different ways. although the work is imbued with eloquence and poetry throughout, it appears that much has been lost in translation. I read the Penguin Classics edition, translated by R.J. Hollingdale, and although the author/translator has written about fifty or so notes on the translation, clever puns and word-plays remain untranslatable - the nuances in language make reading a German copy desirable...if you speak German.This is definitely not a one-or two sitting book, and warrants a thorough read and proper digestion. Many of the passages require that you read and re-read them to fully comprehend what Zarathustra is saying - much is clear but much is spoken in parable and metaphor. This is all precisely what the author intended...I can recommend this book over Beyond Good and Evil, especially as an introduction to Nietzche, as Beyond Good and Evil is probably too self-referencing for the casual reader, but if you can read both, they are good companion-pieces. If you have the time to commit to it, Nietzche's masterpiece is a great read and a call to arms for those willing to command their ultimate will and become Supermen.- Nietzche at his most optimistic -"},{"Title":"Thus Spake Zarathustra","review":"This was my first delving into the wonderful world of Nietsche.

It can be utterly unreadable at times, mostly unreadable the rest of the time. Obviously Common was trying to use the language of the King James Bible; language which was considered out-dated and archaic even when that book came out. But the language admittedly does have a certain force and power to it. Ludovici's afterward at the end can be a good read, as it does show certain ideas, such as the chapter &quot;Young and Old Women&quot;, in a new light, and offers interesting interpretations. But besides that, you'd do best simply getting a different version.Let me just put it this way: if I had paid more than two dollars for this book, I would have felt ripped off."},{"Title":"Thus Spake Zarathustra","review":"Nietzsche brilliantly unmasked various hypocrisies of society and wrote about them. But if you look at his actual life, his reclusiveness, social anxiety, and addiction to opioids, to name a few things, it is kind of a tragedy. He was a talker, not a doer. He thought, but he didn't experience. And once his thought advanced far enough that he realized the need for experience, the tension between his life view and his reality was too much and he broke down. Once the other side of him finally came through, it was too undeveloped for his age. He reveled in his infantile emotional life for a few years and then died.The book is well worth reading. Just take it in full context, knowing Nietzsche as the tragic figure he was, not as the one-sidedly great master some people take him to be.Just my opinion, and only one possible interpretation of Nietzsche's ultimate fate. I am no Nietzsche expert, with this being the only book by him that I've read."},{"Title":"Thus Spake Zarathustra","review":"Nietzsche's great gift to mankind is also his greatest joke and his greatest trap. The idea's in it are facinating and complex and invite endless re-reading. That endless re-reading it both the joke and the trap. The joke is on you if you re-read to learn more about Nietzsche. You should only be reading to learn more about yourself. Remember that N looked for those who would &quot;follow him becuase they wished to follow themselves,&quot; he would teach them to follow themselves, but then, they must go away, wrestle with him, and reject him. After that rejection, he would return with love. Until that rejection, they were still followers, maybe they would come to belive him again, as levels of understanding increased, ('my today refutes my yesterday') but now he would be a guide and not a leader. I suppose one could even re-embrace chistianity but as an awakened one and not as a slave. Remember that N is not telling you what to think, he is telling you that YOU must think and why he thinks like he does. So read him and reject him ( reject him becuase you think, not becuase you are christian) then read him again. Let him become your best enemy and love him not for what he says but for what he makes you become. But then again, don't just take my word for it.as a note on the translation, Kuafmann is probably the best out there. Don't waste your time with Common if you are a cusual reader ( of course if you can read german don't waste your time with either.) However, if you are really hardcore and can't read german than reading more than one translation may give insights as different things may be translated better in one than the other. For example in the prolog Kaufmanns use of the american term &quot;tight rope walker&quot; does not lend the same beuty and clarity to the metaphor as Commons more literal tranlation of &quot;rope dancer&quot; think about it when you re-read the prolog."},{"Title":"Thus Spake Zarathustra","review":"Nietzsche's \\"Thus Spoke Zarathustra\\" is a revolutionary novel. Zarathustra uses ideas presented in \\"The Gay Science\\" and presents new ideas later expanded in \\"Beyond Good and Evil.\\"His writing style embodies a series of paper cuts. He attacks an idea briefly in a section. After a reprieve he comes back to the idea, from a unique perspective, and attacks it again. This continues until Nietzsche completes his argument and prescribes a remedy.The central thesis of Zarathustra is man should overcome himself. Man is enslaved by dogma. Traditional virtues, like unselfishness, piety, pity, and suffering, prevent man from achieving true happiness. Man should cast out dogmatic practices. He should live for himself with passion and gaiety.Zarathustra suffers from the same problems as \\"The Gay Science\\" and \\"Beyond Good and Evil.\\" Nietzsche is quick to attack dogma but his prescriptions are often quixotic. His reasoning often borders on madness and many of his ideas are laughable when compared to modern discussion (ex: his views on women.)Zarathustra remains a testament to Nietzsche's genius."},{"Title":"Thus Spake Zarathustra","review":"Many will link Nietzsche to the idea of nihilism, that once god, morality and all values have been emptied out and thrown out of their pedestals, there's very left to hold on to, and life itself becomes meaningless. Well for Nietzsche, the glass is half-full, and Thus Spoke Zarathustra is a guide on the way to overcome, on how to absolve the self from imposed value systems, seing their limitations and the reasoning behind their existance. What Nietzche preaches through his precepts is for a continuous redefinition of values, eventually to see them as arbitrary, normative patterns.Nietzche sees this transvaluation as the way to free oneself from ALL power structures, Zarathustra himself teaches in the hope that his students eventually overcome the definitions he gives them. Thus Spoke Zarathustra mixes philosophical enquiries within the narrative of a prophetic journey, but Zarathustra's prophecy is the end of all prophets.

I purchased this book and Beyond Good and Evil, started the latter, but found it a tad too dry after a week. I had skimmed Thus Spoke Zarathustra, and found it far more flamboyant and stylistic (to my taste), so I devoted my time reading to it.And what a great book it is! What a departure from what other philosophers speak! Nietzsche teaches us the overman, the next step of our evolution; and to achieve the goal of the overman, we must not sustain or merely improve current state, but conquer it. The material in this book is like nothing I have ever read before. Chapter IV is very satisfying, especially &quot;On the Higher Man&quot;.Some chapters may require you to reread them in order to understand the quintessence of Nietzsche's message, but this is hardly any sacrifice compared to what knowledge you have to gain.&quot;The most concerned ask today: 'How is man to be preserved?' But Zarathustra is the first and only one to ask: 'How is man to be overcome?'&quot; - On the Higher Man, section 3"},{"Title":"Thus Spake Zarathustra","review":"In my opinion, it helps somewhate to have read prof. Ronald Hayman's excellent biography of Nietzsche to get some idea of the context in which Nietzsche wrote this work.As Hayman describes it, it appears this book reflects a kind of genuine religious epiphany/satori experience Nietzsche had while hiking the trails of Sils-Maria while in anguish over his failed relationship with Lou Salome and Paul Ree. For that reason, I personally consider the book to be more scripture than philosophy. Albeit, a scripture informed by the life and learning of an eminent philosopher in the classical tradition.In this context, I see the book as the expression of the fruition of a true seeker's lifetime quest for truth and insight.The two key concepts that are new in the book: the Ubermensch, and The Eternal Return, have been vastly misunderstood, to often horrific effect. A result not entirely unforseen by Nietzsche himself, of course.Personally, even though I was fortunate enought to have studied Nietzsche in college, I never quite grokked the 'eternal return' until I grokked the psychological device of the zen koan via reading Philip Kapleau's 'Three Pillars of Zen'.It seems to me that the 'eternal return' fits in quite nicely with the koan tradition, being a 'what if' conundrum that just happened to grab Nietzsche in the right way and propelled him through the transformations he records here, in the later parts of 'Thus Spake Zarathustra'.The questions the book challenges us to confront are the classic ones: 'what is it to be human', 'what is the potential of the human', 'what is the self and why is it to be overcome' etc etcThe sad and untold part of the book is the book's foreshadowing of Nietzsche's final kundalini awakening/epiphany, and subsequent collapse due to the overwhelming power of the kundalini energy, upon rescuing the flogged horse in the town square, in his story of the jester falling from the tightrope.but ... 'what matters all happiness?' indeed!"},{"Title":"Thus Spake Zarathustra","review":"Coupled with the Gay Science, Zarathustra reveals that there is more to Nietzsche than anti-liberal and anti-Christian no-saying. Through the thoughts and travails of Zarathustra, Nietzsche offers a positive political vision based on a small spiritual aristocracy absorbed in creative self-redefinition. Nietzsche's seminal work also provides insight into his views on his own status vis-a-vis &quot;the new philosophers&quot; he describes: he sees himself as the bridge to the overman, but only a bridge because of his inability to totally escape Christian-dominated metaphysical constructs. A stinging rebuke to all those who claim that Nietzche lacks a constructive politics."},{"Title":"Thus Spake Zarathustra","review":"Some years before Friedrich Nietzsche resorted to the blunt polemic of his books Twilight of the Idols and The Anti-Christ, he produced a literary masterwork that contained not only the main lines of his [later] philosophy, but combined it with a tremendous poetic sensibility to create an imaginative - and polemical - narrative. That book is Thus Spoke Zarathustra: A Book for None and All. Nietzsche regarded it as his greatest work after he had finished it (although all four books would not be published until after his death - which itself came after a decade of insanity), although he also thought that it was widely misunderstood and wrote several other books to clarify the points contained within it.Nietzsche - the \\"anti-Christ\\" - very much modeled himself on Jesus of Nazareth - the Christ - and throughout the work, sayings of Zarathustra are inverted forms of the parables or other teachings of Jesus. In some ways, Nietzsche/Zarathustra comes across as a type of photo negative of Jesus. The meek, for Zarathustra, will no longer inherit the earth for it shall go to those who are hard; no longer is love the focus of living but the will to power. Zarathustra, like Christ, has his disciples and his disciples are also bumbling buffoons that fail to catch the depth of Zarathustra's anti-Christ vision. There is a type of manic brilliance - a Dionysian inspiration/possession - that permeates these pages. The constant repetition of \\"Thus spoke Zarathustra\\" at the end of his speeches throughout the pages gives it an almost prophetic and religious quality. One sees that Nietzsche felt his own destiny as deeply as he felt isolated from the rest of humanity. Perhaps it is no surprise, then, that this book has been something like a book of Scripture for many - particularly in Germany during the last decade of the 19th century and the first few decades of the 20th.In many ways, Thus Spoke Zarathustra is a violent book. Nietzsche strongly advocates the \\"transvaluation of all values\\" - a morality beyond morality - that is built upon the rubble of Christian morality. \\"God is dead\\" is a theme that is constantly sounded throughout these pages and one of Zarathustra's goals is to try to get people to think on the dust and ashes of the idol that he considered Christianity to be. The course that he sought to encourage people to pursue was the course *to* what he called \\"the Overman\\". Zarathustra claims that he is not the Overman - he sounds like St. John the Baptist, \\"the Forerunner\\" of Jesus Christ - but that the Overman will come. He sees his disciples as \\"bridges\\" to the Overman, but leaves largely unanswered the question of what the Overman will be like. It is like a messianism without a sense of what \\"messiah\\" means.It is easy to be lost in the sheer drama of this book such that rather than addressing then-current issues and debates in Europe, he was attempting to write a timeless work applicable in all life situations. Any work that attempts to give a \\"new morality\\" is necessarily going to anchor itself to a significant degree in a world of Platonic ideals. However, it was in the chaos of late-19th century that Nietzsche wrote - a world beset by tremendous intellectual, scientific, social and spiritual turmoil and change. In some sense, then, Nietzsche's \\"exhortation\\" to become hard reflects a real disillusionment with the authoritative institutions of his day. He writes that God died of compassion and exhorts his followers to become hard; there is a real longing for stability to be found througout these pages, and Zarathustra's preaching a new morality is given as a type of answer to that longing.This is one of the most important books written during the latter 19th century. Nietzsche knew a number of famous persons during his day - despite his later falling out with Wagner, one hears much of the same Dionysian recklessness in Wagner's music that one hears in Nietzsche's rhetoric. Hitler, along with much of Germany, was deeply inspired by Nietzsche's \\"vision\\"; Thus Spoke Zarathustra was carried into the trenches by Germans in both World Wars. He has been alternately hailed as a prophet of a new morality and aestheticism and reviled as a madman whose writings inspired the deaths of millions. At the very least, one ought read his most cogent work, which has shaped the views of millions over the last hundred years. It is unlikely that the influence of the anti-Christ will be silenced any time soon."},{"Title":"Thus Spake Zarathustra","review":"Nietzsche is above all a psychological thinker at his most profound. Sometimes, he extends his psychology into political theory, sometimes in a way that seems to give psychological insight to political movements. More often than not, his psychology cannot be generalized into political statements, although Nietzsche wants to do this.In his book, Thus Spoke Zarathustra, he is at his best since he is a psychologist rather than a social critic. (Where he dabbles too much into issues of politics and gender, he is inclined to err.)Nietzsche's Zarathustra is a prophet for a secular era. It's very interesting how much the ideas in the book parallel those later discovered by Wilfred Bion, especially in terms of the psychology of group dynamics. Nietzsche had insights into the ways that groups unconsciously coordinate their members to reinforce conformity and compliance. There is no place for a self-reliant individual where there is a \\"herd\\". Creativity is even less respected by the \\"herd\\", because it disrupts the unconscious mechanisms of herd organisation. Without needing to have any intellectual grasp of a reality outside of the herd, those who partake of group dynamics are still capable of annihilating anyone who thinks and acts differently from the group. The attacks by the herd against the one who stands alone and the counter-struggle for survival have psychological origins at a subliminal level.Nietzsche makes visible these otherwise hidden phenomena: he shows that generally those who stand alone are destroyed, that nobody has to say anything for these attacks to begin to occur. They happen automatically without overt provocation. It's group psychological dynamics at work.Nietzsche's solution to those who are are likely to be attacked for their qualities of independence is that they should prepare for this to happen. They should also throw all their weight into the creative side of their characters, and forget about conforming. If you have intellectual qualities, or creative qualities that distinguish you from the herd (not in your own mind, but in theirs), you may as well invest in these totally, even if it means willing your own destruction -- because the greater your ability, the more likely you are to cause disquiet in those who have chosen to relinquish their independence for the sake of being protected by the group."},{"Title":"Thus Spake Zarathustra","review":"I read quite a few excerpts from this book out of a sense of duty, because I had majored in philosophy in college, but could not finish it: it is simply not my cup of tea"},{"Title":"Thus Spake Zarathustra","review":"I have not done reading through but I could understand this version of translation at least compare to another oneI had long time ago."},{"Title":"Thus Spake Zarathustra","review":"It's a little hard to pick the great thoughts out of the wanderings but it's a great summary of Nietzche philosophy.

THUS SPOKE ZARATHUSTRA is Nietzsche's magnus opum, his most important, overwhelming oeuvre. He identifies himself in this writing with an old Persian sage (Zoroaster...): THE FIRST HUMAN WHO MADE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LIGHT AND DARK, BETWEEN GOOD AND EVIL.This superb masterpiece is NO LESS THAN A BRILLIANT COLLECTION OF MAXIMS AND APHORISMS, without any intellectual allusions, but full of \\"DIRECT\\" WISDOM OF LIFE.

The announcement, the challenge to humanity, 'I give you, the superman!' God is dead. Many of Nietzsches idea's are so modern, or the foundation of modern life (think of the messiah complexes and beyond good or evil personas of rock stars like Marilyn Manson), it is so hard to believe he wrote this in the Victorian age (not hard then to see why he went insane). The most obvious clue to the era it was written is the longwindness, and difficulty of reading the text through. It is perhaps best to approach it in shortbursts, not only for the ideas but to appreciate the poetry of the text - what a way to present philosophy! So in keeping with the revolutionary nature of the work.Thus spake Zarathustra is an ideal book to start reading Nietzsche first hand. If approaching Nietzsche for the first time, or if seeking a more general overview of his thought, I recommend the easy reading,Introducing Nietzsche, Third Edition (Introducing...),' by Laurence Gane.

I've only read two books of his, and I guess I'm surprised by how far ahead of his time he was on religious matters. Philosophy with a hammer, indeed."},{"Title":"Thus Spake Zarathustra","review":"Late one night after I had read the last page of Nietzsche's Zarathustra, and before rereading the first page, I fell asleep and dreamt a dream of all that logically went between: When Zarathustra was over one hundred and ten years old, and it was the appropriate time, he died in an out of the way place called Bethsaida (The New Testament place where Jesus' preaching was ignored).The sun did not rise and the rooster did not crow, prompting his frightened neighbors to summon a doctor and an exorcist - this being customary in such circumstances.Although an examination revealed some peculiar marks visible on Zarathustra's head, neck, chest, and ankles, these were dismissed as some type of permanent political stigmata; thus the death certificate was signed.Word of strange events then spread quickly throughout the town, and to soothe the worry of more naive minds the ecclesiastical authorities decided to place Zarathustra in mock trial. Propped up in a chair and held fast by ropes, the old man offered no resistance to the arrangement. A Catholic volunteered as prosecutor, a Protestant as judge, townspeople of varying descriptions acted as jury, and a popular baker represented the accused. &quot;Here is the demon who even now manages to provoke our anguish with his legacy of atheistic malevolence. Let him be found guilty, then forgotten forever in the unhallowed ground&quot; railed the prosecutor. As for the baker, being a simple man outside the established ways of theological and legal argument, his only recourse was to draw upon his own experience while speaking for the accused: &quot;It may be a difficult leap to make, fellow citizens, but even here is the image of one deserving your love. Zarathustra's intention was not to destroy you or even to take anything away from you - it was to make you stronger! It is better to liken even his most merciless prods to the yeast which causes bread to rise to its full height.&quot;&quot;That's quite irreverent, though it may be material,&quot; countered the prosecutor; &quot;for in my church, before the sacrament of Eucharist is distributed, we draw on stocks of unleavened bread.&quot; Certainly, this was a promising point, but as it was now long past the time desirable for everyone's noontide meal, and the baker had the means to relieve their greatest emptiness, he decided to provide a tasty riposte: &quot;In all appreciation of that exception, as it is I who provides all the bread in this district - including what the churches distribute to the poor - it should be pointed out that the supply of flour available for my helpers to gather has been diminishing, and only the prudent use of yeast can insure enough to feed everyone&quot; Needless to say, the verdict eventually came in that everyone involved was ravenously hungry, which did much to expedite a decision on Zarathustra: And that is how he came to be buried, in sort of a compromise, beneath an unhallowed path immediately outside the narrow gate of the cemetery. Yet, not long after, three scruffy looking grave-robbers arrived to fetch him from where he was content to lay; a Marxist, an anarchist, and a gaunt faced national socialist. And while these three engaged in an acrimonious debate about who was Zarathustra's nearest relative, they dug up his material body and carried it away. Yes, stiffened arms jutting over supporting shoulders, and ramrod legs held in trembling hands, they stumbled away like drunken sailors returning to the safety of some familiar ship.What little reason remained soon gave way to emotions, as the three were so overwhelmed by their old master's predicament that they were incapable of recognizing his true condition. &quot;Zarathustra wants to come with me&quot; blubbered the Marxist. &quot;His persistent posture indicates he is only battered and still unbowed.&quot; To this the gaunt faced national socialist replied, while bearing the burden on the other side, &quot;Your brain is out of dialectical order, halt-foot! The fox feigns his injury, and your only reward will be a bite of my old values.&quot; Then holding up the feet and walking backwards, the anarchist insisted - as usual- in getting in the last word: &quot;Far from having any immediate ambitions, it's obvious my uncooperative brother is determined to impede you.&quot;Soon, all that was left at the open grave was a discarded shovel, the only lantern the three had brought to know the way, and the odd flickering shadow of Zarathustra's spirit. This ghost sat on a big stone nearby, closer than any of them had dared to hope, and it waited until the declamation of the last follower died out in the wintery night air: &quot;O restless dark day! You herald the approach of a new dawn!&quot; Said Zarathustra's spirit. Then finding a more definitive aphorism rising in his throat, he summoned his animals to draw near; for wise enough to keep a respectable distance from the fray, they had only waited to hear. And although at first they didn't recognize Zarathustra's now child like countenance - which usually moved much slower, the bad poetry reassured them: &quot;Lost and marooned are they who nourish themselves solely on what cannot be properly digested.&quot; Then speaking of higher men: &quot;But truly blessed is the special one who miraculously increases what the helpers gather to give.&quot; Thus it was spoken, as in a dream."},{"Title":"Thus Spake Zarathustra","review":"Thus Spoke Zarathustra is a difficult book to read, particularly if you are asleep. But I wasn't asleep, I was only pretending to be asleep! You know, to take advantage of those who claim to be awake.Channeling his inner Christ, Socrates, and Orafoura, Nietzsche gave voice to a mute mystic named Zarathustra. Chronicling his spiritual development and preemptively establishing the modern notion of postmodern ennui and apathy that accompanies everyone being at once anonymous and also mentally famous, Nietzsche was generations ahead of the World Beard and Mustache Competition.Me, me, today it's all about me, so make me into a meme! Remember my name because you'll be forgetting it later. Lose your religion, your mind, and finally your identity as you find yourself without a home, taking shelter under the glorious mustache of a 19th-century intellectual giant.Live in a cave as a caveman might live, but remember: You are not a caveman, despite the assurances of your mother that your derelict father was a caveman. The truth is, you are so modern you are primitive. You alone stand above man because you are Overman!You shine like a gold-star sticker, and I'll distribute four of them to you for being so super. So in the spirit of Orafoura and handing out stars, I give this book five stars.And remember, just because you're Superman, doesn't mean you don't have to wear a condom.

I agree with Ayn Rand's comment on Nietzsche in her preface to her great novel &quot;The Fountainhead&quot; : &quot;as a poet, he projects at times (not consistently)a magnificent feeling for man's greatness, expressed in emotional, not intellectual terms.&quot;Nietzsche, in Zarathustra, looked at Man's acceptance of Christianity, Statism, Collectivism, and Self-sacrifice, gave Man a slap, and laughed at him. Then he begged Man to overcome his faults and reach his highest potential."},{"Title":"Thus Spake Zarathustra","review":"Nietzsche is the messiah of the modern philosophical eon. Nietzsche looks god in the eyes and says you are dead! and god falls to his knees..."},{"Title":"Thus Spake Zarathustra","review":"It is tempting to think that reading the Bible, or Goethe, Kant, and Hegel, or even some gloomy portion of Schopenhauer in which \`common' is called an expression of contempt, might be advised to prepare some reader to begin THUS SPOKE ZARATHUSTRA. But it might be wiser to suggest that almost everyone is already wise enough to see how THUS SPOKE ZARATHUSTRA is the book in which Nietzsche fought for philosophy's right to party until it pukes. Irony in philosophy ought to be compared to the mathematical technique of refuting some hypothesis by showing that an analysis of its logic leads directly to a contradiction of itself or some cherished principle. In THUS SPOKE ZARATHUSTRA, Nietzsche shows that mastery of philosophy includes a strong sense of when life has reached the desire to toss its cookies. Socrates set the most striking standard in philosophy for when hemlock might be the drink best suited for making an example of one's belief. Deadly party techniques have not disappeared in the 2400 years that have passed since the ancient Greeks let jurors decide the fate of individuals who had their own ideas about religion. Nietzsche has a series of sections in the first part of THUS SPOKE ZARATHUSTRA \\"on the Preachers of Death\\" and \\"On War and Warriors\\" (THE PORTABLE NIETZSCHE, pp. 156-160), but embraces the paradox of free death wholeheartedly in \\"On Free Death\\" (TPN, pp. 183-186) while suggesting that it was not quite right with Jesus: \\"and for many it has become a calamity that he died too early. . . . Would that he had remained in the wilderness and far from the good and the just! Perhaps he would have learned to live and love the earth--and laughter too. Believe me, my brothers! He died too early; he himself would have recanted his teaching, had he reached my age.\\" (TPN, p. 185). As far as age goes, Nietzsche considers Jesus, who was once like a twelve-year-old in the temple, was not yet mature enough to be the sacrifice we need. \\"But in the man there is more of the child than in the youth, and less melancholy: he knows better how to die and to live. Free to die and free in death, able to say a holy No when the time for Yes has passed: thus he knows how to die and how to live.\\" (TPN, p. 185).THUS SPOKE ZARATHUSTRA challenges the notion that things happen in their proper time, and reading this book is hardly the most appropriate way to understand any particular moment, but the combination of ideas might help us understand how violent changes can occur when the mass of people feel \\"Would that a storm came to shake all this worm-eaten rot from the tree.\\" (TPN, p. 185). Pious platitudes are the cookies that get thoroughly masticated and swallowed with \\"sour apples, to be sure, whose lot requires that they wait till the last day of autumn: and they become ripe, yellow, and wrinkled all at once\\" (TPN, p. 184), beer and potato chips, or whatever yellow party food Nietzsche got down before he found the logical conclusion:\\"Verily, Zarathustra had a goal; he threw his ball: now you, my friends, are the heirs of my goal; to you I throw my golden ball. More than anything, I like to see you, my friends, throwing the golden ball. And so I still linger a little on the earth: forgive me for that.\\" (TPN, p. 186)."},{"Title":"Thus Spake Zarathustra","review":"&Eacute;ste libro de Nietzsche considerado como una obra maestra de la literatura contempor&aacute;nea, no solo es una gran obra para aquel que desea leerla con prop&oacute;sitos acad&eacute;micos, sino para todos lo que mas all&aacute; de querer encontrar respuestas sobre la existencia, est&aacute;n buscando preguntas, cuestionarse, abrir los ojos ante todo lo anteriormente cre&iacute;do. Por lo tanto el texto es interpretado de la manera en que cada uno de nosotros lo tomemos, adapt&aacute;ndolo as&iacute; a nuestro c&oacute;digo de valores, creencias y madurez cr&iacute;tica.En el libro se manejan diferentes ideas, una de ellas es la importancia de la voluntad. La voluntad de existir, de creer, de vencer el dolor, de obtener una fortaleza interior que nos permita no ser parte del \\"reba&ntilde;o\\" y ubicarnos en la constante b&uacute;squeda de la verdad, la espiritualidad, nuestra propia libertad y la \\"perfecci&oacute;n\\". Sostiene el concepto de que todo hombre tiene como mayor aspiraci&oacute;n ser cada vez mejor. Se maneja la resignaci&oacute;n y el conformismo como lo contrario a lo que ense&ntilde;a Zaratustra. Sin embargo, pienso yo, que en vez de resignarnos o al contrario entregarnos a ser demasiado humanos adorando la perfecci&oacute;n, podr&iacute;amos tratar de mejorar y perfeccionar nuestra vida en este mundo.Se maneja una iron&iacute;a singular, ya que Zaratustra podr&iacute;a ser comparado con Cristo ya que ambos son visto como personas no comunes, desconocidas, constantemente cuestionados, pero a al mismo tiempo, las ideas expuestas por Zaratustra resultan ser todo un reto para la ideolog&iacute;a cristiana. Por ejemplo, la muestra del ut&oacute;pico superhombre del que se habla, marca una inferioridad dentro de la raza humana, cosa que en la religi&oacute;n cuya base es la igualdad entre los hombres, representa una contrariedad severa a sus postulados.El superhombre es el estado mas alto al que puede llegar una persona, se expone como aquel que siendo due&ntilde;o de sus actos y pensamiento es capaz de gobernarse a s&iacute; mismo sin necesidad de pertenecer al tan mencionado \\"reba&ntilde;o o manada\\" siendo manipulado y guiado. &Eacute;ste superhombre es seguro, independiente y muy individualista, &eacute;ste siente con intensidad, pero sus pasiones est&aacute;n frenadas y reprimidas por el poder de su propio razonamiento.La obra est&aacute; llena de contrastes. De alguna manera el texto puede ser visto como pesimista mientras que por el otro lado puede ser considerado bello y lleno de esperanza. Suena algo ir&oacute;nico pero el libro nos hace reflexionar que al destruir el mundo del idealismo mal entendido reflejado en el egocentrismo y el ego&iacute;smo, y los valores falsos, podr&iacute;amos encontrar la verdadera esencia que nos hace ser lo que somos y as&iacute; poder reconstruir lo aprendido en bases firmes y no falsas o temporales.Existen los constantes cuestionamientos existenciales, basados en la preguntas generales de &iquest;Qu&eacute; es un hombre?, &iquest;Cu&aacute;l es nuestro potencial?, &iquest;Qu&eacute; es el verdadero ser?, preguntas cuya respuesta es incierta ya que no hay una correcta si no varios puntos de vista que muchas veces difieren entre uno y otro. El texto no busca la falta de disciplina y mucho menos guiarnos hacia el libertinaje como en alg&uacute;n tiempo se penso, al contrario, se muestra como una reacci&oacute;n en contra del conformismo de ideas y acciones que prevalece hoy en d&iacute;a en nuestra sociedad y que de hecho es bastante com&uacute;n.Otro de los temas tratados es el regreso eterno que plantea una proyecci&oacute;n c&iacute;clica de los eventos, es decir la repetici&oacute;n de &eacute;stos en lapsos largos de tiempo. Habla sobre la importancia de vivir el presente sin encerrarnos en el pasado ni proyectarnos al futuro. Todas &eacute;stas ideas pueden sonar un tanto extra&ntilde;as mas a una mentalidad tradicionalista y occidentalizada como la nuestra, donde generalmente se nos ense&ntilde;a a recurrir al pasado para entender o corregir nuestro presente y prever el futuro. Ideas como &eacute;sta nos hace comprender porque la censura al autor de &eacute;sta obra que permaneci&oacute; en el anonimato por mucho tiempo acatando las reglas morales y religiosas que prevalec&iacute;an no hace mucho tiempo."},{"Title":"Thus Spake Zarathustra","review":"bla bla bla, important book, bla bla bla, tremendous ideas, bla bla bla...dudes, what happened? the spirit of gravity has got y'all down and you're trying to groove with sir nose d'voidafunkread this book when you're feeling light. you won't understand a thing of what fred means if you read it in a \\"philosophical\\" mood.if you approach this book with those droopy-frowny \\"serious literature\\" glasses and gloves on, you'll see only the reflection of your own sad-dog unfunkitude!this is a MYTH, this is a play, this is something that came to fred when he was skipping around Italian mountainsides!this is a book to read a bit of while dancingif you treat it like the Bible, then that's exactly what you'll getand that's not what fred wants you to getso turn your mind upside down and read this book as if you randomly found it written on notebook paper in a dumpster frequented by hobos and started to read it with nothing better to domight not be the best way to read it, but it's miles ahead of treating it with that terrible seriousness that makes everything heavy"},{"Title":"Thus Spake Zarathustra","review":"This is a test review to see how it presents when published and to see whether it's possible to delete it after it's been published on Amazon."},{"Title":"Death On Grave Street (Five Star First Edition Mystery)","review":"Unable to work homicide ever since his pregnant spouse Cindy was murdered in a drive-by killing, fortyish widower Tyrone Trotman retires from the Detroit Police Department to accept the job of police chief of Port Ottawa. He makes an offer on a historical home with the famous Last Tree located in the yard. Tyrone meets the owner, Jane Blane, the love child of the town's recently deceased leading citizen; to his shock he wants her and she reciprocates. They even discuss marriage as love at first sight strikes both of them.Meanwhile, Deputy police officer Billy Budd informs Tyrone he found a corpse in the cemetery that was not primed for burial; not long afterward a second murdered body shows up in the same locale. While the townsfolk insist it is the spirit of the Last Tree calling out to all the trees cut down in the last century, Tyrone seeks a more mortal culprit.This is an entertaining paranormal police procedural romance starring a wonderful protagonist who does not believe in the legends yet talks to the Last Tree and heeds otherworldly advice to save his beloved. The romantic subplot is fun as the lead duet knows they belong together and don't waste time or energy otherwise. The townsfolk and the Detroit witch augment a fun lighthearted bewitching who-done-it that will have the audience wondering if the tree spirits or a Lorax like human is speaking violently for the long gone forests by killing people.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Death On Grave Street (Five Star First Edition Mystery)","review":"Interesting plot.

P.J.'s personality comes through well, and keeps things entertaining for a while.Unfortunately, the writing just isn't very good--the style of description quickly becomes repetitious, and the need for editing and even simple proofreading is painfully obvious. The capsule histories are often highly oversimplified, and in a few cases are downright wrong.Perhaps in the spirit of the other reviews, I should say that I've known P.J. for a while, too.

His narrative is easy to place into a context of not just travel, but travel through cultures, personalities, lives, and life. There is a real sense of adventure that seems to be missing in most fiction, but also an element of curiosity and facination that some other travel writing lacks.On a more practical level, this book has great value to would-be travellers (though seasoned travellers will certainly be rewarded with the text). By examining the small realities of world travel, those for whom attempting trips outside of comfort zones seemed unimaginable can see the potential of exploration of humanity through real travel."},{"Title":"101 Countries: Discovering the World Through Fast Travel","review":"While searching for travel books for my trip to Asia last year, I came across this book and read through it. I was curious what Fast Travel meant because I too had limited time, wanted to see as much of the world as I could, and all of this on a tight budget. Frankly, I didn't think such a thing was possible without money and lots of time, but this book proves me wrong.The accounts of the author are captured in a short descriptive manner which gets the point across and has you longing for more information. Several times along the way he has run-ins with the authorities which require him to pay a bribe or a penalty or some other form of tomfoolery. It makes you realize how different each country really is.The book isn't written like Lonely Planet or Rough Guide travel guides. It is more about the real-life experience of the author. Where he slept, what he saw, how he made contacts and connections, how he communicated, how he travelled, but most importantly what he ate. You realize in the beginning the author is vegetarian and in some countries finding food or communicating that you are vegetarian can be quite tricky. Being vegetarian myself, I find I can relate to it and picked up some knowledge for my own worldly travels regarding cheap methods of sleep, food, and making contacts.It's definitely hard to put this book down because you are always curious as to what's going to happen next in the travels of the author.While your goal may not be to see 101 countries but only a handful, this book still applies. If you are a traveller like I am, but want to know about the real experiences behind worldly travel beyond the travel guides, I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"101 Countries: Discovering the World Through Fast Travel","review":"Being an avid reader of just about anything I can lay my hands on, I stumbled on this book quite by accident.

As I moved from chapter to chapter, I couldn't wait to see where he would go next, what his next challenge would be, and who he would encounter at his next oasis.

It is a wonder to check off so many names without actually noticing the places you rip through and deriding those who actually take the time to absorb another culture. I hope Parmar's sensibilities mature in time to actually notice where he travels even to the point where he can at least assemble a small list of favorite places instead of relying upon snarky answers.Granted, there are some interesting parts of this book. These occur when the travelers back off the hammer and actually try to see and experience an area. All he seems to have now is an extensive list of places as flat as the sheet of paper they are written upon."},{"Title":"101 Countries: Discovering the World Through Fast Travel","review":"I am currently using Parmar's book in my suburban Boston high school Social Studies classroom (World History 1800-2004), to increase students' geographical and cultural awareness.

Complicated world issues-like the Israeli/Palestinian conflict-are presented in simple terms, making 101 Countries perfect as a supplement to standard history textbooks. As a teacher, I am convinced that my American students, notorious for lacking the itch to travel the world, are a little more likely to travel beyond the comfortable boundaries of Europe having read this book.Another important thing to note.

Emilio Lussu, an Italian anti-Fascist politician and essayist, does not belong to the group of the celebrated anti-war writers (he is a sort of local hero, quite popular in Italy, but neglected in the Anglo world), yet he should be put with the classics. His ironic, destructured, sometime grotesque, sometime almost absurdist memoir-novel deserves to be included in the list of the Great W.W.I Books. The original title is \\"Un anno sull'altipiano\\" (A Year on the Asiago Plateau), and it refers to the time spent by the Sassari Brigade (the \\"Sardinian Brigade\\" of the English title) on the Asiago Plateau, where some of the fiercest clashes between Italians and Austro-Hungarians took place. The experience of mountain warfare with the legendary Sassari Brigade (a.k.a. The Red Devils, or \\"Dimonios\\") made Lussu understand the atrocity, the madness and the uselessness of war. And that is what the book is all about--which is a lot, in this our time.Lussu's dry, corrosive prose is an uncanny harbinger of masterpieces to come, such as Heller's Catch-22 or O'Brien's Going After Cacciato. Luckily English-speaking readers can read it again: on the Amazon.UK website there is a new edition on sale which is cheaper than this.

Adrian Rookwhistle thought he had the answer -- he'd give her to a circus. But it wasn't so easy.\\" Note that Adrian starts out as a respectable, timid, and dull young man before inheriting the drunken elephant and you can predict about 75% of how the story will unfold -- get about a third of the way in and you'll be able to predict the rest.There isn't even an attempt at plausibility as the author pushes Adrian and Rosy along on their adventures. For example, Adrian spends weeks at an \\"inn,\\" with his elephant secreted in the stables, without so much as a hint of a client appearing throughout the whole period. In fact, in this book no one who works seems to have any activity that interferes with their spending all their time with Adrian when he's around.Given the above, your enjoyment of this book will depend entirely on whether descriptions of comic mayhem and characters who are extremely broad caricatures tickle your funny bone. If they do, you might find this entertaining light reading. They don't do anything for me, hence the two stars. Outside of one or two funny lines, the whole thing was more of a slog than a romp for me."},{"Title":"WHOSE HOUSE IS THIS?","review":"I had this book as a child.

Works of Arthur Conan Doyle)","review":"Chivalry may be on life support, but it's still breathing in the words of Arthur Conan Doyle's The White Company. Although he is well known for his Sherlock Holmes stories, Doyle was most proud of creating the noble knight, Sir Nigel Loring of the White Company.This book is set in the tumultuous days of the 14th century, when the political struggles among England, France and Spain, and the Crusades in the Holy Land, created instablity for peasant and noble alike. There are many heroes in the tale of knights and battles, but young Alleyne Edricson is the main protagonist. Sheltered in an abbey, where the orphaned lad was educated per his noble father's wishes, Alleyne is unwillingly shoved into the world for a period of a year, where he must decide whether he wishes to make his way there or return to a monastic life.It doesn't take long for Alleyne to meet with adventure. He is shocked to find the world is a rough and tumble place. But his straightforward and naive approach to life helps him out of some scrapes and endears him to some colorful characters who become his bosom companions. Together, they join the service of Sir Nigel, who is an unlikely hero with his bald head, bad eyesight and scrawny stature. That is, until he is able to prove himself in \\"some small feat of arms,\\" which is his favorite pastime. He is always victorious in these exhibitions of his knightly prowess, and he always has a kind word for the vanquished, his noble opponent. His motivation is always to defend the honor of his \\"lovely\\" wife, for whom he cherishes the greatest tenderness, although others wonder if this is due to his poor vision rather than any attractiveness on his lady's part.There are many satisfying battles and cliffhangers in this book. Sir Nigel plunges headlong into any opportunity for a fight. Alleyne becomes his squire and follows him to France, to fight for their Prince, Edward III, who wants to restore the vanquished king of Spain. Alleyne becomes adept at sword fighting and exhibits as much bravery as his lord. He is also motivated by the love of a lady, Sir Nigel's lovely daughter, Maude.I read this book aloud to my children, and we shared many moments of laughter as we followed the warriors from England to France. I struggled a bit with the French pronunciation of names and places (how do you pronounce \\"Blois\\"?), but it was a very funny and exciting book, and I'm glad we were able to read it together. Doyle was an expert on this time period as his mother read him many chivalric tales as a boy, exciting his interest in medieval times, which continued into his adulthood. The descriptions of weaponry, customs, religious life, clothing, historical events and geography permeate the story without detracting from it. There are numerous stirring and gory events (including pirates, hangings, peasant uprisings and decapitations...yuck), which will have readers on the edge of their seats. Of course, the illustrations by N.C. Wyeth added to our enjoyment.There is another book about Sir Nigel, a prequel to The White Company, called Sir Nigel, which we will have to read soon. He has become one of our favorite literary characters."},{"Title":"The white company, (Author's edition. Works of Arthur Conan Doyle)","review":"I can't remember how I happened on this book- probably Amazon herded me to it- but I'm quite glad. I'm more of a fan of the Sherlock Holmes stories, but I found this as enjoyable as The Black Arrow or Robin Hood or any other medieval book that I've read, and I'd never even heard of it before. The protagonist is a young man raised at the monastery who joins a band of rough but good hearted archers and follows their exploits as they head to war in France and Spain. The old agnostic (Doyle) weaves in more respect for the Catholic church than one usually sees from so-called church leaders today, combined with some common sense insights of true morality. For Doyle chivalry not only is not dead, it'll cut off the head of anyone who says otherwise. In other words, a man's word was worth something, and a man's actions were worth even more. Lots of swordplay, a little (very little) romance, some interesting and well developed characters, and an undercurrent of humor. Not as clever as the Holmes books, but a lot more action, and one learns a little English history at the same time. I'd highly, highly recommend it for kids, or anyone really, and I am amazed that it's fallen through the cracks to this point- at least for me."},{"Title":"The white company, (Author's edition. Works of Arthur Conan Doyle)","review":"I cannot tell you how much fun this book is...you will have to read it yourself. This is the kind of book that you must immerse yourself in. Give yourself the time to just sink into Conan Doyle's world. It is easy to do, because Conan Doyle had a gift for imagery. The book is so complete. It shows both the beauty and the barbarity of the times with complete harmony. It is also downright funny at times. I have found myself laughing out loud while reading this book, largely because of the language used. Yes, the language is sometimes hard to follow, but who wouldn't laugh at \\"I have been cozened and bejaped!\\"? I think the author does this on purpose because it IS funny. It is interesting to compare The White Company with Crichton's recent novel \\"Timeline\\", set in the same era. Both authors worked to bring the flavor of that time to the reader, but with vastly different aims and results. Anyway, give yourself a break and escape into another world. Go to battle with Hordle John, Sam Aylward, and Alleyne! Then go sample another of Conan Doyle's little known gems and read of the outrageous exploits of Brigadier Gerard!"},{"Title":"The white company, (Author's edition.

Occasionally I hear him giggling (at a passage) like a ten-year-old boy. From what I recall when I read this as a kid, this book IS the perfect adventure story. Complete with knights and archers both dashing and dumpy (Sir Oliver), and even pirates, it almost reads like a serial novel in this respect. One cannot, however, overlook or underestimate Doyle's brilliant use of medieval language in his dialogue, nor the sheer color of his vivid descriptions. This is a timeless book; one to get yourself lost in."},{"Title":"The white company, (Author's edition.

The book follows the progress of an adventurous monk that has left the cloister and hitched his wagon to Sir Nigel's White Company, a group of English mercenaries seeking fight and fortune in France and Spain. Those young at heart will especially enjoy this tale.

Works of Arthur Conan Doyle)","review":"The White Company is one of those books which lies completely below the radar. While we all know stories like The Count of Monte Cristo and Huckleberry Finn and Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, Doyle's classic and simple-hearted story about English adventurers in the Hundred Years' War is a largely unknown work. I purchased it as a lark, and because it cost a single dollar, and its worth was proved to be many times repaid.In reading The White Company, it is best to set aside expectations of sophisticated or intricate character development--this is a story that does best with a sympathetic reader, already steeped in the daydreams of bygone days and lusty battle--and simply have fun. Also, this is the kind of book that a person with some grounding in history will get more out of than someone ignorant of the 14th century. Perhaps it's advisable to obtain a little background information before settling into the book; assumptions about educational background were--ahem--more stringent in 1900 than today.This is a man's story, to be sure, and it appeals to the insurgent lurking within all men. However, it isn't offensive to womankind, either, revealing the strength of the female characters as well. Enjoy with confidence.One last comment: If, at the end of the story, you don't a lump in your throat, or feel a stirring in your heart to don a steel cap, lace on a jerkin and take up a stout length of yew, you've missed the point."},{"Title":"The white company, (Author's edition. Works of Arthur Conan Doyle)","review":"Though popularly remembered for the Sherlock Holmes stories, the historical novels of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle are more illustrative of his literary flair and narrative skill.'The White Company' and 'Sir Nigel' are set during the Hundred Years War between England and France, focused around the figure of Sir Nigel Loring, a chivalrous knight whose thirst for honour and glory pull him and his companions into many strange and warlike adventures.Mixing real historical figures such as Edward III and the Black Prince with creations of his own, Doyle manages to weave a number of separate incidents into an interesting and highly enjoyable tale. At times very humourous, these stories nevertheless also describe the harsher realities of medieval war, presenting a colourful picture. Though characterisation is sometimes two-dimensional, Sir Nigel as the main protagonist is both funny and endearing.

Coincidentally, some of the character names/personalities find their way to S.M. Stirling's alternate worlds novels as well."},{"Title":"The white company, (Author's edition. Works of Arthur Conan Doyle)","review":"Everyone has heard of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, the creator of Sherlock Holmes. What many readers aren't aware of is that in addition to detective fiction, Doyle also ventured into historical fiction. Doyle's 1891 historical novel The White Company is one of his early efforts in this genre, and I found the medieval adventure great fun.Beginning in England in 1366, during the Hundred Years War, the novel begins with our protagonist Alleyne Edricson venturing forth into the world for the first time. Raised until age 20 in a monastery per his deceased father's instructions, those instructions also require that he go forth into the world for a year before he can choose to return to the monastery. The sheltered young man ventures into the world with little idea of what to do but to visit his older brother and try not to fall prey to the dangers the monks have warned him of.Alleyne soon encounters two companions, however. Hordle John is a rough and wild giant of a man who has been tossed out of the monastery the same day Alleyne leaves. Samkin Aylward is an archer just returned from France and service in the White Company, loaded with plunder, who regales Alleyne, John, and anyone else who'll listen with tales of his exploits. Samkin convinces Alleyne and John to join him in visiting Sir Nigel Loring, a brave and well-respected knight of England who he hopes to recruit as the new leader of the White Company and to return France and beyond for great deeds. Sir Nigel quickly agrees, as he is full of chivalrous fervor to do great deeds of battle and gain honor. Sir Nigel takes Alleyne as a squire, while Alleyne takes an interest of his own in Sir Nigel's daughter, Lady Maude. After months of preparations and recruiting of additional archers and men-at-arms, Sir Nigel leads the company abroad. Great deeds of honor are performed in France in friendly tournament before the White Company goes to Spain to face real war, and a variety of exciting adventures are had along the way.While reading The White Company, I couldn't help but be reminded of The Black Arrow, Robert Louis Stevenson's 1888 historical novel set a hundred years later during the Wars of the Roses, and also featuring a young knightly protagonist and daring adventures. As big a fan as I am of Stevenson, I enjoyed The White Company much more. The characters are much more likable, there's much more humor, Doyle keeps the medieval language much more accessible for modern readers, and overall, it's just a lot more fun. Doyle's action scenes - Stevenson's definite strong suit in The Black Arrow - are as good as Stevenson's, and the White Company leads in every other aspect between the books.I believe my fellow fans of J.R.R Tolkien would enjoy The White Company. Though a historical novel and not a fantasy novel, it shares some of the high and noble adventure that sets Tolkien apart from the more grim interpretations of fantasy. At times some of the beliefs of the day reflected in The White Company, such as a woman who has prophetic visions, are closer to fantasy than today's reality anyway. Had Doyle just put in a dragon for Sir Nigel and Alleyne to fight (although Tolkien would probably have had Samkin the archer deal the deal blow to the beast), this would have make a perfect fantasy novel.I read a version of The White Company illustrated by N.C. Wyeth. I first encountered Wyeth through his illustrations of many of Stevenson's works, and he really brings some of the most exciting scenes of the book to life with his art. Wyeth illustrating an edition of an adventure story is becoming a signal to me that I'll probably enjoy it.I highly recommend Doyle's The White Company to anyone who enjoys tales of knights, archers, and chivalric adventures, as well as to anyone who enjoys fantasy novels like The Lord of the Rings. I had read and enjoyed some of Doyle's Holmes stories before, but I was pleasantly surprised by just how strong Doyle's historical fiction was. I definitely plan to read Sir Nigel, a follow-up book from Doyle chronicling the early adventures of that character."},{"Title":"The white company, (Author's edition. Works of Arthur Conan Doyle)","review":"Note: This review is of the 1922 hardcover edition published by the Cosmopolitan Book Corporation, New York, with illustrations by N.C. Wyeth. On the cover's inside is the inscription \\"Teresa Lee McNeel, December 1930, From Mother.\\" From that, I infer it was given to my own mother by my grandmother on the former's twelfth birthday. While the book has been in my possession for decades, only now have I taken the time to follow Mom's reading trail eighty years later.\\"Now order the ranks, and fling wide the banners, for our souls are God's and our bodies the king's, and our swords for Saint George and for England!\\" - Sir Nigel Loring, rallying the White CompanyTHE WHITE COMPANY, by Arthur Conan Doyle, was first published in serialized form in 1891. It has been asserted that Doyle regarded his historical novels, THE WHITE COMPANY being one of them, more highly than his (now) better-remembered Sherlock Holmes exploits.The place is England and the Continent, the year is 1366 during the reign of the King of the English, Edward III, and his realm is twenty-nine years into The Hundred Years' War with France.The male heroes of the story are three plus one: Samkin Aylward, a grizzled archer of the White Company, an English mercenary force, Alleyne Edricson, a twenty-year old clerk raised by Cistercian monks in Beaulieu Abbey since infancy who's now sent out into the larger world to learn something of it before choosing a permanent vocation, and the red-haired giant Hordle John, a disgraced Brother of the same abbey tossed out because of his self-indulgent ways. The trio then joins a fresh contingent of the White Company raised by the renowned and veteran knight, Sir Nigel Loring, at Castle Twynham in the Hampshire town of Christchurch. Alleyne himself is taken on as Loring's personal squire and, for the two months prior to the company's departure for the Continent, is the tutor of Sir Nigel's teenage daughter, Lady Maude. Edricson is, naturally, smitten, and he goes off to war carrying her green veil as a token of favor.Doyle's novel, written during the time when the Empire still spanned the globe, is, above all, a paean to England and its common men that transformed themselves into their country's stanch expeditionary warrior forces. As a song in the book has it:\\"What of the men?The men were bred in England:The bowman - the yeoman -The lads of dale and fell.Here's to you - and to you!To the hearts that are trueAnd the land where the true hearts dwell.\\"As might be surmised, THE WHITE COMPANY is also a coming-of-age story and a great road adventure. Emerging from the protective cocoon of Beaulieu Abbey, Alleyne is a completely blank slate, a slate upon which will be writ the learning experiences of a journey that will take him to Spain to fight in what will later become known in history as the Castillian Civil War, a peripheral conflict of The Hundred Years' War. Doyle ensures that the values learned mature Edricson into his ideal of a proper and true-hearted Englishman.A main thread that runs through the entire work is chivalry as practiced by an honorable knight, the poster boy being Sir Nigel. A 21st century reader of this 19th century book may find the romantic view of this warrior philosophy somewhat quaint if not downright ridiculous, as perhaps reflected in these words by Loring to an innkeeper when the former learns of the presence of an anonymous but otherwise bellicose knight within:\\"Go tell him that a humble knight of England would make his further honorable acquaintance, not from any presumption, pride, or ill-will, but for the advancement of chivalry and the glory of our ladies. Give him greeting from Sir Nigel Loring, and say that the glove which I bear in my cap belongs to the most peerless and lovely of her sex, whom I am now ready to uphold against any lady whose claim he might be desirous of advancing.\\"Loring is, of course, inviting the other knight to meet him in personal combat on the spot. The contemporary reader may be tempted to mutter, \\"Oh, puhleeeze!\\" However, in 1891, such a challenge, and the courtliness it stemmed from, was likely to be fondly remembered and admired.There was a flip side to chivalry, however. It was a code of conduct that governed relations between members of the nobility only, i.e. from knight on up to princes and kings; there was no obligation for the aristocracy to treat the lower classes similarly. Indeed, a noble landholder could treat his villeins abominably and still be considered chivalrous; only the Church might perhaps prevail upon such a lord to treat his serfs more justly and charitably. Doyle does not shirk from referencing this in the storyline.THE WHITE COMPANY contains thirteen color plates by the painter N.C. Wyeth in a magnificent illustrative style that hasn't been employed in decades.Not surprisingly, Doyle's adventure novel has an old-fashioned air to it. It's a solid tale with a fairly predictable story; there are no plot twists that cause a mental double-take or can claim a \\"gotcha.\\" It was undoubtedly recommended for the adolescent and young adult readers of the period much as I, in my youth, devoured the epic adventures by author Joseph Altsheler, particularly theClassic American Fiction: Altsheler's Young Trailers Series, all 8 novels in a single file, with active table of contents. That said, THE WHITE COMPANY grandly accomplishes what it was penned to do, both entertain and teach moral values."},{"Title":"The white company, (Author's edition.

Both books are excellent for young people forming their characters."},{"Title":"The white company, (Author's edition. Works of Arthur Conan Doyle)","review":"The White Company, by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, is an inspiring tale of knightly honor and chivalry. Though famous for his Sherlock Holmes stories, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, in writing The White Company, produced an extremely vivid account of the horrors of medieval warfare, while mixing in moments of humor to create an inspirational and highly enjoyable tale.The protagonist, Alleyne Edricson, is a young man come fresh from the monastery to explore the world and all it has to offer, as his father had wished. Soon after leaving the monastery, Alleyne meets a beautiful young lady and her father, Sir Nigel Loring. Alleyne then becomes squire to Sir Nigel, a humorous and highly respected knight, and the adventure begins. While fighting abroad, Alleyne proves himself to be a worthy suitor for the lovely Lady Maude, Sir Nigel's daughter, and returns from the war as a courageous and honored knight to marry her.Though the characters are at times two-dimensional, Doyle does a superb job of endearing them to the reader and enabling the reader to feel as if he or she really knows the characters. The White Company, an escape fiction novel, is an excellent example of formula fiction. The characters are mostly stock, and the ending is a happy one. The worthy hero rescues the damsel in distress, loses her for a while, but returns to win back her love. Even though the novel contains some flat characters and stereotypes, a dose of reality is present in the horror of war portrayed by Doyle.This account of knights, war, and fair ladies is permeated with the theme of honor. The code of chivalry for medieval knights is a well-developed theme presented by Doyle. This valuable theme mixed with an enjoyable and funny story makes this novel unique. The White Company is a well-written, interesting book and I recommend reading it."},{"Title":"The white company, (Author's edition.

Doyle's desire to re-use some of the popular characters from the first book in his _Sir Nigel_ 'pre-quel.' (I won't detail the discrepancies, so as not to diminish the reading enjoyment for those who missed them.) I was glad I purchased both books together, though, because they're both worth reading. However, TWC seems to have a fresher quality."},{"Title":"The white company, (Author's edition. Works of Arthur Conan Doyle)","review":"The White Company takes place in Hampshire during the fourteenth century, or the Middle Ages. The main character is a sensistive and enthusiastic monk, Alleyene Edricson. He leaves his monk-bred ways to enter the real world as his father wished him to do. His goal is to change the ruthless ways of his brother, The Socman of Minstead. He firsts finds his brother harassing a beautiful lady. Alleyene intervenes, which causes his brother to set dogs upon him. Alleyene then decides to become a squire to a knight, the knight happens to be the beautiful young lady's father. Alleyene goes off to war and gets involved in battle. Some soldiers called Alleyene weak because he dwelled on the horrors of war, but Alleyenes friend explained his weakness. &quot; It is not weakness of heart, for I know the lad well. His heart is as good as thine or mine, but he hath more in his pate than ever you will carry under that tin pot of thine, as a consequence he can see further into things, so that they weigh upon him more.&quot; Sir Arthur Conan Doyle brings the story alive with vivid detail and characterization. It is great for those who enjoy adventure and historical novels."},{"Title":"The white company, (Author's edition.

I knew that Sir Arthur is an excellent writer but I didn't know that he is that good with medieval adventures.Everything he writes is very true historically and that makes the book even more enjoyable.

White Company &amp; Sir Nigel provides the two publications under one cover for the first time, providing his historical fiction in their proper light and inviting Doyle fans to a taste of something different."},{"Title":"The white company, (Author's edition. Works of Arthur Conan Doyle)","review":"I listened to The White Company when I was 12 as an audio book.I instantly fell in love with Arthur Conan Doyle's prose and his cast of colourful characters: the naive Alleyne (said \\"Allen\\") Edricson, who over the course of the narrative becomes a man, chivalric Sir Nigel Loring, the tomboyish Maude Loring, the simple but immensely warrior John of Hordle, veteran archer Sam Aylward, and the grizzled Black Simon.The characters are strong, well written, and extremely entertaining....Conan Doyle, author of Sherlock Holmes, spent over two years of his life researching this book and his dedication shines through the pages. Containing detailed descriptions of heraldry, castles, weapons, and cities, The White Company takes you back in time to the romanticized world of knight errants, damsels in distress, gallant squires, but does not shy away from the more realistic facts of Medieval life - starving peasants, blood-and-piss battles, captives and ransoms, rape, pillage, and plunder. The White Company contains, among other things:a chase with archers and knights,an awesome sword fight,a giant who can fire an arrow 600 metres,a sea battle between pirates and a merchant boat,a rampaging bear,a gunpowder explosion,an archery competition where Longbowmen shoot birds out of the sky,a pseudo-monk,a wrestling match in a tavern,a last stand between five knights and thousands of starving, crazed peasants,a huge battle in the end,a princess who lives in a nunnery,a lord and a archer taken slave,and much, much more. But the best thing is that the book won't drown you if you tie it around your neck and go swimming and if you put it in your suitcase it won't be overweight: The White Company is just the right length.On a different note, it must be remembered that Conan Doyle was INTENSELY patriotic and much of this book had parallels with England's situation then. So if you don't like that sort of \\"England is supreme. French are dogs.\\" sort of stuff, avoid....The White Company contains one of my favorite poems, an old archer's song: The Song of the Bow. I will show some of it here:What of the Bow?The Bow was made in England:Of true wood, of yew wood;The Wood of English bows;So men who are freelove the old yew-treeAnd the land where the yew tree grows....What of the Shaft?The Shaft was cut in England:a long shaft, a strong shaft;Barbed and trim and true:So we'll drink all togetherto the grey goose featherAnd the land where the grey goose flew....The White Company is one of my favourite books, and I have read many. You must read it!Strongest Recommendation!"},{"Title":"The white company, (Author's edition.

Symons and Christopher Millard, each somewhat obscure and eccentric literary figures in their own right, were sitting in a garden discussing books and authors that had never received proper recognition from the arbiters of literary history. Millard asked Symons whether he had ever read &quot;Hadrian the Seventh.&quot; Symons acknowledged that he had not and that he was unfamiliar with the book. &quot;To my surprise, [Millard] offered to lend me his copy-to my surprise, for my companion lent his books seldom and reluctantly. But knowing the range of his knowledge of out-of-the-way literature, I accepted without hesitating; and by doing so took the first step on a trail that led into very strange places.&quot;Very strange places indeed! Symons began reading &quot;Hadrian the Seventh,&quot; a book written by Frederick Rolfe, also known as Baron Corvo, and originally published in 1904, and quickly felt &quot;that interior stir with which we all recognize a transforming new experience.&quot; Symons went on to spend the next eight years of his life tracking down the details of the life and writings of Baron Corvo, one of the most eccentric, original and enigmatic English writers of the last one hundred years. The result was &quot;The Quest for Corvo: An Experimental Biography,&quot; a fascinating book that has been in- and out-of-print since its first publication in 1934 and has enjoyed a literary cult following akin to that of the text (&quot;Hadrian the Seventh&quot;) and the author (Rolfe, aka Corvo) that originally inspired it.As one reads &quot;The Quest for Corvo,&quot; it seems that Symon's text represents the outermost of three concentric circles of eccentricity.The innermost, core circle is &quot;Hadrian the Seventh,&quot; a strange and imaginative novel that tells the story of an impoverished, eccentric and seemingly paranoid writer and devotee of the Roman Catholic faith, George Arthur Rose. Rose, a brilliant, self-taught man whose candidacy for the priesthood had been rejected twenty years earlier, is unexpectedly approached one day by a Cardinal and a Bishop who have been made aware of his devotion and his shameful treatment by the Church. Rose is ordained and ultimately becomes the first English Pope in several hundred years. While a work of fiction, Symons' biographical investigations disclose that much of the story of &quot;Hadrian the Seventh&quot; closely parallels the life of its strange author, Frederick Rolfe.The second circle of eccentricity is, of course, the life of Frederick Rolfe, Baron Corvo, himself. It is the telling of this life that occupies Symons in &quot;The Quest for Corvo,&quot; and the result is a fascinating, if perhaps not always historically accurate, detective story cum biography. Starting with his obsessive search for information on Rolfe and his meetings and correspondence with those who knew him, Symons brilliantly recreates a life-the life of a strangely talented artist, photographer, historian, and writer who led a life of seemingly paranoid desperation, ultimately dying impoverished in Venice at the age of forty-five.The third, outermost circle is the eccentricity of the author of the &quot;Quest for Corvo,&quot; A. J. A. Symons, a founder of The Wine and Food Society of England, a collector of music boxes, and a master at card tricks and the art of forgery. Like Corvo himself, Symons died at an early age-he was only forty years old-and his life and his book is seemingly as eccentric as its subject.&quot;The Quest for Corvo&quot; is one of those little gems that deserve a cherished, if perhaps minor, place in English literature and the literature of biography.

Symons's THE QUEST FOR CORVO could almost be a sketch for these later, deeper studies in its very metatextual approach to what it means to compose a biography of Frederick Rolfe, one of the strangest figures in fin-de-siecle British letters. Although later biographies took this work to task for its errors and omissions, that shouldn't dissuade you from enjoying how Symons juxtaposes differing perspectives on the quarrelsome and paranoid Rolfe's actions and behaviors, and his desire to get at the &quot;real man.&quot; Greater drawbacks, I think, might be Symons's homophobia--which, while very common for its time, seems a bit hysterical today--and the fact that Rolfe (or &quot;Baron Corvo,&quot; as he liked to style himself) as a person either enchants readers completely or eventually becomes as tiresome to them as he did to his contemporaries. Still, even though Rolfe's antics do grate on some people's nerves a bit after a while(as they did mine), the fascination of his personality remains quite compelling.This edition features a beautiful cover and paper stock (as do all NYRB editions) and an intelligent and thoughtful introduction (which, unfortunately, they do not always)."},{"Title":"The Quest for Corvo","review":"A.J. Symons's THE QUEST FOR CORVO may have enjoyed more readers since its publication in 1934 than any of the novels of Frederick Rolfe, the self-styled &quot;Baron Corvo&quot; who was Symons's fascinating subject. Rolfe (who died in 1913) seems to be enjoying one of his occasional, modest revivals, and anyone who is interested in him at all will read Symons's book.So it is unfortunate that this first and most famous biography of Corvo has so many eccentric (to put it mildly) features to it. Symons was an amateur, and his book has all the advantages and drawbacks of inspired dilettantism. A lot of it is inaccurate, as subsequent Corvo scholarship has shown. (I wish that the various introductions written to the editions published in recent decades would point this out.)It's a fun book, but anyone wishing to know more about Corvo -- who was, in the end, a more interesting figure than Symons -- should look up one of the later Rolfe biographies."},{"Title":"The Quest for Corvo","review":"I read this book many years ago and it was fascinating because of its portrait of a seriously weird man. The man who called himself Baron Corvo was one of the strangest members of the British company of eccentrics.

It is still an engrossing \\"experiment in biography\\" but it is much more than that. I felt at the time of first reading that the prose was the best model for a writer that I had ever read.

Rolfe was not his literary exploits (relatively few, mostly unnoticed) or indeed anything he ever accomplished, but rather his eccentricity of character. And Symons' enthusiasm for Rolfe's eccentricity is infectious, and it lends not only authenticity but genuine merit to his choice to structure the book as a &quot;quest&quot; instead of as hagiography.Nonetheless, despite his intrinsically fascinating character, Rolfe should be approached first through Hadrian the Seventh, and not directly through The Quest for Corvo--if only because then the reader will be following in the biographer's footsteps.As for the content of the biography, I found its wayward structure refreshing, but confusing, especially with regard to the author's depictions and analyses of Rolfe's literary output. A bibliography or chronology would have been quite helpful. Also, echoing other reviewers, Symons's reluctance to speak at length about Rolfe's homosexuality (especially the elements that might still be considered deviant today) leaves too much of Rolfe's character and contemporary reactions to him concealed."},{"Title":"The Quest for Corvo","review":"In agreement with what other reviewers have said, I enjoyed The Quest for Corvo primarily because of the ways the book displays the author's quaint but intense enthusiasm for his subject.

Rather than chronologically narrating the life of Frederic Rolfe a.k.a \\"Baron Corvo\\", the author follows his own progress and correspondence in search of the Baron's life details. The subject of the book itself is one of those late victorian characters that simply had to confront a new reality driven by capitalism and not just church or aristocratic patronage.Frederic Rolfe was a delusional, tragic man with a talent for writing and a deep seated paranoia. He attempted to become a priest for all the wrong reasons and was quickly expelled and dismissed as a superficial spendthrift . He cursed at all those who tried to help him, begged and buggered around in Venice till funds ran out. Then he died alone and poor as a rat. He refused moral judgment while dispensing it in abundance. But his writings, mostly \\"Hadrian the VII\\" and \\"Tales that Toto told me\\" caused enough impression on enough people to merit Mr. Simmons \\"quest\\" for Corvo. It is interesting to see how the author seems to need to justify the life of this hard working parasite again and again based on his literary merits. The author cannot conceal his passion for the subject and it becomes contagious. May be he saw in Fr. Rolfe a twin soul. I haven't read the books Rolfe wrote but I am afraid that they might have lost whatever glow they had in their time. Some of the neologisms he created and the language he used might have been dazzling a century ago. Today, I am afraid it might be almost incomprehensible in its rancid archaism.

Aldrin and Barnes are more technically oriented than some but they went in a little over their heads. I appreciate technical details but they must be consistent and accurate, otherwise they annoy and detract from the plot. The plot wasn't all that coherent in the first place--this was not &quot;page turner&quot;. The dialogue was not realistic. The charaters' speech were too artificial in their use to explain this and that. Some of the subjects the &quot;professionals&quot; spoke about were too simplistic for actual professionals to discuss. They sounded more like space enthusiasts. Maybe I would have enjoyed this more as a juvenile."},{"Title":"Encounter With Tiber","review":"This novel is in every way very good. However, it comes across as not really knowing what it wants to be.There is the action novel part, with God-impersonation, biblical floods, and moon crashes. There is the political commentary, with communist monitors, ill-executed political space missions, and slavery. There is the technical manual, with zero-point lasers, interstellar travel, antimatter, and huge computers. There is the coming-of-age story, with young aliens going through puberty in space, culture fading over generations, and sons following in fathers' footsteps.The composition is just too jumbled, though. In an attempt to be the book about everything, the novel becomes a book without a point, without a climax, unsupported science, and with an unsatisfying ending. Too bad, too, because the beginning is positively riveting.I would recommend it, but don't expect the great American novel; this book was written for a purpose other than being a great book."},{"Title":"Encounter With Tiber","review":"I've read a lot of science fiction books over the years, and I can honestly say that this is one of the worst I've ever forced myself to finish. How anyone could read this book and give it a rating above a 2 or a 3 is beyond me. The aliens are upright walking cats and dogs from only 4 light years away who seem to share a lot of the catch phrases and sayings of the current American culture. It was hard to find a coherent sentence on any of the numerous pages. Somewhere an English teacher weeps. Also, the story (if you can call it that) violates Einstein's Theory of Relativity as it applies to major time perception differences between conscious entities aboard objects moving at relativistic speeds and those who aren't moving as fast (fewer years would pass aboard a spaceship moving at 99% of the speed of light than would pass on the crew's home planet). Note to self: &quot;Choose your reading materials more carefully&quot;."},{"Title":"Encounter With Tiber","review":"One of the first things any (halfway decent) writer of fiction will tell you is that the most fundamental rule is &quot;Don't tell me, show me.&quot; Aldrin and Barnes spend an inordinate amount of time in detailed explanations of technology, history, and motivation, and precious little showing their characters in action. &quot;Encounter...&quot; reads more like a premise for a book than real fiction, and the prose is among the worst I have ever seen published. It is difficult to believe that John Barnes, the man responsible for the wildly imaginative (if occasionally banal) &quot;Mother of Storms,&quot; among other competently-written novels, had anything to do with this; I would be embarassed to have my name associated with it in any way. Forget the plot; the &quot;first encounter&quot; scenario has been done so many times, in so many ways, and so often better than it is done here that there is no point to reading this. No point at all."},{"Title":"Encounter With Tiber","review":"I would not buy from them again, the product was not as described it was obviously water damaged therefore nearly impossbile to read and turn the pages without breaking the spine. I will not buy from them again."},{"Title":"Encounter With Tiber","review":"Somewhat unusual hard SF with a rather unique, very interesting basic plot premise. I would have loved this book except I couldn't stop thinking how unlikely it was that there could be a race like the Tiberians - very scientifically advanced yet seemingly as dumb as a stump when it comes to dealing with adverse conditions and primitive races. Come on guys - I guess you could blow it once but twice?? What did John Barnes do? I think all the NASA-type stuff and probably some of the physics as well came from Buzz, but where was the hand of the experienced author who should have been responsible for patching the holes in the plotline and improving the often sophomoric prose"},{"Title":"Encounter With Tiber","review":"The book is made up of many parts some good some bad 1) The first part is much of a NASA propaganda story full of ...back in the good old days of space exploration, when we just wanted to beat the Ruskies and do science. Lots of technical info about the next step, a sad but probably true view of space politics (politics are always sad) too many un-tecnical technical explanations. 2)First contact - a lot of unexiting over simplistic stories about how a unfortunate child growing up with rich well educated parents show him how to be successfull all the while following a sub plot from Dallas the soap opera. Of course the only people who can figure out an alien messasge is an astronaught. (Buzz I sure that you are very proud to be an spaceman but don't keep going on about it) 3)The Aliens - Well if only somebody like David Brin had done this bit (Racisim, war and ignorance, Slavery and Slang are Universal it seems oh! and Politics and religion) poorly done with too much effort to tell the evolution of an entire alien race in 1/3 of a book. 4)Here all the character building over a great time period fails to come together the whole promise of 'This will change your life!' ends with the reliasation that 'Nothing has changed' though maybe that was the point. Too Much Politics, Soap and fiction Not enough Good Science Fiction Still some interesting stuff and some food for thought if you can slug your way through it Cheers"},{"Title":"Encounter With Tiber","review":"This book is a futuristic science fiction, but nearly all the concepts and details of space travel are based on very firm physical concepts. I found it extremely interesting and entertaining from cover to cover, and many times had to pause to understand the concepts, but enjoyed learning about everything Buzz wrote."},{"Title":"Encounter With Tiber","review":"This book has a great story about what it is like to go to space, and talks about a prehistoric race that came to Earth to escape cataclism, with very interesing twists.I read the story some 15 years ago, and still remember it. I liked this book and it made an impression. I hope you enjoy it too."},{"Title":"Encounter With Tiber","review":"Isaac Asimov has always been my favorite author, but Encounter with Tiber is the only book that I have read more than twice (4 times to date). About every other year or so, I will pick it up and read it again, and I have enjoyed it every time. I would love to see a sequel to this novel, and in fact, I am adding this review after searching the net to see any possible news/references to a sequel."},{"Title":"Encounter With Tiber","review":"There is so much realistic technical and socioeconomic detail in this work that even if the rest had been mediocre it would still have been involving. Yet not only did it succeed in the other departments, but I found some deeply moving moments in this book. It also has an excellent philosophical perspective on space exploration and expansionism that properly portrays the sort of civilization that humankind could likely encounter."},{"Title":"Encounter With Tiber","review":"Encounter with Tiber is really two separate stories (I'm not counting the very tenuous Clio Trigorin sections.) Taken as a whole, I'd say it's a worthy effort, not spectacularly bad but with some definite room for improvement. In the Jason Terence subplot, which forms the beginning and most of the end, the science and technology is competently described, and is a very reasonable depiction of some current ideas, eg. spaceplanes, permanent orbiting stations, the commercialisation of space. Where it fails, predictably, is in the human part of the equation, one reason being that we experience a lot of the story second-hand, in the form of Jason's reminiscences. It is difficult, I know, to avoid two-dimensional characterisation in this kind of book, as the personalities will inevitably play second fiddle to the hardware. But it can be done; one example is Voyage by Stephen Baxter (not everyone will agree with me, just read the reviews!) My main moan, however, is reserved for the midsection of the book, a lengthy account of aliens from Alpha Centauri travelling to Earth and struggling to say alive. Creating an alien civilization is a bit of a balancing act. On the one hand, the aliens can't be too alien, as their story would then be incomprehensible; however, the other extreme is to make them more or less the same as humans, and this is the pitfall that our authors have tumbled into. Beneath their Wookiee-like exteriors, the Tiberians (or Nisuans) seem to be human to the core, right down to their dismal politics, race relations and sexual inequalities. It's interesting that an earlier review mentioned cats and dogs. If we left some ordinary domestic cats on an island for several million years and let them evolve into language-using, tool-wielding bipeds, would their thought processes be anything like ours? I don't think so, and yet cats are terrestrial creatures and almost our cousins, viewed from the vast perspective of geological time. As a contrast, I recommend reading The Mote in God's Eye by Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle, for some superbly imagined ETs. My final question is - given the nature of mankind's encounter with the Tiberians, would we really be that eager to meet them again?"},{"Title":"Encounter With Tiber","review":"The 40th anniversary of Apollo 11 prompted me to fetch my copy, bought really to get Buzz Aldrin's autograph years ago. The additional years since its publication have certainly highlighted the contrast between humanity's anemic space program (and various crises) of today and the scenario described in the novel, where even by now (2009) man has returned to the moon and continues on to Mars not long after. The accompanying economic boom would not be unwelcome, either.The threads of human space travel and the alien Tiberians intersect when a surprise transmission indicates that the aliens had possibly visited the Earth, moon and Mars in the past, with artifacts to discover. The race to find and exploit those artifacts provides a major boost to space travel and drives much of the novel's 21st-century timeline. Here the book works well, with technical exposition that some might find occasionally tedious, and some I thought was nicely enlightening, as in the late stages when scientists analyze and speculate on why the Tiberian colonies failed.The main thread on Tiberian society and their attempt to colonize elsewhere before their home world was destroyed was also done well enough. \\"First contact\\" occurred in the human stone age past, with negative consequences for the humans and the very human-like Tiberians, who must leave Earth to try survival on a terraformed moon and Mars.Minor annoyance: some references to Aldrin himself were a bit irksome, as in a plug for his research on the inbound and outbound \\"cycles\\", and in naming a vehicle the \\"Aldrin\\". He also couldn't resist mentioning that the first word really spoken on the lunar surface in the transcripts from Apollo 11 was his own \\"Contact\\". Not cool."},{"Title":"Encounter With Tiber","review":"This book is excellent hard science fiction. There are no fanciful or questionable technologies in this book, like transporters or warp speed -- not even artificial gravity! (other than centripedal force). All the technologies in this story are at least theoretically possible. For example, they never &quot;break&quot; the light speed barrier. Instead, they describe ways of coping with interstellar voyages that take years or decades. Obviously, in addition to bringing his own considerable knowledge about such things to bear, Buzz Aldrin also got a lot of input from all his astronaut and rocket scientist buddies. The only questionable thing the authors did was to make the aliens big, furry humanoids, but I suppose that is forgivable. Really a great book of truly an epic scope, yet the authors managed to completely refrain from any of that &quot;ancient astronauts/Egyptian pyramids/Face on Mars&quot; foolishness too! Bravo!"},{"Title":"Encounter With Tiber","review":"There is so much realistic technical and socioeconomic detail in this work that even if the rest had been mediocre it would still have been involving. Yet not only did it succeed in the other departments, but I found some deeply moving moments in this book. It also has an excellent philosophical perspective on space exploration and expansionism that properly portrays the sort of civilization that humankind could likely encounter."},{"Title":"Encounter With Tiber","review":"This one will win no great awards. The aliens are anthropomorphized far too much. The technical details, while impressive, are often overbearing. And the narrative is undercut with too much dreamy vision.HOWEVER, the actual story is really really good. And, believe it or not, all of the characters sing with consistency, believability and three-dimensional life.So, if you can tolerate Buzz's incessant self-aggrandizing style, and if you can forgive the overbearing technical precision of much of the science, then this is a highly enjoyable novel."},{"Title":"Encounter With Tiber","review":"This is a really good novel. It intruiged me from the beginning all the way until the end. It took me three days to read, and during that time, when I wasn't reading, I was wishing that I was. Anyone who doesn't give this more than 4 stars should pick another book to read, because they did not understand this book at all. I have always been a fan of science fiction, and I find it great!! I suggest EVERYONE who can read, should read this book."},{"Title":"Encounter With Tiber","review":"This ranks right next to 2001, Clockwork Orange and Slaughterhouse-Five as one of the most brilliant and prophetic works sci-fi has ever seen. The scope and detail of the novel is incredible, but if you can't handle detail that surpasses the Tom Clancy level, don't bother."},{"Title":"Encounter With Tiber","review":"Anybody who gave this book less than four stars should be dragged into the street and shot. The parts that took place on earth involving the two or three generations of astronauts was SO real and SO cool, I wouldn't be surprised if everything happens in reality exactly as they say it does, well, the human part anyway. The humans in this were SO human and the humanity, OH THE HUMANITY! I beg to god that I could be one of those astronauts and do those things, (all except the ones that died of course). I'm lucky, cause I got my copy signed by Buzz Aldrin at Planetfest 97 where they showed the first pictures from Pathfinder live. Anyway, the aliens were cool, and strangely sympathy evoking. Two species, related to each other, one looks like siamese cats, the other like a bunch of Lynx cats. Man, you really gotta read this."},{"Title":"Encounter With Tiber","review":"Great book by Aldrin. I especially enjoyed reading about the Apollo hardware and such. If you enjoy this book, be sure to avoid &quot;Titan&quot; by Stephen Baxter! (Titan is another story about life after a shuttle crash)I hope to see more books written by Buzz Aldrin."},{"Title":"Encounter With Tiber","review":"This book was amazing. Even though the first chapters are slow therest are worth the time. It eloquently points out how &quot;humanity&quot; can spread out through time and space, and leaves you to decide if that is a good thing."},{"Title":"Encounter With Tiber","review":"First off, this book is worth reading. This science is interesting, long, and at times much too simple for even moderately sophisticated readers (as another review noted, do we really need Doppler explained to us?!) The writing at times lacks imagination, and it falls especially short of excitement. The description of the first encounter with Tiberian video transmissions conveyed all the excitement of an average baseball game. Where's the wonder? Where's the existential confusion, the mixed feelings of belonging and fear? Nothing of the like -- just calculations and competition to be the first to crack the code. I wonder if Arthur C Clarke really meant what he said in the prologue. Still, if you can provide your own sense of excitement and wonder, the book is otherwise very rewarding."},{"Title":"Encounter With Tiber","review":"I found Tiber to be a great read. Buzz and John Barnes have written a fine piece of sci-fi that works on several different levels. The parallels between the Tiberian space program and the US program were interesting. Buzz also uses his knowledge of current private industry space systems to weave a fine story.Aldrin and Barnes have done a very good job of character development. In addition, the different worlds and different time slices are well done.My review can not due justice but I loved it.Perhaps we can learn a lesson or two from the near future as written by Aldrin and Barnes."},{"Title":"Encounter With Tiber","review":"Buzz Adrin is one of the top sci-fi writers today of what I call &quot;realistic near-future space history&quot;. Encounter with Tiber combines this typehistorical yarn with two other highly popular sci-fi genres: the Contact story, where we first meet our interstellar neighbors, and the Ancient Astronaut, a variation of the Contact story, but in the distant past.The story itself was a 10, the characters were well fleshed out, the story at times was riveting and exciting, and Buzz has the knowledge to portray a very believeable future in which fantastic events occur.The bad news is the sheer length of the book, all 631 pages of it. Even that would not detract from a &quot;stellar&quot; book, but Buzz tends to wander into excruciating detailed descriptions of how space technology works in the 21st century, sometimes for tens of pages. It almost appears as if Buzz couldn't make up his mind what he wanted to do: write an exciting Contact story that spans decades, similar to James P. Hogan's &quot;Giant's Star&quot; series, or write a 21st century space tech manual.Bottom line: skim the tech lessons, and you have a superb read on your hands. I look forward to the sequel!"},{"Title":"Encounter With Tiber","review":"Contrary to an earlier reviewer, I found the Tiberians to be some of the best thought-out aliens in SF writing. The parallels with our own societies was hard hitting and to the point. While it was a bit dry and technical, this is the first SF novel I've read in a long time where I finished by thinking..&quot;Yes. This could happen.&quot"},{"Title":"Encounter With Tiber","review":"At first I was somewhat disappointed. I saw lots of Aldrin's knowledge, but at times it read like a technical manual. I am quite familiar with many of the technical factoids, but some of the technical explanations were not necessary.As the book progressed, I was more pleased. It developed into a very interesting story, made more interesting by the ring of reality that it conveyed. You get some feel for the vast distances between the stars, and what it will take to travel there."},{"Title":"Encounter With Tiber","review":"Encounter With Tiber was, simultaneously, a great read and a chore to plow through. The sense of wonder that Aldrin and Barnes conveyed was woven so closely with a physics primer that I found myself alternately wishing for more and less.The short last chapter closed nicely, emphasizing promise and potential.It was a bumpy ride. But worth it"},{"Title":"Encounter With Tiber","review":"I couldn't resist the play on another reviewer'sheadline...sorry. You can definitely tell whichparts are written by Aldrin: they're pretty dryand pedantic. Like, do sci-fi readers really needto have things like Doppler effect explained tothem? But the story is super, and very engaging(especially after you get beyond the dry technicalstuff). It's hard to tell where the story isgoing, though, or even if it's going anywhere, but overall the package has some good appeal and only has a few brief slow periods. Unlike many alienspecies, the Tiberians are very clearly alian -- and the most fascinating part of the book, I think, is how the alian perceptions of planet Earth are described. This is the genius of the book, if any: the authors are able to stand outside of human society and give a believable account of how an alien species might perceive us."},{"Title":"Encounter With Tiber","review":"Generally a good effort with parts that are riveting, itcould be improved if the humans where as 3 dimensionalas the Tiberians.The technology sounded plausible, with the exception ofthe ZPE lasers - and that surprised me. There is an amazing future within our grasp if only the politicianscan show some backbone and stay the course. Unfortunately, that's about as likely as the discovery ofreal Tiberians."},{"Title":"Encounter With Tiber","review":"In reading the other reviews, this seems to be a &quot;loved it&quot; or &quot;hated it&quot; kind of book, with nothing in between. I definitely fall into the former category. This is one of the best books I've read in quite a while.It is in reality four books in one, in that one of the main characters appearing at the beginning of the book is an author writing the other three, and we get to read her work.The reviews listed above seem to imply that the family of one of the characters who dies is personally responsible for carrying on the work he was involved in. This is incorrect. The man's descendents are involved in the work, but only as part of the combined forces of all the space agencies around the world. Each person is involved by their own individual choice, not because it's &quot;what the family does&quot;. As one of the descendents says, he would've been an astronaut even if his father (the character who dies) had been a plumber.I was sorry to see the book end. It does, however, leave an opening for a continuation. Let's hope that Aldrin and Barnes keep them coming!"},{"Title":"Encounter With Tiber","review":"Soap opera type characters, somewhat simplistic plot. The span of time and the subject matter makes it ideal TV material. Impending doom, desparate people, a great mystery, a long search for answers and what I think is best of all... potential for sequels! If you're not into technobabble (no matter how true and accurate) just skim it and you may very well see the future of mankind unfolding"},{"Title":"Encounter With Tiber","review":"For those without the patience to slog through the techinical and somtimes tedious aspects of what space travelis really like (Trekers) skip this book. But if you want arealistic view of what we might accomplish with just a little help from our &quot;friends&quot; this is a great read. Youhave to get about 1/3 into it before it takes off, but that's fine by me."},{"Title":"Encounter With Tiber","review":"I have read this book and it was great. The stories were beautiful. I have read read many books like this and Encounter With Tiber is one of the best. I like the amount of adventure in this novel and the author's knowledge of current technology as applied to this novel. I recommend this book to anyone who likes science fiction"},{"Title":"Encounter With Tiber","review":"I cant etll you exactly how good this book was because I couldnt get throught the first couple chapters. It was boring as hell and was basically a primer for astronaut training..the authors could have toned down the technical end a bit and gotten on with the plot. Its no wonder I dont see any other reader reviews here..they are probably all still asleep"},{"Title":"Encounter With Tiber","review":"My strongest recommendation to the reader is that this book is reminiscent of A.C. Clarke. Informative and will set your imagination racing about the near future and distant past. The sense of plausibility makes this book fascinating."},{"Title":"Encounter With Tiber","review":"In my long and often fruitless search for decent sci-fi once in a while a gem is found. This is one of those cases. Also this book written in '96 predicted a 2nd shuttle accident which of course happened in Feb. 2003. The current science is very well researched and yet also leads us to see how future things may develop. The characters and the plot are very believable: characters and events are subject to wise decisions but also the flaws that exist in even the best people and governments have their part to play.Not since the original writings of Asimov have I seen such decent and well planed out sci-fi writing.Note to the 1st reviewer: B. Aldrin has a doctorate in astronautics from MIT. How can he be \\"in over his head\\" in writing a sci-fi book???"},{"Title":"Encounter With Tiber","review":"I have read other reviews on amazon about this book and am slightly disappointed. Those who are true sci-fi fans do there best to see the big picture but let bits and pices of rational thought slip so they can take in the fantasay of it all. Some who have reviewed this book have not looked at things with an open mind all the way. This text is wonderfully written and in time will be one of the sci-fi treasures of the 20th century. Aldrin has lent his insight of alien worlds come through, but Barnes has certanly worked all the magic. If you are a true sci-fi fan this is a must read."},{"Title":"Encounter With Tiber","review":"Buzz Aldrin and John Barnes wrote the long, but quite thought-provoking science fiction story &quot;Encounter with Tiber&quot;. At almost 600 pages, it takes a reader at least a couple of days to trudge through the story, especially the early highly technical parts of the story. Aldrin essentially predicted commerical space travel, and from the news, we may not be far off from the scenerio that Aldrin and Barnes present here. The story is told through five different narrators with three humans at various points in the 2lst Century, and two &quot;Tiberians&quot; who came to Earth(or as they called it Setepos) in ancient times. Basically, the message is that science and space exploration takes time and commitment, but it's worth pursuing. The novel leaves the reader wanting more, as Clio(an astronaut traveling in the late 21st Century) discovers that her journey is just beginning. It leaves room for a sequel, which depending on your attitude towards the story is good or bad. I enjoyed this rich novel, and recommend this for anyone who really wants to know why we should try to go to Mars."},{"Title":"Encounter With Tiber","review":"I really liked Tiber. I like the concept of going back and forth in time and enjoyed seeing the view points of the different Tiberian races and the earthlings- maybe the BC earthlings should have had a bit more character. After all they were able to trick a species about 8000 years ahead of them, they should have had some more depth to them.I enjoyed the technical explanations to a point - I am a long time fan of Arthur C. Clarkes books and there is quite a bit of SF technical descriptions there - but at times it got to much from Aldrins descriptions of how things exactly might work. Even I had to scan over some paragraphs to not get too bored.Maybe the middle section with all the Tiberian views were a little too long and could had been interrupted a couple of times - also the end was very anti climactic - but it was fun anyway."},{"Title":"Encounter With Tiber","review":"This is a science fiction story that blends different stages of technical engineering developments around the character development of two civilizations, one from Earth. Plot discussion leverages off known existing technological challenges, solutions and observed facts. This becomes insightful and relevant to today's space efforts and developments. The book contains canonical hooks that could be evolved into many discussion issues around space technology, space law, planetary settlement (nation building), physics, chemistry, biology, medicine, metallurgy, everything. The credibility associated to the discussion by the experienced elder astronaut author takes the book out of the realm of the throwaway science fiction diatribe into discussable scientific trial balloons that warrant further discussion. This book should be turned into an epic movie."},{"Title":"Encounter With Tiber","review":"This is not a read for those who could &quot;never get past the whale blubber&quot; when trying to read the great Moby Dick. The space science, often engineering science, is real like you have never seen it before (just as Melville's account of whaling in the age of sail is authentic). There is a problem, however, especially in the beginning, in being able to always distinguish between what NASA has done, the technical ideas others have developed and that might be done, and authentic technical ideas by Aldrin and perhaps Barnes. It is a shame not to know which are Aldrin's ideas, for some of them are ingenious and created in me a sense of wonder. Do not skip the technological descriptions (hard to do anyway as they are ubiquitous), for as was true of Moby Dick, they provide the book's tone and ultimately define it. Melville's prose sometimes carried a rolling thunder to it, said to be the result of his reading Shakespeare and the King James Bible. This book does not have anything like that quality and therefore will not escape the genre label of SF. But the insights are sometimes astonishing. The whys and the ways of massacre warfare are flatly logically stated, and the killing is carried out by humans and aliens who you otherwise generally think of as good beings (the pain and killing at Kosovo could just as easily be explained). This is Barnes' contribution, I am sure. The nature of race and prejudice is explored with an at times subtle parallel to American history. The politics of space travel are laid out, and it is clear how much hangs on ulterior motives, reactive (as opposed to proactive) thinking, and chance, including disaster. Sad to say, Aldrin and Barnes' implication that it probably would take a Tiber Encyclopedia or planet crushing cloud of comets to galvanate Earthlings to reach for the planets, let alone the stars, is believable. The interelationships of people, whether human or alien, are at times insightful and good, but mostly they are described rather than revealed through their behavior. And a major character (the younger Terrence) is described at length in a way that is so flat and without the novelist's dynamic, that I wondered if it was Buzz Aldrin's autobiography. Nonetheless, the characters are well defined characters. In other words, the fictional quality is not as good as one would like but it works, partly because of the intelligence that has gone into it. The carefully constructed aliens, human characters, and plot, along with the technology, make this story plausable. You may have to remember the stories by the aliens are supposedly dumbed down translations for high school students. Many readers who equate SF with fantasy, whether they realize it or not, and many who want ceaseless action will drop by the wayside; they will never finish this long book. The book is long and alternates from one &quot;novel&quot; to another, but in the end the separate stories are nicely joined. Well done, Aldrin and Barnes."},{"Title":"Encounter With Tiber","review":"People tend to love or hate this book I noticed, but personally I found it akin to Barnes's other novels which I have enjoyed, but simultaneously get annoyed by. Buzz's authorial voice is hard to pull apart from Barnes except where there's a lot of technical concepts flying around - definitely Buzz's material there. A curious omission that many have missed is its silence about the violation of conservation of momentum that the deccelerator loop on the Earth Starship causes - at no point do the authors note the large accelerations such a thing would cause. Also its flight-time seems to be based on non-relativistic calculations - these aren't major errors, but odd considering Buzz's meticulous details on other technical matters."},{"Title":"Encounter With Tiber","review":"This ambitious novel weaves five narratives together to tell the epic story of mankind's encounter with the alien Tiberians. The Tiberians came to our solar system thousands of years ago but left behind only mysterious artifacts, most notably advanced information storage devices known as Encyclopedias. The story of the Tiberians's adventures on our world is framed by the tale of the humans's multi-generational effort to retrieve an Encyclopedia and use the data therein to seek out the homeworld of the Tiberians.Buzz Aldrin's contribution is evident here. Although perhaps too detailed at times, the description of the politics and hardware involved in man's conquest of space is fascinating. A flaw of the novel becomes evident in the lengthy Tiberian mid-section, which probably came predominantly from co-author Steven Barnes. The aliens are far too human in their psychology-so much so that it is easy to forget that they are aliens at all. The novel ends beautifully on just the right note of mystery and romance as humankind, now fully matured as a star-faring race, seeks the elusive descendants of their ancient alien predecessors."},{"Title":"Encounter With Tiber","review":"The hard science fiction novel Encounter with Tiber is an excellent example of the genre. It is literally packed with interesting science, engineering, and technological explanations.It is basically two interwoven stories. The human part is in the present and near future (say, 60-70 years) and is concerned with the activities and people involved with the revived human attempts at space exploration and colonization. Two factors spur their efforts on: the privatization of space technology; and the reception of signals from a planet in the planetary system of Alpha Centauri A, part of a binary star system that's about 4.3 light years (about 25.4 x 10^12 miles or 43.0 x 10^12 kilometers) away from Earth. The planet of origin of the signals is eventually named Tiber and its inhabitants become known as Tiberians.The alien or Tiberian part of the book describes the extraterrestrials' history, culture, biology & physiology, and political institutions in some detail. Because their planet is about to be rendered uninhabitable within a couple of centuries, they have been sending out robot probes to nearby star systems in a search for a suitable planet or planets to which they can migrate. Such a probe has previously examined Earth, and the transmitted data is so promising that a \\"manned\\" expedition is sent to reconnoiter the planet in person.These two parts are woven together by a historian who is on the human starship that's traveling to the Tiberians' home system in the late 21st Century.One character in particular, whom I guess was supposed to be a sympathetic character, was the astronaut and astronomer Chris Terence. Initially, he seemed to be a highly competent and brave astronaut. However, he proves himself to be supremely arrogant; he apparently thinks that the taxpayers should be happy to spend billions of dollars (with no expectation of any return whatsoever) solely so that scientists like him can \\"do science\\" and discover \\"what matters.\\" In a later part of the book, Chris Terence proclaims that, in the 19th Century, the entire American West from Texas to Washington (state), should have been left \\"unspoiled,\\" a fertile playground for anthropologists, geologists, and naturalists. Such an elitist hostility toward development turned me profoundly against him. But, hey, that's just my opinion. There is one scary possibility, however. Could Terence's elitist \\"pure science\\" attitude be NASA's official position today? That certainly would explain their less than stellar performance, over the last forty years, in advancing real (manned) space exploration, industrialization, and development.I thought that it was quite astute of the authors to have the Tiberians' actions on Earth serve as the seeds of various religious myths that would eventually be passed down through the millennia by humans. This was not done explicitly, but it was easy to pick out certain scenes (the runaway lander, the pillar of fire, the flood, the burning bush, the hovering lander(s), the Tiberians' weapons) and imagine how the orally transmitted accounts of these events could have been distorted and embellished over time.I've noticed that, in about 20% of the reviews of Encounter with Tiber, readers are complaining about the science, engineering, and technology that are liberally scattered throughout the book. Well, HELLO...! That's why it's called SCIENCE fiction."},{"Title":"Encounter With Tiber","review":"Sure, some spots are slow and very detailed, however the rest of the book makes up for that. I am amazed by the future technology that he discusses, technology that is just now being discussed in the press, and much that is a reality. Such as laser engine drives, or optical storage, and nano technology. So believable, in fact I am not surprised when I hear another news report of a new technology that Buzz wrote about in 1977."},{"Title":"Ze-Ami and his Theories of Noh Drama","review":"What is Noh? In short, it is the ancient and elite mask dance theatre of Japan. It is deeply connected both to Buddhist and Shinto belief, tracing back to the 12th century. Frankly, there aren't many books in English on noh. Fortunately, this book is an informative and excellent guide to gain core understanding of the history and heart of noh drama.\\"Noh drama is an exquisite theatrical art in the throes of a lingering death.\\" This has been repeated from time to time since the modern theatre era (beginning of the 20th c) in Japan. The arcane art form, though beautiful and atmospheric, was inadvertently fossilized by its foremost theorist/practitioner Ze-ami Motokiyo (1363-1443), whose jealous refusal to share his secrets belied his brilliant insights into the art.Ze-ami wrote his unedited treatises on the training, history and meaning of noh drama for the eyes of his next of kin, believing that one actor in a generation should have access to these seminal ideas. These essays were repetitious and difficult to understand; Ze-ami was an actor and theory-maker, but perhaps not the best writer and teacher of his age. Furthermore, these writings were not seen by subsequent generations until 1909, when the Society for the Study of noh Literature convinced the family that they should be shared. The first definitive texts were issued by Nose Asaji in the 1940s. Not in any way the format of a modern book, the text is all but indecipherable in Japanese. How then to distill and faithfully communicate the complex ideas in English?It is this point which noh actor and researcher Sekine Masaru addresses in his readable Ze-ami and His Theories of Noh Drama. In the introduction, Mr. Sekine outlines the tragic story of Ze-ami and his life work of codifying noh. Chapter I, \\"The History of Noh,\\" is in fact the history of Ze-ami as well. The untimely death of his father Kan-ami when Ze-ami was twenty-two inspired Ze-ami to train hard and record the essence of his father's teachings in a series of essays. The nature of these writings are the basis of the rest of Mr. Sekine's book.Sekine brings into high focus the contributions and ideas of Ze-ami to noh in their historical context. The English reader is illuminated regarding the theoretical and aesthetic underpinnings of the art, including the elusive concept of hana (flower), which, in all its forms, meta-meanings, symbolisms, and miraculous mysteries, becomes an infinite source of inspiration for noh training and spirit. Also contained within these pages is the inescapable conclusion, though subtly alluded to, that Ze-ami sowed the seeds of noh's eventual decline. The noh performances of today cannot be said to enjoy wide public support in Japan among young people. They are seen as atmospheric and mysterious, but also kurai (dark, scary) and easily relegated to the realm of \\"what old people like.\\"What will be the future of noh if its few young practitioners dwindle? If so, Sekine will have fingered the root causes in his excellent reference for the scholar and layman.Personally, I'm betting on such essentially beautiful, meditational, and sublime art to continue to hold a firm place in the theatre of Japan. Ask international noh classical and fusion teachers like noh actors Rick Emmert and Matsui Akira about the enthusiastic receptions they continue to receive in their performances and classes! Will noh performance be lost in the future? Noh way!"},{"Title":"The ethnogeography of the Tewa Indians,","review":"Saw an older, elegant version of this book in 1984 in the Taos NM Library, with beautiful drawings and pictures and cover, on large paper.

Gottscho, 1925-1940","review":"I thought it was very apt to use the word mythic in the title of this wonderful book. Surely Samuel Gottscho as much as anyone helped to create the popular visual concept of the dynamic American metropolis, a city of towers by day and a kaleidoscope of dazzling light by night, his work must have especially influenced creative folk from comic book artists to Hollywood art directors, the graphic city image is straight out of his photos.Apart from the short intro essay the book is basically photos, divided into several sections and covering, for instance, bridges, Times Square, business, commercial and residential areas of Manhattan plus a few photos of the 1939 New York World's Fair. It is with the night photos where Gottscho really excelled. To achieve his luminous effect he took two exposures, one at dusk to define the building shapes and another some hours later to capture all the blazing window lights. I think these photos plus the ones of Times Square at night look quite stunning.Another reason I like the book is the coverage of streamline design that keeps on appearing in many of the photos, not just the skyscrapers but interiors of retail units, Radio City, some of the apartment interiors and obviously the '39 World's Fair.The book is well printed and designed and the paper makes the photos sparkle with their 200 dpi screen. The captions are basically the location, date and architect though frequently there is more detail provided where necessary. Overall I thought this was a fascinating photobook of what New York looked like in the recent past.***FOR AN INSIDE LOOK click 'customer images' under the cover."},{"Title":"The Mythic City: Photographs of New York by Samuel H. Gottscho, 1925-1940","review":"Samuel Gottscho's wonderful photographs combine an architect's eye with the mood of an Edward Hopper painting. Cool but never cold, these photos are simply beautiful. The noir-flavored night shots are among the finest, with the chiaroscuro of a John Alton film. Gottscho had the luck to be living during one of New York's most photogenic periods, after most of the Art Deco classics had been built but before the postwar clutter of shoebox skyscrapers had set in.Technically, this collection is very well produced, with sharp, lustrous photos on high-quality paper. Highly recommended for any fan of vintage urban photographs."},{"Title":"The Mythic City: Photographs of New York by Samuel H.

Gottscho, 1925-1940","review":"A classic portrait of New York City taken from the late 1920's to the late 1930's. Samuel Gottscho was a professional photographer specializing in buildings. He was hired by architects and builders to record their work. It seems that Mr. Gottscho photographed every building of note, every bridge from a time now long past. But the buildings remain, just different. The streets remain, but with a lot more cars.These photographs, all in black and white, seem to me to be the city equivalent of the Ansel Adams nature pictures. There is the same use of strong and dramatic lighting. There is the same concentration on dramatic framing. The city comes out looking clean and friendly. Here in the General electric showroom there is a display of GE's new home refridgerators, comple with the coils on top, and Chrysler's new cars for 1936.Mostly these are photographs of the exterior scenes with the then new sky scrapers emphasized. But also includedd are some dramatic interiors of the homes of the rich and famous.Dramatic photographs from the midst of the depression with World War II yet to come."},{"Title":"The Mythic City: Photographs of New York by Samuel H.

Resister,\\" is to say the least, timely. Although the book was written before the conflict in Iraq it is now powerfully relevant. Perrin was opposed to the Vietnam War and one of the earliest G.I.'s to go AWOL. The book describes his time in the stockade, his escape from Germany, his involvement in the Resistance movement in Paris and eventually his flight to Canada where he now lives. Like many of his contemporaries his commitment to peace has not waned.Perrin's book is important for two reasons. It demonstrates that it is possible for men and women of conscience to withdraw their services from a war effort gone awry and that there are people all over the world who are willing to assist them in whatever ways they can. I was struck in Dick's account, by strangers who opened their doors, took him in, fed and clothed him, gave him shelter and found him work. At the same time he worked tirelessly to help others like himself who found they could no longer serve Uncle Sam in his misadventures.As I read the book I kept hoping that the American public had come to terms with Vietnam, for if they had then there would be hope they might see more clearly what is going on today. But as Dick's story reveals many of the same mental attitudes, \\"my country right or wrong,\\" are still alive and well. This does not bode well for the ending of the current conflict and averting the increasing globalization of it, in the form of terrorism and its counter force; what many Muslims are now pointing to as an apocalyptic clash between Christianity and Islam.The Bush administration's oft repeated statements about staying the course in Iraq suggests that more and more American G.I.s are going to be the focal point for Muslim fundamentalists bent on drawing the blood of the \\"Great Satan.\\" Despite America's high tech weapons they are not able to defeat those who are not afraid to die. An endless supply of suicide bombers means that more and more young Americans will be killed and maimed in a conflict where the Geneva conventions governing war are disregarded on both sides.Young Americans are being seduced with the promised rewards of fighting for a noble cause, career training, and their education paid for if they survive their military service. Young Iraqis are being seduced with promises too, the rewards of fighting for a noble cause and giving their lives to gain what they've been taught are the eternal benefits of paradise. In both instances the seduction is aimed at those who have not experienced enough of life to see the seduction for what it is.As the hostilities escalate more and more of our young will find themselves in situations similar to those experienced by young Dick Perrin. Hopefully those of us who are older will have the wisdom to recognize their courage and the ability to provide whatever love, solace and support they need.Colin D. Mallard, Ph.D."},{"Title":"Managing Cultural Differences, Sixth Edition: Global Leadership Strategies for the 21st Century","review":"Professor Moran's class at the American Gaduate School of International Management is one of the more memorable experiences at that unique multinational training institution. While the school draws students from throughout the world, as an American, I feel justified in admitting that those who grow up in the United States are generally poorly prepared for cross-cultural relationships. Although the lessons I learned in that course have held me in good stead throughout my career and personal life, parts of it were a struggle. So is it with the latest edition of the course's text book.A clue to this can be found on the title page which, in place of an editor, lists an &quot;Editorial Coordinator.&quot; This book could benefit from some serious editorial rigor. It is marred by many typos, including such unfortunate ones as, &quot;the Qur'an, the scared book of Muslims.&quot; Virtually every page has a totally useless pullout, quoting some profound phrase from that page. Selectively used, pullouts are supposed to increase the reader's interest in the material, but when it is carried to this extreme, it just wastes margin space that could otherwise be used for jotting down notes. One short but deadly paragraph manages to use the buzzwords 'empowered,' 'actualize, 'synergy,' and 'connect', which a good editor would have surgically removed. In spite of these execution flaws, I do feel that the book has merit, and recommend it for those who are interested in being more effective in cross-cultural situations.The book is divided into three units. Curiously enough, the first two units both have the same title, &quot;Cultural Impacts on Global Management.&quot; The first cultural impacts unit begins with an introduction building the case for greater cross-cultural skills on the part of managers. It concentrates on the particular problems that American managers have working outside of their culture. The chapter on communications starts getting into some real meat, introducing concepts such as communication context. Anthropologist Edward Hall's illuminating concept of high -- context vs. low -- context communications is described here, and used throughout the book. (This concept was particularly significant to me, and I have also reviewed Hall's book, &quot;Beyond Culture,&quot; on Amazon.) The chapter continues with descriptions of important communication conventions that differ between cultures, and concludes with a set of practical guidelines on how best to make yourself understood when speaking with people whose native language is not your own. The unit continues with some management cultural ideas that are not necessarily limited to multi-ethnic situations, but are applicable to any large organization. This was interesting to me, although it is oriented specifically towards managers who have direct reports.The second cultural impacts unit begins with a section on common characteristics that typically vary from culture to culture, such as appearance, food, sense of self, beliefs, and time of consciousness. The concepts discussed here are applied in the final section of book, so this provides important background information. The unit includes a section on culture shock, and re-entry shock, which should be mandatory reading for all overseas assignees and their managers. I found a checklist of desirable characteristics for foreign employment candidates especially useful, and several of the expatriates I work with agreed that it was consistent with what they had observed. This is followed by a very nuts and bolts section on preparing people for international assignments. The next chapter is entitled &quot;Managing Diversity in the Global Work Culture.&quot; I have to say that I found the book to have a persistent politically correct theme, and I'm not sure that it is necessary to constantly harp on the value of diversity. This was a very popular HR activity at the time this book was written, but I found it distracting.The final unit, which at 200 pages amounts to one-half of the book, is entitled &quot;Culture Specifics and Business/Service Abroad.&quot; Choosing several representative cultures in each continent, it provides detailed discussions on their unique characteristics, along with helpful tips on dealing with people within that culture. This is similar to those books you may have read on &quot;how to deal with X,&quot; but unlike those books, it is built on a strong foundation of sociological, anthropological, and organizational behavior disciplines that are introduced in the first two units.Interestingly, the first chapter is on doing business with North Americans, which through self reflection, can help American readers better understand what it is like to look at a culture from the outside. I'm sure the chapter would also be helpful to non-American readers, but the book is generally aimed at North Americans. While constantly pointing out how important it is to avoid generalizations, each one of the individual cultural studies contains information on the people within those cultures that could be considered just that. One of the balances that I was never able to manage in professor Moran's class, was maintaining a safe distance between sensitivity and prejudice. Attempting to apply these lessons over 15 years, I've learned that cultural sensitivity can help you understand why someone acts in a particular way, and it can also help you anticipate their feelings or reactions, allowing you to better connect with them. The trick is in avoiding either value judgments, or in assuming that cultural guidelines will always be predictive. This helps explain why it is difficult in a book like this to highlight cultural characteristics that may be considered negative. Continuing their politically correct agenda, the authors identify several cultures as being &quot;hard working.&quot; No culture was identified as being lazy, so presumably everyone is above average. A difficult balance, but a necessary one.Such a whirlwind tour really obviously can't do justice to an entire world. It isn't meant to cover the entire world--it is meant to help you apply the lessons in the book yourself, and it succeeds. Although the treatment of various cultures is somewhat uneven, I did find this a very useful and helpful unit, and I will keep if for reference. I do think there are many flaws in this book, and I don't find it particularly easy to read, but in spite of that, I strongly recommend it for everyone who finds themselves in a multi-cultural situation. If you will be dealing with a multi-cultural environment, I recommend reading this book first, and then finding several books on the specific culture you will be exposed to. I highly recommend also finding the time to read Edward Hall. He's entertaining and enlightening."},{"Title":"Managing Cultural Differences, Sixth Edition: Global Leadership Strategies for the 21st Century","review":"Celebrating the 25th Anniversary of the first edition of this work, the authors proffer an expanded version of a text that has come to be regarded as a classic reference work by students everywhere. Their message is still the same, the understanding of our differences, the celebration of diversity, and the creation of partnerships of long-term benefit.While many of the chapter headings are still the same or similar, considerable content has been added and the emphasis in the first half of the book is on providing information to enhance the building of global leadership strategies. We see the reemphasis on the development of cross-cultural communication skills and their presentation of both the positive techniques and the pitfalls to avoid.Much of the thrust of the first half of the book is on cultural synergy which they view as representing a dynamic process that involves adapting and learning, and which involves joint action in which the total effect is greater than the sum of effects when acting independently. Synergy to them creates an integrated solution that does not signify compromise because nothing is given up or lost and it develops the potential members by facilitating the release of team energies..The remainder of the first half of this text looks at managing transitions and relocations, an all too short chapter on managing diversity in the global workforce, women in global business, and effective performance in the global marketplace.This latter chapter on effective performance in the global marketplace addresses issues of global leaders and strategic alliances, the psychological dimensions involved in intercultural contracting, the development of human resources, the essential factors of global performance, integrity in business organizations, ethical relativism, cultural changes that are occurring in many countries, and the management of technology transfer.What puzzled me is that in the entire first section there is only one quotation from Fons Trompenaars and his name never even made it to the index. There are four plus pages on Hofstede's early work and his name can be found in the index.That aside, for a book that is focusing on global leadership strategies for the 21st century to omit any mention or analysis of Trompenaars seven dimensions and the ground breaking work that he has done seems, to put it mildly, somewhat strange. There would seem to be a need for today's readers to go beyond Hofstede and to transition into the data base and findings of Trompenaars research and its application for effective global strategies.Further to this, in their discussion of cultural synergy, there is no mention of the Trompenaars/Hampden-Turner concept of reconciliation. To achieve the true culturally integrated solution that the authors are promulgating would seem to require a reconciliation approach such as can be found in Trompenaars/Hampden-Turner's writings.The second half of Managing Cultural Differences provides data on regional cultural specifics and addresses doing business with North Americans, Latin Americans, Asians and Australians, Europeans, Middle Easterners, and Africans. In these sections, not all countries are considered but for those that are included there is a rich data base and keen insights of considerable benefit.Overall, this is a good book and judging by previous editions, is one that will be of great value to students keen on understanding the world around them.David C.

Moran International Management)Page 444 - 8th paragraph\\"There is not enough work for all their people, so poverty is prevalent. With an adult population of 326 million and official unemployment rate of 15 million, the last thing India needs is labor-saving modern equipment. Over the years, India has implemented intensive population control programs but none were successful. The high birth rate has been attributed to early marriage, the emphasis on bearing sons by the Hindu religion, the security of having children to take care of parents in old age, and the low level of education achieved by the rural masses.Climate and culture contribute to the high incidence of disease and influence the patterns of work. The hot weather season brings constant dust, which results in various infections~ and eye irritations and also limits the outdoor physical activity. The cold, damp rainy season brings on colds, malaria and rheumatism. Their practice of vegetarianism contributes to malnutrition and protein deficiencies. The people of India have a general syndrome known as \\"weakness\\" brought on by their constant exposure to epidemic diseases such as cholera and typhus, and the malnutrition factor.CORRECTION: This are very UNHEALTHY comments and illustrate pure ARROGANCE and IGNORANCE on the authors' part.

In 2000, Charles Schulz (Sparky) released &quot;Peanuts a Golden Celebration&quot; to honor the comic strip's 50 years.This compilation is one of the best ever created. First and foremost is the selection of comic strips from the past 5 decades that are included. It is amazing to read through these strips to see not only how much Charlie Brown and the gang have changed over the years, but also how much the same they are as well. Strips that were created in the 50s and 60s are as relevant today as they were back then.In addition to the strips, this compilation also includes background information on Sparky, along with his insights on how certain stories came to be and why he drew some of the things he did. There are several pages of letters, tributes, and other information included, making this one of the most exhaustive compilations ever seen in the comic strip world.If you have ever been a fan of Charlie Brown or even remotely interested in some of what went through Sparky's mind when creating these characters, this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Peanuts - A Golden Celebration: The Art and the Story of the World's Best-Loved Comic Strip","review":"As a huge fan of Charles Schulz's work, I am immensely pleased with the personal hand-picked collection of comic strips.It was a fascinating journey to see the development of the world-wide favorite \\"Peanuts\\" gang from the early 1950s to 1990s. For some of us younger fans it's a pleasure to see Charlie Brown, Snoopy and the other beloved characters in early stages of creation.Mr. Schulz's incredible talent and obvious insight to children and dogs will be missed. I looked forward to reading his comics every Sunday...:) at least I now have this staggering and timeless collection.Every strip had me busting my gut, and surely it will uplift others !As a fan of comic strips, or Snoopy and friends, this book is a must have in your collection!"},{"Title":"Develop a Super Memory Auto-matically (While-U Drive)","review":"Have you ever re-introduced yourself to a person, and asked for their name again like: \\"Hi, i'm sorry i forgot your name\\". This tape tries to makes it clear that it is not your memory that is the problem. It is (likely) a lack of focus, and attention. The \\"affirmations\\", although quirky, help you to remember the fact that you likely did not forget that persons name. You just weren't paying enough attention when they first told it to you.The audio tape is started with an introduction as to the purpose of the tape: To get you started in basic memorization, and attention focusing techniques. The tape will take you over the basics of the PEG memorization technique (effective for remembering lists). This tape will help to remind you to focus more clearly next time you talk to someone.

My father-in-law can read engineering manuals that are boring as can be, and he can retain the info. This tape/cd is USELESS for providing hints at how to tackle stuff like that. Sure, it's great for parlor tricks: memorize names of people in an audience and develop the ability to memorize a list of anything the audience wants you to memorize... but nothing more."},{"Title":"Develop a Super Memory Auto-matically (While-U Drive)","review":"For people who have not studied memory improvement, this is a good way to start. Bob and Diedre Griswold alternate with Bob giving instructions and Diedre giving affirmations to soft music. They concentrate on remembering names first, and then they switch over to learning a list of things by number. They introduce the idea of letting each number from 1-9 be represented by a letter of the alphabet (the beginning of what's called the \\"major system\\").I enjoy the format -- the Griswolds make it easy to understand. The information is good and Diedre's affirmations are good confidence boosters. And in my opinion, spacing out the lecture with the affirmations help to break it up into easier to understand pieces.It still takes time and practice, but the format makes it easier to do.However, I would not recommend this to be the only place where you get instruction on memory improvement. I would have liked this better if the Griswolds had gone more into detail about visualization techniques in general. But maybe that would have been too long for their CD.I'd recommend following up on this with books by Jerry Lucas, Harry Lorayne, Tony Buzan -- to name just a few.At any rate, it's good for a beginner -- and sometimes I listen to it just to keep my mind a bit sharper."},{"Title":"Develop a Super Memory Auto-matically (While-U Drive)","review":"Waste of time and money.

Organized into bite-sized chapters, the book presents stories and illustrations on a myriad of topics - from core issues, such as health care and personal relationships, to life enhancement arenas, such as travel and personal pampering. As the bountiful women tell their stories, they reveal their wisdom, courage, humor, compassion, and tenacity. Celebrating each women's individuality, Bernell does not advocate &quot;one size fits all&quot; in her commentary and advice. Rather she writes about choices, the choices that should be available to all women, as she advocates against self-imposed limitations that narrow our lives, demean us, or wither our spirits. Fundamentally this book is about the quality of our lives, about &quot;deservingness.&quot; While the focus is on bountiful women, Bountiful Women speaks to all women.

Debbie Powell"},{"Title":"Bountiful Women: Large Women's Secrets for Living the Life They Desire","review":"The whole full-figured women oppression issue is something that has been of interest to me for a while, but only recently have I become introduced and interested in the sociology of it. I picked up this book b/c of all the rave reviews on this website, but when I actually went to go read it, I found it to be one of the cheesiest and most eye-roll inducing self help books I've probably ever encountered. Now, I haven't even read the whole book yet, so my review might not have 100% credibility, but from what I've read, I hated.Why you ask? Well, even though I appreciate that a heavy woman feels beautiful and wants others to feel the same (cause they all are) I'm really looking for a book w/ insight. These books really are made to build a woman's self esteem and create awareness in both men and women to the cruelties and ignorance made by people about heavy people, but a reader doesn't just want to author to continuously say &quot;you are beautiful and you can do anything!&quot; over and over again. A reader wants research, theories, hypocrisies of world cultures to really feel like she does have a right to happiness even though she's a heavy woman; in other words, we need facts and important info to back up a compliment. This books gives none of that. Instead, what we have here is just a collection of old folkies telling cheesy short stories on how they make themselves feel beautiful. In between these quotes all we have are bridges given to us by the author to prepare us for the next quote. Each chapter is entitled with a different subject, and the first paragraph to the chapter talks briefly about that title (making you think you're in for something good), for example &quot;In-laws&quot; or &quot;They just mean well,&quot; and &quot;dating and romance,&quot; etc. Then it once again goes into more stupid, pointless quotes by people we don't even know, all pretty much saying the exact same thing. A lot of the stuff isn't even about big women and how they make themselves feel beautiful. A whole bunch of it is simply talking about what colors can match others in clothing, make-up tips, etc. It's so shallow it's annoying.If your over the age of 60, there's a chance you'll probably find this book interesting, other than that, you'll be bored to death. If you want REAL research and challenging insightful theories, not to mention at least a hint of laughter which this book gives nothing of, check out Wendy Shanker's &quot;The Fat Girl's Guide to Life.&quot; I love big women, but this book is junk."},{"Title":"Bountiful Women: Large Women's Secrets for Living the Life They Desire","review":"My wife is a large (no, bountiful) woman.

As a large sized woman myself, I had come to the conclusion that I couldn't keep 'weighting&quot; to get thin before I could live my life, and so have pushed myself through many barriers, but Bonnie Bernell has carried the idea so much further than I ever dreamed of. I love the concept she puts forth in the title (Bountiful Women): living your life as fully as you possibly can, in every aspect, not just professionally, but socially, athletically, and in every way possible. The book is easy to read. Each chapter begins with inspirational quotations, then the concept for the chapter is explained with clear examples and quotations from real people who were interviewed for the book. Chapters end with &quot;secrets&quot;-how to cope with the problem area just described. Even thin people could benefit from reading this book, because people, in general, tend to hold themselves back because of perceived limitations-not thin enough, not good-looking enough, not smart enough, not loved enough, and on, and on, and on. This book has much to say for the large sized man also. I recently recommended it to a male friend of large dimensions who thinks that he cannot live his life until he loses weight.

The awkward spinster cousin blooms &quot;like a dry little plant set out in a gentle rain&quot; when her critical mother leaves the room. A woman delirious with influenza falls into a sleep &quot;that was not sleep but clear evening light in a small green wood...&quot;I thought Flannery O'Connor had ruined all other southern short fiction writers for me, but Porter meets O'Connor's deft character portraits, with their keen knowledge of mannerisms and their psychological depth, as well as O'Connor's ability to surprise the reader with moments of recognition: Miranda's girlhood experience feels like my girlhood experience, across generations and geography. Even Mr. Thompson's story feels like it could have happened in one's own family, like the story grandparents and great aunts and uncles half-tell and subtly refer to while the turkey roasts in the oven and everyone steals nuts off the pecan pie.I agree with others who are astonished that this book is not part of the literary canon in the U.S. It is a stunning, gorgeous example of short fiction. With the impenetrable heaps of &quot;literary fiction&quot; from contemporary writers, marketed to ridiculous heights, I'm finding old gems like this one soothing to my constantly inundated reader's mind. Read it. And writers, take note."},{"Title":"Pale Horse, Pale Rider","review":"I first read this book about thirty-five years ago, as a young teenager. At the time, I didn't really know what it was about, lacking the historical background to understand World War I, and having no knowledge whatsoever of the widespread influenza epidemic of 1918. Nevertheless, the memory of Porter's shimmering prose somehow stayed with me, leading me to read the story once again, this time as an adult, and to finally comprehend it better. In fact, I have reread it several times over the years, always profoundly moved by the experience. Recently, after the events of September 11, 2001, I found myself thinking again of the story, and hauled it out of the library for still another reading. It is more beautiful and meaningful than ever. It has the powerful force of deeply felt, true experience."},{"Title":"Pale Horse, Pale Rider","review":"I think the author that Katherine Anne Porter is most often compared to is Thomas Mann. Both wrote their best known work in the novella form and both use a highly distilled prose which is rich in symbols. Death in Venice and Pale Horse Pale Rider(both dealing with plagues of some sort) are two of the best novellas you are likely to come across, both appear in most novella collections(even though Porter didn't much care for that word). Porter evokes another author though as well, Mary Shelley, in Pale Horse Pale Rider. Being a male reader who doesn't read a lot of female authors I am always struck by something in authors like Dickinson and Woolf and Porter and Plath which is that distanced perspective, the writing seeming to come from somewhere outside of life, real life being only a memory. This may be a personal point of view only but in Pale Horse the main character Miranda, even before the epidemic hits, seems the perfect example of this phenomenon as she seems not to very much want to participate in the life around her. She may be tempted into something resembling life by her lover Adam but still she seems to be sleepwalking. So it is not all that surprising that when death does enter her chamber so to speak it is received as not an altogether unwelcome guest. Miranda's dream or vision is so well written and the pace of it so well sustained throughout that you feel you have accompanied her through it. One of those sequences you never quite forget. The coming to life again segment(Shelley)is also quite astonishing and strangely, eerily beautiful. The other two tales are good too but this is the one you will remember. There are many great romantic and symbolist(especially) paintings that you will feel you understand or have a strange communion with after having read this."},{"Title":"Pale Horse, Pale Rider","review":"Katherine Anne Porter writes like a lapidary; each sentence is like a polished jewel, every word is perfect. &quot;Pale Horse, Pale Rider&quot; is a compilation of three novellas: &quot;Old Mortality&quot;, seen through the eyes of Maria and Miranda Rhea, two children home for the weekend from their stultifying boarding school, is the tale of the family black sheep, a beautiful young cousin of easy virtue who continues to fascinate and frustrate her extended family long after her early death; &quot;Noon Wine&quot; shows us a Texas family torn apart by the guilt of the father who murdered a man in what may or may not have been self-defense, and &quot;Pale Horse, Pale Rider&quot; brings Miranda back again as a young woman disillusioned too many times, whose relationship with her lover Adam is threatened not only by his impending entry in to combat in World War One, but even more immediately by the specter of the great flu epidemic of 1918 that is sweeping through the population, leaving more death in its wake than any war ever fought. Porter writes sparingly, but she packs a world of emotion and feeling into every paragraph. This relatively short book is one of the giants of American fiction."},{"Title":"Pale Horse, Pale Rider","review":"This book clearly deserves more than five stars.Pale Horse, Pale Rider is one of the finest American novels of all time. Long before nonfiction books about dying and coming back to life became popular, Katherine Anne Porter wrote this brilliant story about life and death during the influenza epidemic near the end of World War I. Unlike any other book I have read on this subject, she successfully captures the perspective of the beauty of death eclipsing the beauty of life. The book further develops this theme to explain how our perspective shifts back towards favoring life, as the memory of death retreats.Like all great novels, this one transcends its obvious theme into a broader one -- the meaning of the inevitable death that ends each of our lives . . . and what life means in this context. One of the fascinating plot complications that she uses in this book is showing how &quot;duty&quot; to life usually means increasing the likelihood of death. As a result, you see death more visibly in front of you through this book than you ever will in every day life.The story begins with a young woman reporter who is concerned over the chance of losing her job because she has refused to buy a Liberty Bond. She feels she cannot afford it, and she doesn't want to buy one any way. The reason she cannot afford one is due to have been demoted for refusing to write a story about a young woman that another paper ran. As she races from social event to social event, while scribbling her short columns in between, she longs for a personal life and a future. She is attracted to a young man in the Army who is awaiting shipment abroad. She knows this relationship is hopeless. He will be gone in a few days. Also, on the front, people with his job of clearing mines usually die quickly. Against this potential for romance is an influenza epidemic that is taking many lives. Our heroine finds herself feeling a little under the weather. What happens next is described in some of the greatest writing about illness since Marcel Proust's Remembrance of Things Past.This is quite a short novel, so you can read it quickly. I suggest doing it in one sitting, if possible. In that way, the cadence of the inner voices of this story's progression will have a much stronger effect on you. I do recommend reading this on a weekend, though, early in the day. You might not sleep too well if you wait until late at night.After you have finished reading this novel, I suggest that you consider how you view death. Consider the event from several perspectives: emotional, intellectual, as an ending, and as a beginning. Also, look at other peoples' deaths as well as your own. If you do this carefully, I think you will see new perspectives that will be helpful to you.I remember how surprised I was when I first met people who saw death as an opportunity to happily celebrate the life of one of their friends. When I thought about my own reaction to that, I realized that I needed to spend some time thinking more about death. The results were very worthwhile for me. I hope they will be for you, as well.See beauty in all the light around you!"},{"Title":"Pale Horse, Pale Rider","review":"In PALE HORSE, PALE RIDER, Katherine Anne Porter creates a world of two universes; one contains the semi-autobiographical life of Porter's alter-ego, Miranda, who is seen first as a very young girl in the first novella, \\"Old Mortality,\\" then later as an adult woman in the third entrant, \\"Pale Horse, Pale Rider.\\" The third novella is \\"Noon Wine,\\" which is linked to the other two in its focus on a protagonist whose choice of life is severely restricted by the need to conform to society's restrictions. In these three long short stories, Porter elaborates on themes and character types that had previously appeared in her short stories. Porter most often examines the innermost recesses of the human mind that cause her protagonists to encounter spiritual and physical isolation even as they attempt to reach out to end their disconnection. These attempts at finding a soul mate are at first rebuffed, but in their continual probing for like-minded life mates, they achieve a near Faulknerian level of endurance even as they fail.In \\"Old Mortality,\\" Porter becomes young Miranda, who has heard of the almost mythical attributes and deeds of her aunt Amy. In Miranda's mind, her aunt is the apotheosis of all that she herself could be. Porter suggests that much of the accepted myth of the American south is similarly grounded on a no questions asked basis. Later as Miranda matures, her growth is seen as both physical and spiritual, but her sphere of newly-won perceptive vision comes at a heavy cost. She learns what happens when brute reality collides with delicate myth. In the second part, Miranda meets the husband-lover of Amy, whose appearance, actions, and words disrupt her connection to the past. This disconnect is deliberately shaded so that the reader is not quite sure whether Porter intends a discrediting of the past or merely a modifying of its accepted interpretation. In the third part, Miranda is further distanced from her idealized view of Amy when she talks to her cousin Eva, who has a definite grudge against Amy, the result of which leaves Miranda feeling that the immortality of myth is itself a myth. Stories and legends then must be measured against the mortality of those who lived them and those who told of them.In \\"Noon Wine,\\" Porter tells of a tragedy that begins in the past, assumes a myth that becomes self-sustaining, then encounters a reality that causes pain for all concerned. A Texas farmer named Thompson hires a roustabout Olaf Helton as a field hand. Helton works hard, well, and uncomplainingly. Thompson is more than pleased with Helton but is puzzled by Helton's harmonica, upon which he never plays more than one single tune. One day, a bounty hunter appears with a tale that disrupts Thompson's idyllic view of Helton. The bounty hunter, Homer Hatch, tells Thompson that Helton is an escapee from a lunatic asylum where he was committed for murder. Thompson ironically and unwittingly kills Hatch to protect Helton, an act for which he is tried and exonerated in court. The trial is so devastating to Thompson that he kills himself in depression. Both Thompson and Miranda are faced with disruptive reminders from the past, and the results cause pain to them and their families.In \\"Pale Horse, Pale Rider,\\" Porter brings back Miranda as an adult newspaperwoman during the First World War. She falls in love with Adam Barclay an army officer that brings to mind the ill-fated romance between Amy and Gabriel. Both lovers are stricken with the flu epidemic and Adam dies, leaving Miranda grief-ridden. The best Miranda can hope for is to reestablish her spiritual center in a world that is hostile to her very attempt. In all three novellas, Porter precisely captures the essence of those who face moments of crises when they begin to see that the ground underneath their feet is not as solid as once believed."},{"Title":"Pale Horse, Pale Rider","review":"I was unfamiliar with Katherine Anne Porter before reading this book and am now glad I picked it up. Porter has an amazing way with words and with characterization. With only a few sentences you feel as if you know the people in her stories. This book contains 3 short novels of which I think Pale Horse, Pale Rider is the best. Miranda is a young woman working at a newspaper during the last year of the first world war and of the tragic flu epidemic which killed millions. She goes from show to show every evening writing reviews for the paper, never sure why she bothers. She is alive, but not living. She dines and dances with a soldier she loves but knows the relationship is pointless as he is being shipped overseas in a few days. Then she contracts the flu and the end is a harrowing description of the effects of the disease.Noon Wine is the second strongest in my opinion, detailing a small Texas family dealing with the aftermath of the father murdering a man. It may have been in self defense, but it might not have been, you are left with the question and the family is left with the guilt and shame.Old Mortality tells of the sad life of Gabriel through the eyes of his two young nieces. The woman he loves puts him off for a lengthy time while flirting with other men. Finally, though she doesn't love him, marries him and dies 6 weeks later. Gabriel never completely recovers.These novels are beautiful and sad, filled with complex characters trying to get through each day while figuring out why they are doing it."},{"Title":"Pale Horse, Pale Rider","review":"By the time I came along, Katherine Anne Porter was known as the author of the blockbuster SHIP OF FOOLS, the inspiration for the blockbuster movie of the same name. She was pop, or so I presumed, never having read the book or seen the movie. After reading PALE HORSE, PALE RIDER, I realize I was missing out on a lot by dismissing her as such. This book is a perfect trio of novellas, each crafted from a tradition that emphasized the classic architecture of fiction--plot, character, voice, dialogue, setting, title, symbolism, theme and, especially, vision.All three stories were historic fiction when Porter published them in the 1930s. She is looking back on the visitable past, the remains of the 19th century as they pressed upon the earliest years of the 20th. The first story, \\"Old Mortality,\\" explores the weight of a family legend upon an extended family, especially one little girl. The next, \\"Noon Wine,\\" visits a poor Texas farmer who hires a mysterious, harmonica playing stranger, a Swede from the north, who quietly saves the farm, only to be outed years later by a bounty hunter as an escaped mental patient. The last, the title story of the collection, returns to the young girl of \\"Old Mortality,\\" now a young career woman who witnesses the homefront of World War I and the killer flu of 1918. Porter nails the era, the South, the nation and all of humanity in stories that build and explode in ways that postmodern fiction never does. Each is a stand alone story but they sing to one another and make the experience of reading one after the other that much more satisfying. Porter makes the attention to character, to detail, to the expression of creative vision seem effortless.To say more is to spoil the experience of reading this volume. Go for it."},{"Title":"Pale Horse, Pale Rider","review":"Pale Horse, Pale Rider is the collection of Katherine Anne Porter's three short novels that was first published in 1939, offering three pieces of fiction that very much helped to make and secure Porter's reputation as one of this country's best short fiction writers. Calling these pieces \\"short novels\\" may be a bit of a stretch for most readers, however, and it may be more appropriate to look at them as \\"long short stories.\\" After all, the book is only 150 pages in length.Porter herself weighed in on the question and seems to have preferred the term \\"short novels\\" asking of readers and critics, \\"please do not call my short novels Novelettes, or even worse, Novellas. Novelette is classical usage for a trivial, dime-novel sort of thing; Novella is a slack, boneless, affected word that we do not need to describe anything. Please call my books by their right names...\\" However we choose to categorize these stories, it is easy to see why they are still being read today, almost seventy years after they were first published, and why they solidify Porter's reputation.The first and last stories in Pale Horse, Pale Rider share a main character, Miranda, who is portrayed in \\"Old Mortality,\\" the first story, as a child growing up in the shadows of her almost legendary Aunt Amy, a beauty who died young but still seems to be the family \\"star.\\" Miranda and her sister spend much of their childhood trying to unravel the legend of their aunt's life and to make some sense of all the family personalities involved in her history, including that of their own father. As is always the real strength of Porter's fiction, this story is filled with interesting characters and astute observations about the dynamics of family life.The book's last story, \\"Pale Horse, Pale Rider,\\" centers again on Miranda, now a young newspaper columnist struggling to make a living completely on her own during the trying times of World War I. Porter captures the home front atmosphere well, including the often overzealous characters who tried to shame their fellow citizens into buying war bonds they could not always afford and the friction between the young men still at home and the women who had been left behind by their own soldier husbands, sons and boy friends. But her story centers on the flu epidemic that so devastated the world during the war years. Her description of the surreal dreams and confusion Miranda experiences in her struggle to survive an attack of the flu is an intense, and sometimes tiring, experience for the reader.But it is the middle short novel, \\"Noon Wine,\\" that is my favorite. \\"Noon Wine\\" takes place on a tiny Texas farm between 1896 and 1905. As the story opens, the farm is going nowhere and its owner resents the fact that his sickly wife has insisted upon expanding into the dairy business. Even on such a small scale, this lazy man is not at all happy with the daily requirements of tending to his milk cows. His savior arrives in the person of a foreign drifter willing to work for low wages while practically running the farm for its owner. Several years later when a stranger comes to the farm asking questions about the drifter, events suddenly go out of control to the extent that lives are changed forever. Nothing that happens is black and white and Porter does a remarkable job in presenting all the gray tones involved in the situation.Pale Horse, Pale Rider is an impressive collection that should not be missed by Katherine Anne Porter fans. At the very least, pick up a copy of the book long enough to read \\"Noon Wine.\\" You will be happy that you did."},{"Title":"Pale Horse, Pale Rider","review":"this beautiful book impressed me greatly. it alone securely establishes katherine anne porter as one of the very best american prose writers of our century, in the company of faulkner, hemingway, o'connor, fitzgerald, west, and pynchon. this is american LITERATURE"},{"Title":"Pale Horse, Pale Rider","review":"An excellent book- well delivered. This was a part of my book club selections - and the price was right for me. A look at the effects of the influenza during WW I"},{"Title":"Pale Horse, Pale Rider","review":"This book by Katherine Anne Porter, originally published in 1939, consists of three short novels, each about fifty pages long. Though the three pieces vary in style and subject matter, they are all of exceptional quality and admirably showcase Porter's estimable talent for crafting short fiction.In the first piece, \\"Old Mortality,\\" two young sisters grow up listening to the family stories told by their parents' and grandparents' generations, which over time develop into a sort of mythology. The most romanticized character in the family saga is the tragic figure of Aunt Amy, who, praised for her beauty and perfection yet criticized for her free spirit, suffered from tuberculosis and died at a young age. Though written in the third person, the novel is related through the eyes of Miranda, the younger of the two young girls. As she grows into womanhood, Miranda begins to understand that the reality of the past does not live up to the romanticized mythology she grew up with, and that family, beyond its sheltering comforts, has a dark side as well.The second novel, \\"Noon Wine,\\" takes place on a farm in southern Texas. Mr. and Mrs. Thompson, despite having two young children, are growing aged and infirm. They cannot keep up with the farm work as they used to. Salvation comes in the form of Mr. Helton, a stranger who shows up at their gate one day asking for work. Mr. Helton is a Swede from South Dakota, and a relentlessly hard worker. As a farmhand he is truly the answer to the Thompson's prayers. Yet, as most good things are too good to be true, the Thompsons soon begin to suspect that this laconic stranger may have some dark secrets in his mysterious past.The final piece, \\"Pale Horse, Pale Rider,\\" also stars a young woman named Miranda, whom we can assume is the same girl from the first piece, though it's never explicitly stated. Now 24, alone and independent, she works as a theatre critic for a newspaper in a western \\"hick town,\\" which sounds a lot like Denver. Miranda falls in love with a soldier who will soon depart for the European battlefields of World War I. She despises the war and the jingoism that accompanies it, and dreads the day when her new love will depart for his inevitable doom. War is not the only manifestation of death that looms ominously on Miranda's horizon, however, as an influenza epidemic also rages through the city.My personal taste in literature usually leans toward more antiquated works of romantic, realist, and naturalist stylings, but as far as the literature between the World Wars is concerned, Porter is clearly the best of the American modernists. She utilizes the linguistic experimentation and psychological probity characteristic of modernism to her advantage, without indulging in the gratuitous verbal games to which so many of her contemporaries succumbed. Her writing straddles the line between the naturalism of Theodore Dreiser and the modernism of William Faulkner, combining the best characteristics of both while dispensing with their faults. \\"Noon Wine,\\" which is primarily a naturalistic piece, is the strongest work in the book, while the more abstract \\"Pale Horse, Pale Rider,\\" is the weakest. At times it seems the main purpose of the latter piece is for Porter to demonstrate her prowess at depicting surrealistic, influenza-induced hallucinations. Nevertheless, all three novels are very strong works of literature and will appeal to readers of all stripes who appreciate writing that's both proficient and profound."},{"Title":"Pale Horse, Pale Rider","review":"Few authors can deliver the ethereal feeling of sleep, dream, malaise or other seemingly other worldly moments of consciousness. This author is a master. I would even place her with today's grandmaster of such writing - Haruki Murakami. My feelings are not alone - \\"Many of Katherine Anne Porter's stories are unsurpassed in modern fiction.\\" Robert Penn Warren.In this book of three short stories, the first is the weakest, and the last in the strongest. The first is written in the perspective of a young woman who revered an aunt but discovers the \\"good looking aunt'\\" may have been a less delicate or beautiful character. This story is more about the writing than the story - and though it may be the weakest, it well surpasses the average story in American literature.The second is a classic men's perspective of mid-western perspective with an overlay of classic Greek tragedy. The story delivers the innocent and good to the worst of all worlds: murder - or is it? The bad also are hurt, but the living and good people are more affected. The simplistic dialogue and salt of the earth personalities remind me of Faulkner.The last story, from which the novel gets it title, returns to the female narrator whose woozy self, created by illness, transfers in and out of consciousness, while struggling with her job, the world's war, and her relationship with a man about to go off to war. Like all of the stories, it too involves a tragic ending, but this book seems to have a little hope - there is some light at the end of its tunnel.I feel a Toni Morrison style in this writing - some discussion of the otherworldly touching the living, and closing other concepts with spiritual verses of songs or prayer.These stories hug you and give you goose bumps. You may weep and mourn but do so in sympathy.In this short review, I have likened this author to Murakami, Faulkner, and Morrison - and showed devout admiration by Warren - need I say more?"},{"Title":"Pale Horse, Pale Rider","review":"With these three, very different stories Porter fully emerged onto the American literary scene in the 1930s, having scored a success previously with \\"The Flowering Judas Tree and other stories\\". Though the book has only the three sections, they are so separate as to warrant separate reviews. Only one character, Miranda, appears in two stories. She is probably Porter's alter ego, though I am not so familiar with the details. All the stories deal with Death in some manner, Love plays a strong role in the third, and to some extent, maybe tangentially, in the first.OLD MORTALITY explores how the influence of a dead family members can extend far beyond the dates of death; the sagas of their loves and lives touching the children of following generations. I found this tale of a proper Southern family harder to \`get into' than the others, but very persuasive once absorbed. While not much about race, it certainly deals with social class and decadence, in a certain Southern literary tradition.I liked the second story, NOON WINE, the best, a portrayal of a hard-working, tight-lipped Swedish-American workman from North Dakota who turns up on a hardscrabble Texas farm and stays working there for years. He slowly becomes a family member, bringing the farm to a semblance of prosperity, but never reveals his past. His only recreation is to play on a set of harmonicas; he knows but a single old Swedish song about people who drink before noon. A final twist of the tale brings death and loss of reputation.The last offering, PALE HORSE, PALE RIDER, is a love story set during World War I and the influenza epidemic that swept the world then. Porter herself nearly died in Denver (scene of this story) of the same disease, so even though all the stories are drawn from her experience, this one must be the closest. We might describe PH,PR as a race between Love and Death, as Miranda fades into illness, cared for by a handsome soldier with whom she's in love. He goes off, preparing to go to Europe, she's hospitalized. The end is not what you'd think. Or maybe, it's precisely what you'd think if you find death romantic.All three stories are excellent, with strong color and description, subtle changes in character and mood, interesting transformations; well-worth reading despite their age. Porter was no doubt one of the best writers working between 1935-1965 though she seems to have faded from the pantheon at the moment."},{"Title":"Pale Horse, Pale Rider","review":"Have just finished Old MOrtality portion of this book. The way porter goes @ language, a bull w/ her head, hooking @ hoping to gore us something...It is admirable. Also a Texan &amp; have not heard of her. Even if you've never been to the state, she is that rich link to the region and to humanity in general that many of the southern writers are. When you read Eudora Welty, you get distinct pictures of humans and what it is they do and think and feel during their days. Porter does it, too. She doesn't go for hard contrasts like Flannery O'Connor, but has a simple workmens' ethic to her language. (John Gardner is recalled by this.) I can care less about the topic of the first story...it's just that porter makes you want to know because she nails down for us a real world inhabited by real people. Amen, folks."},{"Title":"Pale Horse, Pale Rider","review":"previously read first part of this book and it was great..Second part also excellent. Mr Helton, the farmer's dilemna, the stranger were all rendered cleanly...thought ending dragged wee bit on 2nd part, but still a strong one..I wondered what would happen to the people while reading it without being jerked by the writer to feel by dishonest means this way or that. (You know, some writers want sadness so throw a dead puppy or a crippled child into the mix w/out creating a real character. just for the sake of wringing a feeling out of us by this foul means.) Porter never resorted to a trick in this story except that its overlong ending may have detracted just a bit. Just a bit.The 3rd story felt dishonest. I admit it's hard to portray illness dramatically...well, ok the russians did it with one day in the life of what's-his-name. But porter doesn't do it here. And while she did give us this and that metaphor to give our senses something to react to and make it all less abstract..the way she piled one top of another hurt the overall story. It made it seem dishonest. It smelled of 'how do i make this story longer?' desperation. A shorter illness of miranda would've helped. The fin de siecle feeling of a war..she evoked it, but then seemed unsure of where to go from there. As a short story it might've been better.POrter is a good writer..but you can skip the third part of the book and leave liking her better for it."},{"Title":"The Gun from Eagle Mountain","review":"This book is one when you start reading you just can't put it down.

Revised and Updated: Positive Christian Response, A","review":"Overall, the book is informative, spiritually and mentally, about homosexuality. It shows that one's sexuality and one's walk with Christ need not be mutually exclusive, and in many cases, CANNOT be mutually exclusive. For homosexual christians, the book shows the unconditional love of Christ, regardless of sexuality. For non-homosexual christians, the book is an inspiration on how they should &quot;love&quot; all their brothers and sisters in christ, regardless of sexuality.

Revised and Updated: Positive Christian Response, A","review":"As an evangelical Christian who believes that acting on homosexual desires is a sin, I approached this book with some trepidation. I knew that I would be challenged, but I also knew that it is our responsibility as Christians to fully understand and to examine our beliefs. I too have been repulsed by the way in which gays have been singled out for condemnation and hatred within our society, and how the church has been frequent accessories to that condemnation. Where is the love we are to be known for? Perhaps, I thought, we all have it wrong and need to accept that we have erred in our Biblical interpretation of sexuality. After a careful read, though, I can say that I was not persuaded. If you are inclined to accept their conclusions, then you will miss the false analogies, straw man arguments, word-mincing, hearsay, appeals to emotion and fallacies of arguments that sustain the flow of the book. Scholars and groups who seem to possess agendas are also not very convincing when appealed to as authorities. It all makes for a powerfully articulated opinion, but it absolutely fails when read with discernment. I also think the authors do some disservice to the debate. There are some pretty extreme examples of anti- homosexual behavior in our society that are cited throughout the book, and I am angered by them too. But the overall impressions with which the authors cast those opposed to homosexuality becomes shameless. Nazi references notwithstanding. In the end, it was the chapter on scripture that was interesting but not persuasive. There do seem to be alternate ways to look at some scripture to justify the words homosexual Christian, but after going into example-after- example of their case, I realized it took more faith to believe in their creative interpretations than to believe in literal scripture. Scriptural gymnastics was a phrase that came to mind. In the end, if the authors agree that sex outside marriage is a sin, then it should make the Biblical case for gay marriage. I wouldn't suggest this book to a Christian as an introduction to thinking about homosexuality. You have to have some sense of maturity in the topic to deal with authors who suggest that if you don't agree with them, or if you lack personal involvment with gay people, then you are lacking the compassion and clear-thinking the discussion requires. To that extent, I found the book condescending."},{"Title":"Is the Homosexual My Neighbor?

It is great for people who are really interested in typography."},{"Title":"Bunker 13: A Novel","review":"I had met the author on one of his visits to New York and he had mentioned about writing this book. I kept in touch with him, and actually got to go through an advanced copy of it too. The book starts out tight and only gets tighter page by page. Reads like your typical Tom Clancy thriller, with good action, descriptive but not boring .. enough of a pace to keep you hooked and glued ... but the real twist comes in the end. The end just leaves you gasping for air at the audacity of the whole plot.The story is contextual to India and Kashmir, so i would suggest getting a brief overview of the nationalistic rivalry in that part of the world (much like the happenings between the Serbs and Croats) to really and truly appreciate the wonderful insanity of this book.Also makes you question your perspectives on nationalism and what it means to be patriotic .. but then thats too deep a topic for this book. This is a true blue nail-biter of an action thriller.Overall, an awesome read that i just cant seem to get out of my mind ..."},{"Title":"Bunker 13: A Novel","review":"Aniruddha Bahal's Bunker 13 moves at such a lightening quick pace that the reader rarely has time to think. Bunker 13 stars MM, an adrenaline junky of an investigative news reporter, ostensibly researching illicit weapons and drug deals in the Indian Army. MM spends much of the book stalking his nemesis, a Major Rodriguez, but nothing in Bunker 13 is exactly as it seems. The story takes off with MM going through paratrooper training in the Indian Special Forces, with a high octane narcotic chaser. From there, MM follows Rodriguez into Kashmir... and to go into any more detail would give away too many spoilers. This is not a book meant to make you think; its all action, well written and fast paced.If there's a major flaw in the book, its that at times the package is so fast, dark and smooth it doesn't feel particularly Indian. In that regard, Bunker 13 had a vaguely Bollywood feel to it... not only is it a twisted version of real life, on speed, but its an idealized Indian/Western version at that. Bahal uses the 2nd person while writing the book, and while at first annoying it eventually has its impact. In some ways, the second person perspective gives the book a slightly psychedelic feel, although in the beginning it felt derivative of something else, perhaps Complicity by Iain Banks.Despite any flaws, or lack of Indian flavor Bunker 13 is nothing but a literary version of a high end Hollywood action film. Thinking too much spoils the fun, and the plot twists at the end are so wild that nobody could anticipate them. Instead, the reader should sit down, pour a drink, and just enjoy the ride. Its dark, fast, fun and not easily forgotten!"},{"Title":"Bunker 13: A Novel","review":"This is the best thriller I have read in a long time. Picture Hunter S Thompson writing Catch 22, that's how funny and ferocious this book is. This book is about a dangerous game of double dealing and an anti-hero that layers identity on identity. MM is a defence journalist but has an agenda of his own, and with Spider Jerusalem-like vehemence he takes on everybody that stands in his way. Saying more about the story would be giving it away, go and read it for yourself, you wont be disappointed. Here are a few tasters though: free-falling while shooting heroin, spies and mobsters, rogue army units and nuclear arms-heists, stingers and mp5's, swastika shaped pubes and kinky sex, chemical torture and Jihad. Do I really have to go on?"},{"Title":"Bunker 13: A Novel","review":"Indian investigative journalist Bahal's fictional debut stars MM, an anti-hero investigative journalist who covers military affairs for a fledgling weekly magazine. The roller-coaster of a thriller starts off with MM on an undercover assignment with Indian army paratroopers in Kashmir. Before the reader knows it, the story is knee-deep in corruption, as he discovers an elite unit siphoning off captured weapons and drugs to sell on the international market. With this as the background for gripping set pieces of jungle patrol against the &quot;Mossies&quot; (Kashmiri guerillas), shooting heroin while parachuting, plus loads of recreational drug use and three exceedingly explicit sex scenes, the book rockets along at a furious pace.However, that's just the tip of the iceberg, as it is quickly revealed that the crusading journalist also works for Indian intelligence. Bahal works hard to keep the reader guessing as to MM's true motivation: is he really a righteous journalist who hates corruption, or is he an Indian James Bond looking to take down India's enemies, or is he a recklessly brilliant hedonist who's playing both sides against the middle, or is he all of these, or maybe none? The second-person perspective writing helps to blur matters, but careful readers will pick up on one clue early on that may provide the answer.The overall tone is very hard to describe. Loaded with military jargon, acronyms, weapon specifications, and machinations, the book reads at times like a subcontinental Tom Clancy. Yet the corruption angle and black humor is very reminiscent of Robert O'Connor's excellent novel Buffalo Soldiers, whose plotline also features military drug smuggling, or even the classic military satire Catch-22. However, there's also a wacky Elmore Leonardish feel to it as well, with loads of kooky memorable characters, scathing humor, and wild heist schemes. At the same time, each set piece is vivid and believable, from Mm's visit to the Russian mafia, to the office politics of his magazine, to a giant rave, to the spooky final battle scene in Kashmir.As the book rockets along and the stakes grow higher and higher with each fresh twist, it somehow gets rather exhausting. The second person voice grows old fast, and under Bahal's breakneck pace some of the satire is left behind and the book becomes more of a straightforward thriller. Crammed with action, the pace is relentless enough, however, to largely divert one's attention from the outlandishness of it all. It's a fun read, and a refreshing break from the tidal wave of measured highbrow fiction coming from India over the last decade. American readers may want to do a tiny bit of background reading on the Kashmiri conflict beforehand, as Bahal assumes readership familiarity with the main gist of it."},{"Title":"Bunker 13: A Novel","review":"Was it Clausewitz who said \\"War is the extension of diplomacy by other means\\"? I have to wonder if \\"Bunker 13\\" is a move to extend the author's awareness of corruption in the world of defense and military leadership in India to a wider audience. As co-founder of a Web news site, he already cracked open a long-simmering scandal in that arena. Or maybe it's just a way to make some more money from the author's seemingly encyclopedic knowledge, or just satisfy the writing urge.What's it about? Quite a list. At first we are reading the story of Minty Mehta, \\"MM\\", an Indian journalist embedded with the forces serving in the ongoing low-intensity conflict between India and Pakistan in the Vale of Kashmir. Gradually we learn more about MM's long and complex history, including much training in the elite special forces. He is not what he seemed. There are personal rivalries and vendettas that have developed along the way. And there is his apparent alignment with one sector of the Indian Army, in helping them accumulate cash, weapons, and brownie points with the top brass in ferocious competition with another sector, even though both are notionally dedicated to conflict with the \\"Mossies\\" - the Moslems of Pakistan.But then it seems that MM is really out mostly for himself, as he develops a gigantic scheme to sell hundreds of kilograms of seized heroin to the Russian Mafia and, incidentally, double-cross them on the deal. You will note that this is not a timid gentleman. And did I say double-cross? That's just one instance of the multiple levels of double-triple-quadruple-deception and overall cynicisn that pervade this world. Not to mention violence, sex, and other suchlike good things.It's hard to give a short decription of a kaleidoscope. For instance, if you want to find out all about the effects of exotic pharmaceuticals, either for recreation or for extracting information under interrogation, or even pre-strengthening a person to withstand their administration, Bahal's your man. Weaponry? the effects of different rounds impacting on \\"the naked ape\\" - plenty of info. BUT - don't take everything as literally true. He tweaks you with a certain level of deliberate misdirection. For instance, a character describes the fiendish effect of \\"red mercury\\" in the SwiftArrow missile . .but wait, there's no such weapon (there is an \\"Arrow\\") and the substance is, by all accounts, an urban legend! Caveat emptor.And, of course, as in any good thriller there are grand old plot twists near the end. But you'll have to read it to find them out.Someone else mentioned \\"Catch 22\\" and that had also come into my mind...but the pace and the insanity level are several notches higher in this one. Almost too much so - can be too wildly frenetic - hence the 4 stars. But well worth a read!"},{"Title":"Bunker 13: A Novel","review":"I'll make this short. Set your expectations right before reading this story, and you'll not regret it.What should your expectations be?1. Second Person. Not many stories are written this way, but this one is. It may throw you off-balance at first if you're used to reading many books in a week, and all of them are narrated either in First, or Third person.2. Cuss words.

Terror and Love. Both of them, in graphic details. Yes.4. Some slow portions. This is the part which can bore you out.

But that doesn't make him a great writer; Bunker 13 stands testament to the fact. For starters, the supposedly astounding plot isn't well constructed....Bahal gives the impression of conjuring up side-stories and sub-plots not in a steady, built-up fashion but in ways that best suit the many twists and turns in the main plot.Next, there simply isn't any Indianness to any of the Indian characters....almost all of them (right from the Jawans to the 'Mossies' to the Majors) babble away in Yankee jargon, their curses forming a greater part of their vocabulary than meaningful sentences. The whole thing might have looked a little more authentic had Bahal sprinkled some Indian cuss words over his concoction of stale wit and murky sarcasm.Thirdly, the entire novel is written in the second person....it does get to the reader if he/she does not relate to the character in question.Finally, Bahal seems to have drawn some of his inspiration from Hollywood action flicks. There's this bit which has an uncanny resemblance to a scene from the movie Spy Game - Bahal's protagonist MM, does a Brad Pitt when his instructor tells him that he is to be seen with a glass of water in his hand and talking to a man in a suit within 5 minutes. And there are traces of the opening scene in The Peacemaker in the planned heist of the nukes from the chartered train.The only good bit, I felt, was the exhaustive research that Bahal has done on Indian weapons and geography....Kashmir in particular. But on the whole, I was disappointed since I was expecting a little more Indianness and ingenuity from the Tehelka man."},{"Title":"Bunker 13: A Novel","review":"The first half of this book plods along, painfully.

This book gives a well designed pictorial and written view of the physical aspect of emotion.

Twenty three years into the field, now I think it should become part of any curriculum turning out potential \\"psychotherapists.\\" The field has changed over two decades, and as physical well being become more and more part of our practice, it is imperative to understand how unexpressed emotions wear on the physical being.

It's not what I expected in relation to \\"emotional anatomy\\". Its not about somatics. Its a big book with big drawings and a description to these drawings. Its not for beginners. Its about the tubes, layer and pumps in the body and how these change depending on life's experiences which in this book are nearly all negative. I think this book is an acquired taste and with time I will understand it."},{"Title":"Emotional Anatomy : The Structure of Experience","review":"This book's approach to the relationship between structure and emotions is primarily a theoretical and philosophical exploration. While I appreciated its creative flair, its rewards remained pretty much intellectual. This is fine, but If you work with the body using touch, such as a massage therapist, bodyworker, somatic educator, physical therapist, etc., it leaves parts of the body mind interconnection picture unaddressed. Understanding all aspects of the interaction of body and mind is critical for hands on therapists, so if Emotional Anatomy whetted your appetite, or if you're looking for a book takes a comprehensive look at the body mind connection and how it affects touch and hands on treatment, readThe Psychology of the Bodyby Elliot Greene and Barbara Goodrich-Dunn. It's described as comprehensive because it addresses topics like how touch affects the bodymind, how bodymind factors affect the therapeutic relationship, emotional release and how to deal with it, ethics from a body based point of view, understanding mental health conditions from a bodymind point of view, and collaborating with mental health professionals."},{"Title":"Winter's End (Alex Rourke, 1)","review":"In this very good and very dark mystery set in Maine, Alex Rourke is asked to come home and help with a murder investigation. Alex is a former FBI agent born and raised in Winter's End, Maine. He hasn't been home once since he left years ago and now has resurrected his life as a private investigator in Boston.But Sheriff Dale Townsend, brother of his best friend in school, needs his help. Sheriff Townsend has a suspect in the recent murder of a local woman. While the suspect was seen standing over the nude body holding knives in his hands during a heavy rain, there is not any proof that he actually committed the murder. The man won't confess or say anything meaningful at all and the Sheriff is stumped. The Sheriff and Alex worked another case a couple of years ago by phone with Alex suggesting a couple of things and that fact along with the fact that Alex had a reputation as a very good interrogator before his mental breakdown several years ago, convinces him that Alex is the man for the job. They need identification of the suspect and a confession fast as the local population is very upset and the pressure is on to close the case.Alex agrees to help and soon finds himself back home in Winter's End dealing with a suspect that seems to be playing with him for his own amusement. At the same time, Alex begins to confront why he left in the first place and his actions the last several years. Alex is forced to deal with the past as dark forces move around him, pushing him towards a final confrontation and not just with the suspect.Vast stretches of this debut novel reminded me tremendously of work by James Lee Burke. The author's use of imagery that, in this case is often the play of light and shadow evoked the association, as did his use of disturbing dreams and visions. Much like in James Lee Burke's works where the dead take visible form and have a message for the living, the same sort of thing happens in this novel several times. Alex's subconscious is very active and as this nearly three hundred-page novel works to its conclusion, the line of sanity becomes increasingly blurred.At the same time, the character of Alex like many of the other characters in this novel is slowly developed. Unlike many first time novelists who perform a sort of data dump on the reader, each piece of background info is slowly doled out to the reader. As such, along with the other elements of pacing, plot, action, etc. everything is slowly but consistently moved forward tightening the grip on the reader as the novel unfolds.This is a complex and very enjoyable novel and one of the best books I have read in a long time. Hopefully, this is the beginning not only of a series, but also of a novelist's career. If so, it is one heck of a start."},{"Title":"Winter's End (Alex Rourke, 1)","review":"This book is certainly interesting reading.The story of a man who solves mysteries for a living running into a suspect he can't crack, in the town he grew up in of all places? Certainly a nice premise, and one that the author does his best to play through to the end.I read this book while travelling in Europe, and after having spent a few days in England I was certainly aware of some Britishisms in the book, but otherwise the dialogue is clean and the characters range from interesting to tolerable. The lead character is tough and smart without being \\"hard boiled\\" or invincible, and even when some characters seem a little one-dimensional they are at least engagingly so.Some of the relationships between characters are a bit thin at times, but the exploration of what it means to \\"go home again\\" with the express purpose of digging up the unpleasant corners of your past is built carefully. Certainly there are moments where the reader (or at least this reader couldn't) can't help but imagine what secrets might be lying beyond the edges of our own vague memories of home.The twists and turns kept me reading, and the generally smooth writing made it enjoyable. I recommend this book for any casual reader's mystery list, as long as police procedurals and New England settings don't grate the nerves. They don't bother me at all, and I plan on picking up any other books from this author that I see."},{"Title":"Winter's End (Alex Rourke, 1)","review":"When suspense novel becomes psychological thriller.\\"Childhood events shape the rest of our lives, Mr.Rourke.\\"The first thing to say about \`Winter's End', is that this book was written back in 2003, so crime detection procedures and forensic analysis methods have moved on apace since then. Even so, I think that this story stands its ground very well in the genre, even today and John Rickards is way up there with his contemporaries of the time ... the likes of John Connolly and Michael Connelly.The choice of cover art for this edition, was spot on, setting the scene for the dark and menacing force which has gripped small town America. Where fear is contagious and neighbour suspects neighbour, as the chilling truth is uncovered, piece by piece. A mysterious puzzle which everyone has their suspicions about, but which, to a person, they would rather had remained hidden in the depths of time.Alex Rourke, once a child of this introspective community, is a flawed and broken man, abandoned by the system of justice he strived so hard to uphold, now working freelance on the outside, although still on behalf of truth and fairness. The incident which brought about his breakdown, has left him a loner, lonely, vulnerable and seemingly unable to commit to, or become close to anyone, so returning to his hometown to help out a colleague in need, isn't really what he needs right now. His journey becomes something of a pilgrimage of self discovery, where he uncovers some pretty unpalatable home truths and dark secrets about his own family, that he isn't expecting.Romance is also on the cards for Alex, in the shape of pathologist, Gemma. However, whilst there is an obvious mutual attraction between the two, it is left to Gemma to do much of the groundwork. The two seem like a great match, with Gemma a caring, yet carefree individual and Alex responding to her nurturing in a positive and committed way, horrified when it seems that she might be in danger. Whether there is a future for them as a couple, I wouldn't like to say, but it would seem that they are prepared to take things slowly for now, living their separate lives apart from one another, with Gemma more than respecting Alex's need to re-examine his future and the direction in which he would like his life to go.In our unknown \`villain', whom Alex has named \`Nicholas', we have a chilling, dark character, full of hatred and bitterness, seeking revenge in a terriflyingly final way, for wrongs he feels have been committed against him, both by the establishment in general and certain individuals in particular. His methods are calculating and systematic, his results brutal and final. His actions are all leading up to one decisive, irrevocable show-down, when the full extent of all the heinous injustices against him will be revealed and his final act of retribution will be meted out. Given the things that had happened to \`Nicholas' during his early years, I had to admit a grudging feeling of sadness and remorse for him, as I would for anyone else who had endured such incarceration and humiliation, as to alter the balance of their mind so completely.The plot isn't particularly fast paced, the moves have already been pre-ordained and the outcome a foregone conclusion, unless Alex acts quickly to change it. There are several twists and turns, as Alex tries to manipulate the endgame and trap his suspect, however the whole story is more one of a titanic battle of strength of will and mind games between two evenly matched adversaries. A plot firmly based on some great characterisations and human observations, with all their warts and flaws.I had a couple of endgame scenarios mapped out in my head and was glad to see that I wasn't too far off the mark with one of them, although I was never really sure which it was to be until right towards the end, which kept the suspense and tension building nicely, as I avidly devoured the pages.This is a debut novel for both author and character and was curtailed into a short series of just four adventures in total. I shall be more than interested in acquiring the remaining three books, to see just where John takes Alex on both his professional and personal journey forwards."},{"Title":"Winter's End (Alex Rourke, 1)","review":"Ex-FBI agent turned private investigator, Alex Rourke, is called back to his hometown of Winter's End, Maine by old friend, Sheriff Dale Townsend to help solve a murder of a woman found lying dead on a dark roadway.

The cops arrest the culprit for murder.The victim is quickly identified as forty years old nurse Angela Lamond, but the Sheriff has no idea who his incarcerated suspect is. The guy has no record and refuses to even divulge his name. Dale calls his friend former FBI interrogator Alex Rourke to help on what appears is an open and shut case. Now a private investigator, Alex leaves Boston for Maine to see if he can coax answers from the apparent culprit. Though he slowly has some success, Alex concludes that this relatively silent soul anticipated his arrival, but why this seems so remains unknown.WINTER'S END is an incredible police procedural that hooks the reader from the opening grisly scene to the final unexpected twist even with readers expecting a final curve ball, but not one that would make Blyleven proud. The story line never slows down as the Sheriff and the ex-Fed try to break a vicious case that seems so obviously resolved.

None of the so-called plot twists are surprising, and the outcome of the novel becomes clear about half-way through.It has to be said that the writing is decent and made the book an enjoyable read despite all its shortcomings.

I must admit that though Eugene O'Neill is considered by some to be the father of American Theater, I did not enjoy reading this play. The Tyrone family's insane dysfunction with their constant bickering and apologizing was very annoying and frustrating to read. I also disliked the fact that after four acts of continuous yelling and tension O'Neill offered no conclusion. The day in the life of the Tyrone family gets progressively worse until it finally peaks and the play just ends. No happy ending, no hope for the future, just despair. \\"Long Day's Journey Into Night\\" is a wholly depressing read that I really could have done without. However, after learning more about Eugene O'Neill's background, and the extent to which the play is based on his life, I began to have a greater appreciation for this play. O'Neill did lead a very hard life, therefore the frustration and despair I felt while reading this play demonstrates O'Neill's talent to engage his audience and to convey the emotions of the characters in a very real manner. While O'Neill's depressing end did not satisfy my craving for a happy ending, it was appropriate for the play as Eugene's own family never got a happy ending. I did like the clever way O'Neill showed the Tyrone family's desire but inability to forget their troubles through the dialogue. At the beginning of the play the audience is presented with a normal, loving family. The audience soon however, gets the suspicion that something isn't quite right, and that the family is tense. Slowly the family's skeletons are exposed through arguments between the family members, but the characters always feel regretful for bringing the subject up. Thus showing that no matter how hard the Tyrone family tries to pretend that all is well, their skeletons are always with them and resurface to continually remind them of the truth. Although I still believe \\"Long Day's Journey Into Night\\" to be thoroughly disheartening to read, the reader's emotional response to this play leaves no doubt to O'Neill's exceptional writing."},{"Title":"Long Day's Journey into Night","review":"Reading this play was fun. O'Neill's style of dialogue and stream of consciousness has even made it easier to be followed. The Tyrone's are a middle class family and they have all been the scapegoats of James Tyrone. While he had a childhood with poverty , he cannot get rid of the past ghosts . Therefore , miser as he is , he gives the hell to the whole Tyrone family. Yet, one must think, upto which point should we blame our parents for our own failures? That is what Eugene O'Neill has done in this book. He has finally managed to forgive both his family and himself. The Tyrones have once more become the origin of re-birth of the playwright. The invisible love attachments of the family members in this play has deeply affected me."},{"Title":"Long Day's Journey into Night","review":"If there was ever a book to justify the resources, both human and monetary to battle in the drug war, this is it. Set in the early 1900's America, this book is about a mother's heroin addiction and the shambles left behind. At a time when drugs were legal, all a woman had to do was go to her pharmacy and order a weekly dose, this book shows the ugliness addiction to this drug can do to a normally dysfunctional family. Whether the family was already dysfunctional is not known, but the mother's addiction most certainly made things worse. A great short play; a quick read."},{"Title":"Long Day's Journey into Night","review":"\\"Long Day's Journey into Night\\" is Eugene O'Neill tackling with the personal demon that haunted him for the rest of his life: his family. This stark, realist drama is an honest, straightforward portrayal of a family teetering on complete breakdown. Set in Edwardian America, it details the personal turmoils that plague each member of the Tyrone family. James Tyrone is a stage actor whose control over his family is as flimsy as his personality. Firmly believing in his right as to deserving the respect that he feels entitled to being the patriarch of the house, the frailty of his reputation becomes glaringly apparent as he confronts his distracted wife and severely affected and acerbic sons. His wife, Mary, is a woman whose schizophrenic flights are a sad and annoying canvas portraying the ravages of time and circumstance on an individual. James Jr. and Edmund are their two equally suffering sons, the former a drifting and embittered character seeking solace in sarcasm and drink; the latter ( a model of the author himself ) an intelligent, sensitive, and highly literate adventurer and man of letters sidetracked by an illness which brings his family's relations to near implosion while making them closer.The style of the writing reminds one of black and white films of the 30's and 40's: everyday life tinged with the theatrical. The characters are real but cliched. The clockwork precision of the acting and language reveal O'Neill's limitations as a dramatist, and never throughout this play does he advance beyond the written norm like his idol Strindberg did in his great plays. The dialogues are good, especially in the heated arguments between the members of this domestic hell, like the scene where Edmund and his father open up to each other over bottles of booze, and Mary's pathetic method acting to hide the truth which she is not equipped to face. These alone make up for the overall banality of the play and it's dissapointing ending.Conservative in style and substance yet painfully honest in it's subject, \\"Long Day's Journey into Night\\" is the academe's avant-garde play. A masterpiece to the printed word's squares and a pedestrian tome to those who know better."},{"Title":"Long Day's Journey into Night","review":"Eugene O'Neills portrail of his family's love of detruction is almost beautiful.

Tyrone regularly refers to Jamie as a useless failure, and a drunk, not only to his face but to other family members, and in turn Jamie refers to his father as a man who would rather save a dime then save the life of his son, Edmund. Tyrone says such things as \\"You'd be content to sit back like a lazy lunk and sponge on me for the rest of your life!\\"(p.32) and comments to Edmund that, \\"If he's ever had a loftier dream than whores and whiskey, he's never shown it.\\"(p.131). The characters of the parents are pathetic, the mother all fluttery and drugged, and the father as the stereotypical old, cheap, and mean failed celebrity. The only seemingly normal relationship is between Edmund and Jamie as for the most part they exchange brotherly love. The relationships and conversations between the family members seems entirely unnatural, they go from scathingly angry to chipper in a matter of seconds. It is as if they entire family is bipolar.Long Day's Journey into Night was based on the life of O'Neill himself, with the character of Edmund as O'Neill. The mother of O'Neill was truly a drug addict who had lost the son between O'Neill and his older brother, and his father never accepted O'Neill for who he was. These sad beginnings continued throughout the life of O'Neill and was evident in the writing of this piece. If the characters in Long Day's Journey into Night are closely based on his family members then O'Neill had a more sad life than anyone could possibly imagine."},{"Title":"Long Day's Journey into Night","review":"Convinced by my computer teacher to read this play, I checked it out in the library and read it in within days. The result: A very dissatisfied reader.Something like this won the Pulitzer Prize? If any of his plays should have won it (which a couple of them did), it should have been All God's Chillun Got Wings, not this pointless play.The family in this play was MUCH too dysfunctional. All they did all day (which the whole play was in one day) was argue and argue and argue. And when at times it seemed as if the arguing would end, one of the four characters said something that would spark up a new argument.Woe be to my computer teacher for suggesting me this book, for it bore me into tears."},{"Title":"Long Day's Journey into Night","review":"Why, pray tell, is this play so revered? It isthe most boring, over-hyped, and predictable playI have ever encountered. If you don't know everything that will happen by page five,there is something seriously wrong with you. Ifit were written particularly well, I could give itsome slack--but, REALLY! Save your money and readsome Tennessee Williams, who really IS America'sgreatest playwrite."},{"Title":"Long Day's Journey into Night","review":"It's a wonderfully sad story about the struggles of a family's struggles. In each of the characters you can feel a hint of yourself, and you feel the true pain of each of them. O'Neill's writing makes you feel like you are really there, which might might not be the place that you want to be. It's extremely sad and depressing, but abolutely wonderful."},{"Title":"Long Day's Journey into Night","review":"This is by far my favorite play, by my favorite playwright, Eugene O'Neill. It touches my deeper emotions and inspires me every time I read it.

Anyone interested in theater or movie scripts will find this extremely excellent."},{"Title":"Long Day's Journey into Night","review":"I'm not a big play fan, but this was exceptional. I feel sorry for the whole family and the things they go through."},{"Title":"Long Day's Journey into Night","review":"This is a truly great novel, perhaps it fades just a bit toward the end, at which time Fitzgerald was allegedly engaged in an amphetamine fueled rush to conclude the story after years of working on it. Defintely worth reading."},{"Title":"Long Day's Journey into Night","review":"A great play written by a great writer. Although written more than 60 years ago, this play is still both powerful and relevant. The play is semi-autobiographical and contains brutal honesty about O'Neill and his family. I only wished it was performed more often. If you wish to read one America's greatest writers at the height of his powers, this monumental work is the play to start."}]`),q={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:S},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:x,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(s=>setTimeout(s,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},U={class:"card-container"},C=["disabled"],B={key:0},J={key:1};function E(s,o,n,u,r,i){const c=y("PoemCard");return e(),t("section",null,[o[1]||(o[1]=a("div",{class:"top-banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),a("div",U,[(e(!0),t(f,null,g(i.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(e(),p(c,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(e(),t("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:o[0]||(o[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(e(),t("span",J,"Loading...")):(e(),t("span",B,"See more"))],8,C)):w("",!0)])}const W=d(q,[["render",E],["__scopeId","data-v-a6cc2a20"]]),j=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"people/50.md","filePath":"people/50.md"}'),H={name:"people/50.md"},D=Object.assign(H,{setup(s){return(o,n)=>(e(),t("div",null,[b(W)]))}});export{j as __pageData,D as default};
