The rules, customs, and behaviors are foreign to those in the free world. People outside of the walls will never be able to appreciate or accept. The problem, however, is that the prisons are within our country and need to abide by the laws of the United States of America. This book did an excellent job of asking the question, \\"does justice occur after incarceration?\\" The short answer is, no. The bigger question to ask is, \\"when will this country enact laws that can adequately deal with prison gangs and the control that they have in our criminal justice system?\\" This book is a telling example of all the state and federal correctional facilities will experience with any prison gangs that occupy them. It is a must read for all correctional employees and lawmakers."},{"Title":"Murder Unpunished: How the Aryan Brotherhood Murdered Waymond Small and Got Away with It","review":"Inmates bent on running the asylum in an out-of-control prison dominated by homicidal gangs. Official corruption. Fraudulent land scales. A car bombing. Jurisdictional struggles. Hypnosis. A hung-over judge. Prosecutorial misconduct. A senile attorney.What might sound like the ingredients of an over-wrought novel are the facts of Durango author Thornton W. Price III's nonfiction true crime book, \\"Murder Unpunished,\\" published by The University of Arizona Press on July 1.The cast of characters includes a future U.S. Supreme Court justice (Sandra Day O'Connor), a future Democratic presidential candidate (Bruce Babbitt) and the man who pioneered the psychological autopsy (Dr. Otto Bendheim).But most of the players in this extraordinary peek at Arizona State Prison run amok came straight from Satan's casting call, even down to the unfortunate Waymond Small, possibly one of the nation's least likable murder victims.The time is the late 1970s. In less than two years, there have been 14 murders and dozens of assaults at Arizona State Prison. The Arizona Republic has cast a relentless eye on the mayhem. The political pressure to do something ratchets up. And finally the Aryan Brotherhood takes a bridge too far with the murder of Small on the eve of his testimony to the state legislature.Price, the author, was a young attorney. One of the inmates charged in connection with Small's death-a group collectively known as the Florence Eleven-ends up being Price's first murder case.Tempting though it must have been, Price wisely avoids much use of the first-person in this economically written account of five murder trials. When he does resort to it, it's justified by the insight it offers.My own first nonfiction true crime book, \\"Someone Has to Die Tonight,\\" is scheduled to be published as a Pinnacle mass market paperback in March. I know the challenge Price took on in combing through 16,000 pages of court records and conducting interviews with key players for his narrative.I also know how his involvement in the case probably made the task harder. I became a confidential informant in the case of a self-styled teen militia that I was documenting. Separating oneself from the story and keeping the narrative focused becomes more difficult when there's a personal connection.The Florence Eleven was the case for Price: The case that every cop, attorney or crime reporter knows about-the one you never forget. In spite of this, Price showed remarkable discipline in his writing, and it serves his readers well.My literary attorney, Bob Pimm, counseled me to make my book a train ride that readers wouldn't want to get off. The train needs to take off in the first chapter, he said, and the reader needs to want to say on all the way to the end.Price kept me on the train.\\"Murder Unpunished\\" has moments of writing that jumps out for its eloquence or economy. He describes one murder in two pithy sentences: \\"Even with a loaded gun to his head, the idiot wouldn't shut up. He'd dared him to shoot, so he did.\\"And here's how one of the large cast is introduced: \\"With a thin, six-foot-seven-inch frame, Jerry Joe \`Stretch' Hillyer looked like he'd survived the rack.\\"And here, another: \\"Born in Scottsdale one week before the bombing of Pearl Harbor, Tidwell's life began in as much ruin as the Pacific Fleet.\\"Price knows we need humor in a dark tale ridden with murder, rape and drug abuse, and he finds it (somehow it always seems to be there, even in the darkest crime, often because of the extraordinary stupidity of some criminals, whose choices in life seem determined to provide job security for police and prosecutors).\\"Did you see anything?\\" a tired investigator asks in one of 650 inmate interviews after Small's murder.\\"No.\\"\\"Would you tell us if you had seen anything?\\"And then there's Price's account of the state's attempts to hypnotize a witness, a chapter that may alone justify the book's $17.95 cover price.True crime is a tempting genre for the very reason that makes readers sometimes skeptical the writer could really know all he portrays. How could we know people's thoughts? How could we recapture dialog years after the fact?It's possible because of the uniquely thorough nature of investigative and court records, around which entire books can be built. It's not an easy task sifting thousands of pages for the specks of gold that add up to a compelling narrative. There are a lot of mediocre true crime books out there. Price's is not one of them.Here we find a writer unafraid to show a criminal's sheer enjoyment of violence. A writer who's resisted the temptation to include every fact or exchange he personally finds compelling, restraint that must sometimes have been painful.He knows court procedure and introduces us to terms such as the \\"slow-form guilty plea\\"-the trial of someone obviously guilty from the get-go.He shows us the Mau Maus, the Mexican Mafia, the Native Brotherhood and the Aryan Brotherhood out of control in Arizona's penal system and what was done to fix it. He gets the prison language of kites, fish and punks exactly right in a sometimes profane book that avoids overdosing on cussing and violence.He explains very well why prison crimes are so singularly hard to investigate.Down among the human dross, Price somehow emerges with none of the nastiness sticking to him or the reader. Better, he somehow makes us care.He gives fascinating insight into how the Aryan Brotherhood worked, like a business. And he offers some motivation without making excuses for his unattractive cast.The case comes as close to Durango as Chimney Rock, just off Highway 160.Despite a misprint in the spelling of Price's name on the cover (one of those palm to the forehead blunders that has probably cost some hapless copyeditor restful sleep) \\"Murder Unpunished\\" is otherwise flawlessly edited.This is entertaining, educational and compelling. I hope Price will find another case somewhere in his career worth writing about."},{"Title":"Murder Unpunished: How the Aryan Brotherhood Murdered Waymond Small and Got Away with It","review":"This book was very informitive about the code that convicts live under.

The reader can also reflect on why a person can act despicable yet still receive grace. Mr. Price presents the reader with an opportunity to question the concepts of revenge and universal justice. These themes of duality, like old friends, are revisited here in the pages penned by Mr. Price from his autobiographical and historic perspectives that have matured over time. He is unapologetic.I for one wish to apologize for the state of Arizona's justice."},{"Title":"Wombat divine","review":"We have purchased or have been gifted about 200 children's books overthe past 4 years and browsed through many more at bookstores andlibraries.

None of the Australian animals in Wombat Devine actually resemble the Australian wildlife they are supposed to be. Wombat looks like a bear, the emu for some reason has wings that can come out of the front of its body like arms which emus in real life no doubt wish for but don't have, the echidna is just the platypus with a lot of yellow triangles coming out of its body, the bilby looks like a rabbit (no wonder Mem Fox dumped this illustrator and went with Pamela Lofts for the sensationalHunwick's Eggwhere the bilby actually looks like a bilby."},{"Title":"Wombat divine","review":"We first heard this story in our church service and now with our 3 year old granddaughter it is a hit all year, not just at Christmas.

What I admire about author Hewson is simply that he is a literate writer who knows how to create likeable, thoroughly human protagonists. They're not typical, they're not omnipotent, they're not even at the top of their field or their game. Nic is just learning, and gets better with every case. Peroni is a good cop who's made a serious mistake but takes responsibility for his own choices. Teresa is a tough as nails pathologist who is scared about love but willing to stick her neck out and hope for the best. As for his villains, Hewson also makes them credibly human. Terribly twisted but human. Some of the passages relating the killer's train of thought are downright chilling. While technically a police procedural, The Sacred Cut is more a story of ordinary, well-trained people trying to solve a horrendous crime and prevent its repetition while preserving their own sense of morality. If the plotting has flaws, they are more than over-ridden by Hewson's characterizations and by his remarkably cliche-free prose. The setting in the timeless city of Rome is icing on the cake."},{"Title":"The Sacred Cut","review":"It's five days before Christmas, and Rome is covered in snow. Braving the elements on this cold winter night are policemen Nic Costa and Gianni Peroni, accompanied by civilian Mauro Sandri. A photographer, Sandri is assembling a documentary on the policeman and their city.Summoned to the Pantheon by a shaken security guard, the policemen are ambushed by an intruder, who begins shooting before fleeing into the night. The policemen are unharmed, but the photographer is fatally wounded. Later, a woman's body, bearing knife marks in the elaborate pattern of the so-called Sacred Cut, is found on the premises. Seeking justice for the photographer, Costa and Peroni begin searching for the murderer; their investigation will bring them into conflict with one of the strangest killers they've ever faced, a man out to settle scores with origins in the days of Desert Storm.A happy blend of police procedural and international thriller, Hewson's third Nic Costa novel finds the trinity of Costa, Peroni, and their Chief, the irascible Leo Falcone, in fine form, fearlessly grappling with criminals, bureaucracies, significant others, and the American intelligence community in their pursuit of the truth. Providing laughter and thrills in equal amounts, Hewson makes it look easy.The Sacred Cut is totally compelling, one of those rare thrillers which emphasizes character over action, although Hewson acquits himself admirably in that department as well. It's the attention Hewson lavishes on his entire cast that keeps readers' interest piqued; all the rest, as they say, is gravy."},{"Title":"The Sacred Cut","review":"I picked up this book because of the snowy scene of Rome on the cover. It's been a not-so-snowy winter here, so I thought I'd make up for it with a snowy novel. This was an excellent book and truly transported me. It was an intelligent novel with many twista and turns taking place over three days near Christmas. Hewson's characters are well developed and the end left me sympathetic to many of them and hoping for more in his upcoming novel to be relased in 2007. I'm going to go back and read some of his earlier novels in this Nic Costa series while waiting for \\"The Lizard's Bite\\" to be relased."},{"Title":"The Sacred Cut","review":"In David Hewson's \\"The Sacred Cut,\\" a vicious killer is loose in Rome. Three Italian policemen, Nic Costa, Leo Falcone, and Gianni Peroni, become embroiled in an ugly situation when American intelligence agents, led by an obnoxious fellow named Leapman, ride roughshod over Italian law and attempt to take control after a brutally murdered woman is found in the Pantheon. The victim's back is covered with a strange pattern of marks carved with a scalpel. Also involved is Emily Deacon, an FBI agent with expertise in architecture and a knowledge of Italian. Emily's late father, Dan, had been a friend of the killer, and she has been brought to Rome to flush out the perpetrator before he takes another life.Although the premise of \\"The Sacred Cut\\" is engrossing enough, there is far too much talk and too little action to sustain interest for 340 pages. The heroes are likeable, especially Gianni Peroni, a hulking and scarred policeman with a gentle heart, and Emily Deacon, a troubled woman who needs to find out how and why her father died. The villain is an ex-military man, who kills with expertise and is a master of disguise. Although he constantly hears voices in his head, he is lucid enough to pull off complicated schemes that keep the authorities off balance. The plot is almost incomprehensible, and even when the author reveals some key information later in the book, it is not enough to clarify all that has come before.Hewson tackles a variety of issues, including the American government's interference in other countries' sovereign affairs, greed, political corruption, the horrors of war, and a person's need for closure after surviving traumatic experiences. The problem is that Hewson does not integrate his plot, themes, and characters in a convincing and compelling manner, and the pace of the story, especially in the second half, is sluggish. I love the Italian ambiance, and setting the book in the midst of a rare blizzard in Rome adds some interesting twists, but \\"The Sacred Cut\\" is not a book that I can wholeheartedly recommend."},{"Title":"The Sacred Cut","review":"I have read all of Hewson's \\"Nic Costa\\" books and sadly have to say that I was disappointed in this one. I am no fan of the CIA, but the plot line to me was unbelievable. I don't want to give the plot away and spoil the book for others, but this book reads like a failed John Le Carre \\"wanna be\\". It also read like an obvious attempt to leverage off the (to me) hideous Da Vinci Code book, with references to \\"symbology\\" that go nowhere. The significance of the \\"cut\\" is never adequately explained or, if it was, I missed it. I also see shades of Hannibal Lechter here. The Roman background and the description of the history of the Pantheon constitute the \\"saving grace.\\" Take it out of the library, if possible. Otherwise, forget it. It adds nothing to the development of Nic Costa as a character or as a detective."},{"Title":"The Sacred Cut","review":"Discovered by chance \\"a season for the dead\\" and enjoyed the characters: they are \\"real\\", complex, they hurt (and they're hurt), they laugh, they love, they die... and Rome is a character on its own.

Sacred Cut is the 3rd in a serie that gets better and better.Real characters again, a real love of Italy - a perfect combination for me.I just went on to buy them all on Kindle so I can just keep on reading the wonderful adventures of Nic Costa."},{"Title":"The Sacred Cut","review":"Hewson's writing is engrossing. Early in the series, the characters will win you over and by this book, A Sacred Cut, their trials and tribulations really matter to you. That makes this dangerous, intriguing, multi-layer mystery all the more enjoyable.In short, great book by a great author!"},{"Title":"The Sacred Cut","review":"David Hewson's third novel in the Nic Costa, Rome Detective, series is the deepest character study yet - but short on action.Hewson's knowledge of Rome as well as the history surrounding the area - including the Vatican - is quite apparent and each novel has peeled away more about each of the central characters. This novel was the least exciting in the series but is so well written and character driven that it was still a satisfying read. Including a U.S. military figure that may have lost his sanity to the point where he is performing ritualistic serial murders in the Rome area is a nice base for an intriguing tale of lies and deceipt that involve both the local and U.S. governments."},{"Title":"The Sacred Cut","review":"I am currently on the 7th novel in this series and still can not figure it out. Hewson has a way of making you think one thing and then blowing you away with the result. Can not get enough."},{"Title":"The Sacred Cut","review":"In Rome, Laila, a homeless Iraqi refugee seeks warmth from the wintry weather when she observes the brutal murder in the Pantheon. The victim is naked with mystical carvings etched into the flesh and positioned apparently to mimic Leonardo da Vinci's The Vitruvian Man. Roman detectives Gianni Peroni and Nic Costa places the witness under police protection with pathologist Teresa Lupo \\"mothering\\" theyoungster who saw so much death and destruction at home and now in Rome.The two Italian cops investigate the homicide when FBI agent Joel Leapman orders them to back off or else while his Fed partner Emily Deacon tries to be diplomatic asking the locals to stay out of the case as it is part of a wider global investigation into a killer with no boundaries. Others Rome homicides occur, but neither Peroni or Lupo can understand the meaning of the religious symbolism and positioning of each corpse. The Italian police wonder whether it is a ritual killing or a calling card to play cat-and-mouse with the cops and are angry that the Feds know so much more but offer nothing to further the Roman inquiries.The third Roman police procedural starring Peroni and Costa is a fabulous thriller that has the audience enticed and captured by the opening moment when Laila is introduced to the reader. The story line is filled with twists as the readers like the two local detectives wonder if a religious serial killer is at work and what is the culprit trying to accomplish. The Feds add obxiousness especially the rude Leapman while omitting what they know about the killer. Fans will fully appreciate this strong tale while wondering for most of the novel where David Hewson is guiding us.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Sacred Cut","review":"I can honestly say that this is one of the first crime mystery novels that I didn't care for. It was extremely hard for me to get into the fast reading, page turning, want to know more mode. The story line was well thought out, but I just couldn't seem to follow with enthusiasm. The main reason why is because Hewson used too many adjectives. Every character, it seemed like, had over ten adjectives that described them. It left nothing to your imagination. I couldn't seem to get interested and finally put the book down halfway through."},{"Title":"The Sacred Cut","review":"Nic Costa, the purported hero, must be the least interesting Italian male on the planet. The heroine is an impressively boring and dim American. The appealing setting, Rome during a snowstorm, is ground to death. The interesting plot idea quickly dissipates, the perp being revealed early on. His motivations are repeated, confusingly, ad nauseam; they remain incomprehensible at the end. The fate of some characters, including one of the bad guys, is left unresolved.Another distracting note is that Hewson doesn't know enough about the American language to be writing from our viewpoint. Usage and spelling are wrong throughout. Spelling might be excused, but not usage--when the voice is American."},{"Title":"The Sacred Cut","review":"Ar some point, a story has to \\"set its hook.\\" You have to get interested. Alas, The Sacred Cut, by David Hewson, never gets to that point. From characters that are hard to follow in the context of the story, to a Kurdish refugee who is inserted into the story for I don't know what reason, to a ho-hum \\"confusing lines between bad guys and good guys\\" type plot, The Sacred Cut never really takes off.Can't win them all."},{"Title":"The Sacred Cut","review":"David Hewson creates believable characters and a setting so real you start to shiver as you enter the cold and echoing Pantheon, where a murder has taken place in a freak snowstorm. Nobody is quite as bad, or as good, as they seem to be in this third novel featuring Roman cop Nic Costa. Hewson writes beautifully (don't miss the description of snow falling through the \\"oculus\\" of the Pantheon's dome like a spiraling strand of DNA), making this not just a hard-to-put-down thriller but a story that will linger in your mind after you finish it. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Sacred Cut","review":"This is the first David Hewson book I have read. I was very disappointed. The dialogue is very stilted and unatural. People just don't \\"yell\\" that often. The shifting point of view is confusing. If the flyleaf hadn't identified this as a \\"Nic Costa\\" thriller, I wouldn't have known he was the main character. The plot is a stretch and the story line is hard to follow.I live in Wisconsin. It doesn't snow continuously here for three days in a row, so I find it hard to believe it might happen in Rome."},{"Title":"The Sacred Cut","review":"This book reminds me of the remake of the \\"Thomas Crowne Affair\\", not in specific content but in spirit. Both are mature works about adults for adults, an increasingly rare commodity in this age of youth worship. What an opening! A young Kurdish girl in war-torn Iraq makes a mad dash for freedom and after working her way to Italy, becomes a primary witness to a gruesome murder.We are back in Rome a few days before Christmas with partners Costa and Peroni investigating one of a series of related murders in various countries by a master assassin who is not only psychotic but borderline genius. They must battle not only American intelligence services and murky Italian anti-terrorism shadows but also their own personal demons. Into the mix steps FBI agent Emily Deacon who has a personal interest in the case.The integration of character, moood, plot and dialogue is superb. Every event \\"makes sense\\" instead of seeming forced or somehow contrived. A truly good read satisfies on many levels but the truly superb story is propelled by character traits as opposed to having character traits determined by events. There is a subtle but appreciable difference between the two. We eventually come to understand the intentions of all involved - the detectives, the runaway, the \\"ghosts\\" behind clandestine events and finally the murderer himself. A superb read!"},{"Title":"The Sacred Cut","review":"Mystery writing is always formula writing, but the better ones at least manage to add enough frills and gewgaws to conceal the equal signs and brackets. None of that here, we have formula and not much else. Lots of shadowy mumbo-jumbo in the plot, tracing vaguely -- but never intelligibly or convincingly -- back to the Gulf War. We don't expect fully drawn characters in detective procedurals, but most of these folks are as interesting as a lump of dough. Even the bad guy, it turns out, is pretty soft-hearted for a serial killer. And by the way, if this is a Nic Costa story, why doesn't Nic have any lines? At least three other characters figure more importantly in the investigation than he does.Finally, in a book by a Brit, set in Rome with an Italian detective as its key character, I found it odd that the murderer, his victims, and the inevitable perky young blonde threatened by him, were all... Americans!? Just guessing here, but I envision publisher, editor, or author Hewson himself deciding to throw some Americans into the picture to enhance sales in the big U.S. market."},{"Title":"The Sacred Cut","review":"I'm disappointed with this book. I picked it up as the back cover promised it to be \\"better than the Da Vinci Code\\" and featuring \\"bits of real antiquity\\". I find both statements highly exaggerated.The writer hardly makes Rome a worthy character in the book, there are not enough vivid descritptions to capture the atmosphere of the city.Other than Laila and Emily, the characters are not interesting enough to care. I find the dialogs to be illogical and often going nowhere. The language of the book does not flow efortlessly so that you can forget the outside world and picture the story in your imagination. There are some very awkward slang frases and repetitions. To quote just one: \\"Now a puzzled -looking fire crew were hosing down the damn thing in front of a small crowd of puzzled onlookers.\\" (page 183) The author uses the word \\"puzzled\\" again two sentences later. All in all, nowhere near the level of writing of the DaVinci Code, if you must compare. Finally, the story ending is completely unrealistic, the transformation of a lose cannon murderer into a reasonable honorable kind of guy - I don't buy that. I love thrillers and spy novels, and frankly, this one is one of the worst constructed novels I've ever read."},{"Title":"The Sacred Cut","review":"While playing the game 'Skyrim' I found that for certain things it would be nice to have some infornmation.The book is a great help, but I only use it when I am stuck.

I'm not reading them in order of publication, but I enjoy each one more than the last.I realize not everyone likes the same thing, but I cannot understand the criticisms leveled at this novel. Poor writing? Come on, Hewson is one of the most literate crime writers working today--certainly on a level with Donna Leon and Ian Rankin (to both of whom he's been compared). Uninteresting characters? Please. Hewson takes the time to develop each character so that by the end of the novel you feel you really know them. Confusing plot? Well, a police procedural is supposed to have an intriguing story line that twists and turns, and Hewson's novels certainly exemplify this, but there's nothing confusing about the plots; when everything is revealed, all makes perfect sense. Rome not brought to life vividly enough? This accusation is so ridiculous I won't comment upon it, except to say that if you've been to Rome and seen the places Hewson describes, you realize how accurate and compelling his descriptions are; when I read his prose I feel as if I'm back there. Slow moving? Well, compared to American crime writers, maybe so, but that's just because Hewson takes the time to bring his characters to life instead of showing us cardboard figures frantically scrambling about.For my money, Hewson is one of the best crime writers out there, and THE SACRED CUT is an engrossing, compelling read."},{"Title":"The Sacred Cut","review":"I listened to this book on CD format. The readers voice was too low to hear at times, forcing me to back-track and turn it up. Not recommended for listening if you are driving.The \\"blurbs\\" from reviewers caused me to think this was a \\"puzzle\\" type story. It was compared to \\"Di Vinci Code\\". I have no idea why. This is just a murder mystery set in Rome. There are no religious overtones at all. The author tried to link in some ancient Roman history but, all that did was take up space in the story-line. It was more closely tied to modern times, with a de-ranged killer. Desert Storm plays a role.All in all, a good book, but, not one I'd pay full price for."},{"Title":"The Sacred Cut","review":"First, let me start off by stating that I had been misled by a reviewer that compared this book to The DaVinci Code. \\"If you liked the DaVinci Code, you'll love this book,\\" it said. This coloured my enjoyment of this novel, as I was expecting the author to throw many assorted symbols into the story. But there is just the one: the Sacred Cut. If it hadn't been for that review, however, I might never have picked up this novel, and I would have missed out on a good story.Set in Rome during a blizzard just before Christmas, detectives Peroni and Costa are called to the Pantheon where they make a gruesome discovery and are shot at. They are forced to work with the FBI on this investigation, and find that there is little collaboration from them.The characters in this book are portrayed in a very human manner, with all of their faults and human frailties. No superheroes here. The main story is also very believable. Both of these elements make you want to read on and find out how things turn out for these people.I do recommend that you read this novel if you enjoy a good murder investigation. But if anybody tells you it's like the DaVinci Code, beware! I personally found no resemblance at all, and it tainted my overall enjoyment of an otherwise good book."},{"Title":"Fundmentals of Pediatric Orthopedics","review":"There are newer and better books.

It is filled with instances of humor and triumph. It depicts a Chinese culture and a cuisine that is not, as one of the previous reviewers stated, for the faint of heart. This story shows a person that is both proud to have survived and troubled by some of the things that he did to survive. I was fascinated by this story and I was grateful to have read it rather than to have lived it."},{"Title":"The Attic: Memoir of a Chinese Landlord's Son","review":"This is my all-time favorite book. I've read it three times. I suggest it to everyone. I've found myself chuckling through descriptions told with humor, but in reality must have been very difficult situations. I've heard only one negative response to the very short chapter devoted to methods of killing and eating animals. It is very shocking. It is not gratuitous violence, it's China's very ancient way. The author did not imply that these methods were widespread by any means. The rest of the book is funny and sad and thoroughly enjoyable. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Attic: Memoir of a Chinese Landlord's Son","review":"This book is captivating and full of flavor. Cao's writing style is very wonderful. When read The Attic, you gain access to a world that is not common to 20th or 21 century Americans. Cao describes his life of living in Shanghai China with very little materials but making the very best of it. The book is an excellent example of the human spirit overcoming the challenges of life. After you get into he book you just cant put it down. I would prescribe this book to anyone that would like to see into the life of mid 20th century China. Caution, this book has customs and parts of daily life that are very different from western custom. Please read with caution if you have a sensitive nature."},{"Title":"The Attic: Memoir of a Chinese Landlord's Son","review":"This is a great book.

When he told of his sister's assignment to the countryside and the desperate measures taken to bring her back to Shanghai, then I began to experience a sense of anguish, along with him. In the early parts of the book I felt a distance from the family: I did not get a sense of the fear that must have gripped the family as they sought refuge in Shanghai,and their subsequent relief, despite their--to an American--very harsh circumstances. For five people to bathe, cook, sleep, work in an attic is beyond our grasp. As the author described his dispairing and brave sister, his parents experiencing the effects of age, a quarrel over good fortune, the memoir at last came alive to me. I appreciated the author's sharing his memories; still, for most of the book, I remained an observer. I can't say exactly why."},{"Title":"The Attic: Memoir of a Chinese Landlord's Son","review":"The other reviews mention the graphic, nauseating chapter on unusual eating practices in China - things so horrifying to a Westerner that I won't even attempt to describe them.The reviews leave out the human atrocities in the book, and there are plenty. What this author's sister is forced to do to her hand to survive chills my blood and depresses me, even now, months after my initial reading.Overall, this is not a novel for the faint of heart - I can't express this enough!The chapter on animal abuse (I can't call it anything but) is the most revolting thing I have ever read, so BEWARE! If you are a vegetarian, don't even ATTEMPT this book.Aside from the dark content, I just did not find this book pleasing; the author is a selfish creep who abuses his family. I suppose the reader is supposed to write this off as cruel youth, but the entire book leaves a bad taste in your mouth.If you want to read something both lyrical and informative about China, try Falling Leaves, or Red Scarf Girl, or Bound Feet, Western Dress. Any of those memoirs would be an excellent read. Red China Blues is also a fascinating book, though written by a Westerner.

However, this is a rather small corpus for such a large character, and even within the lifetime of the Conan Doyle, others turned their attention to working through different Holmes/Watson stories, filling in odd gaps in their lives, and sometimes greatly embellishing the legends. Holmes and Watson have travelled to outer space, through time, and have even had their genders switched in such tales.One of the recurrent themes in the continuing lore of Sherlock Holmes has been the attempt to locate him more concretely in 'the real world', seeing the stories actually as fictionalised accounts of a very real person. This novel, 'The Seven-Percent Solution', penned by Nicholas Meyer (under the direction, as the novel's credits state, of John H. Watson, MD) is very much in that tradition. Like most of the Holmes tales in the canon, this one is largely recounted from the perspective of Watson. It serves as a corrective, a confession, and a reconciling of timelines -- where was Holmes during his 'missing' time after fighting Moriarty? Who was Moriarty, in reality?Here we have Holmes chasing Moriarty to the continent, just as Watson recounted in the tale 'The Final Problem', perhaps the most famous and most controversial of Holmes tales, of that time or ours. However, Moriarty is a different figure here -- not the Napoleon of crime, but rather a shadowy figure from Holmes' past. Watson, being a medical man, watched Holmes deteriorate under the influence of cocaine, a seven-percent solution no less. Watson realised that this addiction was masking some other problem from Holmes' past, and the fixation on Moriarty was an outgrowth of this. Being aware of current medical literature, he became acquainted with the new works of Sigmund Freud, and engaged Moriarty to lead Holmes in a chase, not to the perilous falls, but rather to Freud's chambers in Vienna.Let the psychoanalysis begin.Meyer, under Watson's direction, recounts the struggle Holmes had at overcoming his drug addiction and facing up to a reality that was very painful for him to bear -- solving the mysteries of the world for others was child's play compared to solving his own interior mysteries. We as readers get an interesting snapshot of late Victorian life in Vienna. We also get treated to yet another mystery, one that could not be recounted in the official canon, wrapped up in Holmes' own treatment as it was. Of course, in the end, the mysteries are solved, internal and external, but Holmes needs a holiday -- he spends years away from London, and of course Watson provides the cover.Meyer's rendering of the text in a Watsonian style is commendable. He has drawn on the wealth of Sherlock Holmes material outside the canon for inspiration, as well as drew on the ample references within the canon to support his tale. Made into a feature film, this tale is perhaps the most successful of the non-Conan Doyle apocrypha. Any fan of Holmes will love it."},{"Title":"SEVEN PERCENT SOLUTION","review":"What a fun book this has been to read! I \\"did\\" it in a couple of days, and enjoyed it thoroughly. Why was it so enjoyable?First, it's a well-written story. The author has a great command of the important elements - not only the language of the period, but also the historical, cultural, scientific and technological details of the Victorian era. At every turn, you'll find interesting information and references (often in the form of footnotes) which give the story a rich context, and lend it credibility. At times I felt as if the author was flaunting his knowledge, but since done with taste and often humor, that is easily forgivable.Second, the characters are well-realized, rich and complex enough to be believable. Much character development occurs during dialogue, which is in my view superior to lengthy and boring descriptions. We instantly recognize Holmes, an eccentric, brilliant and deeply conflicted individual with seemingly irreconcilable qualities. Yet this is not merely a reconstructed, reclothed mannequin - the author manages to resurrect an authentic, life-like Holmes, not contrived or artificial in any way. His observation and inference skills are as sharp as ever. There is much revealed about him that is shocking, yet should not come as a total surprise if one really knows Holmes as well as the author does. That he has done his homework is evident from the Acknowledgements, which serves as a sort of bibliography, from where the key ideas used in the book are distilled. Freud and Watson are less in focus, although much that's interesting is revealed about Freud, particularly to those who are not too familiar with him.Third, the story itself is interesting, with many dramatic turns. The main element is Holmes' addiction to cocaine, and his abnormal fixation on Moriarty, resolved by Freud's at the time radical approach to psychotherapy. Freud himself is an interesting character, gentle yet powerful, virtuous yet vain; always good-natured and devoted to his patients and his ideas, in equal measure. There is a great sense of symmetry in the story, where Holmes and Freud's paths and ideas cross: Holmes, the great detective and Freud, the great detective of the psyche. Freud cures Holmes, and Holmes helps Freud with a suicidal patient who is unable to speak, and frustrates Freud's efforts to penetrate her mind. Holmesian methods of deduction by keen observation are the very same ones as Freudian, only applied to a different field, and the way the author draws the parallels is fascinating. It's not his original idea, but it is well developed in the novel. The real story starts in the second part of the book, when Freud's mute patient puts Holmes on a trail that leads him to a diabolical political plot to arm Germany and precipitate a catastrophic European war, which is, as it were, \\"delayed\\" until 1914 by Holmes' and his friends' efforts.To conclude, I'll commit a sacrilege and venture the opinion that the book sits so well with the other Holmes literature that it could be considered part of the Holmes library."},{"Title":"SEVEN PERCENT SOLUTION","review":"The canon of Sherlock Holmes consists of a set of short stories and novels penned by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle -- fifty-six short stories and four novels.

Watson, MD concerning his association with Sherlock Holmes. He rewrites Holmesian history by disavowing the death and reappearance of Holmes, and then strikes off in new territory by relating a previously unexpected extended adventure.The book is surprisingly cheeky in some respects, revealing a previously hidden side of Holmes that is no less than pathetic. Holmes' addiction to cocaine reduces him not only to the level of his fellow man, but the the level of the worst criiminals and addicts that he has devoted his life to pursuing. This is a pretty bold move.In other respects, the novel pays almost fanatical homage to the Holmesian tradition. Moriarty is reintroduced as lovingly as possible, and all of the regulars come out to play; despite the fact that most of the book takes place in Vienna, we get a satisfying glimpse of everyone from Mrs. Hudson to Mycroft Holmes.In my opinion, the book falters when it attempts to introduce Sigmund Freud into the mix, setting Freud and Holmes up as equals who each have their own peculiarly specialized brand of genius. While I like that this idea cements Holmes' place in the real world (when I bought this and another Holmes book from a second hand store, a patron remarked with no joke intended that Holmes had been the greatest detective of all time), I don't like to see Holmes evenly matched by anyone, and there's a gimmicky \\"Dracula vs. Frankenstein\\" feel to it.I would have preferred a more traditional Holmes story somehow extended to novel length; as it is, the traveling and the introduction of another major character left my thirst for nostalgia only somewhat quenched.Despite these shortcomings, this is a very entertaining book, and fans of Sherlock Holmes will appreciate the chance to have another experience with their hero. Having read a couple of other post-Doyle Holmes books, I can say that this is probably the best I have read for the fan interested in seeing Holmes as he was in the original stories."},{"Title":"SEVEN PERCENT SOLUTION","review":"\\"The Seven Percent Solution\\", a Sherlock Holmes pastiche by Nicholas Meyer, is a well-written book, but has the dumbest cover blurb I've ever read.\\"Sigmund Freud and Sherlock Holmes!

If he did, then in all likelihood his addiction to drugs would have one day overcome him. Enter Sigmund Freud who has had some success in treating such conditions.In \\"Seven Percent Solution\\" by Nicholas Meyer, Dr. Watson tricks Holmes into visiting Freud, as Holmes' addiction has not only weakened his friend physically but seems to be effecting his mental condition as well. Meyer's does a splendid job in creating a convincible scenario where Holmes and Freud both confront and soon congratulate one another. Of course a mystery soon sprouts forth and Holmes and Freud team up to solve it.The real mystery, of course, is Holmes. Through Freud we get a better understand of Holmes and his obsession with mysteries, Hint: it has to do with his mother. The book makes this all work and it's an enjoyable read; however, it is not an easy fit with the rest of the Holmes books written by Arthur Conan Doyle. It's main fault is that it erases one of Doyle's best characters by means of psychoanalysis. So if you're a Sherlock nut, this book may offend you in the end...but it's a good read nonetheless."},{"Title":"SEVEN PERCENT SOLUTION","review":"The Seven per-cent Solution, by Nicholas Meyer could have been a great addition to the extended legacy of Sherlock Holmes.

It all comes down to a great idea, a brand slam. The author talks about marketing by committees, strategic plans and how they are frequently at the heart of brand development. The plan comes first and everything follows from there. He argues that this is totally the wrong approach and his reasoning certainly makes sense. What must come first is THE BIG IDEA. This could be a product idea, an advertising idea, a slogan idea and so on. This forms the core to be able to move forward. If a strategic plan is needed then it follows from the idea.Brand Slam is divided into section that show how a brand slam can happen in different areas. For example, the slogans section show how the use of different words can contribute towards a brand slam slogan. The advertising section considers how brand slam ads are memorable and, ultimately, more effective than poor advertising. The sections are illustrated with a wealth of examples, some of which have their own dedicated section that goes into detail about how a brand slam business was built. One criticism is that the examples are primarily US brands or international brands in the US and the slogans and advertising may be unknown to an audience outside. However, this does not hide the lessons that are being communicated. The examples still work though.Brand slam is inspirational and encourages the reader to think of other relevant examples and why they work. Each section concludes with a set of lessons to be learned. These can be applied to your own company or brand and help you towards your own brand slam."},{"Title":"Brand Slam: An In-Depth Look at the Remarkable Concepts and Creative Teams Behind Some of the World's Most Ingenious Brand Recognition Campaigns","review":"Brand is an important and valuable asset for every company, thus creating a unique image for your brand and differentiating from your competitors are important issues in brand management.

That's the genre for this book. In February 1986 Joyce tendered his letter of resignation to Gene Jankowski. He begins his tale of the events leading up to that action by first describing the early years of the organization he left, CBS. &quot;CBS News consistently measures itself by its past&quot; he writes. He talks about the &quot;glory days&quot; of Edward R. Murrow and the &quot;handful of young men&quot; who created broadcast news from scratch, with no model to follow.It is hard to comprehend how corporate decisions are made. Dan Rather inherited a prestigious news organization as far as ratings were concerned. While his performance has kept the network at or near the cellar the entire time he's been in the anchor slot, he seems arrogantly secure in his position. Joyce points out that both inside CBS and outside there was concern when Walter Cronkite announced he was stepping down, that Rather did not have the qualities necessary for the anchor slot. It was assumed Roger Mudd would be next in line to replace Cronkite. Subsequent ratings all these decades later showed Joyce's observation at the time was correct. Evidently the decision-makers at CBS have an agenda other than public preference.There are other glimpses of the inner workings of CBS during the 1980s. For anyone still interested in CBS, perhaps better phrased, for anyone interested in corporate bureaucracy this book is full of examples of decisions that were not always the most logical."},{"Title":"Digital Signal Processors: Architectures, Implementations, and Applications","review":"In my opinion this book is one of the best in this subject.

Lew needed Doc to help identify the victims and have Ray begin taking pictures of the scene.Much to Doc's surprise when he arrived at the scene he recognized Peg Gamin, a local resident, with a rather shady reputation as one of the victims.

Peg had been Ray's friend for years and he was shattered at the news and determined to find the killer.It is soon discovered that Peg not only was an heiress but also had a son. The three women were connected with their once a week Karaoke outings as well as the fact that they had all been patients of a plastic surgeon. Peg was in the process of filing suit against the surgeon malpractice.This is the seventh in the Loon Lake series and Victoria Houston brings back many of the characters from previous books as well as a couple of new ones.

I heard Ms. Houston on an NPR show and liked her immediately--her Midwestern sensibility, her sense of humor, the way she talked about writing. So I purchased this book, and I found it a terrific, engaging, and completely enjoyable reading experience.The characters are likeable, slightly quirky, and believable. The story features a triple murder, and couple of other grisly deaths along the way, but the author loves her main characters so much, and writes so wonderfully about the locale, that the reader is almost more interested in the interactions of the cast of mostly amateur crime fighters who move from clue to clue to solve the crime. The book is well-paced and contains humor and local color--and some nicely written descriptions of fishing experiences--and the mystery unravels page by page.Ms. Houston is a skillful writer. This book is a keeper.

Edited by Charles Guignon. 389 pp. Cambridge : Cambridge University Press, 1993 and reprinted. ISBN 0-521-385970-0 (Pbk).This excellent collection of articles for students and the general reader contains, in addition to an extremely clear and useful 40-page introductory overview of Heidegger's thought and career by Charles Guignon, the following thirteen pieces:1. The Question of Being: Heidegger's Project - DOROTHEA FREDE; 2. Reading a life : Heidegger and hard times - THOMAS SHEEHAN; 3. The unity of Heidegger's thought - FREDERICK A. OLAFSON; 4. Intentionality and world : Division I of 'Being and Time' - HARRISON HALL; 5. Time and phenomenology in Husserl and Heidegger - ROBERT J. DOSTAL; 6. Heidegger and the hermeneutic turn - DAVID COUZENS HOY; 7. Death, time, history : Division II of 'Being and Time' - PIOTR HOFFMAN; 8. Authenticity, moral values, and psychotherapy - CHARLES B. GUIGNON; 9. Heidegger, Buddhism, and deep ecology - MICHAEL E. ZIMMERMAN; 10. Heidegger and theology - JOHN D. CAPUTO; 11. Heidegger on the connection between nihilism, art, technology, and politics - HUBERT L. DREYFUS; 12. Engaged agency and background in Heidegger - CHARLES TAYLOR; 13. Wittgenstein, Heidegger, and the reification of language - RICHARD RORTY.Although many of these contributors are distinguished Heidegger scholars, most do seem to have successfully pitched their discussion at a level suited to the non-specialist, and although this book is by no means a 'Heidegger Made Simple' (a certain amount of background in both philosophy and Heidegger would be useful) most readers should come away with an enhanced understanding of Heidegger and a desire to know more. The absolute beginner, however, might prefer - after reading Charles Guignon's Introduction, and before plunging into the articles - to read a more extended general introduction such as George Steiner's 'Martin Heidegger' (1987).Besides helping the general reader and non-specialist, the Companion will also be of use to more advanced students as providing a conspectus of recent developments in the interpretation of Heidegger, and here the inclusion of Zimmerman's excellent article is both gratifying and noteworthy. Too often, books about Heidegger completely overlook the fact that many of the most brilliant minds in Asia have spent the last two thousand years pondering some of the very same problems that exercised Heidegger, and that a knowledge of their thoughts about such matters as Being or Time can sometimes help us to better understand Heidegger.Readers, for example, might take a look at Book 11 of Dogen's 'Shobogenzo,' UJI (Existence-Time or Being-Time), or at such works as Graham Parkes 'Heidegger and Asian Thought' or Richard Mays 'Heidegger's Hidden Sources : East Asian Influences on his Work' (see my Listmania List 'Understanding Heidegger' for details). Dorothea Frede, in her 'The Question of Being,' asks (without answering) the question : &quot;What led to the &quot;breakthrough&quot; that provided Heidegger with the clue for attacking the question of the meaning of being in a new way . . . ?&quot; (page 51). Who knows? Might it have been Asian thought? It certainly begins to look so.The Companion also includes a List of contributors, a Chronology, a curiously organized 22-page Bibliography of both German and English works (which would have been easier to consult if the items had been spaced) and an Index. It is well-printed in a large, clear font on excellent paper, is bound in a sturdy glossy wrapper, and comes with a glued spine. Well organized and well produced, The Companion becomes a fitting addition to the distinguished Cambridge series and should be of interest to all serious students of Heidegger."},{"Title":"The Cambridge Companion to Heidegger (Cambridge Companions to Philosophy)","review":"As a student, I found this book to be an extremely helpful introduction to Heidegger's philosophy.

They had tons of \\"readers\\" that were actually novels and were graded for each year from Gr.1 to 5 or 6. I never used them in school but they were in both my school library and public library and I signed out anything they published without even seeing what it was about. I don't remember any titles but I do remember series about race car driving, underwater diving, cowboys, an outer space family. Gee, they all seem boy-targeted don't they? I'd never heard of \\"Tommy O'Toole\\" before but wouldn't pass up owning this delight for anything.This is the first in the series, written for the Grade 1 class; it progressively increases in reading ability from short easy sentences to longer on level sentences with a few above-level words by the end of the book. Like a normal school reader of the time, it has a vocabulary page and after that is a section of school phonics lessons (we didn't read this part, my son wanted to actually, but I said let's just enjoy the story and leave it there).Ds loved the book! The story is about Tommy O'Toole, age unknown, but a young working man, possibly in his middle twenties. Some illustrations make him look almost teenage, while others definitely make him almost \\"Dad\\" age, but he is certainly a man. Tommy finds a stray, hungry collie dog and takes him in. Tommy works at the railroad as a \\"hoop-man\\" and he trains Larry to retrieve the hoops. The book is filled with adventures and local children often come to the train yard, are friends with Tommy, love Larry and get involved with the action. The story is surprisingly not very old-fashioned at all except in the time period which is easy to explain away by looking at the book as historically set in the fifties. Otherwise the children include boys and girls and the adventures are quite exciting. There is one where the dog goes missing and is found caught in an animal trap. There is a small picture on every page done in two tones, red/gray, but there is more text per page than picture. Even though the book is Gr. 1, I think the expectations in 1957 were higher than today and the book is more equal to at least Gr. 2. A very impressive story, and ds read it very well.Unfortunately, I do not have the second book, but I do have the 3rd one.

We enjoyed the photos of instruments being played, diagrams to clarify details, and historical information on the instruments. In the first 51 pages called Making Music, topics covered are the orchestra, conductor, composer, groups of instruments (stringed, woodwind, brass, percussion, and keyboard), and chamber music. Each instument section includes how the instruments actually make the sounds and is correlated to the CD. I wish the CD tracks could have been longer and sometimes the track included several instruments playing. It was hard to just pick out a particular instrument, especially for the younger children.The music on the CD is Concerto in Pieces by Poul Ruders played by the BBC Symphony Orchestra and conducted by Andrew Davis. In the composer section there are photos of Ruders working on this score, in the orchestra section there are photos of the BBC Symphony Orchestra, and in the conductor section there are photos of Andrew Davis conducting.Part 2 is the History of Music. We enjoyed an interesting timeline with historic art from 40,000 BC to 2000 AD. (Since they have so little information, it really starts in 2600 BC.) Major divisions are ancient, medieval, baroque, classical, romantic, and national music. A reference section on composers, musical forms, and a glossary of musical terms completes the book.I didn't really care for the CD, especially now having listened to it many, many times through. I wish it could have more clearly indicated individual instruments too.I think this was a good start in our study of musical instruments. The children were interested in reading from it each day (2-4 pages per day). They enjoyed the diagrams and seeing the instruments. The CD added to the book. I just think it could have been better."},{"Title":"Young Person's Guide to Music","review":"I was somewhat disappointed in this book. I guess for a non-musical person, it does okay.

After five minutes of looking through the new book with me, she was inspired to pick up a large leaf and place it under her chin. She took a stick and began rubbing it back and forth across the leaf. \\"I'm playing my viola,\\" she said. The really funny scene was when she tried to pretend a guitar case was a double bass. The pictures are really great for kids. I think they could have chosen nicer music for their cd. The Witches Chorus is rather overpowering. The instrument examples sound electronic to me. The charts of music history is confusing. Incidents in each period seem to have been picked at random rather than for their overall importance to the period. It isn't really a general overview. However, I still like the book. The strong point is that it gives children a good introduction to the instruments. It is entertaining."},{"Title":"Thomas Becket","review":"Frank Barlow set out to write the definitive Becket biography. Mission accomplished. Thomas Becket, the 12th century english politican/archbishop/martyr/saint, rose from semi-obscurity to become chancellor of england under Henry II and then became Archbishop of Canterbury. After becoming Archbishop, he promptly got into it with the King (his buddy) over whether religious clerks could be subject to the king's punishment (among other issues), fled to France and spend five years arguing with Henry II over who was right and who was wrong.Upon his long awaited arrival in England to resume his position as Archbishop, he was promptly murdered by some over zealous nights. The rest, as they say, is history. He was soon made a saint because his blood had miraculous healing properties(eww.)Barlow knows his primary and secondary sources. When the sources are unclear, he says so. When the sources are absent, he tells you. It is clear that Barlow is not overburdened with a love of Becket or King Henry. His understanding of 12th century politics and religion (really the two were inseperable) is unimpeachable.In summation, I found this book just as interesting for its portrait of 12th century society (albeit the elite side of society) as for the story of Thomas Becket. I doubt I will ever read another book about Becket after reading this one."},{"Title":"Thomas Becket","review":"The author has read all documents, all letters and memoranda, all notes and chronicles from eye-witnesses and other people around Thomas Becket. Maybe even too much or too many. He tries to rebuild a full biography with all personal intentions and meanings from this imbroglio and forest of testimonies. He succeeds quite well, though at times he seems to be overwhelmed with details. Yet he clears up a few facts. Becket was of Norman extract by both his parents and his father was a merchant in London. Jean Anouilh's myth of a Saxon father and a Saracen mother is clearly ousted. The book is also clear about Thomas Becket's life. He sure was the friend of Henry II, in spite or because of a ten years age difference. But this did not mean he took part in Henry's drinking and womanizing. In fact he appears to be a very serious and tedious person who does not really like the pleasures of life, even if, as the Chancellor, he is obliged to have an apparently ritzy life. The point is he was a good Chancellor and had a good influence on Henry, though as the Chancellor, he had no real power, except on church services for the King and the copying service of the crown. He probably taught Henry his job and kept him within some limits. When he was the Chancellor he did all he could to impose and improve the King's power, and limit and contain the Church's. He forced the Church to accept to pay the various taxes the King needed for his wars. But Henry tricked him. Was it with his agreement or against his will? We will never know. Henry appointed him Archbishop of Canterbury, the head of the church in England. This enabled Thomas Becket to finally lead the life of austerity and rule-governed behavior he desired. He was able to wear the monastic underwear under his archiepiscopal dress. This will determine in his new life intransigence and exaction for himself and the others, including the king. He became the best defender of the church and refused the king's power in the judicial field that was encroaching on the church's courts of justice. He refused criminal clerks to be tried by lay royal or feudal courts, monks who became such to escape serfdom to be in any way recaptured, and his appointing priests to be in any way questioned by local feudal barons. The book though never enters the question of the contradiction between Saxons and Normans. The author uses the word English and we do not know if he means Saxons or Normans born in England. Barlow thus avoids questioning the main problem of that time: the colonization of England by the Normans and the integration of the Saxons in the new emerging English society. From this moment though Thomas Becket became Henry's archenemy. The king will do all he can to destroy him. Thomas Becket will go in exile and use the French church and the Pope to get a reconciliation, though he must have thought it was a foolish bargain knowing the king the way he did. But he accepted against all odds to go back to Canterbury where he will be assassinated within days after his return, just after Christmas 1170 in the cathedral itself. This death will start a popular pilgrimage and myth, and the King will come on his own repentance pilgrimage there in 1174 in order to recapture the support of the Church in England against the rebellion led by his eldest son he had had the carelessness to have crowned before his own death, though against the will of the Archbishop of Canterbury Thomas Becket in exile at the time. Actually on this question, in this situation the book is by far too short concerning the role of Eleanor of Aquitaine, his wife. But the main shortcoming of the book is that his conclusion is factually right but historically short. Thomas Becket will have helped the church to stand against old feudal customs imposed onto the church, thus appearing as if defending the freedom of the church, what will appear later in the Magna Carta, and yet that made the church stand against the King in his attempt to build a more centralized political order with one single tax system and one single royal judicial system. And at that level the King is going in the right direction since such reforms are needed to guarantee equality to all and a more centralized society, a less divided and exploded society, in a way one \\"rule of law\\" in the whole kingdom. This will also appear in the Magna Carta, though less clearly and it will take a few centuries for it to become a reality. These two directions, civil liberties and a more unified just and fair territory and political system, will be the very basis of the political organization that will finally emerge, for the first time in the western world, after the Glorious Revolution. Barlow does not see this perspective though he notes the great improvements that will appear in the judicial system after Thomas Becket's death, the church essentially yielding to the King's justice.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine & University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne"},{"Title":"Thomas Becket","review":"I'll weigh in as the curmudgeon of this group of reviewers. I just finished this Barlow book, having read a few others (I have other ones I've reviewed), and had a heck of a time finishing this one. I'll go on record as saying that I think Frank Barlow is a master of the part of historiography and historical research that bores many scholars to tears: he PORES over every possible document, gleaning what he can out of the contents. He is a document archeologist. He also weaves together various accounts of his subjects from often contradictory sources, and he does a good, if tedious job of it. He tells us when documents should be there but are no longer extant, and he gives us the appropriate back-story behind some of the record-keepers' possible motivations.That said, in this book, as in other Barlow studies, the scholar reveals his pro-Catholic Church approach to the subject matter, which isn't bad, per se, but sometimes I feel the author takes a rather official, approved view of his subject matter. This may be more my interpretation as opposed to fact, but the idea has suggested itself in the past, and this book, unfortunately, reinforced my earlier opinions. This doesn't mean Barlow's research is flawed or inappropriately relayed, but it does get a little frustrating when you want the historian to go deeper to the obvious follow-up questions, and yet holds himself back. Like I said, this is more my opinion and observation, so take the criticism with a grain of salt. I also didn't lower my rating because of it, as it is an unsubstantiated subjective observation.I would like a writer of better quality than myself to work out a less-biased appraisal of Becket. With all due respect to Dr Coulardeau (see other reviews) of the Sorbonne, I don't know that I agree Becket is an \\"exceptional\\" character, if by exceptional he means the saint is praiseworthy. The record, hagiographic a**kissing aside, does not support the views that Becket was a likeable fellow: he seemed to forget where he came from (ie his coming from low-born status) when he was the chancellor of Henry II. He was never particularly pious prior to his becoming a priest, then arch-bishop later the same day. In fact, as chancellor, he fought enthusiastically for Henry's anti-clerical policies, exemplified later by the Council of Clarendon.I found it ironic, though Frank Barlow doesn't, that the reasons behind Becket's \\"martyrdom\\", Henry's arguments for his authority over the Church, were worked out originally by Chancellor Becket, then fought against voraciously and fatally by Archbishop Becket. Many people suffered for Becket's stance, and the man is quite cruel in his lack of humility and empathy for those he pains.Why shouldn't the King have been offended? Why shouldn't his clerks have hated the exile they were in? Why shouldn't the pope have hated the archbishop's stubborn refusal to be diplomatic? Why shouldn't lifelong ecclesiastics have hated his ignorance of the Church or of Becket's meteoric rise against ALL common sense? Why shouldn't Henry the Young King (son of Henry II) have been frustrated by an ingrate who refused to perform his coronation, but insisted on his sole right to consecrate a king of England? Whew? This guy is all about himself, if I may say so. And it hurts to read...In fact, I have to agree with the contemporary assessment of Becket that he was disloyal and inflexible to a man who recognized him as a brother, elevated him for his aptitude from the lower ranks, then bent here and there to accomadate his old chancellor's changing values when he became archbishop. As a Catholic I risk a certain amount of censure for saying this, but Becket seems to offer no justification for his martyrdom other than pride. Barlow has a hard time reconciling the fact that Becket was martyred for his stiff-backed defense of the Church's (ie HIS) rights over the King of England's claims. Becket went from fine-dining, nice clothes, proximity to power, hawking with the king, with whom he was on indecorously intimate terms, to a prideful view of himself as an anointee of God, rather than an appointee of the King and the Holy Father in Rome.Becket was not well liked by all his clerks; he was barely tolerated by pope Alexander; he was known for sumptuous feasts as archbishop, and he mocked monks for their austerity. Later all this was accounted a ruse by a very holy man who was martyred for love of the Church. Well, I call BS, because it becomes obvious from the record that Thomas Becket was an average chancellor, though a wary and accomplished lawyer; he was a terrible scholar by his contemporaries' accounts (his own clerks had good-natured fun at the archbishop's expense, though most admired his willingness to learn things like spoken Latin. A good thing for an archbishop, right? So how come he didn't speak it well already if he was so smart as to become chancellor of England?)In fact Becket emerges from the records as a less-than-likable guy. He is one of those folks who can get so self-righteous on principle, as opposed to any generally worthwhile reason, and who eagerly yet ironically suffers for the opinions of others. I think his condition may have bordered on paranoid schizophrenia. He may have required medication, or at least therapy. An honest account from his confessor, the closest we'll get to meeting Thomas' analyst, Robert of Merton, would be highly illuminating.He clearly places himself above others, even his own friends, such as the King of England. He displays contempt for King Louis, Pope Alexander, his own clerks, his monks at Christ Church, Canterbury, and, ultimately, his own work as chancellor. To me, he seems like he's a person who wants conflict for the sake of a good dust-up, and that smacks of vanity and pride, two serious sins. He was a yuppie lawyer, to put it in modern parlance, and he definitely never lost sight of himself in all he did. His motto should have been: What does Thomas like?So if you need the information about Becket, read this book; Frank Barlow, while a little biased from a Church and English point-of-view, is a very good researcher, and keeps his eyes on the prize amidst a lot of confusing information. But if you want a careful analysis of Becket, and his relationship with King Henry, and its impact on the English Catholic world-view, you might look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Thomas Becket","review":"The true story of Thomas Becket, archbishop of Canterbury, and the adversity which led to his brutal murder and martyrdom in his cathedral by four knights of King Henry II.

This is an engaging history of the severe enmity that developed between King and Archbishop over the rights of the Church, finally ending in a horrible murder."},{"Title":"Thomas Becket","review":"This is a balanced biography of a saint, looking at the records and avoiding the pitfalls of backdating a saint's character. Thomas Becket had a strong personality, rising from merchant's son to Chancellor of England Archbishop of England, and then sainthood. He lived at a time when the upper class was tightening its boundaries, although there were a few others who made this journey, most notably Nicholas Breakspear, Pope Adrian IV.This should not be the first book on medieval England that you read. TryThe Civilization of the Middle Ages: A Completely Revised and Expanded Edition of Medieval Historyas a starter. The author focuses on Thomas, Henry II and their companions, rarely commenting on the overarching social and religious situations. He does discuss the particulars of the political situation. For a biography that discusses the society as a whole tryChaucer: His Life, His Works, His World. I am more of a student of social and cultural history rather than biographies, but this was a very good biography."},{"Title":"Thomas Becket","review":"Great historical events that happened too too long ago are difficult to not only research but also to put into print with any new information. The evidence is all gone, any observers or participants are long gone and there are certainly no pictures of events before, say, the mid to late 1800s. This book suffers from that but I must tell you that if anyone is even marginally interested in the Becket/Henry story this is one of the \\"must reads\\". It is not only one of the few classics about the subject but it is one of the better ones. If one is looking for great literature of course this is not it but if you enjoy the era, like the history and need to know more about it this is a clear \\"must read\\".It's an older book with older syntax but that does't affect the truth. It's a style that won't turn you off and my wager is that at the end of it you will be glad you opened it up in the first place.Good reading !"},{"Title":"Thomas Becket","review":"A wonderful friend of mine who lives in England requested that I purchase this book and read it.

There are, naturally, some differences in the scripts. And, one can't help hearing Burton's voice when reading Becket's lines. The play is a strong, yet not overly sympathetic, portrayal of Thomas Becket. He's shown with both strengths and weaknesses, although the king is seen more as flawed throughout. If someone had not seen the film version, I'd recommend reading the play before seeing the movie in order to make an independent judgment. But then, do yourself the favor of seeing the film."},{"Title":"Commentaries on the Laws of England","review":"Every American lawyer ought to read Blackstone.Not that the law he contains is still reliable, although much of it is. But for the big picture, the history of the development of the English common law, he remains an indispensible source.The American founding fathers grew up with this stuff, and these four volumes were indispensible for a Colonial gentleman's education. In viewing them, you will gain a new understanding of the meaning of the Constitution of the United States. As Blackstone develops the law, he sets it against the backdrop of the British struggle against arbitrary rule by the King, the seventeenth century wars of religious fanaticism, and England's long battle to win free from the power of the papacy. To read Blackstone is to learn what the founding fathers thought and feared, and what they wrote the Constitution to guard against."},{"Title":"Commentaries on the Laws of England","review":"Sir William Blackstone (1723-1780) was an English jurist, judge and Tory politician; these Commentaries were first published in four volumes (On on the Rights of Persons; On the Rights of Things; Of Private Wrongs; Of Public Wrongs) between 1765-1769, and were very influential on the development of the American legal system. Other volumes in this series are:Commentaries on the Laws of England: A Facsimile of the First Edition of 1765-1769, Vol. 1,Commentaries on Laws of England, Vol. 3, andCommentaries on the Laws of England (Vol. 4).He begins by stating, \\"The former book of these commentaries having treated at large of ... such rights and duties as are annexed to the persons of men, the objects of our enquiry in this second book will be ... those rights which a man may accquire in and to such external things as are unconnected with his person. These are what the writers on natural law (style) the rights of dominion, or property...\\" (Pg. 1)He asserts, \\"This is the only true and solid foundation of man's dominion over external things, whatever airy metaphysical notions may have been started by fanciful writers upon this subject. The earth therefore, and all things therein, are the general property of all manking, exclusive of other beings, from the immediate gift of the creator.\\" (Pg. 3) He suggests, \\"I will not put the title of the clergy to tithes upon any divine right; though such a right certainly commenced, and I believe certainly ceased, with the Jewish theocracy. Yet an honourable and competence maintenance for the ministers of the gospel is, undoubtedly, jure divino (by divine law).\\" (Pg. 25)He argues, \\"the liberties of Englighmen are not... mere infringements of the king's prerogative, extorted from our princes by taking advantage of their weakness; but a restoration of that ancient constitution, of which our ancestors had been defrauded by the art and finesse of the Norman lawyers, rather than deprived by the force of Norman arms.\\" (Pg. 52) He states, \\"A sixth method of acquiring property ... is by marriage... This depends entirely on the notion of a unity of person between the husband and wife; it being held that they are one person in law.\\" (Pg. 433)While this reprinted edition (e.g., using an \\"s\\" that looks to us like an \\"f\\") may be \\"off-putting\\" to some readers, I personally don't think it's a big deal; Blackstone's principles and reasoning are of such interest that they are certainly worth a bit of reading effort."},{"Title":"Enterprise Zones: Critical Positions (Film Studies (Boulder, Colo.).)","review":"This is a book written by fans of the phenomena that is Star trek who also happen to be academics - or is it the other way round? Either way, what is offered here is a critical but affectionate study of some of the issues that many viewers and fans believe Star Trek to address most successfully - racism, sexism, colonialism and so on. What becomes apparent, however, on reading this book, is that basing one's critical approval of the series on an assumption that Gene Roddenbery's creation has got it right on each and every occasion is a position that is far from safe. The authors show that in more than one instance the Federation behaves in a manner as questionable as that of its purported enemies. This is especially the case with Star Trek's most powerful villains to date, the Borg (featured in the latest of the Star Trek movies \\"First Contact\\") whose aim to \\"raise the quality of life\\" is really no different from the Federation's aims, even if the methods employed are quite unalike. In other words, the Borg want everyone to be Borg and Federation Starfleet wants everyone to be (at least in attitude and outlook) human. To take another example, the Klingon Worf is praised by Captain Picard on a number of occasions, but only when his behaviour imitates that of this human crewmates; when Worf behaves like a Klingon (for example when he kills someone in a Klingon \\"rite of vengeance\\", an acceptable act in Klingon culture), he is reprimanded. These are valid observations, but sometimes the essays make connections which are more tenuous, such as the one which identifies the android Data with African-Americans in the present century. As a fan and an academic, I can appreciate what the authors of this collection are attempting to do. Whether the essays as a whole would be appreciated (in both senses of the word!) by those fans who are not accustomed to the language of the lecture theatre or text book is another matter, but I have no hesitation in saying that I found it rewarding, often fun and, despite the reservations I have already stated, it is a book to which I find myself turning again and again as I watch - perhaps too frequently - reruns of my favourite show."},{"Title":"Carrie Underwood (Blue Banner Biographies)","review":"This is an outstanding children's book geared to ages 7-12 not an adult fan book.

Coleman is probably the preeminent writer in the Battletech universe. Not only does he give fans what they want - plenty of rip-roaring BattleMech action out on the killing fields - he also ties the story he is telling into the big picture. The Republic is falling apart following the loss of interstellar communications, giving rise to increasingly deadly factional wars all across its ten Prefectures. Blood of the Isle takes us to Skye, an Inner Sphere world trying to withstand the merciless onslaught of the mighty Clan Jade Falcon. As this book opens, Skye has already withstood one attack and now lies vulnerable to the inevitable return of Jade Falcon's superior forces. The Highlanders, led by Tara Campbell, are greatly weakened, the Steel Wolves of the singular Anastasia Kerensky have disappeared, the Republic has sent along little more than one elderly paladin for support, and Duke Gregory Kelswa-Steiner's conflicts with his wayward son Jasek stand in the way of possible salvation. The aid of Jasek's Stormhammers comes at a political price the Duke will not pay, for his son does not share his loyalty to the Republic but instead advocates a return to House Steiner.The Jade Falcons are a deadly threat, as Chinggis Khan Malvina Hazen foregoes honor and clan tradition for total war and outright conquest. The previous invasion of Skye cost her an arm, a leg, and an eye - as well as her brother; the planet's conquest is something she now takes very personally, and her return is marked by unpredictable and very deadly vengeance on the people of Skye. Before the attack comes, however, Jasek Kelswa-Steiner makes his ignominious yet necessary return to the planet, bringing not only his Stormhammers but the Steel Wolves with him, along with plans for recruiting forces from the Lyran Commonwealth, a move that offers the enemies of his disapproving father a foothold in the Old Isle of Skye worlds. As you might expect, there is plenty of political intrigue buried at the core of this story, as the defense of Skye is a show marriage of convenience likely to enjoy a short and tumultuous honeymoon at best - but the questionable future will have to wait as the battle for Skye quickly heats up in a very big way.Battletech fans should be thrilled by all of the Mechwarrior action in these pages; the second half of the book features one fight after another, with BattleMechs going toe to toe as military tacticians try to outmaneuver each other's forces. Blood of the Isle goes a long way toward making up for a lack of battle action in some earlier Mechwarrior: Dark Age novels. At the same time, the political and military dealings going on among suspicious allies are brilliantly plotted, leaving room for questions that seemingly must be answered at some point down the line. It is hard to completely trust anyone in these trying times, as each faction inevitably has secret designs of its own vis-&agrave;-vis the Republic and its own local interests. It all makes for a wonderfully juicy tale of politics told against a backdrop of good, old-fashioned Mechwarrior action."},{"Title":"Mechwarrior: Dark Age #11: Blood of the Isle (A BattleTech Novel)","review":"this book is the first that I've read in this series. I've played all the mechwarrior games and this book really did not disappoint. It had some real shockers concerning the plot ( that I could've done without).

They approach the concept of God with a natural child-like faith, believing that God hears and answers their prayers, even when they ask for a puppy, and they get a kitten, instead. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. Everything about it will uplift your soul. This book is for anyone who needs a good laugh during their trials and tribulations. The children took a complicated God and made Him simple to understand. The author, Dick Van Dyke, may have written this book 30 years ago, but the comments in the Forward and the opening paragraphs to each new chapter still stand today. The book lets us know that it's not a corporate religion we should seek, but an individual, personal relationship with our Creator (as seen through the minds, eyes and tongues of children)."},{"Title":"Field Guide To The American Teenager: A Parent's Companion","review":"I like the style in which this book is written. Each chapter is self contained, i.e., you don't have to read earlier chapters for any other chapter to be useful. Thus, the book need not be read cover to cover if certain topics are not of interest to you. Each chapter deals with a specific topic such as drinking and driving, motivation, taking responsibility, date rape, eating disorders, etc. Each chapter starts of with a realistic scenario in which a problem dealt with by the chapter is set forth. Then, the authors discuss the general subject matter of the chapter in analytical terms. Finally, the discussion returns to the scenario and how the problems can best be dealt with and resolved.The scenarios include dialogues between a teen and friends, teachers, parents or others who would play a role in the situation set forth. The authors later analyze how well the subjects of the dialogues handled the situations in the scenario. The book is very readible and the advice is genarally good, albeit not always in the greatest depth. As a parent and a school board of education member, I find the book useful and recommend it."},{"Title":"Field Guide To The American Teenager: A Parent's Companion","review":"As the subtitle indicates, FIELD GUIDE TO THE AMERICAN TEENAGER is all about Appreciating the Teenager You Live With. That's a big concept: Appreciating the kid (not always an easy thing to do when you feel like you're at your wits end). Not dictating behavior or choosing career paths or keeping your kid from harm's way -- as if any of that were even possible by the time s/he's a teenager.Riera and DiPrisco make it clear that there is no way to 'follow-the-dots' and come up with pat answers to the difficult subjects they tackle. Instead, this beautifully written book presents teens in their natural habitats. Real situations are depicted -- ones that anyone can identify with -- but rather than attempting to proscribe behavior, Riera and DiPrisco discuss each topic and scenario in an insightful section called Notes Home that will surely help parents bring a new slant to their thinking. It definitely opened my mind to new approaches.I highly recommend this book to anyone with a teen -- or a soon-to-be teen. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Field Guide To The American Teenager: A Parent's Companion","review":"I work with teenagers and so it is extremely exciting for me when I find a book or people whose dedication, intelligence and true understanding of teens is obvious. I am very excited about this book ,as I am about allof Mike Riera's works.I don't know his co-authors work as well but what I have read here is very impressive. This book is important for parents and for teens because it is time we start listening to those who not only understand this transitional period of life but respect it. These authors do both and as a bonus they make it very easy and clear for us to understand as well. I really can't say enough about how exciting it is for me that there are books like these available for parents of teens. I am a parent of a 15 year old. I don't know what the future holds for us and would never pretend to think I got it all figured out. Far from the truth. BUT&lt; I do have great amazing moments with my son and he knows beyond a shadow of a doubt that he is respected and trusted. He has yet to betray that. It is an awesome feeling. Get the book. The respect they have for teens is contagious."},{"Title":"Field Guide To The American Teenager: A Parent's Companion","review":"Many books of this genre fall into the trap of either being too clinical or too cynical. Thankfully, Drs. DiPrisco and Riera provide us with a wonderfully accessible and beautifully crafted inquiry into the American teenager. Having been a teenager once, (if I still trust my memory) I find their insight trenchant. While I cannot claim complete objectivity--I defy anyone who has read either DiPrisco's poetry or Riera's earlier books on teens to remain impartial--I am thankful for their effort and think it a national prize."},{"Title":"Field Guide To The American Teenager: A Parent's Companion","review":"I work with at-risks teens and was looking forward to reading this book. If you're considering it -- don't bother. It simply contains 309 (including index) pages of safe generalizations.

My fear is that teens will use this book as a guide to manipulate their parents, teachers, and educators."},{"Title":"The Future of Executive Development","review":"Internationally recognized Executive Development Expert, James Bolt has edited one of the best collections to date on the trends and future of Executive Development. Drawing from his more than 25 years of experience in the field, Bolt and the contributors provide a wide ranging perspective on both the past and the future of executive development. The articles contributed by both top consultants and internal practitioners overview all of the leading areas in the field including simulations, coaching, action-oriented learning, peer to peer networks and also review such best practices as leader as teachers, building global talent bench strength, creating communities of practice and measuring impact. This is clearly one of the most informative and comprehensive books currently available. It is helpful for both the experienced practitioner and novice alike.While many collections of this type contain one similar example after another of corporate case studies and programs, Bolt's book provides a more critical view of some of these trends and the business rationale behind them. The chapters on experiential learning and on leaders as teachers for example, provide specific detail on various ways these approaches are used. Bolt and McGrath's chapter on Increasing Speed to Market for Executive Programs describes the innovative concept of Rapid Cycle Design as a method to build line involvement in leadership development and gain quicker and deeper buy in for an executive development effort. The chapter from leadership gurus Jay Conger and Robert Fulmer on succession provides some insights on the use of technology while critiquing competency models and 360 feedback. Also helpful and distinctive is the amount of focus on transferring, measuring and embedding learning in the organization. The chapter by Dulworth and Forcill on peer to peer networks provides success factors needed for these networks which are an often overlooked tool in developing leadership. In these and other chapters, Bolt and his contributors are challenging us to look beyond the typical executive development programs and to examine them in terms of how they connect to the future needs of our leaders and organizations.Overall, I recommend this book highly. It is broad and comprehensive in its overview of the field yet specific enough to offer practical ideas and takeaways. It does not push any one viewpoint and reflects well on the constructive inquiry that James Bolt has brought to this field for many years.David Giber, SVP, Linkage, Inc."},{"Title":"SLAYRIDE","review":"This really isn't up to Mr. Francis' usual high standards. The main character is an investigator for the Jockey Club, and that is pretty much all we learn about his character or motives. He is more a plot device than a living human being with whom one can empathize. The villains aren't particularly interesting either, nor any of the supporting characters. The story could have been more involving if the characters had been better drawn, but as it is, it drags. Francis is such a fine writer that nothing he has done is totally worthless -- but this book is only worth one reading, and one puts it aside with a sigh of regret that this very skillful author didn't have the time or inclination to give us a better race."},{"Title":"SLAYRIDE","review":"British Jockey Club investigator David Cleveland travels to Norway investigating the disappearance of British jockey Robert Sherman. It's presumed that he'd stolen the day's take from the racecourse and vanished. However, neither he nor the money has turned up, and some of the evidence doesn't quite fit together.Things get complicated fairly quickly, and instead of a straightforward case of theft, Cleveland finds himself with a murdered witness, and his own life in danger.If you like horses and horse racing, you'll probably enjoy this (and all of Dick Francis's books, for that matter) more than I did. In Slayride, there's a lot of detail about the Norwegian racing world, and how it differs from, say, the British.I enjoyed the logical unraveling of clues--my favorite type of mystery. At times, this made the book seem a bit plodding, as Cleveland followed false leads, but it also felt realistic.Best, though, was the twists and turns. The reader gets to experience them along with Cleveland--that is, they're not telegraphed or obvious... at least not to me.I tend to mildly enjoy Dick Francis's books, and Slayride was no exception. He does a good job of crafting a mystery, but I get bored with the horse stuff after a while. So he's an occasional read rather than an author I collect."},{"Title":"SLAYRIDE","review":"SLAY RIDE follows the normal Francis formula, but the life threatening assault on the hero, David Cleveland opens the story. This doesn't leave much time to develop the suspense that characterizes most Dick Francis novels. It was too easy to figure out \\"who-done-it\\", which spoils the fun, for the reader, of a mystery.The betrayal by a friend is sad, but plodding like a hard run race that didn't make it. But by all means read SLAY RIDE for the interest of knowing an author who stands head above the rest at a low point, it gives you insight into his power of storytelling.Nash Black, author of WRITING AS A SMALL BUSINESS and SINS OF THE FATHERS."},{"Title":"SLAYRIDE","review":"It had been a while since I had read anything from Dick Francis and I was in the mood for a mystery and saw Slay Ride at a used bookstore for $2.00.

Once I had myself acclimated, I enjoyed it a great deal, although I will say that I &quot;figured it out&quot; faster than I do some mysteries.What I liked, I think, was the slightly unique setting and the things about Northern European horse racing that I had not know before. I also thought the chracters were interesting and had some depth that is sometimes missing in Francis' books. There are some characters in this one that I have wondered about as you would with real people--what made them turn out this way? and what is going to happen to them afterwords?"},{"Title":"SLAYRIDE","review":"Dick Francis always teaches the reader something, and in Slay Ride we learn that there aren't many homebred jump jockeys in Norway. The population is small, with not enough racing going on. So English jockeys are often invited to ride in races.One of these jockeys, Bob Sherman, is accused of stealing the day's take at the vrevoll racetrack. He's disappeared with sixteen thousand kroner. Feeling somewhat embarrassed by the incident, the British Jockey Club sends its investigator, David Cleveland, to Norway to look into the matter.David is the usual appealing Dick Francis hero, but with charms all his own. At thirty-three, he barely looks twenty-five, so he gets no respect (at first) from the bigwigs. In fact, he's a skilled fact finder. He's trained himself to watch the movements of people's eyes, and even to sense slight disturbances in the atmosphere caused by fear or aggression in others. His carefully cultivated jungle instincts are destined to come in handy.David's inquiry into a fairly minor theft uncovers a much bigger game. So big that he has to deal with several attempts on his life.The cast includes some wacky characters. Like David's chauffeur, a left-wing Norwegian who drives like a maniac, his Great Dane calmly ensconced in the back seat. And then there's the paranoid Norwegian security guy who's always looking over his shoulder for attackers. And David's weird neighbor in London who can't bear noise. Women enter the picture, too, giving our hero a chance to have healthy male thoughts, politely controlled.I knocked this book down in a day, unable to stop reading.

The racing game is a lower key aspect than many of his books, but this is not a downside. All Dick Francis readers should enjoy."},{"Title":"SLAYRIDE","review":"Dick Francis is a unusual mystery writer in his repetition of setting instead of detective. All of his books revolve around the world of horse racing, in all its tangents. The unusual slice of this milieu explored in the book is Norwegian horse racing, though we see almost nothing of the racing itself, and instead are presented with the personalities that David Cleveland, our narrator and inspector, must interview in order to figure out Who Stole the Money and Who Killed the Jockey. The individual scenes, and particularly the verbal battles between Cleveland and the various jockeys, cops, breeders and insufferable owners are, as usual with Francis, the gems in this book. There is a larger spectrum of idiosyncratic characters, and the unusual Norwegian setting has apparently given Francis the freedom to open-up his characters to fairly extreme eccentricities, including a sex while dancing scene that was simply odd.The main characters in Francis' books may have different names, but they share many of the same characteristics. They are men connected to horse racing, but often tangentially, and they are intelligent, hard working, sober fellows with a good head on their shoulders. But what saves them from being insufferable bores is a sense of humor and modesty, characteristics much in evidence with David Cleveland."},{"Title":"SLAYRIDE","review":"Fortunately this wasn't my first Dick Francis novel so I knew better than to become discouraged by the substandard plot. Francis' characters are usually more likable than in this story. Even if the formula is a little predictable, following along is always enjoyable because the people involved are fun to watch. Friends betraying each other is a fortunately unpleasant rarity for Francis. The mystery also lacked the suspense and complexity of his other novels. Lastly, the setting, Norway, bored me as a back drop for this offering. Slay Ride is the only Dick Francis novel that, for me, has failed to please."},{"Title":"SLAYRIDE","review":"Dick Francis's main character is not a jockey in Slay Ride. The story takes place in Norway which is not really known for it's horse racing. I wondered if it would be a good read or just dropped in the basket for things that go to a second hand store.

At the risk of revealing too much, let's just say things are not as they appear.

Dean Christensen and have conducted our own investigation of Cordes Junction, Arizona that is on 1-l7, halfway between Pheonix and Flagstaff, Arizona.We sat at Don Daveports Market (928-632-7626) and gained much of our information, seeing that the psychic energies do intermingle and that the vast amount of land on the Orme Ranch is definitely similar to the Boynton Canyon psychic energy vortex, west of our city, that is only 35 south of Cordes Junction.We visited the Cordes Junction Chevron station and discovered highly evolved spirits that we believe are guardians of some sort for the communities of Cordes Lakes and Cordes Junction, that mix together.Most people have witnessed the spirit activity at the Cordes Junction Chevron (928-632-8558) and we believe they are from other dimensions of time and space.We envision the possiblity of what Sedona has developed, with hot air balllon rides, into the Aqua Fria region behind Cordes Junction, and jeep rides into the native American Indain ruins that Christesen writes about.We also concur that the researh done spiritually is accurate, and indepth, and that a 'boom' is about to begin, with new people moving in, new stores already being built, prior to our discovery, and ironically land is very inexpensive in this psychic energy vortex community in central Arizona. New business keep opening which shows the attraction that this book -- or the psychic energy vortex is pulling as people gravitate to this 'boomtown,' in central Arizona about 40 miles west of Prescott, Arizona."},{"Title":"Eli, Eli Lama Sabachtani","review":"This book is awesome, completely researched, and will change your mind drastically.

Names were also changed for protection against the Romans, which the author shows effectively.I purchased the book on subjecting myself to growth, and as I read and reread the passages I am truly growing, and hope you will experience the same, as a man finds his alter-ego in the deserts of central Arziona, and also inside a jail cell near Golgatha, just prior to the crucifixition.My question is: Why are men, women and children fighting in Israel when this book could be read quite easily in any language, in any nation, which is should be done now!"},{"Title":"Eli, Eli Lama Sabachtani","review":"There are alot of theories about the crucifixtion, but F.

Unfortunately, it is not a Cayce primer, but a mixture of thoughts that relats to St. John l4, l5, l6 and l7 and also what Cayce -- the remarkable psychic of his time, told people to study in Deutronomy 30 -- to know Thy God as thyself.In futuristic terms, one could not detect this if one did not know about Cayce, the thousands of psychic readings perormed by the man that could extract healing medication from a distance through atral projection of telepahty, that adds to the drama and intruigue of this book!I highly recommend it, and so do many others!"},{"Title":"Eli, Eli Lama Sabachtani","review":"This is pure spiritual and metaphsyical concepts that bring forth new light!Out in an Arizona desert, a man embrks on an epic jurney...not through, over land, space and time...As Murphey (Christensen's main Character) embarks on a spiritual journey (not religious with dogma) with him, thorugh the age of Christ, and the time of the cruxifiction. In the process, a new perspective on the life, and death of Jesus the Christ is revealed.Barbabos, Murphey's counter part, in a Roman incarntion explains the three brothers and sisters, uses support from Edgar Cayce's concept of the &quot;Kindgom of God is within,' and shows one how to obtain Christ Consiouness, making us all CoCreators with God!It is simple and easy to undertand. It is reality and not dogmatic doctrine, but a simplified approach to everyday living to know 'why God has forsaken you,' the title of the book!Merging ideas of Eastern religins, mysticism and philosphy with Western idelogies, Christensen probes our beliefs and consciouness in a unique and provociate manner.Chritensen mentions the psychic energy vortex of Cordes Junction, Arizona, and other places that are sure to put that section of the state of Arizona on the psychic energy vortex map, and makes a comparison to a negative energy vortex, the Bermuda Triangle, off the coast of Florida, following Cayce's and Plato's theories.I recommend that you pass this on with light, love and peace, to bring wha Christensen is trying to do, simply promote peace, whether it be peace within or world peace, that could rudes the tension of world affairs at the present time.Surely some Presidents and Leaders-- governors and polticians should be recommended to read this simple book with a simple message: peace.Peace be unto you!"},{"Title":"Eli, Eli Lama Sabachtani","review":"If the impact of this book has made a clearer understanding of what higher consciousness is, then Christensen's book should go quite rapidly, with translations that could affecting warring natioins, as it relates to religious battles.

I incorporated my experience as a psychic to outline a male psychic energy vortex, and vortexes that combine with the Boynton vortexes west of Sedona. They are here in Cordes Junction, which will become a similar city, such as Sedona. In comparison I did extensive research in the Antuqities by Josephus and found that historian to be an arrogang and pompous writer, who consulted psychics, to save his own life, as he please Rome and then slowly convervetered to Christaining.I did not want to offend anyone, and there were parts of the journey that became a nightmare, with edit and publisher concerns.A week after the book was placed on this site, I had my first offer to sale to the book, and I am hestant to do this at the present time.Being an astrologer and knowing we have to deal with Mercury retrogrades at least three times a year, there are dicisions to me made, as I write the seuqal to this book, called 'Cordes,' that has a more indepth approach to life and living on a positive psychic energy vortex, that correlats to a yin energy in Precott, Arizona.I took the historical approah to take myth and legend out of the book that was dubbed Eli, Eli, Llama Sabachtani.I knew in the process of sending items back and forth to the United Kingdom, that there could be difficulties, and there were.Sometimes a person's worst enemy becoes their best friend; and those that give us the worst problems are our best teachers!I set forth, after manay years, wondering if this book could generate peace, knowing that there were 'snippers and clippers' in our Christain Bible, and that's when the historical aspect took over, being a trend of many writers.I wanted the truth, and I wanted to express it with love, with peace, hoping that those that were to come in contact with this book would find their own inner harmony.If it happens, the book will generate itself, as God sees fit.Many hundred of words fell by the wayside.They had to as I made this a simplified, and fast reading approach to higher consciouness, with the spirit guides that worked with me on this book, and other books I also plan to publish.You don't feel different being an author. You know you have accomplished a mission, but seeing the final 'proofs' brough a tightening of my stomach.I also used much material that I have learned from Dr. Jonanth Paker, Quantum Qests, and 20 percent of all royalties of my books go to help eradicating diseases.Where do you want to sart, with me?I have also wondered if Presidents vote for themselves and know that a book has a greater impact that does a politician. The reason I stated this was because I gave myself a five star rating, because if I believe in me I beieve in my words, with this book dubbed Eli, Eli, Llama Sabchtani."},{"Title":"Eli, Eli Lama Sabachtani","review":"After reading the massive and extensive research, compiled so secretively, and significantly, I can see the value of this book being the best seller it will become. There's no doubt in my mind that Mr. Christensen of Cordes Junction is profound in metaphysics, spiritual at-one-ment, and hisotrical knowledge and counters any and all Hollywood extravangas. How about airing this one on a special documentary made for television? The ratings would be as high as five stars on this website!"},{"Title":"Eli, Eli Lama Sabachtani","review":"The warring factions of nations could benefit from reading this book, that has to be re-read more than once, to grasp the heights and depths that the author takes you to; showing you historical aspects of the life of Jesus the Christ, his brothers, his sister, and his mother and father, which will leave you in suspense, as Christensen outlines from much reserch that Jesus father was not Joseph!"},{"Title":"Eli, Eli Lama Sabachtani","review":"Eli, Eli, Llama Sabachtani is quite unique.

Dean Christensen has done is quite conviently put in the passages from the material dicatated by the famous prophet, seer and revelator, Edgar Cayce, who died in 1945, used historical reserach to produce a best seller, and show that reincatatiion is as accurate as the Second Council of Constantanoble took out of the Christin Bible in 553AD. If read, I am sure the Irish would stop fighting and go do their church and the Catholics in England would start going to their church and worship withthe fath and love presented by F. Dean Chritensen who was written this with love -- showing how to gain peace back and stop the manipulation of the Bible, and other forms of belief, to make churches the massive amounts of money they hold on to and gain on a daily basis.It's a best seller, in my opinion and hifgkt recommend to any reeader vsiting this site and my review."},{"Title":"Eli, Eli Lama Sabachtani","review":"I have read this book several times and like the character F.

He enlightens us on history and reserach and talks about the birthplace of Christainity in Europe, in a city called Trier, and also encounters many obstatacles as a Roman Legionaiire converting slowly to Christianity, helping the guard that was also converting to Christian, and gives a differnt acount of the cruxificitonI like Mr. Christensen's style as he outlines the myths and legends, and rhetorically names the brothers and one sister of Jesus.He outlines the 'snippers and clippers,' the monks and scribes that did the edit for the four settings of the first four books of the Nest Testament.Ironically, when Barbabos and Murphey come to the conclusion of who inserted &quot;wars and rumors&quot; of wars he hit the nail of the head, because that has become the belief system of many nations, kindreds and tongues who have attempted to manipulated portions of the Bible, until Christensen made his discovery with Josphus, the historian, who wrote to please the Romans who were at war, and Christensen points out that this famous historian consulted with psychics to save his life, as he compiled the Antiquties.It's great and I am sure you will enjoy this as much as I have as it races to the top of a best seller, which it probably is doing now."},{"Title":"Eli, Eli Lama Sabachtani","review":"Mr. Christensen seems to have brought some hidden material to light that is obviously occuring in the world today, with the US having it's problems with Church and State, and the world trying to overcome evil.

With the constroversery over reincarnation that use uses, which he claims was outined by the same church in 553 A.D. in the Second Council of Constantinople, delclarying karma and reincarnatin as hearsey, Chritensen also introduces concepts of discovery by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the (Mormons), who he states have said that the native American Indians are the proimed people, and with his twist and turn of adventure and probing the consciousness present that there were causians living with the native American Indains on this concept, prior to the discovery of America. He claims that the missing years could have been for learning by Jesus the Christs, highlights on the missing books of the Bible, and then makes a comparison of items that are 'yet to be revealed,' that he has done in this book, which is entitled Eli, Eli, Llama Sabachtani. Although Christensen states that no church can trace its true roots to the ministry of Jesus the Christ, he makes an unusual comparison of two of the wealthiest churches in the world, who continually have problems with their doctrine and gigantic means of using money to control the masses, but does not higlight on buying out the contaversy surrdounding the Roman Catholic Church, as it relates to allegations that are in the news each day. He also introduces James, the one brother of Jesus the Christ who has the major portion of the ministry, which is highly unusual, documenting with an arrangant historian by the name of Josephus, and showing that inconcistancies of some parts of the Bible.Is this through revelation or through channeling, which would be the same, and Ruth Montgemery has critiqed Dick Sutphen's writings, stating he has a 'walkin' and I wonder what the critque of another profilic writer in the metaphysical world, such a Montegomery, would bring forth with Christensen's profound an provocate book? Would one find this book in a Christain bookstore or the chain of bookstores owned by the Mormon Church, called Desrest Books? One has to ponder the aswer to that question!

Mr. Christensen also outlines that most of the teaching went to James, his brother, and Peter simply stood for and meant &quot;rock,&quot; leaving an absence of reality with the Roman Catholic Church.

It is so accurate, with a profound switch as Christensen approaches the depth of the crucifixtioin and it would be possible that this could bring world peace with the simple words Christensen has penned, using what Jesus the Christ said in the ninthhours, and it should put portions of central Arizona of the metphysical map, as was once done by another metaphysical writer, Dick Sutphen, who put Sedona, Arizona on the metaphysical map, with his outline of the five psychic energy vortexes there, that Christensen presents in the book, stating they are also in the Cordes Junction, Arizona area, and a large ranh and school, known as the Orme Ranch.

I also live in a place with a lot of Spanish around me. Therefore I didn't need to crawl through the basics. For my modest skills, this series of lessons moved at a suitable pace. After 10 or 12 lessons -- about an hour's worth -- I could string a few original sentences together in a pinch and I was starting to think in Spanish a little. I'm not doing it in a car so it is very noticable that the lessons build on a highway driving theme but you gotta start somewhere and highways are as good as any place. The pronunciations are academic, not like Spanish speakers really talk but isn't that always the way?"},{"Title":"Drive Time: Spanish (Cassette): Learn Spanish While You Drive (All-Audio Courses)","review":"This is James from James Spanish (the learning Spanish blog). Using audio courses while you drive is a great way to learn a language. The Drive Time series is presented completely on audio, with no accompanying textbook exercises to complete, so you can learn completely while behind the wheel. There is a handy reference book, however, which provides a written guide to everything covered in the audio course. As well as conversation, the CDs also cover some basic grammar, giving an all round understanding of the language.The CD audio course breaks in beginners gently, with easy and simple exercises to introduce new learners to the language and pronunciation before moving on to more complete lessons. In fact, the first CD in the course is called an \\"on ramp\\" and is specifically tailored to easing students into the learning experience before really moving on to the core material. This is a nice inclusion, and great for beginners or learners who have found themselves a bit intimidated by other courses that demand a high level of understanding from the get go. That said, the conversations are not translated every time, and a certain level of basic Spanish is expected in order for you to understand what is being said.The speed of speaking increases throughout the course too, naturally encouraging you to tune in to native speakers. For this reasons, this course is ideal for any student wanting to improve their conversational skills and comprehension. The course lessons steer clear of the repetition model used by many other courses, focusing instead on teaching you as you listen. One of the main complaints from Spanish students is that while they can understand the clearly spoken Spanish in their lessons, when they hear native speakers talking they get lost and cannot understand. This course deliberately avoids artificial speech patterns, making your ear tune in carefully to what is being said. The narrator speaks in a natural way, not pausing between words or over enunciating, so you can get used to listening to how native speakers talk.While you may want to pair this course with study materials that teach more vocabulary and grammar, this set of CDs is a great way to build on your conversational skills.In closing my review of this product, I'd like to share with you the three Amazon products that I have found most helpful in my pursuit to learn Spanish. If you are truly serious about achieving fluency, I'd recommend getting all 3 of them if you can afford it.1.Lights, Camera, Spanish (Book + DVD): Learn Conversational Spanish by Watching a Romantic AdventureThis is actually a 90 minute movie for Spanish-language learners. It gives the option to watch the movie with subtitles but I'd recommend not using them to improve your Spanish. This \\"movie\\" also includes a workbook so that you can reinforce the Spanish vocabulary words and phrases from the film. The workbook also has lots of exercises to keep you engaged in the film. But be prepared to hear Chilean accents. Although pleasent to the ear, the accents from Chile are very different from most Latin American accents.2.Verbarrator Version 1.1 (Windows Version)This software replaces the traditional verb conjugation books and makes learning how to conjugate Spanish verbs an interactive and fun activity. This should be a required resource for anyone who wants to improve their ability to conjugate Spanish verbs. Especially anyone who is challenged by the drudgery of learning how to conjugate Spanish verbs and who is looking for a new way to make learning how to conjugate Spanish verbs an easy and fun activity3.Diccionario esencial de la lengua espanola de la Real Academia Espanola (Spanish Edition)If you are really serious about speaking the language fluently, then at some point you will need to replace your Spanish-English dictionary and get a pure Spanish dictionary with both the vocabulary words and the definitions entirely in Spanish. I use this one only because it was highly-recommended by a friend from Spain who teaches Spanish. According to him, in academic circles in Spain as well as Latin America this Spanish dictionary is the standard."},{"Title":"Drive Time: Spanish (Cassette): Learn Spanish While You Drive (All-Audio Courses)","review":"Most people who reviewed this stating its great for beginners have probably only listened to the 1st CD. The first CD is a very steady and well paced introduction to Spanish. When I started the 2nd CD the pace of new words and spoken dialogue increases 10 fold. It give me no time to learn and rarely there is any repetition. The narrator changes between CD1 and CD2 and I have a feeling these CDs were designed as 2 different learning packages but for some reason other another were slapped together very last minute and sold as a single package. I have listened to the CD's while walking the Dog several times. I have picked up words and grammar but overall I dont think its a good package."},{"Title":"Drive Time: Spanish (Cassette): Learn Spanish While You Drive (All-Audio Courses)","review":"At first it was helpful.

I study Spanish a lot, but don't speak it, so I like to keep on trucking along getting a little Spanish in my ears each day. I purchased this because many reviews said this wasn't for beginners, but let me tell you, I am bored to tears listening to them explain that there are masculine and feminine words, that the word \\"the\\" is \\"el and la\\", and how to say the time. Even if you are a beginner, this would not be comprehensive enough on it's own, and you'd need classes or Rosetta Stone. Disappointingly, I am still on the search for more well-made audio programs. I would recommend Learn In Your Car Spanish, not too much beginner material there and it acts as a good refresher."},{"Title":"Drive Time: Spanish (Cassette): Learn Spanish While You Drive (All-Audio Courses)","review":"This is great if you are not a beginner learning Spanish. Starts slow but then the tempo of each lesson increases quickly. Love this concept of learn while you drive."},{"Title":"Drive Time: Spanish (Cassette): Learn Spanish While You Drive (All-Audio Courses)","review":"This is a great product for someone with previous Spanish experience. My only complaint is that it starts off too slow, then plummets into advanced with the second CD. I took two years of Spanish in college and have built up a decent lexicon, but even I had to listen to most lessons twice to understand exactly what the speakers were saying. After about the third CD, they stop breaking up the sentences for you to repeat, and I had a hard time remembering what they'd said about half-way through the sentence. But if you don't mind going over the lessons several times, this set will certainly build your conversational skills."},{"Title":"Drive Time: Spanish (Cassette): Learn Spanish While You Drive (All-Audio Courses)","review":"Love this CD. I am a student of the Spanish language. This CD makes me think--Appreciate the speedy service of Amazon. Dale"},{"Title":"Drive Time: Spanish (Cassette): Learn Spanish While You Drive (All-Audio Courses)","review":"Definitely great for people on the go or who just don't have time at home to devote to learning Spanish or taking a class. It can get a little fast sometimes and tends to throw a LOT of information at you in short amounts of time, so it's extremely important to have a native speaker with whom to practice what you learn to solidify it in memory. The only downside is the fact that many phrases, when they were recorded, were cut off just slightly at the beginning, so it's sometimes difficult to hear what the native speakers on the CD really said. This can make it extra challenging for someone with no Spanish background or who just wants to hear clearly what was said to be able to imitate. This is the main reason why it's so important to have a native speaker in real life to practice with. Overall very good product, though. I've learned a lot with it so far in just the first few weeks of owning it."},{"Title":"Drive Time: Spanish (Cassette): Learn Spanish While You Drive (All-Audio Courses)","review":"I found this is a good starter to restart your spanish practicing. It's not for beginners. They touch the very basics very quickly and well if you don't know how to play with the inflections and all the good differences between the languages, I could see someone getting lost easily. It's not a bad product. Only thing is the pauses to repeat or to think about what you have to say is too short and usually you're saying it as they repeat the answer you just said. Other than that, I am very happy with the purchase and I like how it's easy to use in the car. Beginners in the language beware!"},{"Title":"Drive Time: Spanish (Cassette): Learn Spanish While You Drive (All-Audio Courses)","review":"perhaps not advanced enough for someone who has some spanish but for the raw beginner this is a good one - drive listen and learn!"},{"Title":"Drive Time: Spanish (Cassette): Learn Spanish While You Drive (All-Audio Courses)","review":"Easy to follow even though I am an American.

After the first two or three sections, though, the pace picked up rapidly and I felt like Lucy in the candy factory. There was no way to keep up or comprehend what was being said, much less learn anything.After listening to the CD's over and over, some words were discernable and the small book helped as a reference. This CD should not be used, however, unless you are intermediate Spanish and need a refresher or more conversational experience."},{"Title":"Drive Time: Spanish (Cassette): Learn Spanish While You Drive (All-Audio Courses)","review":"I am starting spanish from ground zero. I knew how to count to ten, but that was all.I was very pleased as I worked my way through the 1st CD -- I really felt like I was learning. Feeling pretty stoked, I went on to the 2nd disc. Whoa! I was totally lost. The 1st disk is called the \\"on-ramp\\" before the lessons on discs 2 - 4.It really seemed to me that discs 2 - 4 might have been the concept for the package and somebody said, \\"this is too hard, let's add an introductory disk\\". The english-speaking narrator and the spanish speakers are different from from disk 1 to disk 2 as well, lending support to my theory. The main problem (after disk 1) is that they just start speaking spanish with very little repeating and I haven't a clue what they are saying.I haven't even listened to disks 3 & 4. I'm going to try another program."},{"Title":"Drive Time: Spanish (Cassette): Learn Spanish While You Drive (All-Audio Courses)","review":"Not very good sound quality and very difficult to understand.

Drive Time Spanish is one of the better versions for improving your Spanish that is available."},{"Title":"Drive Time: Spanish (Cassette): Learn Spanish While You Drive (All-Audio Courses)","review":"I bought this before I had read reviews on it because it was the cheapest cd's you could get.............more bang for the buck. After I read the reviews, I thought woe is me. Sounds like a waste of money to me! Much to my surprise, I really am using it. It's in my car of course, and I run the cd's over and over again. They seem a bit past me, but they are extremely helpful and well worth the little money that it is. My only complaint is that they don't give you much time to repeat occasionally. Plus sometimes they don't translate some of the conversations, expect you to know it I suppose. Still despite these complaints which may loom large to some, I find myself really getting a lot out of these cd's and recommend them to anyone from advanced beginners, intermediate to advanced. And the price is right!UPDATE I have since learned that it is necessary to use more than one program so now I have several programs and I use them all while driving around and going places."},{"Title":"Drive Time: Spanish (Cassette): Learn Spanish While You Drive (All-Audio Courses)","review":"Most students wish more \\"conversational\\" practice was included in the learning spanish products they buy. This is exactly what Drive Time Spanish gives you.Yes, the speakers talk to fast, and don't pronounce as cleary as you would like. But that's how it is in the real world.A very good product for those who have used \\"Learn In Your Car Spanish\\" or \\"Behind The Wheel Spanish\\" and would like to move on to conversational spanish."},{"Title":"Drive Time: Spanish (Cassette): Learn Spanish While You Drive (All-Audio Courses)","review":"This audio collection is a definite tool if you have had previous exposure to learning spanish. If you are a beginner with no experience in learning the lanuguage, this series probably moves too fast for you and is a little more difficult to comprehend. I had 4 years of spanish in high school but had a 4 year lull where I didn't study the language so I lost a lot. This CD set offered a quick reintroduction to the language on the first CD and then takes off into some of the grammar and a lot of dialogue. This is a very valuable tool in learning to feel comfortable speaking the language. I listen in the car on the way to work and back and have listened to each CD several times so it sticks in my brain. I would reccomend to anyone who has taken at least a year of spanish in the past and feels comfortable with the basics such as pronouns, simple phrases and some verbs."},{"Title":"Drive Time: Spanish (Cassette): Learn Spanish While You Drive (All-Audio Courses)","review":"the first cd was good, the second went to major grammer and was difficult to learn from. would not recommend this for beginners."},{"Title":"Drive Time: Spanish (Cassette): Learn Spanish While You Drive (All-Audio Courses)","review":"CD 1 starts off great!

I have friends with the NKJV Open Bible, and it's full of study notes, charts and maps. I wrongly assumed the only difference between this one and theirs would be the actual translation; I was wrong. The maps and charts are meager, there are ZERO study notes, and barely any cross references. There are perhaps 2-4 per each page. The only redeeming features are the book outlines, the topic index, and the visual survey of the Bible.I gave it 3 stars because the leather, binding and print are of good quality, but you'd be much better off buying the Matthew Henry Study Bible. The KJV Open Bible does not aid in Bible study; as a matter of fact, it hinders it."},{"Title":"Missing Tiger","review":"Author John Campo makes no bones about the fact that his protagonist Mr Bobby Turner is pretty much a version of his own tall hollow body jazz guitar playin' track bike racing self in his book \\"Missing Tiger\\".

She is able to dig deeply revealing the gripping ties that bind a family. She enters the inner recesses of the minds of the most eccentric and lonely characters. And she does it with such grace and precision. Her prose is pure poetry. But beyond all this, she brings something else to the task, something essential for a great novelist; wisdom. She writes with uncanny wisdom about the human heart and psyche. Dare I say reading this novel was a kind of religious experience. What a writer, what a book!"},{"Title":"Passing on","review":"Bit too much angst and not as much fun as Joanna Trollope. Good read, worth it but not at the top of my list."},{"Title":"Passing on","review":"Major life events, here the death of a dominating parent, often force us to reexamine the way we have led our lives. Lively creates two siblings who have never been true to themselves or even recognized what was true. When the mother who had through intimidation and criticism directed the lives of her children well into their maturity dies, the son and daughter are suddenly thrust in the role of directing their own lives. Before they can break out of living life by rote and habit, they must first truthfully face who they are after decades of directed patterns. This novel explores a universal theme and the major and minor characters she creates to make that life journey are at times engaging and at others frustrating. Worth a read and a thought."},{"Title":"Passing on","review":"This book was one of the most interesting I've ever read. Penelope Lively created two of the most interesting, yet pathetic characters in modern fiction. Both siblings Helen and Edward were destined to lives of social isolation from birth because of their controlling mother Dorothy. The story is gripping from the onset."},{"Title":"Passing on","review":"I realised about half way through this book that I had read it before (the first thing to really push my recognition buttons was a typically straw man attack on Creationists. I also remembered the technique she used of telling us early that one of her characters fiddled with their glasses when perplexed, and later just saying when they started fiddling). All the plot seems to happen in the last couple of chapters, whereas until that point we're just getting a picture of the main two characters. Our central character, Helen, is a 52 year old woman dealing with the death of her overbearing mother, who may have actually altered the whole course of her daughter's life by, for example, not handing on a potentially vital love letter Helen finds while sorting her mother's things. The issue for Helen is less whether things really would have been different if her mother hadn't have been involved than how much she is to blame for not taking a stand, for being too pliant.Lively is good, you get to like and respect Helen. A major theme is linking nature to our lives: how do we deal with the fact that we really are just beasts with intelligence? (The conclusion manages to have some hope in this bleak outlook: 'They saw that there is nothing to be done, but that something can be retrieved.') This is the assumption - obviously I deal with it differently to Lively. And I suppose I put a minus after the A because I think her insight, while profound in some areas, doesn't extend to respecting anyone with alternate views. The novel is a bit preachy (in a relatively subtle way - it's not the only concern of the book), and does unapologetically reduce several characters to mere goodies and baddies (eg. Ron Plaget, Helen's mother, Giles Carnaby, Susan Wilmot). She also is pushing a pretty tough barrow: she wants us to feel sympathy for Helen's 49 year old brother, a repressed homosexual who gropes the neighbour's 14 year old, and to utterly condemn, in contrast, anyone in society opposed to homosexuality - including the father of the 14 year old (set up for a fall, of course, an utterly immoral opportunist). The way she tells the story, we are sympathetic, but it is such a contrived 'moral' that makes its point but undermines the universality of the story.Plotwise, slow moving, sure, but a dynamite finish, with several things all happening at once, rather than conveniently pacing themselves throughout the drama. We reel with the characters with no time to wallow over major events as more major ones rudely jump in. The irony is thick as Helen's younger sister talks on about her daily crisis' assuming that her stick in the mud single older siblings will have had nothing to report - when actually they're going though much more that she probably will never give the chance to hear (shades of some conversations I've had with ' also reminds me of that ably presented scene in 'Pulp Fiction' where Bruce Willis' character, on the run from the mob, has to tread carefully around his girlfriend's potential tantrums about her nails or whatever).Like I said, she's good - but she should read some Hornby and see it's possible to present characters that differ but are both respectable. It does surprise me when people like Lively or Adam Spencer (JJJ presenter/mathamatician) do just write off anyone who believes that the complexity and beauty of nature suggest there is a God. Not just disagree, but vehemently abuse. Surely somewhere they've come across someone they respect who holds to this idea? Maybe they have but can't put the two together. Christians with half a brain have known and made it clear for ages that some very intelligent people are atheists. How about some atheists with half a brain making it clear that some very intelligent people are theists?"},{"Title":"Passing on","review":"Helen and Edward Glover have just buried their mother, Dorothy. Dorothy, the manipulative and domineering woman that she was, raised two meek children who did her bidding and one child, Suzanne who escaped her, but understood the life her siblings had led. Penelope Lively has once again written a wonderfully literate book of characters, showing their foibles, yet the allowing the mysteries of life to unfold in real drama.Helen and Edward live in a small town near the edge of Cotswold. Helen is 52 and a part-time librarian. Edward is 49 and a teacher at a girl's school. It appears that both of them have not made much of their life, under the eye of their mother who had a need to keep them under her thumb, while allowing them to think they were not worthy of much.They live in a large, unkempt home Greystones, and have a piece of land known as the Britches, which Edward keeps as an environmentally safe place. After their mother dies, she stays with them in picture and soul. It takes a while before either of them can talk about her. It is while Helen is cleaning her mother's room and then cleaning the entire house that she finds the &quot;nasty&quot; things her mother had done to keep her two children at home. In the meanwhile, Helen has blossomed and has become good friends their solicitor, Giles, She falls in love with this wily man and feels like a school girl again.Edward, in the meantime becomes more reserved and into himself. An incident occurs that rocks both of Helen's and Edward's lives. As it happens, Phil, their sister, Suzanne's son has moved in with them because he and his parents do not see eye to eye. Both Helen and Edward continue their daily life and seem to make a difference in Phil's life. Has Dorothy's death freed these two characters to pursue their own lives?Both Helen and Edward appear to be accepting what has been lost in their lives because of their mother and moving on to a new and better life. Their next door neighbor wants their land and will use every wily trick he can muster. Are Helen and Edward smart enough to rebuff this man? What would new found money do to their life? Penelope Lively has introduced us to two characters that move our hearts and souls. She has been able to develop their personalities to such a degree that we can begin to understand how Dorothy, the mother has taken over their very thought and desires. How to break free of this tragic creature?Can something be done, be retrieved of their lives. A poignant and personal look inside the minds and hearts of two people we come to care about. Penelope Lively has done it again! prisrob"},{"Title":"Passing on","review":"I am amazed that this book is out of print, because it is a very entertaining and readable novel by a writer who consistently provides a good read. I recently came upon an English paperback copy of it in an English-language bookstore in Paris, and I found it to be one of this writer's better novels. It concerns the lives of a sister and brother after the death of their old dragon of a mother, with whom they had been living for most of their lives (they are both middle-aged). There are problems with the house and some adjacent property, as well as problems in new and old relationships, and Helen, the sister and the main character, realizes that the mother was even more awful that she had thought, and painfully also comes to realize her own connivance in the mother's viciousness and in her attempt to keep Helen and her brother under her thumb (even after death). Helen is a likable and admirable character, and one gets a good sense of what modern life is like in an English village."},{"Title":"Passing on","review":"Only an author of Penelope Lively's talent could present a story of two diffident, almost invisibly shy middle-aged people and make the reader not only care about them, but care deeply.On the surface, nothing whatsoever happens in the very quiet country lives of Helen and Edward, a brother and sister caught in a time warp of old-fashioned Victorianism smack in the middle of the teeming 80s (when this book was written). Having lost their domineering old battle-axe of a mother as the book begins, both brother and sister are having trouble banishing her critical and strident voice from each of their minds.As they go about their days--Helen as a part-time librarian, Edward as a schoolteacher--the reader senses that something horrific is about to happen. The very stillness of their lives portends something awful. It is the genius of the author that can portray that feeling without in any way discussing it or warning the reader...it's just there.And when it happens, lives are shattered, and the reader simply must weep.This is a tour de force. A brilliant piece of writing. And something that cannot be put down and forgotten."},{"Title":"Passing on","review":"Reading this book broke my heart. And yet, when I finished it I turned back to page one and began again. The characters in this book are so complex and compelling, it was as if they were people who inhabit my day to day life. I recommend this book to anyone wishing to be haunted by perfect fiction."},{"Title":"Passing on","review":"Passing On was my introduction to Penelope Lively and now I'm looking for her other books to see if they're as good! Reading this novel was a much more pleasurable (and poignant) experience than any plot synopsis I could provide would indicate, so just try to get hold of a copy-and enjoy!"},{"Title":"Passing on","review":"As a rule I like Penelope Lively's style and would happily read anything she writes. On this occasion I have to admit I took a break from the muddling pace of Helen and Edward's story about half-way through (while I quickly devoured Martin Amis's Lionel Asbo - talk about a change of tempo!) but I did finish it, and I am glad that I did. Ms Lively's novels are hardly plot-driven pot-boilers, but this one just seemed too ponderous at times, especially early on as we get to know the painfully insular, emotionally cauterised, middle-aged brother and sister and the ways in which their vile, overbearing mother impacted on their lives. The novel gathers pace toward the very end, as it draws some conclusions that left this reader somewhat unsatisfied. Not my favourite Lively, but still a solid three and a half star read from a classy, eloquent novelist."},{"Title":"Passing on","review":"This is a story about a couple middle-aged children who survive the death of their difficult and manipulative mother. The characters really stand out in this novel, though you might not want to be them, you can recognize them. They are the people down the street when you were growing up who you didn't want to wind up like. Those down the street people, they had secrets, these people of Penelope Lively's do too. Reading this book is just like reading about real people, sad and pathetic people, but real nonetheless."},{"Title":"Passing on","review":"This book really affected me - it is one of the best novels I've read in years. Penelope Lively's sensitively rendered portrait of a brother and sister is heartfelt and heartbreaking. Two middle-aged siblings are haunted by the treatment of their late mother. And although this old lady is dead in the story, her presence is felt on every page - the legacy she left for her children by her own selfishness and corruption is incredible. I couldn't put this book down and I could definitely read it again."},{"Title":"Passing on","review":"Dear Helen and Edward. How frightfully English they are. With their self-effacing modesty and good manners. My heart sympathizes but my mind is impatient for them to get a life.Penelope LIvely is a most intelligent observer of human frailty and writes in a manner most engaging. I have now read three of her books in a row and can't get enough."},{"Title":"Passing on","review":"Passing On starts out with terrific characters, good conflict, and I enjoyed it immensely. But the end just sort of fades out--it was rather unsatisfying. Phantom mother just gets abandoned. Goth nephew just leaves. Ultra religious student with wealthy parent just goes off on vacation. Dreamboat lawyer just gets politely dismissed over the phone. Obnoxious neighbor just waves and walks away. Nasty little dog even just gets handled by other people.Maeve Binchy would have handled the resolution of these conflicts so much better. The first 3/4 of the book, I couldn't wait to 'pass it on' to my friend who has shared so many Binchy, Marcia Willett, and Rosamunde Pilcher novels with me. But after I finished it, I just slid it into the bookshelf, thinking \\"nah, not so good after all...\\""},{"Title":"Out of the Shadows: A rape victim examines her life in and out of Mormonism","review":"Mormonism permeates just about every aspect of a believer's life. Pam McCreary does an excellent job of relating, in a gripping and well written manner, what it is like to grow up in the Mormon church. She exposes the not so well hidden sexism that infects the church at all levels. And she describes how Mormonism requires its followers to sacrifice their individuality and uniqueness on its altar of obedience and conformity. She also poignantly tells how discovering the truth about the Mormon church fundamentally altered her life and forever changed her relationship with her parents, her spouse, and her friends.As a former Mormon, I found that much of Pam McCreary's life mirrored my own and that she has successfully battled many of the same demons that I have. I highly recommend this book for anyone who is and has struggled with being Mormon or anyone who has a spouse, close friend or relative undergoing such a struggle."},{"Title":"Out of the Shadows: A rape victim examines her life in and out of Mormonism","review":"A griping read. The author does an excellent job describing her life as a rape victim and bizarre intricacies of the Mormon religion"},{"Title":"The Practice of Medicinal Chemistry","review":"I want to buy this book. I am in Japan. Would you pls tell me how I can get this book."},{"Title":"Celestial Railroad and Other Stories","review":"This is a nice pocket book edition of some of Nathaniel Hawthorne's greatest short stories. It's just the right size to carry around in your back pocket to read whenever you're stuck somewhere waiting for whatever it is.Hawthorne, with his Puritan ancestry, was obsessed with the idea of sin and what human beings do to conceal them from the community at large. I guess, in a way, he was concerned with hypocrisy. Hawthorne believed in the Biblical saying that noone could cast the first stone against anyone else because we all have our secret sins. You can tell he has disgusted by the Puritan way of life because it allowed no confession and no reconciliation. Everything not up to their moral par, all their desire and passion, was pushed down into their subconscious where they rotted. Like William Blake says, &quot;Desire not acted upon, breeds a pestilance&quot;. The very act of suppressing desire makes it stronger.In the story &quot;The Birthmark&quot; a woman named Georgiana is the most beautiful woman in the world, except for a birthmark on her cheek in the shape of a red hand. Her husband fixates on this harmless mark, believing it to be the symbol of all that is evil in the world. So he tries to destroy it with all his scientific knowledge and destroys her along with it.In another story called &quot;Egotism&quot; a man is afflicted with a snake growing out of his bosom. It gives him the ability to see everyone's secret sins. &quot;The Minister's Black Veil&quot;, one of his most famous, concerns a community's obsession and ultimate horror of their village priest wearing a black veil. Why is he wearing it they ask? What horrible sin could he have committed to feel ashamed to show his face? All it is a thin veil of lace but all their evil comes out in the face of it. Ironically, the people that have awareness of the evil in themselves manifest physical symbols of them which themselves and others can see. Thereby excluding themselves from hypocrisy because their souls are on public display. &quot;Young Goodman Brown&quot; is also included here and is a nightmarish meeting with the Devil.Some of the more haunting stories that divert away from the Puritan psyche are &quot;Wakefield&quot; in which a husband one day walks out of his house and never goes back home. He lives close by his wife and passes by her in the street for decades but never approaches her. There is no rhyme or reason for doing this. In &quot;Dr. Heidegger's Experiment&quot; the fountain of youth is presented to some elderly guests with surprising results. &quot;The Ambitious Guest&quot; is a cautionary tale about seizing the day. &quot;The Maypole of Merry-Mount&quot; is a surreal tale of circus entertainers coming to found a colony in the new world and their inevitable confrontation with the Puritans.The only story in this book that I didn't like was &quot;The Celestial Railroad&quot;, strangely enough. It's an allegorical odyssey based on John Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress and if you've never read that work, like me, you will not get anything out of it.Hawthorne is a master of the short story. His strength is the ability to acknowledge that the evil in ourselves is undeniably existant but that only through admitting that existence can it be combatted. Lots of the characters in this collection destroy their lives with this admission. But at least they are true to themselves. If you enjoy this book, seek out The Scarlet Letter and The House of Seven Gables, or vice versa."},{"Title":"Celestial Railroad and Other Stories","review":"This book is a must have for the fan of Hawthorne. It has all the stories one needs to begin to understand the first real American master of prose fiction.The title story is one of the great pieces in response to the second great awakening in this country. The narrator telling us about his trip with Mr. Smooth-It-Away, and Apollyn and the other malevolent devils on the fast way to salvation make the book one of the true masterpieces of its time or any time. That the targets of ridicule, the real faithful are eventually saved, while all those linking their salvation to technology are damned is an important theme that is explored.The Minister's Black Veil is truly one of the works of genius of the 19th Century. The story about Father Mapple wearing his veil over his face is indeed one of the great self-introspective stories. And the story is so true when dealing with human nature.Rappaccini's Daughter is also a tale that weaves in the most sublime irony. What if the story you are reading is really about something else entirely? What if the love story you read is really the tale of jealousy and professional rivalry?Young Goodman Brown leaves his Faith at home to go wandering in the woods at night. I wonder what will happen? Let us note that the Devil will of course be present. And what happens to an idealistic young man when he sees all the sins and demonic deeds of his neighbors?Finally, I will talk about The Maypole of Merrymount. Three words come to mind in this tale: BIG JOHN ENDICOTT. The reaches of tolerance versus intolerance are brought to bear in this story. Nearly all your thinking on puritans are also brought together in this story. It is possible that among all the puritan writers who composed in the 17th Century, Hawthorne in his works manages to create the real cultural picture of puritan society in his stories written in the 19th."},{"Title":"The broken doll (A Father Shanley-Sammy Golden mystery)","review":"The prose is so poetic, the characters so interesting, and the stories - gritty and realistic as they are - so spiritually uplifting in the end. What a treasure to find his writings."},{"Title":"America's History","review":"I grew up reading political and military history; that's what I was taught in high school and college, for the most part. When I took over my school's Advanced Placement program in US History, I decided that while I could teach the traditional forms of history, such as politics and the wars, I simply didn't know enough social history. Given the fact that social history is the dominant form of history today (and realizing that there simply wasn't that much new to say about politics or wars), I turned to this masterful textbook. My students love this book: it's readable, entertaining, and thorough. I add in the political and military stuff, when it's needed. About the only major hole in the text is some short-changing of the Monroe Doctrine, which is the biggest error that I could see. Teachers have to choose textbooks that address their shortcomings; if you don't know your political or military history, choose another textbook. But if you have the same background I do (and most people over thirty do), then choose this one.

I merely submit two observations: 1) The growing evidence ranging from the anecdotal (Jay Leno) to the statistical that Americans under 40 are losing almost all of their historical heritage (aside from making us the laughing stock of the rest of the civilized world, I'm going to go out on a limb and suggest that this just might have unfortunate implications for our future as a global military and economic superpower sometime in the not-too-distant future); and2) The fact that the chapter on World War II contained in Henretta, 4th Ed., although thirty pages long, has just SEVEN PAGES on the actual war itself--and that covers all theaters and all belligerants from Blitzkrieg to Hiroshima (and even those pages are filled with large and small errors).

This book is much better than texts used in previous AP classes, it's divided much more effciently and orderly, in terms of taking notes this is the easiest thus far. However, the summer reading assignment of the first 5 chapeters is an exercises in futility. The short answer and essay questions we are tested on are rediculous. Do not waste time doing the reading. Find a friend who knows a guy who knows this place where you can get an outline of the book. These notes are the holy grail for AP students. I recomend you use these notes only for the summer reading; during the year, do the reading! This book is not a horrible one for class use and doing the reading is essential for the AP test in may.

I highly recommend this book written by one of the original pioneers of Science Fiction. It gives you an excellent glimpse into the mindset of post Word War II when everyone went to bed everynight wondering if the \\"Reds\\" would be dropping the atom bomb on them at any moment. I also found the idea, practice and implementation of Civil Defense interesting. Living in earthquake prone California, I beieve that Civil Defense is something that should be brought back with a vengence and taken seriously. Afterall, do you really want to sit around after a disaster and wait for the Government to show up and help you? Can anyone say \\"Katrina\\"? Great book that will provoke intelligent thinking. What more can you ask for?"},{"Title":"Tomorrow! (Popular Library, 60-2089)","review":"Several characters are followed through this fascinating novel, setting great groundwork for their experiences when nuclear war suddenly comes to America... and their city.Wylie wrote this at the time when it was JUST becoming possible for nuclear warheads to be delivered by missiles, so bombers and missiles both come into play. So does germ warfare. And the result is a horrendously realistic account of nuclear war as only such a masterful author and researcher as Philip Wylie could portray it. The TV movie, &quot;The Day After,&quot; came along decades later, and scared the wits out of many of its viewers... but that was a Sunday walk in the park compared to THIS story. THIS is the real deal, and when you set this book down, you'll find that it's a story you'll never forget.By the way, if you enjoy this, then you MUST track down a copy of Wylie's LATER nuclear war novel, &quot;Triumph,&quot; and decide for yourself whether or not he topped this earlier work. It's a toss-up!"},{"Title":"Tomorrow! (Popular Library, 60-2089)","review":"A moderately well written &quot;end of the world as we know it&quot; book. A great book gets me concerned about the well being of the characters but I just didn't get worked up about them. (Especially the kid who sometimes seemed more a device for exposition than a real child.) The action was good though and the underlying cold war &quot;duck and cover&quot; paranoia seeps through beautifully. Very good with minor flaws."},{"Title":"Tomorrow! (Popular Library, 60-2089)","review":"&quot;Tomorrow&quot; is a good book. However, I thought &quot;Triumph&quot; was a better read, despite being considerably darker. Still, this is worth reading, especially for those of us too young to know about &quot;civil defense&quot; drills firsthand.&quot;When Worlds Collide&quot; and &quot;After Worlds Collide&quot; are Wylie's best, and I'd recommend them above &quot;Tomorrow.&quot; If you can find them."},{"Title":"Tomorrow! (Popular Library, 60-2089)","review":"Some of the descriptions of destruction in &quot;Tomorrow&quot; read almost like the news reports of the World Trade Center tragedy in New York.Although we now know that the aftermath of a nuclear strike would be much worse than Wylie describes, one of the small points near the end of the book may have a greater significance than the author realized.After the destruction caused in the downtown area, one character comments about future workplaces. The premise was that since people would no longer want to work in the dense, high-rise buildings that were such an easy target, rebuilding would be done as numerous smaller, scattered buildings on the periphery of the city.Have we finally discovered what Wylie wrote 30 years ago: an impressive address - whether the WTC in New York or Peachtree Street in Atlanta - may have value only in its ability to attract unwanted attention and create a target?"},{"Title":"Tomorrow! (Popular Library, 60-2089)","review":"I first read this book as a fourth grader and it mesmerized me and horrified me both. Now, thirty years later, it's still powerful reading -- the narration of the actual nuclear attack is spellbinding. We know a great deal more about the effects of a nuclear war now -- for example, the book mentions fallout but it is not depicted as a major problem, and sadly things would be much, much worse in what's left of River City and Green Prairie than the book depicts. But considering how little even experts knew at the time, the book is terrifyingly accurate. It's also just a great read, and ranks with Frank's Alas, Babylon and Wylie's own Triumph (which is confoundedly hard to find!) as a classic of the Age of Anxiety."},{"Title":"Tomorrow! (Popular Library, 60-2089)","review":"I find Wylie a little variable in quality, but I liked this one. The characters were a little too stereotypical -- the valiant police lieutenant, the dedicated CD man, the fearless editor, the panicy population, etc., but it was still an entertaining read. There were some attitudes of the 50s here that didn't ring true today about african americans and communists, but it was tolerable.The dated part was that this was a &#34;survivable&#34; nuclear war due to the small number of bombs, the required delivery by aircraft, and the fact that the bombs were airbursts and so had less residual radioactivity. Presumably were we to have an actual nuclear war today (God forbid) it would be much worse. The implication in this book is that society can come back after such a conflict and even &#34;win&#34; the war. The interconnectedness of the markets and our industries today makes that suspect, as do missiles and ground bursts and higher yield weapons.When you compare this against &#34;Threads&#34; the British documentary, you can see that all the CD preparation in the world wouldn't really allow the CD officials in this book to survive the experience. Still it's interesting and very worth reading. I wish it were electronic and about $3.99 at most."},{"Title":"Tomorrow! (Popular Library, 60-2089)","review":"If you are a fan of apocalyptic fiction, there are many better books to read than this. While I did finish it, i found it slow moving (very slow), Pretentious in language, and very out of date in the effects of war. I think the real message was about the value of civil defense. An interesting point, but the author, writing in the mid-50's was talking about efftects of atomic bombings that are much milder than true. Totally unrealistic."},{"Title":"Bruiser (High Risk Books)","review":"Well, I'm pretty terrible at writing anything let alone reviews but I enjoyed this book quite a bit and definitely recommend it.I wasn't sure what to expect after seeing a favourable recommendation from Dennis Cooper on the back cover! It turned out to be a nice story about the relationship between an older English guy visiting the States who was sick of his job and wanted to travel around and a 17yo guy who'd been kicked out of home after having a hard time with his family (I'll let you discover the hilarious situation that unfolds here). They meet at a restaurant and things go from there. What I liked was how the story twisted and turned in all sorts of directions but still flowed really well. It portrayed their respective personality differences and life experiences realistically and held my interest all the way though - I ended up staying up into the early hours to finish it.

This book is one of the worst books I have read, and I am an avid reader! The story is simplistic, pointless and old. If you're interested in this type of story, I strongly suggest reading &quot;The Night Listener&quot; instead, if only to see what a master does with a similar storyline. I finished this book while on a New York subway, and the only reason I didn't deposit the book in the trash when I left the station was that I was afraid someone would pick it up and waste their time on it like I did. Sorry, Mr. House, but I really, really did not like your book!"},{"Title":"Bruiser (High Risk Books)","review":"This novel, describing the unlikely affair between a 42-year-old expatriate Englishman and an 18-year-old waiter/amateur boxer/occasional rent boy, came as a surprise. The pair meet in Chicago, where the older man, the narrator, is living in a seedy hotel while avoiding his obligation to his family business. One of the great rewards of this novel lies in the narrator's outsider view of American culture, surreal warts and all. (Especially good is the murderer-as-celebrity subplot later in the book.) Another reward is the complete credibility of their relationship: both men--any suggestion of pedophilia is just plain inaccurate--are outsiders for very different reasons; but as their friendship evolves, they begin to understand and care for each other.Though this book is ostensibly a road novel, and the destination is Brazil, most of the action takes place in Chicago and San Antonio; Texas, despite its mythically American significance to the narrator, appears as rainy, dark, muddy, bleak. It is here, though, that both men must reconcile their outsider identity with their need for each other. Their separate journeys and mutual arrival bring the novel's greatest reward: a happy (!) ending. In fact, the book ends with a brilliant, shimmering sunset. Recommended."},{"Title":"Bruiser (High Risk Books)","review":"&quot;Bruiser&quot; is the sort of book I usually hate but it was so well done I liked it in spite of myself. It is a love story, but very low key, told in that sort of flatfooted tone that some critics call &quot;K-Mart realism.&quot; It concerns a British importer living in Chicago who meets a young amateur boxer, who winds up living with him.The two men struggle through the necessary adaptations of living together such as conflicting schedules and HIV status. They plan (although &quot;plan&quot; is perhaps too firm a verb) a motor trip to South America but don't make it past Texas. The setting for the second half of the book is depressing but what redeems it is the obvious love the men feel for each other even though we never hear &quot;I love you.&quot;In other words, this book is so well told that we readers feel the two men's affection for each other and how it motivates their actions without string-pulling. As a Chicago resident, I can certainly say that the Chicago locales were well rendered. Overall &quot;Bruiser&quot; is a good job, and I look for further works from this author."},{"Title":"Bruiser (High Risk Books)","review":"Practically everything about this slim novel is fresh. Taking now fairly stale themes in gay fiction (older man/younger man, AIDS anxiety, the Englishman abroad, adventures on the road), House transforms them into something altogether mesmerizing with chiseled prose and twists of plot so convincing and immediate that one sometimes feels like he's reading a private journal. (The writing often reminded me of Denton Welch's journals and short stories.) The book manages to be erotic while avoiding the breathless ecstasies of much romantic writing--the characters are not angelically handsome, not every moment teeters on sexual sublimity, and House rarely relies on abstractions, preferring viscerally concrete details instead. The book is worldly wise, also, without lapsing into preachiness. The world House paints here is grim--full of brutality, abusive stupidity, fear, even criminality--and while doing nothing to contradict this bleak view of things, he also offers glimmers of grace--not divine grace, to be sure, but the musty, sometimes messy grace of human connectedness."},{"Title":"Bruiser (High Risk Books)","review":"House performs at least a couple of feats of magic with this novel. First of all he has written a love story in which neither character says, &quot;I love you&quot; to the other. Such declaration is unnecessary. The reader knows, through their actions, how Paul and Adrian feel about each other. Such is the true novelist's craft, to show rather than merely tell. Secondly, House has made effective use of present tense narration. I usually abhor this point of view for its pretensiousness, but this time it doesn't detract from the flow or interest of the story.House has taken what could easily become maudlin and made it moving and believable."},{"Title":"Bruiser (High Risk Books)","review":"Are sexual attraction and love distinct, and if they are, what is the relation between them? Richard House's novel is a powerful new addition to the vast literature dealing with these questions.In the central relationship between the teenager Adrian and the fortyish Englishman Harris, sexual attraction is born out of the need for love at Adrian's end, and deep love grows out of what for all appearances starts as intense sexual attraction at the Englishman's end. By the end, trust and a kind of domestic routine are established. The mood is throughout bleak and the surroundings are seedy, all the better highlighting the nobility and beauty of a human relationship fueled by love. Much of the book covers the pair's travels and one may object to the drab and largely predictable uniformity of the landscape. By the same token the dialogue between the two men is somewhat formulaic. But these are quibbles, the book stands on the insightful manner in which it follows the growth of love and attraction between human beings, and at this deep level it delivers."},{"Title":"Bruiser (High Risk Books)","review":"I fell in love with this book and don't know how I missed it when it was first published...I found it an intriguing story, realistically told, about coming to terms with possible HIV+ status, as well as the coming together of two completely different types whose backgrounds could not be more dissimilar. There was no sugary endings, the writing was lean and I enjoyed it immensely..."},{"Title":"Bruiser (High Risk Books)","review":"I was expecting a novel that had something to tell. I was hoping Adrian and Paul would find a happy medium somewhere but they just seem to settle for what is in front of them."},{"Title":"Bruiser (High Risk Books)","review":"I thought the idea of reading a novel is for entertainment and to be taken away from the present. This was like reading a reality show whereby the reader is watching day to day occurrances.. then - the ending is 'to be continued'. Perhaps I missed some deeper meaning in this story. Perhaps the author is writing this story on an existencial level that I don't get! Perhaps it is meant to be studied in an English class to find deeper meanings! However, I very much liked the tender and poignant relationship between the 2 characters. That part of the story was touching. I hoped it would last for both of them. They both seemed so fragile and vulnerable. But what was 'the story'?? We are following 2 lovers as they seek change, and new beginnings. The story is easy to read and flows nicely but if it wasn't for the occasional sex romp I wouldn't believe I was reading the book I ordered. I am glad it wasn't any longer.Then it ends with a weather report."},{"Title":"Bruiser (High Risk Books)","review":"This is an excellent exploration of the complexities and subtle tensions of a relationship between Paul, a middle-aged somewhat disillusioned expatriate and Adrian, a young vulnerable hustler and waiter. The story is set against a bleak landscape of middle America with its anonymous and drab motels and diners. If you want a neat and happy ending you will not find it here. But the tone is fundamentally optimistic, showing that two very different and unsettled people can find real comfort in each other. I look forward to reading the author's second book, Uninvited."},{"Title":"Bruiser (High Risk Books)","review":"I am tired beyond belief of the pederast story: older guy, young boy/man. It's been done, it's been done, it's been done. But I stumbled on this novel totally by accident, was desperate for something to read, and was surprised. Remarkably surprised. It starts with a stray dog being killed and no one wanting to deal with the carcass and ends with the two main characters adopting another stray puppy. In between, House really sets up an interesting story of unwanted people (strays?) more desperate for love than they realize. He touches on AIDS, but doesn't dwell on it which was perfect for this story. The title hints at the subtle (Harris) and horrendous (Adrian) ways men abuse each other when all they really want is affection. Neither character is stock and House offers no easy answers or happy endings. Instead the end of the story has Harris and Adrian still en route with their new puppy, taking a breather on a shining, white salt flat.Good stuff!"},{"Title":"Lives of Girls and Women","review":"This is a classic of women's fiction, one of my favorites of all time. A depiction of small-town life like Sherwood Anderson's, it makes the small-town mundane luminescent with meaning. I love the characters, especially Del and her mother, but all her characters live; her geniality and generosity and breadth of vision are truly Shakespearean. I think she's probably the greatest writer in English today."},{"Title":"Lives of Girls and Women","review":"Alice Munro is a master.

Excellent stuff."},{"Title":"Lives of Girls and Women","review":"Very well written. Not anti-men as others have claimed. An inspiring read especially for women. Please don't let the unfair bitterness of a couple keep you from it!"},{"Title":"Lives of Girls and Women","review":"I was disappointed in this book; my opinion is that Alice Munro should stick to short stories. The descriptions were good, and the insight into the thinking of the main character was interesting, but there was no plot development, just a description of this young girl's deprived life but told with a hope that her intellectual potential might bring about a change in her life. When that just falls flat, at the end of the book the reader is left with nothing in the way of productive insight or inspiration or any satisfying closure."},{"Title":"Lives of Girls and Women","review":"I agree with many of the other reviewers that the characters and the story were generally enjoyable to read. Though it did take me a bit to get invested into the book I found myself deeply involved with them, of course Del primarily, toward the end. The descriptions of Del's adventures and curiosity were tangible and brought back childhood memories and feelings. However, I expected a much different outcome; I expected this curious, intelligent, intellectual Del to develop into a different woman. I can't help but wonder if this book is popular among women who are looking for reassurance in their decision to follow relationships rather than personal ambitions (and maybe that is ok to a certain degree). Hate to sound cynical, but I was outraged at Del's decisions toward the end of the book and in my opinion she made some serious and more importantly, uncharacteristic decisions that really ruined the book for me and made me wonder how this is a major book for women. I couldn't tell if it was condoning her behavior or simply displaying it as the constricted and likely course for women of a time period and even to (I think) a lesser extent today. Still I think that Del's character in the last chapter was entirely too emotional and irrational given her previous actions and thoughts. I myself am in my mid-twenties and I know that life options for women now are not what they were for women in their 50s, 60s, even 40s today, so perhaps it is more relatable for those a little older, and maybe it is important that I've read it to gain a bit more understanding about where we've (women) have come from; but I'd hate for a young girl today to read it and think that she should emulate Del."},{"Title":"Lives of Girls and Women","review":"I hadn't read Munro prior to this \\"novel\\" loosely woven from a series of short pieces connected by sequence and character, but found this work delightful. I took the most pleasure in the texture of the prose. Sentences frequently contain, mostly conclude with, these interesting, nearly polar modifiers, so that they say the thing and it's opposite in rapid succession. And both are true in the way that ripened fruit contains within it its future rot. I'm encouraged to discover other Munro."},{"Title":"Lives of Girls and Women","review":"i just finished reading this novel for me literature class. it was a good novel for young women growing up today. even though the story took place in the '40's, girls are going through the same things today that Del Jorden went through"},{"Title":"Lives of Girls and Women","review":"This item was exactly as portrayed in Amazon seller notes.

Don't know what all the fuss is about - Munroe is overrated, although middle-aged women seem to enjoy her books."},{"Title":"Lives of Girls and Women","review":"Typical anti-male diatribe disguised as a work of literature. This was assigned reading for one of my college literature courses over twenty years ago, and the memory of the distaste I felt while reading it is still fresh in my mind. The symbolism and 'moral of the story' is heavy-handed and overtly obvious. I recommend avoiding it like the plague."},{"Title":"Lives of Girls and Women","review":"Maybe it was because this book was assigned to me to read by a college professor. Or maybe it was becasue I like more of an intreging story. I hated reading this book. I was slow and monotinous."},{"Title":"Lives of Girls and Women","review":"Alice Munro is truly the master of the short story. &quot;Lives of Girls and Women&quot; deserves to be on everyone's list of must-read books. Munro is an exceptionally talented writer, one who can take ordinary situations and turn them into something wonderful. Here, she presents a traditional coming of age story, then spices it up with her own unique brand of dry, subtle wit and a host of zany characters. In &quot;Lives,&quot; we follow Dell Jordan from childhood to young adulthood as she struggles with her identity in a small town in southern Ontario. Along the way, we meet many colorful characters, including Dell's Baptist boyfriend, her social outcast mother, a suicidal music teacher, and a lecherous friend of the family. &quot;Lives&quot; is more of a collection of short stories than a novel, but each story is like a puzzle piece. In the end, each piece fits together to create a massize jigsaw puzzle of Dell's life. I have read &quot;Lives&quot; three times, and it is one of my favorite books - addictive, humorous, and thoroughly enjoyable."},{"Title":"Lives of Girls and Women","review":"What an amazing book! This not merely a good book for middle-aged women, or good instruction for girls, or any such claptrap. To label Munro as good \\"women's lit\\" is demeaning to women and demeaning to \\"The Lives of Girls and Women.\\" (Plus it makes men who enjoy reading her a bit funny.) It's a great book! In any category!Munro is a master of characterization and narrative structure. Del's description of her mother, for example, reveals: (1) Del's feeling of discomfort at her own place within Jubilee's hierarchy and environment; Del wants to fit in, and her mother embodies the eccentric within her own self. (2) Del's mother's strengths, pulling herself from abject poverty, putting herself through school, starting her own business in conservative postwar rural Canada - this woman evokes our admiration, despite the disgust of our narrator. It's these multidimensional portraits that makes Munro so great - yes, a character (Del's mother) can earn our admiration, disgust, and pity all at once...Then in the building of conflict, Munro ALWAYS surprises us. Every scene is fresh, new, interesting, every culmination of conflict resolves in ways we would never expect. Take the time when Del was being molested by her mother's boarder's boyfriend. One day she goes off with him in his car out to the country, and we're expecting some \\"Bastard Out of Carolina\\" child-raping exploitation and subsequent weepy victim hood. But Munro makes a left at the light, has the man simply masturbate in front of the child, who for her part is excited, charmed, and repelled by the sight and is grateful to be introduced to the mystery of the penis.And lastly, Munro refuses to depict her women in the same, old tired way. Her women are not dragged around by the hand by handsome strangers, as they so often are in movies. Her women are not victims of rape, incest, or peer pressure, as in way too many contemporary novels. No, Munro's women are real. They have drive, ambition, and a deep desire to be seen as people.Definitely one of my favorite books, ever."},{"Title":"Lives of Girls and Women","review":"I was forced to read this book during the final exams for my H.S.C. but actually found that it was very enjoyable. It is the touching story of a young girl growing up in Canada in the 40s, who yearns to be an artist, and her journey towards womanhood. The format of the story is unique and the characters are likeable and real enough to believe in. This is a well-told semi-autobiographical novel which stays in the memory long after it's has been read."},{"Title":"Lives of Girls and Women","review":"I couldn't possibly say all I want to say about how good this book is. I am Alice Munro's biggest fan and this is my favorite of her books. Many of her later stories are larger in scope, more ambitious in their reach, but this book is truly a gem. Get lost in Del's world. Munro creates a lush, astounding, painfully, gorgeously real world. Read this book and then read it again. And give it to every one of your friends."},{"Title":"Lives of Girls and Women","review":"One of the most insightful and remarkable short story writers living today, Alice Munro's stories are like events, rich, beautiful and knowing. &quot;Lives of Girls&quot; traces the life of one girl into womanhood, supplying a blueprint, in many ways, of how to write a short story. Munro is a master, and this work is one (of many moments) of her at her greatest."},{"Title":"Lives of Girls and Women","review":"I first read this book when I was 15, for an high school english class, and have returned to it many times since. Munro is a deceptively simple writer whose style is subtle, witty, and rings of truth. After many reads, I still find something new each time I pick Lives of Girls and Women up. Another Munro favorite: The Beggar Maid. Fantastic writing and use of the short story form."},{"Title":"Lives of Girls and Women","review":"I think I saw on youtube, that some religious schools banned this novel. Man those guys are easily offended! I think actually this novel is quite innocent. I mean it's just a little girl who honestly seek some answers to her existential questions in the established religions in her town. Then when she grows a little older she naturally becomes interested in the question of sex, and explore that. What could be more natural and innocent?! I think Alice Munro's voice is charming and entertaining. Especially the part where her school performs an operetta is catching and memorable.There is a very strong scene in the end of the novel, which actually the whole of the novel centers around. This scene takes place in the Wawanash river when Del Jordan is bathing with her truck driver boyfriend Garnet French. In my opinion Alice Munro in that scene carves out an eternal and everlasting moment in the history of litterature. To me the scene is perhaps not so much about religion specifically, but more about human society in general.As with some great artists, there is something superior and untouchable about Alice Munro. For a rather plain person like me, this strange stuff, is a source of recurrent intellectual itchiness, because I will properly never be able to touch it, define it and put it in a box.Is the books Ontario town, Jubilee, perhaps inspired by her experiences in the Ontario town, Wingham?"},{"Title":"Lives of Girls and Women","review":"This is the first book I've read by Alice Munro, and I've found it to be really impressive, and I'm definitely going to seek out other writing. She's undoubtedly good.Munro's coming-of-age story resonates with a real sense of truth and has important things to say about the experience of women during the 40s. The main character is torn between her own passions and intelligence, and the guide of her likeable oddbod intellectual mother, and the conventional house-wife role that her best friend Naomi so vigorously adopts. It's an age-old predicament of most heroines - her inner sensibilites vs. what is commonly acceptable - but its wry observations and emotive language sets the novel apart. Munro's frank approach to sex is also refreshing."},{"Title":"Lives of Girls and Women","review":"The jacket describes LIVES OF GIRLS AND WOMEN as Alice Munro's only novel. But this is misleading, since the book's seven chapters read more like a sequence of the short stories for which Munro is justly famous, and the whole seems more like an autobiographical memoir than a fictional narrative. The setting is the small town of Jubilee in Southern Ontario, not so different from Alice Munro's own birthplace of Wingham. Like Munro herself, the narrator, Del Jordan, is the daughter of a fox fur farmer, and is of a similar age, passing through adolescence in the 1940s. Each chapter focuses on a different year in Del's life, from fourth grade through high-school graduation. She is a normal girl from modest surroundings, and her experiences are by no means unique. Yet she has a mother who, for all her eccentricities, believes in ideas and education; it soon becomes clear that Del (like the author) is destined to break clear of the limitations of these surroundings and become a writer.Munro's writing is straightforward and evocative, but it relies on small realizations rather than big events, so the book may seem dull at first. It began to take wing for me with the fourth chapter, \\"Age of Faith,\\" describing Del as a young teenager becoming interested in religion. \\"Changes and Ceremonies,\\" the next section, is about the school musical and what appears to be a budding romance between the producer and the school music teacher -- a touching story set off by the gentle sadness of its ending. In the final two chapters, \\"Lives of Girls and Women\\" and \\"Baptizing,\\" romance is no longer something that Del observes from the outside, but a force that she must fit into her own view of herself, as she struggles with the changes in her body, confusing emotions, and the effect she has on men. One result of Munro casting the story as fiction is to enable her to treat Del's sexual discoveries much more frankly than she might have felt free to do in an autobiography. Temporarily derailed by love, Del's plans do not work out entirely as she had hoped, yet there is no doubt where she is heading in the end.Just as Alice Munro has used her birthplace as a source of wisdom without allowing herself to be confined by it, so Del Jordan leaves home only to return in spirit. A touching epilogue shows her looking back at Jubilee, consciously altering its details for the sake of her fiction, yet poignantly aware of the life there that she cannot capture on the page. It is a surprisingly postmodern device for 1971, but it gives this charming hybrid a context that has one foot in art and the other in everyday reality."},{"Title":"Lives of Girls and Women","review":"Alice Munro is widely known as a short-story writer. However, in her career there supposedly be a novel: \\"Lives of Girls and Women\\", first published in 1971. In one of her rare interviews - to \\"The NY Times\\" in the 1980s - she says that to her view this book is more a series of interconnected stories than a novel per se. It is not because she says so, but anyone familiar of the structure of a regular novel is able to know that this is not really one of them.There are elements that belong to the novel dynamics - the same narrator, the same group of characters and so on - but, then again, they could belong to short stories either. As a matter of fact, each of the \`chapter' of \\"Lives of Girls and Women\\" ends in itself. In other words, each of them has a beginning, middle, and an end. However, it is not the vital to decided whether this book is a novel or a collection of short stories. Either one will not change how brilliant it is.The second book published by Alice Munro, this is one of her best accomplished works as a whole. Her posterior collections have some of her best short stories ever - but as a whole they do not keep the same level. However in this one, none of the chapters is better or worse than the following one.Throughout a 40-year career, Alice Munro has established herself as one of the most important writers currently working. Her stories deal with ordinary people, whose lives would not be supposedly interesting. But, in her pages, this lives become unforgettable.In \\"Lives of Girls and Women\\" we follow the upbringing of a girl in rural Canada - this could be an autobiographical book, but it is not the point to discover it. We accompany Del Jordan since her childhood until her days as a young woman expecting to go to the university and chance the pattern in her family's life.\\"Lives of Girls and Women\\" are, after all, a book about changing times. At some point, Del's mother notices that \`there is a change coming I think in the lives of girls and women'. More than thirty years after its first publishing, the book proves that those changes came to stay."},{"Title":"Bringing the Heat","review":"Let me preface this review with a few things:1. I am 21, and grew up in Hawaii, over 2,000 miles from the nearest NFL franchise. I grew up with no team allegiance, and barely followed the league at all. Come every February, even through high school, the teams in the Super Bowl were foreign to me.2. I became a semi-dedicated Eagles fan over the past four years, while I was at school in Philadelphia, where it's hard to live without being infected by the city's fervor for and and obsession over their most prized team (despite the fact that the Phillies are now more of a winner). After a youth spent somehow avoiding profession sports fan-dom, I now follow everything except Nascar.That being said, this was an excellent, borderline must-read book for those interested in the Eagles, those interested in the NFL, or those interested in professional sports, period. It does not surpass, but rather approaches, the golden standard of all sports writing, Halberstam's \\"Breaks of the Game.\\"Bowden captures an excellent vignette of the league and a team in a state of transition; furthermore, I'd go as far to say that he captures the neuroses of the modern professional athlete. From top to bottom, the Eagles during this season were a cast of varied and compelling characters, as Bowden admits in the afterword. From the spacey and self-consumed Cunningham to the angry and intense Joyner and Waters, to the jovial and comparably sane O-line. While some came from middle-class childhoods (in the case of Randall, a youth filled with fame), many came from dirt poor childhoods in the rural South -- Bowden does a good, comprehensive job of examining these player's stories and how they have shaped the men they are today. In the current day, with tortured characters like Michael Vick, Bringing the Heat illuminates the fundamentally different lives many of these men have lead from a conventional person, and Bowden pays careful attention to the consequences that the money they are awarded has on their lives and minds.Perhaps most enlightening are Bowden's significant words about then-owner Norman Braman, who no doubt bears resemblance to many current owners with his meddlesome and uninformed opinions. A significant portion of the book is dedicated to Braman's and the Eagles' front office dealing with pending contract situations for many of the players, detailing the arcane and unfair pre-free agency system employed by the NFL -- and, in particular for tight end Keith Jackson and defensive end Reggie White, illustrating the beginnings of the NFL's true free agency era.Even though I was 4 when this book was in the process of being written, I was thoroughly surprised and amused by many names that I recognized, like Mike Golic, now a radio host on ESPN Radio, and Buddy Ryan, father to (formerly Baltimore Ravens) Jets coach Rex Ryan, who seems to ape his father's defense-centric mindset.Bowden is always mindful of the bigger picture of football in America, whether its the racial prejudices that influence the demographics at each position on the field, or the uneasy informal truce struck by those that play the game (coaches, players) and those that seek to capitalize on the game (owners, press). While in some cases, his analysis may seem obvious and unnecessary, often Bowden educates you on something you may never have suspected existed.My minor complaints with this outstanding book:- Simply put -- it's sprawling. Bowden rightly chose a season that seemed to have everything -- off-field tragedy, front office strife, a disconnect between the offensive and defensive teams, larger sweeping changes in the NFL -- and a team that seemed to have every type of personality. In his effort to catalogue everything, the book sometimes feels like it's lost focus, and you'll be stuck in some player's backstory forever. Bowden exaggerates this effect by bookending his story with the Eagles' first round playoff game against the Saints -- for me, even though I enjoyed the 20 or so chapters in between, it seemed like it took forever to find out what happened in the second half. It KILLED me.- Unless you really want the Kindle edition, I suggest you avoid it. The picture section lacks contrast, and is probably much better in print, and, unlike some books that read in the Kindle's default text, this one is more of a scan quality. In one more memorable instance, an H somehow got bisected, with an entire line being dedicated to the first half of the H and the rest of the letter on the next line, with the rest of the sentence.- Bowden's a much better writer than he lets on in this book. Somewhere along the line while writing this, he was infected with this weird disease that forced him to write colloquially, reverting into second-person at an alarming frequency while explaining the larger dynamics of American football and NFL culture. It doesn't detract from the reading experience, but I found it annoying and somewhat unnecessary."},{"Title":"Bringing the Heat","review":"There are many elements of Mark Bowden's superb book to admire: the wide-angle view of what makes a professional sports franchise; the detailed and completely fair portrayals of larger-than-life personalities who toiled on the field, on the sidelines, and in the management suites for the Philadelphia Eagles; and the sense of momentum that really brought me into the maelstorm that an NFL season turns into (and made me root for the Eagles even though I have never had any allegiance to them--I'm a Dolphins fan for life!).But I think the best thing about this book is the way it produces a dazzling picture of the NFL right before it underwent the most profound change in its history: the arrival of widespread, unrestricted free agency and the end of dynasties (well, to some extent, ask New England about that one!). And no team in 1992 embodied the steps between the old and new ways of pro football than Philadelpha did. They had risen to very good heights under Buddy Ryan, yet Ryan's era ended with no playoff wins. They had one of the most dominating defenses in NFL history during the 1991 season, yet didn't make the playoffs that year in large part because star QB Randall Cunningham's knee was demolished in the season opener. And in the 1992 offseason, Pro Bowl DT Jerome Brown was killed in an auto accident. Jerome's death became a catalyst for his teammates to finally break through and reach the Super Bowl, alongside the knowledge that future Hall of Fame DE Reggie White (RIP) would not remain with the Eagles after the 1992 season--a point driven home when an Eagle player became a precedent-setting free agent early in the season and signed with Miami (honestly prevailing, I was thrilled to have TE Keith Jackson join my beloved 'Phins).So this book is about a team that was very good. Yet it's also about a team that fell short and knew exactly what it meant to get that close without getting a cigar or a Vince Lombardi Trophy. This book doesn't note that during the years when the heart of the '92 Eagles were at their peak (1989-1992), four of the most dominant teams in NFL history were all from the NFC and all won Super Bowls. That would be beneath one of the best sports book I have ever read, a work that's funny and horrifying, focused and colorful, and a must-read for anyone who loves football in the present day--and knows how that game came to be. 5 stars/5 stars."},{"Title":"Bringing the Heat","review":"Mark Bowden(Killing Pablo, Blackhawk Down, Guests of the Ayatollaho)writes a vivid portrayal of the 1992 season of the Philadelphia Eagles..Bowden is always a reporter who digs and digs for the inside info...any football fan would love this book as it takes you inside the goings on of owner, coach and player....the 1992 season was an especially tumultous one for the Philadelphia Eagles..Buddy Ryan, Richie Kotite, owner Norman Braman, Randall Cunningham, Reggie White, Seth Joyner, Wes Hopkins..you find that the egos, relationships in the locker room and jealousies of the players sometimes override the will to win..."},{"Title":"Bringing the Heat","review":"I grew up in Philly during the days of Buddy Ball.

Thanks for the great trip Andy!!"},{"Title":"Bringing the Heat","review":"Mark Bowden's Bringing the Heat is a tremendously compelling look at the Philadelphia Eagles team that he covered from 1990-92. To describe those years as tumultuous would be a vast understatement with this volatile team. Mark Bowden leaves no stone unturned in this epic saga of a team that ultimately failed in it's quest to be the best. It is actually an embarrassment of riches because of the wide variety of topics Mr. Bowden touches upon from the advent of free agency, in depth personality profiles and even a smidge of soap opera theatrics in the widespread adultery of players with chippies dubbed Sis-Boom-Bimboes. As a great fan of the Mike and Mike Show on ESPN Radio, I particularly enjoyed his coverage of the garrulous Golic's beginnings on local TV. There is really a lot for the football fan in this tour de force gridiron odyssey. I have only mentioned a few topics, highly recommended."},{"Title":"Bringing the Heat","review":"A MUST READ for any Eagles and/or football fan!If you call yourself a Philadelphia Eagle Fan and haven't read this incredible work by famed \\"Black Hawk Down\\" author Mark Bowden, you should probably switch loyalty over to the Dallas Cowboys or Washington Redskins.Although extraordinarily long for a sports story, by the time you finish \\"Bringing The Heat\\" you're wishing it was a allegory of 20 books each covering a decade of Eagles football. Every page...every story...every life...every success and failure are laid out and developed so well, I was literally on the edge of my seat the whole way through. Reading this book takes you into the minds and hearts of professional athletes unlike any other sports book I've read besides Andre Agassi's \\"Open,\\" and that was a personal account.Mark Bowden's exceptional ability to relay ANY story...fiction, reference, political, military, legal, law enforcement, or athletic...are simply beyond compare. He is a \\"Writer's Writer\\" of the first order, and this is one of his best!"},{"Title":"Bringing the Heat","review":"You don't have to be an Eagles fan to enjoy this book, but it certainly helps. Mark Bowden (also author of Black Hawk Down, Finders Keepers, and Killing Pablo) captures life behind the scenes of the 1992 Philadelphia Eagles. It was a heartbreaking season in a long series of heartbreaking seasons that make up the Eagles. If you liked Friday Night Lights, Playmakers, Any Given Sunday, you'll see how much truth are contained in those stories which are scripted from the real players as shown here.Buddy Ryan's famed 46 defense, Reggie White, Jerome Brown, Randall Cunningham - ancient history as far as football goes. Bowden gives bios of almost every player, mega quotes, assessment of skills and weaknesses. No one is spared, coaches, owner Norman Braman, the media, fans, and of course, the players.The book has an odd style to it, skipping back and forth from past to present. It begins during a playoff game, goes back, forward, which can make it tough to follow if you're used to a chronological telling of a tale. But that does make it more exciting - like the game, you're never quite sure what's going to happen.Bowden really does have a knack for story telling. I have enjoyed the three books of his that I've read - I am sure there are technical aspects of the game that may not be 100% correct, but for the average fan like me, this is fine. This book is a glimpse into the locker room, the gridiron, and most revealing, the players themselves. Great reading for Iggles fans, it's also interesting to see that the names and dates have changed for the Philadelphia Eagles, but the results have been the same- roller coaster highs and lows, unfulfilled expectations and disappointments."},{"Title":"Bringing the Heat","review":"If you've read the title of this review, you're probably wondering which of the Philadelphia Eagles' disappointing seasons I'm referring to, as there have been MANY since the teams' last championship in 1960. This book details the 1992 season, one of the most highly anticipated ever for this team. On offense, All-Pro QB Randall Cunningham was returning from injury, RB Herschel Walker had been signed to lead the rushing attack, and WR Fred Barnett was about to enter the finest season of his young career. On defense, the team was coping with the death of Jerome Brown, and the returning stars (Reggie White, Clyde Simmons, Seth Joyner, Eric Allen) were expected to repeat their tremendous performance from 1991. To the delight of ravenous Eagles fans, it started out beautifully, with a 4-0 record and a trashing of the Dallas Cowboys on Monday Night Football. The following week brought a loss at Kansas City, and from there on, the regular season did not play out as hoped. Still, the team made the playoffs and finally shook the monkey from its back, beating New Orleans on the road in the Wildcard game. After 3 playoff losses under Buddy Ryan in recent memory, this looked to be the turning point. The team had promised to win the Super Bowl in Jerome's memory, and was off to a good start. However, the following week brought a crushing loss to the hated Cowboys, where both the offense and defense were lifeless. The off-season brought many changes and spelled the end for Buddy's Boys, who clung to his attitudes even after his firing and replacement with Richie Kotite.Author Mark Bowden followed the team for the Philadelphia Inquirer from 1990-92, and had a front-row seat for all the theatrics. He does an excellent job diving into the specifics on players and coaches, devoting the first half of the book to character profiles and a great illustration of Jerome's final days. The narrative on the 1992 regular season kicks in thereafter, with excellent views on how attitudes and expectations swung wildly throughout. Hardcore fans of the team will recall the anguish they experienced as hopes faded.Absolutely a must-read for Buddy or Kotite-era Eagles fans, and highly recommended for fans in other cities where the NFL is king."},{"Title":"Bringing the Heat","review":"Mark Bowden provides his readers with a glimpse into the chess match that is played out on any given Sunday in the NFL. Bowden lets us into the lives of the very elite athletes who have the ability to reach the ultimate level of pro sports; their endless preparation from grade school through college and onto the pros. Weekly film study, practice, game planning and analysis of opponents tendencies is religiously embraced by those in the &quot;pigskin temple&quot; just to gain the extra step needed to obtain victory. After you read this book you will never watch a pro football game the same again. A must read for Eagles fans."},{"Title":"Bringing the Heat","review":"Bringing The Heat is a gridiron epic: a robust 500-page chronicle of the Philadelphia Eagles' tumultuous 1992 season that lifts the lid on the pressure cooker environment of an NFL team desperate for a final shot at the Super Bowl, even as its internal conflicts surpass those unfolding upon the field. Haunted by the death of talismanic defensive tackle Jerome Brown, the team struggles to heal the locker-room rift between its league-leading defense and a misfiring offense led by talented but erratic quarterback Randall Cunningham. It must also contend with the expectations of a team owner and a sports-mad metropolis desperate for a championship to dispel its citywide inferiority complex. Former Philadelphia Enquirer reporter Bowden compares gridiron football to a religion in the devotion it demands from coaches and players, and explores the disconcerting consequences such dedication brings. These include the unpredictable effects upon young black males as they are thrust - sometimes from abject poverty - into a world of wealth but also unrelenting media scrutiny. His attention as well to the saddening regularity of players' marital infidelities portray familial breakdown to be, for some, an inevitable feature of a pro football career. Panoramic in its perspective (the advent of free agency that threatens to dismantle the talented Eagles), intimately personal in its detail (the venomous rage of linebacker Seth Joyner: the extravagant idiosyncrasies of Cunningham), Bringing The Heat is both an absorbing and colorful character-driven tale and a serious and incisive social commentary upon the phenomenon of professional sports in America."},{"Title":"Bringing the Heat","review":"As a diehard Eagles fan, I absolutely loved this book. The Eagles of this era may have had the most talent and personality of any recent team. Incredible insight into the players and coaches - their personalities, their infighting, everything. Definitely a gossipy work, but that's what makes it awesome. Any NFL fan would love this book. It definitely helps the reader appreciate the absolute zoo of playing in the National Football League."},{"Title":"Bringing the Heat","review":"Mark caputures a team I remember in my youth with remarkable detail. Awesome insights. Remarkable profiles of players and coaches. You grow up with them, go on the field with them, and go home with them. I highly recommend this book. Only critism is sometimes the in game detail is overbearing and detailed. This book made me realize one thing that is often overlooked: athletes are humans."},{"Title":"Bringing the Heat","review":"Well, if you're an Eagles fan, you're tortured enough already, the season being documented was blown back in the early nineties, so at least you can lay off the Peptobismol. But if you're a sports-writing fan of any description, then this is an essential book. The success of \\"Black Hawk Down\\" both as a book and a movie, had its precedent in Mark Bowden's earlier work. \\"Bringing the Heat\\" utilizes the same dramatic, combative writing style, and moves fluidly through every phase of football, from wives to girlfriends, the press, the fans, the fans booing Santa, offense, defense... every conceivable angle and personal quirk is analyzed. Mr. Bowden is a remarkable judge of character and manages to summate a lifetime in a few paragraphs, a trait of character in a line, and the entire conundrum that is the Philadelphia Eagles in a mere 500 pages."},{"Title":"Bringing the Heat","review":"I've been an Eagles fan since 1970, and I still think the 1992 team had the most potential, possibly surpassing the 1979-80 Vermeil teams. This book gave me the inside scoop on that (disappointing) season, and also detailed the seeds that led to this team's collapse in the second half of the season, where they started 7-2 and finished 7-9.I rate it as &quot;mostly&quot; accurate because of little things like the Eagles playing the Phoenix Patriots. (I read the first edition, maybe that error was fixed in a later edition.)"},{"Title":"Bringing the Heat","review":"Mark Bowden's account of the events leading up to and including the Philadelphia Eagles 1992 season provides a behind-the-scenes look at NFL football. Bowden details what the sports page does not--extramarital affairs, bitter feuds between teammates, and player resentment towards a seemingly &quot;greedy&quot; owner. It is not all gossip though. Bowden offers a detailed look at the (often challenging) childhood of players, the &quot;sluice&quot; which filters out players through the numerous levels of organized football, and the repercussions of the death of star defensive tackle Jerome Brown. Mixed in between the colorful stories is a detailed look at the 1992 season: a season that began with realistic Super Bowl predictions yet ended with another playoff defeat to the dreaded Cowboys. This is not just a book for Eagles fans. It is a book for fans that want to know what life in the NFL is &quot;really&quot; like."},{"Title":"Bringing the Heat","review":"Bowden follows the Philadelphia Eagles during the 1992quest for the Super Bowl. Stories and histories ofindividual players, coaches and management are woven into atapestry illustrating the world of the NFL from theperspective of the people who put the show on. While thebook is a must-read for any Eagles fan; it is certainlya great book for any person interested in the NFL circus."},{"Title":"Bringing the Heat","review":"This is a great read. Mark Bowden does a great job of bringing you up close with the famed Philly Eagles team that was touted to win it all. It's one of those books that keeps you interested and is hard to put down. Sports fan or not, this is a worth the time to get the behind the scenes story on a team that should have been a NFL dynasty."},{"Title":"Lottie's New Beach Towel (Lottie's World)","review":"In her afterward, author Petra Mathers informs us, in part, \\"...Looking back, I think Lottie's World on Crook Road in Oysterville has always been there. Finally, one day, the fog lifted and I could see it all clearly...\\" She later states, \\"Things happen whether I'm there or not, and I don't want you to miss anything.\\" That could be taken as a cute invitation to children to engage their imaginations with her, along the lines of Shel Silverstein's, \\"If You are a Dreamer,\\" intro to \\"Where the Sidewalk Ends.\\" On the other hand, it could also be taken as a window into our author's psychotic process. That would be the more cynical interpretation, but after reading \\"Lottie's New Beach Towel,\\" I'm really inclined to believe the latter. There is a surreal, dreamy disorganization to this book. The action starts with Lottie, the chicken, squeezing lemons when a beach towel arrives from her aunt. Soon she at the beach, hopping from her towel to the cooler, to the towel, to the cooler (the sands hot), and ultimately into the cool water. She mistakes her own chicken-foot for a starfish. So far, good stuff. Her buddy Herbie shows up on a boat. A couple half pages of choppy action and- with a call of \\"Hard to lee,\\" which I imagine means something, they are stranded on an Island. Suddenly they are in the middle of a wedding. At this point, I was a tad befuddled. I thought I had been skipping pages. But after a nice ceremony and party, they find their way home and Lottie, bloated from excessive wedding cake, writes a thank you note to her aunt for the towel.I don't know, I'm not really knocking the book. My daughter loved it, it's sort of cute and interesting. But it just made my mind spin a little, it was like Fellini directed an episode of Felix the Cat. It made me wonder whether Mathers is a genius writing a kid's book that was over my head or if her wiring is a little on the loose side and she's learned to channel her associations into mildly entertaining dreamy stories.But thumbs up. It passes the important test in my home (\\"Read it again Daddy\\"), and the illustrations are quirky-quaint-cool."},{"Title":"Lottie's New Beach Towel (Lottie's World)","review":"I am a children's librarian, and I find this book to be extremely charming.

Still, every summer we bring out Lottie's New Beach Towel to the family room coffee table so we can enjoy and re-appreciate the wry humor and simple, colorful illustrations on every page. It's the best of summer in a book."},{"Title":"Lottie's New Beach Towel (Lottie's World)","review":"The illustrations are just wonderful in this book and so is the story. If you love the beach, you will definitely enjoy this. Lottie uses her beach towel in a variety of ways, to walk on when the beach is hot, as a sail when Herbie's boat stops running, as a bridal veil. And it is great that Lottie writes a thank-you note to her Aunt Mattie for the towel. The text is simple to read, but it is slightly more &quot;grown-up&quot; in nature compared to other childrens books we have. Nonetheless, since we are avid readers, my three year old loves it and we also have &quot;Lottie's New Friend&quot;."},{"Title":"Lottie's New Beach Towel (Lottie's World)","review":"My 16-month old daughter LOVES this book and the cute illustrations - grandma has been &quot;forced&quot; to read it over and over and it has kept her attention.

It is a useful tool to develop applications in fuzzy control. Otherwise this one presents a basic introduction to neural network, furthermore the theory about neural-fuzzy and fuzzy-neural is presented in basic form. The book contains a large number of examples about all items and Matlab software is used in many of they. I would catalog this book in medium level of deepening. Topics about fuzzy control are tried deeper than neuro-fuzzy, fuzzy-neural topics."},{"Title":"A First Course in Fuzzy and Neural Control","review":"Fascinating reading. I had trouble putting it down at times, which is a lot to be said for a text book! Although I had lots of experience with classical control methods I hadn't studied neural or fuzzy systems before. I found the book gave me an excellent introduction to the topics in a highly readable format and yet also gave me the details mathematics required to be able to be able to program fuzzy and neural systems myself. It also had examples using the Matlab toolboxes which was useful."},{"Title":"A First Course in Fuzzy and Neural Control","review":"A First Course in Fuzzy and Neural Control provide a great introduction to fuzzy and neural systems, giving enough level of detail when needed and without missing the point that it is intended for an introductory course. The book provides a well-balanced lecture going from key concepts of classical control theory to soft-computing control techniques. This is definitely a \\"must have\\" book in any personal library of anyone interested in the study and development of bio-inspired technologies. From academic point of view, A First Course in Fuzzy and Neural Control is the ideal text book for introductory courses on the subject that will be the source of inspiration for the students to get motivated to explore the fascinating world of soft-computing and bio-inspired technologies."},{"Title":"Representative Men; Seven Lectures","review":"this is one of my favorite Emerson works. It opens itself up to so much, talking about his theories of influence, precursing everything from queer theory and gender transitivity to Harold Bloom, and it is a poem, too. It's beautiful. It offers his thoughts on the most diverse materials, gets into the most detail on his Hindu readings, gets very brave in \\"Swedenborg.\\" But ... for a 165-page book? Delbanco's intro is boring and useless. Don't even READ it before you read the book. It'll be like watching an educational video on yeast infections before watching a porno. The index is a kind of neat feature; it's cool to see how many men are mentioned how many times. For example, the most obvious 'omission' in the book, JESUS, is mentioned only 5 times in the book, but he lurks throughout in so many ways. I love the book, but think the edition is a huge ripoff. However, it is difficult to find all these essays in one volume without buying a \\"complete works\\" or something, and they are ALL good and work together as a complete 'book,' one essay building off the prior in subject and time, going from B.C. to the nineteenth century, from Plato to Napoleon and Goethe."},{"Title":"Representative Men; Seven Lectures","review":"Great men are those who inspire new great men into being. So Emerson understood in his seven portraits of human greatness.

The world is upheld by the veracity of good men: they make the earth wholesome. They who lived with them found life glad and nutritious..... We call our children and our lands by their names.

I was vaguely aware of Wilson's life and work, but after reading this book I feel as if I knew the man personally. Well-done, mostly fair, very human -- I cried more than once."},{"Title":"When the Cheering Stopped: The Last Years of Woodrow Wilson","review":"The strange thing about reading history books written before one was born (in this case 1964) is that that biases are all different. This book laments the collapse of the League of Nations and Woodrow Wilson. Ten years later, no one would dare write about American intervention in the world stage in quite so laudatory tones. Issues that bother modern historians such as the unconstitutional incarceration of Eugene Debs, race riots, Wilson's racism including anti-German hysteria, the Imperialism of the other League Nations as well as the anti-sedition laws get swept under the rug.Despite the bias, this is an amazingly personal look at a man who tried to sell a great plan to the United States only to be disappointed by Congress and the American people. It discusses his illness, his lack of willingness to compromise, his ineffectiveness as a leader. It also goes into great details about his wife's role in keeping the administration afloat, although it portrays her as a vindictive shrew. There's some interesting information about his daughters (true to WASP fasion, one of his daughters tried on several strange religions before taking off to India and dying of dysentry in the 40s).While some of the material is lacking (see first paragraph) and while the enemies of America's involvement in the League are portrayed in a rather sinister fashion, this is still an excellent read and introduction to the post-WWI history."},{"Title":"When the Cheering Stopped: The Last Years of Woodrow Wilson","review":"As the other reviewers noted, When The Cheering Stopped is an excellent telling of the last years of Woodrow Wilson essentially from the time he went to Paris for the World War I peace negotiations until his death in 1924. Those were years of marked decline for Wilson as he suffered a major political setback with the Senate's rejection of the League of Nations and a major health setback in the form of a series of embolisms that eventually led to his death. In many ways, the book suggests that they are related.Although the book certainly treats Wilson as a great president, towering intellect, and good person, it is a little less sympathetic than other reviews may lead you to believe. The book certainly understands that, overall, the situation that developed in the last year of Wilson's presidency where he could barely function was not good for the country. Vice President Marshall and the Congress obviously should have acted more forcefully to get the president to resign or even impeach him if necessary. Partly as a result of Wilson, there is now a mechanism in the 25th Amendment to deal with an invalid president. The book does suggest Wilson had a little more functionality, at least in fleeting moments, in his final years than other sources have led me to believe. The book also condemns Wilson's second wife, Edith, by demonstrating that her vindictiveness for certain individuals such as British Ambassador Lord Grey, Franklin Roosevelt, and Joseph Tumulty made a bad situation worse. Although you have to admire her love and loyalty to her husband, her way of expressing it led to erratic behavior from the White House.The last third of the book is about Wilson's post-presidency, told with more detail than I thought possible. Wilson's health recovered a bit and Americans, at least in DC, expressed appreciation by applauding him at shows and lining the street to see him. This gives a somewhat happier ending to a sad, almost delusional decline by Wilson (he kept dreaming of a third term for example)."},{"Title":"When the Cheering Stopped: The Last Years of Woodrow Wilson","review":"I've been deeply interested in Wilson ever since reading this book at age 16. Nearly forty years later, it remains one of my favorites.

I recommend the book to anyone who enjoys historical biography."},{"Title":"When the Cheering Stopped: The Last Years of Woodrow Wilson","review":"WHEN THE CHEERING STOPPEDThe last years of Woodrow WilsonReviewed by Carolyn B. LeonardThis oldie-but-goodie laments the collapse of the League of Nations and then-president Woodrow Wilson. The message is especially timely during this presidential election year.Wilson defeated two former US presidents, Theodore Roosevelt and William Howard Taft, to win his first election in 1912 as the twenty-eighth president of the United States. Wilson used tariff, currency and anti-trust laws to prime the pump and get the economy working in 1913. He spent 1914 through 1916 trying to keep America out of the war in Europe. However by mid 1917 in his second term, this president saw war as unavoidable. He announced the country was entering the \\"war to end all wars.\\" During 1818 and 1819 he worked tirelessly to promote his peace plan and was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. However, the Senate never ratified and the nation never joined the League.After the war ended, in the hot September of 1919 the president, his second wife, his doctor and his secretary stumped the nation by rail to stir up support for the League of Nations. President Wilson, then past sixty and in his second term, was exhausted by World War I and his struggle to get the United States into his treaty of peace. Yet, he firmly believed that without the US in the League, there would soon be another even more critical World War. By seven votes, the treaty failed in the Senate. The President, against the warnings of his doctor, made a national tour to gain public support - 8,000 miles in 22 days. From Washington to California his train paused at every whistle stop for an appearance and then back east again as his voice grew steadily more hoarse. No microphones or loudspeakers were available and it was important to Wilson for the people to hear what he had to say.Suddenly in Wichita, Kansas, his trip was cancelled -- just before his scheduled appearance in Oklahoma City 26 September 1919. Only his intimates knew why.The stroke was so debilitating that for seventeen months the President never saw ANYONE except his doctor, and no one was allowed to see him, especially not a photographer, reporter, anyone from the public or even his cabinet members and friends. No details, no explanations.His wife, Edith Galt, (with only a second grade education) took charge of all correspondence and actions/reactions to his cabinet. She would send their requests back each day with a note (in her 2nd grade scribble) saying, \\"the president says ....\\" To this day, no one knows if the president ever saw any of the requests or if Mrs. Wilson made all the decisions. (Perhaps she was actually the first woman president?) The Wilsons detested Vice President Thomas R. Marshall and never briefed him on the situation, so he took no part in the government actions and was never advised he was only a heartbeat away from the top office. The doctor never expected the president to survive. The American public was never allowed to know the severity of the situation. Even Wilson's secretary of state, Joe Tumulty, was banned.Still the country survived.The next administration - Warren G. Harding - was filled with graft, theivery, misappropriation of government funds, scandals such as the Teapot Dome. Harding is seen as one of the worst presidents in American History. His early death probably saved him from impeachment over the many scandals of his administration.and yet our country survived. There is hope, no matter who wins this election!Wilson's illness later led to the passing of the Twenty-fifth amendment establishing procedures both for filling a vacancy in the office of the Vice President as well as responding to Presidential disabilities.ABOUT THE AUTHOR GENE SMITH - He presented Mrs. Edith Harding as a shrew and a vindictive person although an extremely loyal and devoted wife. I loved the ending, though the author may have drawn it out a bit too much. The sorrow of seeing Wilson as a broken, haggard, bitter and defeated man was rewarded with Smith's revelation of the crowds starting to gather in front of his home, finally recognizing him as one of the great leaders of his time. This is cheering to anyone who has ever felt the sting of defeat.Go here to read my other Book Reviews and see the cover of the book:http://www.carolynbleonard.com/CarolynBLeonard/Books.html"},{"Title":"When the Cheering Stopped: The Last Years of Woodrow Wilson","review":"Ever since I was a child and read those teal biographies of the 50's, I have been a fan of President Woodrow Wilson. In the 50's I was proud of myself for reading a big person's book and I learned alot about Wilson. He was just like I was at the time, a Scot and a Presbyterian. Reading this recent book has enhanced my belief that although flawed, his Presidency was one of the best and most controversial of all time. The League of Nations is what did him in as he suffered a major stroke and his Presidency was filled by his wife. After reading this book I still have a very good opinion of the President and think that he should be in the top 10 of all time.

How much did Mrs. Wilson run the country? Smith believes quite a bit, though that belief has been disputed by others. Smith also contends that Wilson's failure to secure a yes vote from Congress to join the League of Nations is what finally did him in; most would agree with her on this.

Woodrow Wilson really has an amazing story. Guess one could say that he was so far ahead of this time in terms of foreign affairs. This is just an amazing book."},{"Title":"When the Cheering Stopped: The Last Years of Woodrow Wilson","review":"\\"When The Cheering Stopped\\" presents the fascinating conclusion of Woodrow Wilson's career and life. Beginning with brief backgrounds of Wilson and his second wife, Edith Galt, the bulk of the book is the story of the Versailles Peace Conference, the fight for the League of Nations and Wilson's stroke and period as an invalid. Much of this work covers the tragic seventeen month period during which presidential leadership and action were lacking from the American scene.After the death of his first wife, Ellen, Wilson took less than a year to meet and marry Edith Galt, a widow who immediately captured his affections. Their courtship was the stuff of rumors, but, rejecting advice that the wedding be deferred until after the 1916 elections, they married in December 1915.With the coming of the Armistice, the Wilsons traveled to Europe for the Peace Conference. Greeted by the public as a savior, Wilson found the heads of government to be less deferential. Wilson found himself in tough negotiations during which he achieved successes and suffered defeats. His overriding desire for the League of Nations forced him to compromise on other issues in order to bring home the Covenant of the League.Upon his return to Washington, Wilson found strong Senate opposition to the League. The ensuing battle over reservations to the Peace Treaty and the Covenant drove the President to take his case to the people in a coast to coast train journey during which he strove to rally support for his proposals.As the trip progressed, the long hours, heat and travel took their toll. On September 25, 1919, Wilson lost his place and broke into tears during a speech in Pueblo, Colorado. The next day at Wichita, Kansas, the President was found to be suffering from paralysis. Finally his physician and the First Lady took control and ordered the train back to Washington where he suffered a stroke in the White House on October 2.From the time of his stroke, the Wilson presidency was effectively over, even though his administration lingered on through the rest of his days. The President remained hidden in the White House under the care of the First Lady. Public business went unattended save those matters that Edith chose to submit to Woodrow or, perhaps, respond to on her own. Rumors ran rampant: he was dead, insane, or suffering from venereal disease contracted in France, just to name a few. In fact, he was paralyzed on the left side while his mind was a shadow of what it had been.During the time of his invalidity, Cabinet officers and Congressional leaders discussed whether the Vice-President, Thomas Marshall, should assume the powers of the presidency due to the President's inability to serve. Marshall refused. When meetings with Wilson were demanded, he and Edith always managed to make a good enough presentation to forestall efforts to remove him from office.It is often claimed that Edith Wilson was the first woman president through control of her husband during his illness. Author Gene Smith makes the case that she was motivated, not by a lust for power, but a loving passion to protect her husband from the stresses which brought him down and which could kill him. Regardless of the effect on the Republic, Edith successfully achieved her goal. Her husband lived.Wilson never seemed to grasp the severity of his condition. Despite his obvious inability to discharge the duties of his office, he began to talk of a third term in which to fight for the League. When the Democratic Party deflated those dreams, he saw the 1920 elections as a referendum on the League. A referendum it was, with the League opponents garnering an overwhelming win. Wilson then retired in Washington where he lived out almost three years of almost irrelevant existence.Gene Smith is to be congratulated for an excellently crafted exposition of the longest period of presidential disability in our nation's history. This is not a complete biography of Woodrow Wilson, but it is the story of the most significant part of his life. Although more information about Wilson's health has come out in recent years, this book is still essential to the understanding of Woodrow Wilson and his place in history."},{"Title":"The evolution of man scientifically disproved in 50 arguments","review":"This is a classic work, written more than 80 years ago, it articulates part of the argument against evolution that existed DURING THAT TIME FRAME. It's a book of historical interest, those who are curious about the debate that was framed during the 1920's are going to get alot out of this book. It's a fascinating look at one side of the argument that surrounded Tenn. during the Scopes trial. If you have the intelligence to approach it as a historical work, and with historical value regarding a relatively famous time in American history, then this is a good read. If you are, however, an ardent Darwinian dogmatist who's only interest is to shout down anything and everything that disagrees with your worldview and therefore you can't comprehend or appreciate the fact that this book was written nearly one hundred years ago without launching into a ridiculous diatribe about how \\"stupid\\" religious people are and cursing Republicans and whatever other crap tends to pop up from these so-called reviews,then you won't like this book. Of course, the fact that some are unable to frame a historical work in a historical manner has not and will not stop them from posting heavily biased negative reviews that have little to do with the actual work itself and ends up being more an impassioned defense of their belief system. I would, however, strongly encourage those who are actually interested in reading the book to gain historical perspective to ignore the ramblings of the idiots on here and delve right in."},{"Title":"The evolution of man scientifically disproved in 50 arguments","review":"As a believer in God (and science and evolution), I went into this read with a lot of curiosity. It did not take long to realize why it is being given away on Kindle. The author uses shoddy mathematics and 'slur words' (brute, monkey men, etc) to bully his way through an obviously biased argument. Nothing is ever 'proven' as he states it is, but instead, 'formulas' are given that are supposed to disprove certain parts of the THEORY of evolution while giving no solid evidence in the opposition. There is a lot of talk about how things can be mathematically and scientifically disproven and then, when it comes time to really prove his point (not just bash an opposing point of view), the author quotes stories from the Bible and very rudimentary math as his 'facts'. Brushing over his 'proof' in a paragraph or two full of fluff.I'm a believer, but I'm a believer who realizes that if you want to write something like this, and not just aim it towards the 'lowest common denominator of intelligence' reader, you're going to have to cut out the bias demonstrated by the author time and again (of which has no place in real scientific research, which this book is most certainly not) and come to the table with actual real data and facts to back up the claims you are making. Not a paragraph or two on why your personal point of view is absolute.Can someone please tell me again why everyone is so scared to believe in both the existence of God AND Evolution?"},{"Title":"The evolution of man scientifically disproved in 50 arguments","review":"This book would appeal only to those who adhere to nineteenth century thinking. I stopped reading thebook after skimming the first few arguments. It seemed to me that an absolute, unquestioning acceptanceof the literal Bible was a prerequisite for reading this book."},{"Title":"The evolution of man scientifically disproved in 50 arguments","review":"It's not very pleasant to read this book because the article is poorly reasoned... indeed, horribly reasoned. But since this was published more than 100 years ago, let's remember the fact that many information was not there yet. I mean something like DNA sequencing, linguistic determinations and human anatomy etc. Despite of all that reasoning, it is interesting to know what religious people thinking (and trying to convince others) in the mid 1800s (if the Amazon labeled correctly 1858). Since the book is free and short, take a few hours for a sneak peak into the evolution theory when it was still a new born surprise to the general public is worthy."},{"Title":"The evolution of man scientifically disproved in 50 arguments","review":"What happens when a man with a brain absolutely rotted by superstition (religion) employs some basic math, throws in some reckless linear extrapolation, and attacks a subject (Darwinian evolution) on which he obviously does not know the first thing? The answer is a series of pathetic attacks on knowledge and reason that are so ignorant I burst out laughing many times. The old National Lampoon humor magazine could have printed this mess unedited. This book is so bad, it's good.Despite the title, the essays are more rants than arguments and there is hardly anything scientific there. A typical essay consists of 1) some good old fire and brimstone fear mongering, 2) pure venom for those in society who dare think rather than blindly believe, 3) and a rant built upon an absolute complete ignorance of science in general and evolution in particular which often begins with a stated fatally flawed assumption.Allow me to illustrate with 2 example essays randomly chosen (Rev. Williams would certainly note that this 4% of his arguments - he loves to calculate percentages).16 \`Brute Descent Impossible' Here, Williams is in true form. In this rant he, for the sake of argument, concedes that life is 60,000,000 years old (this was 1925 so let's allow this figure though Williams frequently guffaws at such a non-biblical age). He notes that the skull of a certain hominid has 2/3 the brain capacity of modern man. He then asserts that the specimen must be 20,000,000 years old since that is 1/3 all the way back from the present. Now here's where it gets a little fuzzy. Williams knowledge of evolutionary theory is so poor it's difficult to be certain what he means. But apparently he assumes a linear development of brain development in man from the beginning of life! Anyway, he asserts completely arbitrarily that this too old for a human. Evolution is therefore invalidated.31 \`Pictures in Caverns' Here Williams attacks the antiquity of Cro-Magnon cave art suggested by the depiction of extinct animals. Of course, since the universe is only 6000 or so years old and since the first man was made in god's image cave men could not have existed. His brilliant insight: it's dark in caves and the modern men who had to have created the paintings were attempting to depict extant species when they came out as extinct species because they could not see what they were doing! Yes, this is an argument against evolution.The man's an idiot. This is not parody. This is a diseased look at the world around us that is possessed by so many of our neighbors, some of whom are seeking to become the next US president."},{"Title":"The evolution of man scientifically disproved in 50 arguments","review":"really the only thing the author has proven is his own inability to understand the theory of evolution, population dynamics, statistics, and selection, among other such endeavors."},{"Title":"The evolution of man scientifically disproved in 50 arguments","review":"This book would make an interesting case study for anyone beginning a PhD and looking to improve their critical thinking skills. The author provides 50 \\"proofs\\". However, the author's use of the word \\"proof\\" is a little fast and loose by today's standards or even the scientific standards set in the author's era. Each proof has the kind of serious flaws that a journal reviewer should be skilled in catching.For example, the author's first proof is, he claims, a rigorous mathematical one. If people have two to three offspring and new generations appears every ~30 years, how many years would it take to grow from a population of 2 people to today's population of some billion people? His answer is about 5000. This reasoning is fairly sound, however the author goes on to state QED: the evolution of man, if it exists, has taken approximately 5000 years.Derp!To point out the obvious: firstly, this model provides only an approximation of a lower bound on the duration of the evolution of mankind, and excludes possibilities such as resource and environmental constraints leading to limits on population sizes growth (which may cause populations to grow or shrink).If we followed the author's model and reasoning, we would expect the Earth to by consumed by a soup of microbial organisms some miles thick within our lifetimes.Secondly, the author claims that his reasoning bears the irrefutablility of a mathematical proof. What the author presented was a mathematical model only. If the model has flaws, you must question whether the proofs determined within its context have any validity.The author also likes to wag his finger at evolutionists as being unable to honestly follow the scientific method. I didn't get too far through the book, but its good for a laugh on a rainy day."},{"Title":"The evolution of man scientifically disproved in 50 arguments","review":"The Evolution of Man Scientifically Disproved by William A.

It has been well documented that WW2 Nazism was fueled by another godless system (Darwinianism), but this author, prior to WW2, was saying that another godless system contributed to the earlier war, WW1.One reviewer wrote, \\"I would bet my last dollar that Williams had not read one word of Darwin's work...,\\" but I wonder if the reviewer read Williams' book, as on page 5, Williams quoted substantially from Darwin's book.\\""},{"Title":"The evolution of man scientifically disproved in 50 arguments","review":"The writer makes a valid point.

I was fascinated by the background of the empire and the characters that made it up. There were several plot developments revolving around characters that I found very intriguing: Hecati, Bixia, Agel, the jinji, the Magria and so on. For instance, we left her half-sister Bixia screaming that she would do everything in her power to bring the empress down. So, here we are in the conclusion and we never even see Bixia again, let alone have her try anything to ruin her life. The author focuses a great deal on minute details, then forgets the big picture. The emperor is mentioned almost as an aside that he is dead. What happened? We get about one sentence that the magria is dead and has been replaced by a former deputy that she had removed from office due to flaws. What happened? We never find out. We spend pages and pages focusing on the empress reaching Albania and her father, and all her attentions are concentrated on saving his life so that he could lead his armies to put her on the throne. Everything is about to come together, and then she's basically arrested and carted off to the capital with her family who have no real part in the rest of the story. No armies. Nothing. She earns the respect of a dragonrider who pretty much seems set to bring her an army of dragonriders, and we never see him or another dragon again. She wanted a jinji from the very first book, and she finally gets one. She even gets one that is unusually colored and matches her topaz colors, then all we get from the jinji is it piping up a couple of times that danger approaches. Well, duh. He never uses his peculiar skills that I wanted to learn more about to sense and draw off magic. We didn't need the jinji to tell us that. Too much detail was focused on petty humiliations and not enough on the real meat of the story. I was very disappointed at the lack of conclusion for this series. I feel as though I wasted my time reading the first two, which were much better than the last. I wish that the author would have extended the series to at least a fourth book to fully develop all the characters, then I would have been one happy reader."},{"Title":"Realm of Light (The Ruby Throne Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"The exciting conclusion of the Ruby Throne trilogy begins right where it left off in book two. Faced with certain death behind, the Emperor and his band of refugees has no choice but to flee into the Shadow Realm. Caelan, not willing to let the Empress tread the dark realm alone, enters with her. They soon become separated, and are lost in the darkness. There is a way out, but the cost is high. And even if they do get out of the Shadow Realm, there is still the matter of those pesky prophecies.An extremely well crafted novel, full of surprises and character growth. The relationship between the Empress Elandra and her guardian Caelan is full of emotionial tension, and the shadows and prophecies that follow them both add depth and character. Surprises are plentiful, and the action non-stop. All of these add up to one thing: loss of sleep when you can't put it down. An excellent fantasy setting by a terrific writer. Hopefully there is more to come."},{"Title":"Realm of Light (The Ruby Throne Trilogy, Book 3)","review":"This was a very dissapointing ending for the ruby throne trilogy.

It will never be in the top 10 percent of original fantasy novels but the series is a good outing in lightfantasy. The only real complaint I have is the lack of such vital scenes asKostimon's death which we only hear about second hand and well after theevent.

Ms. Richard has a witty and entertaining style of writing, which makes this book a genuine pleasure to read. This book is an invaluable resource for anyone on a low carb diet who does not have access to the Internet, or who does not have the time or patience to weed through millions of posts on Internet support boards in order to find those few pearls of wisdom that are always hiding among a proliferation of other posts.This book includes a brief individual summary of each of the following low carb plans:the Atkins dietthe Carbohydrate Addict's Dietthe ZoneSugar Busters!Dr. Bernstein's Diabetes SolutionProtein PowerThe Schwarzbein PrincipleNeanderthinThin forGoodThe Secret to Low Carb Success also provides this summary in the form of a chart, allowing you to compare all of the plans side-by-side. You can reference subjects like caffeine on another comparison chart and see what each of the individual author's opinions is on a given subject.One of the most helpful sections of this book and will no doubt be Chapter 2, \\"Know What to Expect.\\" This is where you get the real nitty-gritty -- the lowdown on how much weight you can really expect to lose on a typical low carbohydrate plan, the definition of a true stall and plateau versus the typical periods of slow or no loss that plague all of us, and a discussion of \\"whooshes\\" as well as \\"set points\\" and \\"natural body weights\\" that are difficult to move beyond. I particularly enjoyed the discussion of how muscle growth masks fat loss, and how, as we all know, \\"scales are for fish\\".The book goes on to discuss how water retention masks fat loss. She explains it very well: since a pint is a pound the world around, the weight of the water that we drink and retain fluctuates daily.Another very valuable section has been devoted to the subject of hidden carbs. Very few of the official diet plan books even touch upon this so-important subject. This book includes images of actual nutritional labels, and it drives this important point home very well.The author has cleverly combined the advice of many successful dieters into one easy-to-read narrative. Bravo, Laura Richard!"},{"Title":"The Secret To Low Carb Success!: How to Get the Most Out of Your Low Carbohydrate Diet","review":"A few years ago I lost a fair amount of weight going low carb, but due to not knowing much about eating LC, I was inadvertently cheating the diet. My weight loss stopped, I became disillusioned, and went back to my old ways of eating. This past fall my doctor instructed me to go on a low carb diet (he had lost 35 lbs on LC eating). He was serious: My weight was affecting my health.I decided to do as much learning as I could about the LC lifestyle -- it gets a lot of criticism in the medical community, and with my wife and several friends in the medical field, I figured I better get as many medical perspectives as I could in order to dialog intelligently on the subject.The gold mine was struck when I came across Laura Richard's book. Laura Richard is a registered nurse -- that's the 4-year degree-type -- and she also holds a master's degree in healthcare administration. She no dummy when it comes to the medical field. This is what impressed me first: Her Credibility.I bought the book for what seemed like too low a price (it's way inexpensive), and dug in. I was immediately impressed with Richard's organization of the subject matter. Not much rambling in this book, but it's not a dry read in any way. Quite the contrary. What makes this book so appealing is a genuine, down-to-earth writing style. It captures you and you want to keep reading. She uses easy-to-understand analogies to explain difficult concepts. I don't see how anyone could not understand the material she presents.As has been previously posted in reviews of this book, Laura Richard does a fine job of consolidating what was no doubt hundreds of hours participating on Internet message boards and discussion groups. She includes a &quot;voice of low carb experience&quot; section at the end of most topical discussions. In other words, not only does she do a great job of outlining various &quot;expert&quot; opinions with a fair and balanced approach, she ties it all together with a dose of reality expressed by hundreds of others from her experience participating in discussion groups.This book is both a primer and a bible for low carbers (and for those who want to support their LC family and friends). In addition to the well-organized contrast and compare section on all the LC diet philosophies and all the great tips and education throughout the book, Richard includes a fairly comprehensive resource section at the back of the book -- which I've found quite helpful. Even as good as this book is, it obviously can't cover everything, so joining a low carb forum online is helping to &quot;fill in a few gaps&quot; in my learning. I probably wouldn't have joined such a group on my own, but as Richard has shown, &quot;the voice of low carb experience&quot; can be quite helpful at times.In essence, this book is not only informational, it's transformational. If you could only have one book to explain the whys and wherefores of the LC lifestyle, this should be it. I've read it twice, and it's one of the few that's going onto my &quot;read it every year&quot; bookshelf. I'd pay ten times the cover price for the wealth of information this book presents.Five Stars. Excellent. Highly Recommended. Easy Read.

This book summarizes several versions of the low-carb diet, without subjectivity. Richard creates a nice comparison chart of the most common low carb diets. She offers great advice on how to prevent and get through stalls and various support resources for low carb dieters. A MUST read for low carb dieters or those who can't decide on a low carb program. The only downfall is small print.."},{"Title":"The Secret To Low Carb Success!: How to Get the Most Out of Your Low Carbohydrate Diet","review":"If you are a lo-carb convert and are looking for a way to make this way of eating a lifestyle, I highly recommend you read this book. It is particularly helpful in diagnosing stalls in weight loss, many of which are subtle but can pose a barrier to success. Before reading this book I had the big picture. Now I have the find points and can see that Lo-carb is not just about losing weight but gaining health."},{"Title":"The Secret To Low Carb Success!: How to Get the Most Out of Your Low Carbohydrate Diet","review":"I have been doing a low carb diet for a long time, but I learned a lot from this book anyway. It is so full of tips on how to do low carb dieting better, that I will be trying them for a long time to come. I wish I had this book when I was first starting the diet because I think I would not have made as many mistakes. I spent a lot of money buying a bunch of low carb books trying to figure the diet out and I wish I would have had this book first. I think it would have saved a lot of time and money because it is all in this book."},{"Title":"The Secret To Low Carb Success!: How to Get the Most Out of Your Low Carbohydrate Diet","review":"So many people have written such nice things about this book that I feel compelled to write a negative review. But I can't. This book was very useful. If you are thinking of starting a low carb diet but are not sure which one, start by reading this book. It compares the various diets in an unbiased, down-to-Earth way. For me, the most important part of this book was the chapter which discussed the various factors which can cause the low carb diet to suddenly stop working for no clear reason. Many of the causes of slowing weight loss are not obvious. This book will likely help you find the cause of your slowed weight loss and help you get back on track. And on top of that, the book is so cheap. You are hurting yourself if you don't add this book to your low carb arsenal."},{"Title":"The Secret To Low Carb Success!: How to Get the Most Out of Your Low Carbohydrate Diet","review":"The author has done a great job of introducing low-carb dieting in all its different forms. She begins by listing the points that all the low-carb book authors agree upon. Then she provides encapsulated summaries of the most popular low-carb diet plans, defining the focus of each and highlighting what people liked most about each plan and what they liked least.This is not a low-carb diet book in and of itself; it simply gives hints on how to make whatever diet you have chosen to follow work better for you. And unlike most of the diet book authors this author lays it out straight as to what the dieter can expect, including the negative aspects of stalls and plateaus. I liked the balanced treatment of the various low-carb diets.She even goes into some detail on nutrition labels and how to identify hidden carbs. She did, however, use a faulty premise in her explanation of how to locate hidden carbs based on nutrition labels, and I didn't like the fact that she lumped sugar alcohols in with real sugar. But these are trivial annoyances and should not cause anyone to go astray on their diets.Overall, it is a good read for anyone considering a low-carb lifestyle, or for those who might be experiencing problems on their diet."},{"Title":"The Secret To Low Carb Success!: How to Get the Most Out of Your Low Carbohydrate Diet","review":"I have been low carbing for about 2 months and I was having mixed results before I read this book.

She helped me to re-establish my priorities and I can now offer good advice to my dieting friends, thanks to her.

My situation had no bearing on the Atkins plan as I still follow it.I stumbled upon this book about 4 months ago in a drug store--way before reading any reviews. The writer is credible, the writing style is not over the top on medical terminology. Once you start reading it, it is hard to put down.Ms. Richard states the facts concerning each plan.Anyone who is even considering a low carb lifestyle (this is not a \\"diet\\") should really read this book BEFORE they start any plan. Although I started lowcarbing before knowing about this book, I believe it would help even a current lowcarber in the event that they may need to make adjustments with whatever method they are using.The book is very inexpensive and worth much more than it's price.

The grandfather formerly owned a large farm of prized horses, but lost most of them due to misfortune. All their hopes are centered in one valuable brood mare.The story starts out as the older grandson, Rodger, joins the Armed Forces, just weeks before the new foal is to be born. His younger brother determines to watch over and train the foal for his brother until he returns although he had former plans of going to college and really has no interest in horses before.It's a beautiful tale of devotion, how the young man conquers himself to help out his brother, training and driving the horse in races, even after Rodger becomes missing in action.

This book is about how Marley deals with this change and how she struggles to forgive her dad and adoptive family.I liked his book because it is a sweet story with a good moral, but it just wasn't very intresting. Anyone that is looking for a book that is intresting and where things happen in it, don't pick this book to read.

It is refreshing to see the main character as a person, who happens to be an African American, instead of the traditional books with plots that stem from the fact that they are black. What an underlining, yet powerful message Angela Johnson is sending. The simplicity of this book tells a greater story; Marley the fourteen year old is seemingly apart of a perfect family, in a perfect small town, with perfect neighbors. Does it really matter that there is one small blunder amongst the family? Does blood trump experience? Does holding off a secret ALWAYS mean deceit? These are all questions Marley spends ample time pondering once she finds out her parents aren't her blood parents. We are rewarded to share this back and forth reasoning, resentment, acceptance time period with Marley. This book may be of someone else's account, but it makes you think of your thoughts that would roam in your mind if you were to find out you were adopted. Read it, and develop the characters through the sense of yourself. Hmmmm... would I declare this town, Heaven, a living Hell?

This book is told in first person so you really feel the ups and downs that the main character, Marley is facing. Marley lives in Heaven, Ohio, and lives what she believes to be the perfect life, she soon finds out that her family has kept a big secret from her and it shows how she deals with the truth. It is very good if you have a student in your classroom or know a child with the same problem as Marley faces in the book, she tries to figure out who she really is when she thinks that she was lied to her whole life. The book shows really well what some children feel in this certain situation and how they cope with, and in Marley's case the outcome is great.

When Marley begins babysitting, the students and I began to think that (predicting) something romantic might develop between her and Bobby, but no such thing occurs.

I am a student at Crawford High School. I chose this book Heaven for my literature circles group. I find this book very interesting because I feel that Marley should be happy with the parents she has."},{"Title":"Heaven","review":"HEAVEN, the 1999 Coretta Scott King Award book, is a first-person narrative centered on the idea or theme that just as some truths in life may bring a sense of sorrow and loss, they can also turn those painful feelings and emotion into real joy, hope, and acceptance. When main character, Marley, discovers that she's adopted, knowing what to do with that truth becomes the real issue of the story. For 12 years, Marley has lived in Heaven, OH with two doting parents, a quirky but lovable brother, good friends and neighbors that she adores. Now, it seems that her life up to this point has been one big fat lie! Even though she lacks trust in her adoptive family now that she knows the truth, it will be their continued love and support which wins her over and helps her to finally find the answers she so desperately needs to know about her life.I believe what makes this book so interesting to read is that it presents Marley's family, filled with deception and lies, as paradise. While the most troubled family in the story is &quot;picture perfect&quot; and free of deceit. The plot is idyllic and often dreamy with punches of reality mixed in as everyone's deceptions unravel. Even though this story is not as compelling as Ms. Johnson's 1994 Coretta Scott Award winning book, TONING THE SWEEP, it is still a moving story that handles the topic of adoption with graceful sensitivity."},{"Title":"Heaven","review":"I believe this Coretta Scott King Award winning book is a refreshing departure from most books about African Americans. It shows no drug use, nor violence and no one is living in an urban ghetto. Instead it shows a loving nuclear family who has normal ups and downs, and it even shows a very RESPONSIBLE single father! Written in first person, it feels as if you are really experiencing life through the eyes of a 14 year old. And even though I have not been adopted, I can certainly relate to Marley's dismay at the traumatic revelation - when everything you once thought true suddenly changes. My only problem with the book is with the storyline about Marley's girl friend. What was the real reason behind Shoogy's hurting herself and why did she dislike her family so much? Johnson seemed to let the storyline about the girl drop rather then bringing it to some sort of conclusion. But in all, I found \\"Heaven\\" to be satisfying and unique. There is almost no references to race in this book, letting the fact that she is Black just to be a given, and making Marley's struggle for self-discovery a universal story that would cross all color lines as an issue that any teenage girl (or boy?) could identify with."},{"Title":"Heaven","review":"Marley is a fourteen year old girl who lives with her parents in Heaven, Ohio. The book discusses on an average day what she does. She sometimes go to the ma suprette to wire money to her uncle, she spends time with her friends Shoggy and Bobby (this character later comes in Johnson book called first part last). Marley narration through out the book let you realize her family is not a bad one. Her world comes tumbling down when she finds out that the people she has called mom and pops all her life are really her aunt and uncle and the uncle that she has been wiring money too is her real father. The book has many little chapters with different headings that focus on the specific title in each. It shows Marley emotions going up and down on the reality of her world and how she eventually deals with seeing her real dad coming to visit. A great read!"},{"Title":"Heaven","review":"I had a really hard time getting into this book. At first I was confused as to how the characters were related. I also had a difficult time adjusting to the author's style. For some reason, I struggled with how she used the first person point of view. However, once I began getting into the plot, I could not put the book down. I am not adopted, but the author did an excellent job getting across to the reader how Marley felt when she discovered her parent's secret. As the reader, I went through the feelings that Marley went through. I felt myself getting angry for Marley and at Marley. I wanted her to get upset and confront her parents with their secret. I also was very upset with Jack that he only wrote letters, but never visited until he felt like he had to. I really enjoyed how the book ended. I loved the connection the author made with the first letter from Jack.

I would say this book is worth reading, but only if another book isn't avalible."},{"Title":"Heaven","review":"While the complexities of family life are explored in this book from the standpoint of a young girl, this book contains and conveys many misconceptions regarding adoption and families. Today, families that are created by adoption, convey this information to children early in life, and the validity of family is challenged by the pseudo-angst conveyed in this book. Reading the reviews, particularly, those written by youngsters, indicates that this misconception is indeed conveyed by this book; that adoptive families are not \\"true\\" or \\"real\\" families. Over 5 million adoptive families in the US currently exist, and unfortunately this book feeds into the oft-repeated stereotype that adoption is a secret often hidden, and that a family that includes adopted children are \\"less real\\". The book of today that would better mirror such families would be one where the teenager responds: \\"Yes, I'm adopted, and this family is MY family\\"Regrettably publishers and authors alike still latch on to the \\"orphan\\" and \\"the shock of adoption\\" themes as prime targets for pulp preteen and teenage fiction themes."},{"Title":"Heaven","review":"In ths book there is a girl named Marley.

What is most valuable for the person who wants to know about homeschooling in general is that there are 55 families here, each using a somewhat different style of homeschooling, but each family seems to be getting along just fine. One family, in which the parents are both long-haul truck drivers, talk about their adventures &quot;On the Road.&quot; Some of the families, such as in the &quot;Never O'Clock&quot; and &quot;Teacher Didn't Shave Today&quot; chapters (which are in the section of follow-ups from &quot;Patchwork&quot;) are willing to talk warts and all.There is a good balance of families that are religious, not so religious, and not religious at all. There are families that are more or less going it alone, and others that have teamed up with learning cooperatives or that take advantage of some part of a public school program. Only children; small families; big families; rural areas; big cities; working parents; single parents; the United States, Australia, Africa, Canada, the United Kingdom; extremely structured and very free and easy. It's all here!Recommended to journalists who want an overview of homeschooling philosophy; families considering the homeschooling adventure; skeptical relatives; anyone who likes to eavesdrop on other people's lives!"},{"Title":"Homeschool Open House","review":"This is a superb book for three groups of people: Anyone who's THINKING about homeschooling, anyone who is ALREADY homeschooling and anyone who wants to KNOW more about it.

The author doesn't try to espouse one particular technique, rather, she lets the viewer see the realities of how homeschooling looks with the individual overlays of each unique home life. This is not sanitized; it's a honest view of how different families have made it work or are struggling to make it work. The author is not judgemental about the vast differences that occur among families, and she includes more than just the standard &quot;conservative&quot; perspective on the subject. Homeschooling is NOT for everyone and this book helps readers determine whether they're cut out for it, or gives new ways of handling challenges. The author does ask some penetrating questions in the first few chapters. The book is full of innovative ideas and specific techniques from families all over the world who share their hard-earned 'secrets' to the thorny problems that arise. I found it compelling and think this is a 'must read'."},{"Title":"Homeschool Open House","review":"&quot;What's remarkable to me, besides the awesome task of envisioning, designing, organizing, interviewing, drawing, questioning, thinking, typing, and finally publishing, was that even thought the spine of the book and the research topic is about homeschooling (and does not really effect my life one way or another), I couldn't put the book down. It's so HUMAN. So BROAD. So interesting because it's about PEOPLE. Their dreams. Their 'ideas.' Their Day. But, mostly, I was in awe of the strength, resourcefulness and sheer revolutionary energy needed to go one's own way.&quot;"},{"Title":"Homeschool Open House","review":"I'll keep it simple...if you liked Homeschooling:A Patchwork of Days, you will at least like, if not love, Homeschool Open House. Not only does it do a five year follow-up on the original homeschooling families, but it has interviews with many more homeschooling families, from Alaska to Zimbabwe, some with one child, others with seven. I was inspired by some families, while I cringed at some of the unschoolers' choices. I am certainly looking forward to the next five-year follow up!"},{"Title":"Homeschool Open House","review":"If you're considering homeschooling, but have no idea how it might work on a daily basis, take a look at Homeschool Open House and Patchwork of Days. Even though I had a hard time relating to the families who chose homeschooling because of religious reasons (many of the featured families), I enjoyed their honest accounts of daily life. Both books give a great look into routines, philosophies, success and failures and, in Open House, how homeschooling has fared for them over the years. I especially enjoyed the accounts of non-American familes and Nancy Lande's family."},{"Title":"Homeschool Open House","review":"I wanted to say that one of the stories, story number two, specifically, called \\"On The Road\\", tells of homeschooling on an eighteen-wheeler. For those of you who read that one, I thought you ought to know that I'M A.J, now 12, writing this review in October of 2006. I stumbled across this story in this book when looking around a book shelf in our living room, in the summer. The story was written by my mom, Trish Dalton, and it was an interesting story, nonetheless, with a paticularly suspenseful conclusion, which ends our traveling on the truck. My mom still has back pains now or days, and whenever she has to bend down, I usually do it for her. Also, this story was NOT originally titled \\"On The Road\\". It was called \\"Travels with AJ\\", and I strongly approved of that. There WAS going to be a sequel written by my mom, called \\"Travels with AJ 2: A New Beginning\\", which was never written. I wrote some unprofessional short stories about our dogs and their traveling, but I never published them, because they stray away from the entire point of the first one, which is homeschooling on the road. The sequels were just about various adventures about the two interesting dogs, Lennie and Roadie, traveling. In 2002, we started doing a trucking company, but without eighteen-wheelers. We just used heavy-duty pickups. That ended pretty messy, too. My mom broke her neck in an Abilene, Texas accident, but she eventually healed. There were going to be sequels, yes, that COULD have been published, but you have to remember, I wrote them, and not only did they abandon the point of homeschooling on the road, but the stories eventually bent out of shape, with things like government conspiracies, and the Mafia. People wouldn't even see a link between them. Anyway, \\"Travels with AJ\\" was the original title, and the two sequels I wrote were: \\"Travels with Lennie\\", and \\"Travels with Roadie\\". I don't know if I ever thought about a prequel, going back to when my mom did truckdriving, before I was born. It could have been good, but it never happened. Maybe one of the reasons the first name was never used was because it too much resembled a different book, or TV show, I can't remember what it was, or what the title was. So, anyway, I wanted to comment on how I was the star of Homeschool Story #2 in this book, which also turns out to be a sequel, and I'm thinking there will be more sequels to this one, with many, many, many more homeschool stories, and it's always possible that \\"Travels with AJ\\" will be written as a graphic novel, by me, with those sequels.Sign, Austin James \\"A.J.\\" Dalton"},{"Title":"Homeschool Open House","review":"As a person interested in himeschooling because of my own eprsonal experience that I have not learnt most of what I have from educational institutions, \\"Homeschool Open House\\" is a most welcome addition to a field of literature that, in relation to the number of homeschoolers active today in the United States and elsewhere, is not well represented.Nancy Lande's first part of this series,Homeschooling: A Patchwork of Dayswas less comprehensive but still provided some exceptioanlly touching stories of down-to-earth people who, as we see time and time again reading through the twoo books, manage to gain a great deal as a result of the flexible schedule provided by homeschooling. This flexibility is, as I see it, a critical virtue of homeschooling, along wiht the fact that it provides well-defined work for everybody within a family and values it in a way that can be described as very fair.The families in the book are varied: some have only a single child, others five or six, but within \\"Homeschool Open House\\" there is, I should note, remarkably little of the religious motivation cited for homeschooling by people likeRod DreherorPat Buchanan. though many of the families do mention the Bible, it is always the routine, doctrinaire nature of public schooling that is so criticised by most families studied in both Lande's books.There is a great many lovely little stories about exactly what these homeschooling families do during their daily routine - things like cooking and day-tours that I wish I could do more but which I can never discipline myself to do effectively. It is perhaps because of my envy of these things that I enjoy reading \\"Homeschool Open House\\" as much as I do when I am travelling in an aimless way around Melbourne on buses. Some of the work they do reminds me on a second look of the advanced Chemistry textbooks I would emorise when a young child - and then get chided by my minder for pointing out facts students in Year 9 are not supposed to know (like how the gas laws aren't really true for real gases).All in all, I have found literature on homeschooling far too sparse for the curious and Nacy Lande has done an excellent job of showing the experience of so many families who practice this method of education."},{"Title":"Homeschool Open House","review":"I have read the first book, Homeschooling: A patchwork of Days, over and over every year. I was thrilled to see this follow-up with additional entries of other home schooling families."},{"Title":"Homeschool Open House","review":"As a homeschooling parent myself, I devour books on homeschooling. The idea of looking into a homeschooling day for many different families attracted me to this book. Some of the families are wonderful, showing the sacrifice and love that is involved in homeschooling. The children are thriving in a wonderfully rich cultural environment. Other families disturbed me, especially some of the unschooling ones. Their leave-and-let-bloom attitude looked to me as bordering on educational neglect. I saw mothers more worried about chores than about math. I saw kids more worried about their next TV show and with little structure. I saw too many hours gone by with little to account for. The parent that used the TV show WISHBONE to jot it down on her journal as having done &quot;American Indian Legends&quot; with her kids is blatantly disguising her children's educational experience. This book is a wonderful introduction to the homeschooling lifestyle but it can also be a powerful weapon for those in the educational establishment (myself as a teacher included) who are gearing their claws for attacking homeschooling. On the average, homeschooling children perform above their otherwise schooled counterparts but we also know that there must be exceptions. The book was interesting but it disturbed me as well."},{"Title":"Beyond Ourselves","review":"After reading Christy, I was actually looking forward to this book.

(He has only used 2 words) but in some titles (like Riders of the Purple Sage) they swore ALOT!!! His descriptions of places and landscapes and so such, are really good and very descriptive.

And when easterner Madeline Hammond gets off the train near midnight and things begin to happen right away, you know that this is going to be a good one. Gene Stewart, the other half of the romance is a man's man with the traditional western values but who has at first kind of lost his way because of drinking too much. But that gets straightened out through the love of a woman. The cast of characters includes some cowboys, old time cowboys, you will never forget. There's an animal, a magnificent horse, in the story; an automobile, driven by a cowboy who loves to go fast and scare his passengers, and this plays a vital role in the climax of the story as only ZG can describe and tell it. This is another of his books which take place in contemporary times, written when these events were playing themselves out along the US-Mexico border. This is another of his books which is told primarily from the woman's perspective and would indeed appeal to the female reader; it's NOT a bang, bang shoot'em up with street duels and impossible violence, but realistic characters and events. It's a great book for anyone to enjoy, a historical romance set in the West; not a \\"western\\".

This book, written by a professor of psychology and ethnic studies and a professor of sociology, is, predictably, a scholarly study. This is the first scientific, representative study of the American-born generation who lived through the experience. Time was running out, given the advancing age of the Nisei. So a random study was done in 1997 of 183 current residents of King County, Washington (Seattle) who had been what they call \\"incarcerated\\" in the camps. I found this a powerful term to express the injustice of what was done to the Japanese Americans without having to go through diatribes. It got the point across. They chose this location partly because research was already going on, and partly because of the high concentration of Japanese Americans there.The book follows a chronological order, first describing what prewar life was like, for various age groups, then the act of incarceration, what life was like in the camps, resettlement after the war, and present day life. Two formats are used, first, quotations from the open ended responses people made. These tend to be all too brief; I wanted more. The other is charts and statistics. I've taken statistics classes so am not intimidated by this, but it might feel like a bit much to someone who just wants to know what life was like. But the narrative tells you, and you can let your eyes pass right over the numbers and pay attention to the words.Among the interesting findings I'll just pick some. Even before the war, a generation gap was looming. The Issei, the immigrant generation, were terribly discriminated against, and thus clustered in \\"Japantowns.\\" They lived either by farming or in businesses that catered to their own community. Thus, they tended not to learn English. Their children, the Nisei, learned English and American ways in school. They became their parents' interface to the American world. This is probably a universal immigrant experience. But it became even more problematic in the camps, where the structure of life was controlled by the US Army and the parents had little or no control over their children, and the family structure so important to the Japanese started to collapse.Sixty years later, those who had been the youngest when they entered the camps had the least-negative memories, while those who had been young adults had the worst memories. Young adult women's memories were worse than men's. The book didn't talk about this, but I wondered if it wasn't related to the difficulty of raising young children with minimal resources.Women who were not married when they entered the camps married two years later, on average, than their age-mates in the population at large--at a time when women were marrying earlier than they had during the depression years. And they had fewer children, spaced farther apart, again at a time when the general birth rate rose.The Japanese American Issei generation had a low level of education, due to lack of opportunity, and they had high expectations for their children. Their children had high expectations for themselves. Almost half the young men and a quarter of the young women expected to go to college. And they actually exceeded those expectations, though many waited years to fulfill them. The same was true of occupational status. Issei fathers were very limited in the occupations available to them, but their children were ambitious. And as a group, they exceeded their ambitions.One of the most interesting chapters was on resettlement. It clearly surprised the authors that the incarcerees had so much difficulty reestablishing themselves after the war. Part of this was caused by the government's policy of encouraging them to \\"spread themselves thin\\" across the country to be less conspicuous and \\"more American.\\" Their strong community and church ties were thus destroyed and took years to rebuild in new ways. Before 1945, they were still not allowed to return to the Pacific coast, and some of these people who ended up in the Seattle area moved as many as eight or nine times before landing there. Discrimination made finding jobs very difficult, and many had lost all economic assets.If you are interested in knowing more on what happened to the Japanese Americans during and after World War II, I would highly recommend this book. If you need to ignore the statistics, do so, but get the gist of the overview of the story. Then look in the long bibliography, or do a Google search, and find one of the many good autobiographies written by someone who lived through it, for an up close and personal view of what it was like. You'll benefit from both vantage points."},{"Title":"John Deere Tractor Data Book: Two-Cylinder Models Through 1960","review":"This book contains all specs for two cylinder John Deere tractors including serial number reference guides.

In fact, the Bill Gates of Pridmore's novel lives in a world far removed from Microsoft, trillionaires (I'm not even sure how to spell that) and the power of technology.He is a pharmacist at a hospital in Australia, and we join him as he struggles with inner demons of several dimensions.In short, I think the book is superb. Anyone who has been involved with mental disorders - and let's face it, few of us make it through life without some sort of connection, either personal or vicarious - will identify with this very accessible account.Pridmore has structured the book intelligently - balancing the dark, difficult and ultimately tragic elements of the story with the human, the hilarious, the mundane. His clever balancing makes it digestible for the general reader, while still (I'm told) credible and interesting for the health professional.It's not easy to track down &quot;What About Bill Gates?&quot;, but I think it's worth it, both for interest and insight. It is not a long book, but is a very memorable one. From what I read on the Amazon site, Pridmore's other books are non-fiction. I'm only sorry he didn't have another go at communicating his obviously considerable talent through the fiction medium.

Soke (founder) Higashi outlines the history and philosophy of Kokushi-ryu Jujutsu, with a clear explanation of the principles driving his development of the style. The basics of breakfalls (ukemi), stances, strikes, kicks, throws, chokes, joint techniques, and more are clearly illustrated with instructive photographs and precise text.As with all martial arts texts, this book should not be used without the supervision of a qualified instructor. This is particularly the case with Kokushi-ryu Jujutsu, as most of the techniques require a practice partner in order to safely learn and adequately understand the principles involved.

How callous are you to hope her death will eradicate her work? Somewhere she's laughing at you. Can you hear her?"},{"Title":"Blasted & Phaedra's Love (Methuen Modern Plays Series)","review":"These, the first two plays by Sarah Kane, the most brilliantly original voice of 1990s theatre, are essential. Blasted captures the full horror of contemporary war and socks home scalpel-sharp observations about life, abuse of all kinds and extreme despair, yet finds some compassion amid it all. Phaedra's Love is a majestic macabre comedy, a re-working of the Greek tragedy of Phaedra, yet again with serious points to make about obsessive love, extreme boredom and hypocrisy.Sarah's work will live on for centuries, both through performances of her own plays and through the new writers influenced by her who are already emerging.I met Sarah twice, and she was a very lovely lady, so may you die horribly, Colorado, you scum."},{"Title":"Blasted & Phaedra's Love (Methuen Modern Plays Series)","review":"They tell me that Sarah Kane made quite a stir in British theatre before her untimely suicide in 1999. Given the undeniable intensity of &quot;Blasted,&quot; not to mention the in-your-face subject matter, it's not difficult to see why. I think Kane had at least some talent, but the modest technical skill she brings to this play is definitely overwhelmed by the unpleasantness of the material. Really, &quot;Blasted&quot; is just that old Theatre of the Absurd shtick--you know: &quot;The world is a crazy, horrible place but it's all we have&quot;--updated for somewhat more permissive 1990's audiences; no one familiar with the best plays of Beckett, Pinter, or Stoppard should be terribly impressed by it. The companion piece, &quot;Phaedra's Love,&quot; is more of the same, only lacking the questionable merits of the first play. In fact, &quot;Phaedra's Love&quot; is flat-out awful, strongly suggesting that Kane had really very little to say.

The supposed shock value such pornography displays is imaginary in the minds of those who pathetically but desperately seek attention through such antics as a child screaming at the top of his lungs to be heard by an unattentive mother. To the rest of the world it may disgust us, but it fails to shock us only precisely because that is what it is so desperately trying to do. The cry for attention becomes sad, pathetic and, eventually, compells us to disregard it as the most microscopic, unimportant and, thus, most easily disregarded distraction in a world otherwise filled with beauty, challenge and potential.Canada reveals his/her shallow obsession, by the religious overtones to his/her review. The myth of religion, any religion, my friend, is as constricting to your intellect (what little of it there is) as is the works of Kane and others like her. How much more peace and love can the world stand? It's cup is nearly empty as it is, so I would say a nearly infinite amount. As to Kane and others like her, the eradication of their work through death is the only value their life will ever bring to anyone. How ironic that the only gift they bring to us is their own death, when the we all would have been better off had they never existed in the first place. Kane and artists like her are among the most compelling arguments in favor of abortion."},{"Title":"The Glass Harmonica: A Novel","review":"This book is an excellent, dreamy science fantasy work by a great author. She weaves two parallel story lines across two and a half centuries and creates each world wonderfully. She also integrates historical figures, such as Ben Franklin and Mozart, into the storyline deftly. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys science fiction or fantasy, and anyone who enjoys this book should enjoy all of her previous works."},{"Title":"The Glass Harmonica: A Novel","review":"I would really give this three or three-and-a-half stars, but I am inclined to be generous because it is clearly well-researched and also well-written.Marley has written a knowledgeable and sensitive book about two musicians living 250 years apart. Eilish Eam is an orphaned street player who attracts the attentions of Benjamin Franklin while Erin Rushton is a famous glass harmonica player based in Seattle of the early 20th century. Their presence somehow comforts each other across the ages and Erin learns an important lesson about her own life and the purpose of her art.The problem with the novel is that there simply is not enough there there. While Eam's world is incredibly detailed, Erin's is only hinted at. It is obviously quite different from our world in 2003, but exactly how is never made clear. I realize that the focus was meant to be on Eam. However, since Marley chose to structure the plot around Erin, I felt that she should have also given Erin more focus. The key decisions in the book rested on Erin, but I knew very little about her motivations. As a result, the ending felt a little unearned.That said, the book was good enough that it made me want to try other books that Marley wrote. She writes about 18th century London in a way that felt both sharp and real. I also enjoyed reading it-- it kept me going and interested. Promising signs pointing towards a writer whose other works I might enjoy more."},{"Title":"The Glass Harmonica: A Novel","review":"Louise Marley has proven herself again! An author who has established herself in the genres of Fantasy and Science Fiction, Marley has now added a touch of historical fiction to the mix. The Glass Harmonica combines an expertise in music and medicine with future and past worlds that are meticulously developed. The two characters, Eilish and Erin, are compelling...and the addition of real historical characters such as Ben Franklin and Mozart makes this a convincing and insistant read. Brava!"},{"Title":"The Glass Harmonica: A Novel","review":"Louise Marley's novel tells two parallel stories. One begins in 1761 and concerns a young orphan named Eilish Eam, who earns her keep by playing music on water-filled glasses for passersby on the streets of one of London's poorer districts, until she is discovered by Dr. Benjamin Franklin. Impressed with her talent, he offers her a proper place to stay in exchange for her services in developing and playing his own similar invention, which he calls his glass armonica.The other, which occurs in 2018, follows Erin Rushton, a professional musician whose specialty is an instrument that evolved from Franklin's original device. Erin's brother, the composer of much of her repertoire, is undergoing experimental sound therapy to correct a neurological disorder, and her glass harmonica may provide the key.The tales run concurrently in roughly alternating chapters, converging when each character glimpses or feels the ghostly presence of the other. Erin wonders if she is losing her mind, since the harmonica is rumored to induce madness in sensitive individuals. She also finds herself becoming romantically involved with her brother's doctor.THE GLASS HARMONICA is an uncommon mix of historical fantasy and science fiction drama. I found the chapters set in the past more interesting, and it seems that the author may have as well; Eilish's world is described in rich detail while Erin's feels slightly underdeveloped. I'm not sure that setting the latter in the future was necessary at all. Most of the technological advances are superficial, and the relevant ones could have easily been worked into the present day.While the story is not quite complex enough to warrant the book's page count, and the ending is somewhat contrived, I was thoroughly absorbed in the tale. I recommend it especially if music and musicians are one of your literary fetishes."},{"Title":"The Glass Harmonica: A Novel","review":"I bought this book because it won the Endeavour Award, and also because I'm interested in Ben Franklin. I loved this book! Historical detail, interesting scientific speculation, vivid characterization, and clear writing.

I liked the way she presented Benjamin Franklin. As I would read the words, I could actually smell the scents in both the past and the future with her writing. This book drew me in &amp; took me for a trip. The theme of music helping to heal is an interesting &amp; thought provoking one. I will be reading the other books by Louise Marley."},{"Title":"The Glass Harmonica: A Novel","review":"This story intrigues with its portrayal of the power of music and human longing. I love a book that moves me, and Marley's, as usual, does. This story is both sweet and sharp, giving an unflinching glimpse at exploitation and privilege, including a courageously mixed view of Benjamin Franklin. Check out Terrorists of Irustan for another great Marley read."},{"Title":"The Glass Harmonica: A Novel","review":"Erin Rushton has the perfect life in the world of 2018: friends, a loving brother, a very successful job as a world famous musician, and the glass harmonica, an instrument rarely played in a typical orchestra. However, now as her brother's mental disorder takes a turn for the worst, the child prodigy begins to see the visions of a little girl, much like herself, more often...too often to the liking of her sanity. Her instrument has a rumored reputation of ultimately killing its artists. Even if the great Erin doesn't believe in the ridiculous tale, she can't help but wonder if her precious glass harmonica is actually driving her over the edge.Centuries earlier, in 1761 London, Eilish Eam, a peasant orphan, is forced to make a living by sitting on the cold street corner before sunrise, playing her oddly enchanting water-filled glasses until her young twelve year old fingers become cold and sore. With almost nothing, Eilish returns tot eh rough Seven Dials into the home of Dooya and her sweet, young crippled son Mackie. This was the girl's everyday routine until the fateful morning an old colonist inventor by the name of Franklin stops to listen to her bewitching melodies. The glass harmonica never ceases to amaze these two troubled girls, and even plays a part in saving a life, as it can do nothing to prevent a wanted death. Louise Marley tells of these brilliant stories in the future classic The Glass Harmonica.The author works in down points in both Erin and Eilish's lives. Erin's equally talented twin, Charlie, has been suffering from Friedreich's Ataxia since he was eight, disabling the use of his legs, but thanks to an engineered virus injected into his body, the ataxia was ceased. In Erin's opinion, the ataxia had not weakened him, but enhanced his mind as an orchestra conductor. Over the years, his desire to fit in with others and actually have the ability to walk has grown, driving him to try risky, and even life threatening procedures and programs. His latest attempt is working with Dr. Eugene Berrick, a fresh doctor using binaural beats to create new pathways in Charlie's brain. He believes if they succeed, Charlie's commands can have an optional route to travel through the nerves. The worried Erin can't help but mistrust the stranger, yet slowly fall in love with his untypical personality.As Erin deals with her brother's outrageous efforts, Eilish can barely stand to live with herself knowing she has no power over Mackie's living conditions with his constantly drunk mother, which are worsened by his cripple. One night after Eilish left to live with Benjamin Franklin and work on his glass harmonica, or armonica, Dooya is stabbed to death in the streets, leaving Mackie to live with an already overcrowded foster family. In order for them to keep him in their house, Eilish grants them exquisite food and small sums of change in the Franklin home, plenty for the peasant household. Eilish falls very ill, but when word of Mackie's tragic fall of death in a chimney during a job reaches her, it further weakens Eilish, eventually leading to the inevitable death of the Irish orphan that even the armonica couldn't prevent. Before, the dark angel takes her, a relaxed, happy Eilish sees a healthy, perfect-legged Mackie run into her arms in a patch of field.The conclusion linking the almost parallel lives is remarkable and very clever unlike any book I've ever read. Finally giving into her realistic visions of the mysterious girl, Erin returns to London. On her way to the street corner where the ghost was most life-like, a curator form the Benjamin Franklin house in London practically begs her to play at a gathering. That very night as her delicate fingers touch the ancient edges of the original glass harmonica, the spirit of the little girl takes a seat right next to her, mimicking Erin's movements while repeating the phrase: Tis like that, my little instrument. The saying made Erin realize the sounds of her instrument could save Charlie from the sudden blindness caused by the treatment. What really saddens the performer is that she also knows the unidentified bones found under the museum belonged to the spirit and that the original player of the first glass harmonica would forever be unknown.This book takes a spin on the classic science fiction story, adding elements of tragedy, historical facts, and a bit of romance, making it one of the best science fiction out there.R. Turner"},{"Title":"The Glass Harmonica: A Novel","review":"Opera singer Louise Marley is surely one of the most unique new voices I have encountered in the realm of science fiction and fantasy. Her novel \\"The Glass Harmonica\\", is a dazzling mix of historical fantasy with borderline cyberpunk science fiction. Her tale is a fascinating look at music from the viewpoints of two women - born centuries apart - consumed by their love of music and whose apparitions demonstrate to each other the important healing power of music. In 1761 London, Eilish Eam is an Irish orphan and street musician whose chance encounter with Benjamin Franklin earns her unexpected patronage and interest in her lyrical playing of the glass armonica. In 2018 Seattle, Erin Rushton is a famous classical musician and the world's foremost soloist of the glass harmonica. Her brother Charlie, crippled since childhood, is a distinguished classical composer. Tormented by her brother's health, she soon meets the ghostly wraith-like figure of a young girl who shares her passion for the glass harmonica. Marley is a spellbinding storyteller with a fine gift for creating interesting characters such as Eilish, Sarah, Charlie, and Gene Berrick, the young doctor who tries an unorthodox treatment for Charlie's injuries.

The writing was decent and the two stories were interesting. However, from reading the summary of the book, I expected the lives of the two main characters to intertwine in a more dramatic way. The book is written with the past and future characters' stories in alternating chapters. However, when they finally mesh, it seems sort of anticlimatic. It's like \\"Is that it?\\" I'd been expecting a ghost story, focusing on Erin being haunted by the ghost of Eilish, and maybe some time travel or at least a better conclusion. But by the time I reached the end of the book, I felt like I'd been reading two separate stories - one a historical drama, one a futuristic SF. Even though they both revolved around the healing power of music and the glass harmonica, the stories themselves did not intertwine as much as I had hoped. I had trouble relating to the futuristic story, because the author invents a lot of gadgets but doesn't really explain what they are. It took me a while to realize what a \\"picture window\\" might have been as opposed to a \\"viewing window\\" or a TV screen. There's really no romance or sex, which I hadn't been expecting, but maybe some of you might have.I give it three stars because the writing was good and the individual stories were interesting. However, the whole point of the story was to see how the past and future characters intertwine, and I felt they never really did. A decent book, but not something I'll read very often."},{"Title":"The Glass Harmonica: A Novel","review":"This book's hard to classify--fantasy or science fiction, mainstream or young adult. It's the tale of two women and the music that binds them. In the 1700's, a young poor girl busks the street playing music from glasses. She's mentored by Benjamin Franklin, who wants her to play his own glass instrument. In 2018, musical virtuoso, Erin, returns to play that same instrument.The story is well-written, if a bit long. To me, the 1700's was a richer venue well depicted and compelling, while the future seems a bit barren and uncertain."},{"Title":"The Glass Harmonica: A Novel","review":"Not as thought-provoking, or as moving, as some of Marley's other works, notably \\"Terrorists of Irustan.\\" It also feels rushed and left me just a little unsatisfied. Still, it is a sweet, pleasant novel, a nice bit of light reading.The story of Eilish, an Irish orphan employed by Benjamin Franklin to play his newest invention, a glass harmonica, is interspersed with that of Erin, a modern/future musical prodigy of the same instrument. As Eilish navigates her way through 18th century London, Erin struggles to engineer her own independence as well as that of her composer brother Charlie, who cannot walk thanks to an inherited neurological condition. Music is the key to both of their lives, and specifically what they call \\"glass music\\", the sound of the glass harmonica. (Essentially a mechanized device for spinning glasses, played by rubbing wet fingers around the rim - think of the sound when you rub the rim of a wine glass.)There is little real tension in this book, save for Charlie's struggles to walk and the mysterious illness (never specified, but I assume it to be lead poisoning) which plagues poor Eilish. Secondary characters are interesting, even when they're not altogether sympathetic. I was especially fond of Franklin, who comes across as the epitome of an absentminded professor.A nice bit of historical fiction, and especially fun reading if you happen to be interested in music. I guess I'm just so used to Marley's \\"issue\\" novels (\\"Irustan\\", \\"Child-Goddess\\", \\"The Maquisarde\\") that this one was just a little bit too light for me. Judged on its own, though, it's a great effort."},{"Title":"The Glass Harmonica: A Novel","review":"It's been years since I read this book, but I still keep it in a place of honor on my crowded shelves. That's because, although slight in the way of a whisper thin quality, it also cuts through much of the pedantic nature of most historical fiction. I really enjoy the way the author utilized Ben Franklin without having to destroy or reinvent him. I admire the back and forth between timelines that remained clear and precise, something done with an elegance of deceptive simplicity. And I'm a fan of heartfelt, well developed character driven plots, of which this work is an excellent example. You should choose to pick it up; it's sure to stay with you, too."},{"Title":"The Glass Harmonica: A Novel","review":"I read this book for the first time when I was 12, because I was super into harmonicas. Note - the mouth harp is not the harmonica featured in this book. It is some sort of odd glass instrument.Upon re-reading as an older, wise, more awesome version of me, here are my thoughts. I really hate the storyline with Erin and Charlie and Gene. Gene is weird and I don't like him, and Erin is a total whiny baby. I caught that even as a 12 year old, so it's pretty obvious. Their love is really forced and the ending is ridiculously rushed. There are some interesting ideas about \\"the future\\" but ... meh.On the other hand I LOVE the storyline of Eilish. I thought it was fantastically well done and it's very compelling. I remember skipping the Erin parts as a kid and just reading Eilish's part. I love the history and the characters and the portrayal of Ben Franklin and that whole part. So yay.A kind of obscure book about an obscure instrument. Overall, it's not one I would go out of my way to read again."},{"Title":"The Glass Harmonica: A Novel","review":"A haunting, poetical novel about two young women who are glass harmonica players: an adolescent Irish street musician discovered by Ben Franklin in eighteenth century London and a 21st century musician touring concert halls with her beloved, handicapped composer brother"},{"Title":"The Glass Harmonica: A Novel","review":"This book surprised me. I wasn't sure what to expect when it was given to me, but I was pleasantly surprised at how firmly it kept me in its grasp. There were bits of it where I just wanted them to get on with it and tell us what happened, but it moved along at a fairly good clip.The historical aspects of the story aren't as richly described as I'm used to with the historical romance genre, but this story isn't really a romance. There are romantic aspects to it, of course, with Erin and Gene coming together as a couple, but that's actually a very small component of the story.The focus on the Glass Harmonica (or the Armonica, as it's ascribed to Benjamin Franklin as saying) is refreshing. I'd never heard of this instrument, I'm not sure if Louise Marley made it up for the story, but it's a fascinating subject, and the scenes involving Franklin and his contemporaries are very indicative of the period, I think.I thoroughly enjoyed this story, even though it made me very sad at times. I really got into it, and I would highly recommend this book to anyone. It contains quite a bit more substance than most of the fluff I've read recently, but it's a good read. I must get my hands on more of Marley's work now."},{"Title":"The Glass Harmonica: A Novel","review":"Compared to her well-done trilogy, this book is like it's written by an different writer. The characters are poorly developed and one-dimensional. This makes it hard to really care about them. More interesting was the portion of the story set in the 1700's; Eilish was somewhat interesting. Erin seemed too weak and whiny of a character to be the other half of the book. Likewise, it's hard to feel any sympathy or care about Charlie and whether he walks again or not. He's just there.The plot is also thin--I kept thinking &quot;When is something going to happen?&quot; There's not enough foreshadowing of some of the events that occur towards the end in Erin's part, and a miraculous event near the end seems too convienently resolved.Finally, in the trilogy, Ms. Marley made us a part of the music and in undestanding how it works and affects other people. This one never quite reaches that height."},{"Title":"The Glass Harmonica: A Novel","review":"This is a decent novel. There's nothing truly spectacular about it, but nothing awful either. The writing is nice and simple, and the characters cute, even if they are all overly \\"sensitive.\\" (How many other readers wanted to slap Marianne?) Except for Gene, of course, who was so WOEFULLY underdeveloped I'm not even sure he qualifies as a character. You could tell Marley doesn't really have a clue about the personalities of \\"reserved\\" people. But on the whole, it was a pleasurable vacation read, entertaining but not too taxing of the intellect. So it gets 3 stars.HOWEVER . . .!The passivity of Eilish and the ignorance of those surrounding her concerning her \\"illness\\" drove me MAD. And reading previous reviews, no one else seems to have written a diatribe against lead poisoning, so here I go.Marley approaches the lead issue with so much delicacy that I imagine a person unaware of the danger of lead dust might not realize that this is what killed Eilish - younger readers especially. Having worked in an environmental law clinic dealing with issues of lead poisoning, I'm pretty familiar with it. While this book makes it seem that it was merely the product of past ignorance, lead poisoning remains a very real danger today. Lead dust, as most people already know, can be a danger if your house or apartment has lead-based paint. But did you know that lots of lead dust can accumulate on window blinds? Children can also be poisoned by playing on lead-contaminated soil, common in many places. Sadly, a recently released study by Environmental Health Watch found that almost TWENTY percent of children in Cleveland, my hometown, have symptoms of lead poisoning. While the percentages in most cities are much lower (CDC in 2001 reported a national average of 2.2%), lead poisoning still leaves too many children, most of them living in poor urban areas, susceptible to recurring headaches, blurred vision, and brain damage. The sad thing is that lead poisoning is COMPLETELY preventable - but because most children suffering from it are poor, they do not receive the protection they should.I really wanted Erin to save Eilish from such a pointless death, to tell her to get her arse out of that house, or at least have someone dust that stupid laboratory. You'd think Ben Franklin at least would know better. I was also annoyed at the weepy, complacent attitude exhibited by both the writer and Eilish herself towards her death. Fight, why don't you! Do SOMETHING! Even if Eilish didn't seem to mind that much, I at least expected more outrage from Marley - but maybe being an \\"artiste\\" makes her too delicate for such battles. Her wimpy characters surely seem to be.Just wanted to point out an issue in the novel that seems to have been overlooked by most reviewers."},{"Title":"The Glass Harmonica: A Novel","review":"I started this book with high expectation from the previous reviews, but I found the plot to weak and the characters to be very, very...thin...underdeveloped...two dimensional. The two parts of the book are disjointed and painfully parallel at the same time. The section that happens in the past is far more interesting than the part that occurs in the future. Reading the chapters that happen in 2018, I found myself all too ready to rid myself of the whiney characters and get back to the past."},{"Title":"Married By Christmas","review":"Lilli is shocked by the man she sees at a party, and the man-eater hanging off his arm. So shocked she drinks much too much wine and goes home with a handsome man known only as Patrick. Waking up almost in the buff and apparently having lost her innocence to him in a night she can't even remember, Lilli escapes from the hotel room in the morning while Patrick is in the shower.But home turns out to be not much better after questioning by her father. Later, Lilli finds out that Patrick is \\"Patrick Devlin,\\" a wealthy banker, who has her father and his business between a rock and a hard place. This business trouble can be laid at Lilli's door in the shape of her embezzling (and gay) ex-fianc&eacute;. But Patrick has a way to save her father. Marry him! Her family loyalty is desirable to him since he found trusting a woman difficult after his disastrous marriage to a philandering woman.There are some humorous moments as this super Alpha man dominates the spoiled little rich girl. And wait until you find out who the mysterious man at the party was - and even who the woman was! I did feel that Patrick was a bully but he becomes a rather tender-hearted man in the end. Lilli is a rather weak heroine but she is also very young. Both Patrick and Lilli have sad childhood incidents as you find in most of these Harlequins. I was surprised that this took place in the UK, as the recent ones in this series all take place in Australia. Pleasant, different afternoon read, though unbelievable at times. I judge these Harlequin Presents against similar short books and this one is fairly good."},{"Title":"Married By Christmas","review":"Description from the book back cover:It was hardly surprising that Lilli Bennett had drunk a great deal of champagne; barely three months ago her world had been rocked by trauma.

He vowed that she'd marry him within the month, and as only he could save her father's hotel chain from going bust, Lilli had no choice but to become his bride by Christmas!"},{"Title":"Married By Christmas","review":"MY THOUGHTS: SPOILERS ALERT!

Also I don't read much romance novels were in the hero is almost like a virgin - I'm not saying he is. But the fact that Patrick didn't have any woman for five years after his divorce. And the heroine was a virgin so thats great. =P Although I'm surprised considering this book was written in 1995. The story might seem a little too happy go lucky but it is a \\"christmas\\" romance novel so that is probably why.

I like this book. It's concise and compact, the language is simple and informative, and it delivers well on the promise of completeness.I find especially useful parallels with other languages, like C++ and Java. It's sometimes easy to miss some subtle changes between languages and assume something, which is not true, with nasty bugs as a result. Such comparison helps to avoid that.I also like that author managed to put so much information into relatively small volume. Most computer books are so bulky that it takes weeks to read through in your free time. And when you are working 10-12 hours a day, you don't have much free time. Not with this book. It can be slowly read in evenings in a week, and if you want just to get a grip on the language and start to write code, single evening may be enough.The only word of caution could be that the book does not really cover .Net Framework library. I actually like that, because I hate the books describing libraries, there is SDK documentation for this. And that left a space for a deeper description of the language intricacies, which are essential. But some people may consider it a flaw."},{"Title":"The Dark Art of C# Programming: .Net Core Language (Series)","review":"It's started on a slope of the hill... Three hackers, one from mainframe, another from Linux, and the third one from Java, decide to learn the new language from Microsoft... Their dialogs inserted across the book take a very small part of the text, but they add the humor and very nice personal touch, such as I did not see since Algol-68 specifications. And they also help to understand many things much better.What is probably the best thing, I like about this book, is that it does not just say what the language does, but why it does that and why it was designed this way. Frankly, I was puzzled by #region directive in C# before, and now it makes perfect sense.I also like, that this book is concentrated on the actual language, not on Microsoft tools and which key to press, when computer wants \\"any\\" key. This book respects the reader, assumes simple things, and explains complex ones. At least it worked this way for me."},{"Title":"The Dark Art of C# Programming: .Net Core Language (Series)","review":"I like this book and find it quite useful, but I agree with the previous review: it's not for everybody. Which is probably true for any book.There are two kinds of programmers: those who operate in concepts and those who just memorize slobs of APIs. In \\"Programmer's Stone\\" (check it in Wikipedia) they call it two methods of thought: mapping and packing.Packers just hoard facts, memorize them and make living out of it. Programmer-packer prides himself in knowing all the subtle details of some particular framework. They often start as technical writers or VB programmers and then moving up the stack. Programmer-packer's top of career is a local expert in, say, MFC or Java 2.0 libraries. They often can command good salaries because of impressive list of skills they can show on their resumes. Programmer-packer is indispensable if you want to get a complex framework-dependent solution. That is, if you want a complex framework-dependent solution.If you are a programmer-packer, this book is not for you. Find a thicker book. Much thicker. Better off with pictures. Seriously. I never had time to waste on those (I am mapper myself), but I know that's what packers use and love.Mappers on another hand memorize (and often create, if needed) a concept behind the facts, and quickly reproduce the facts out of the concepts. Programmer-mapper prides himself in understanding how the system works (and why it does not). Once they grow over programming, they become architects, managers, execs in their own start-ups. That's whom this book is written for.While C# is very close to C++ and Java, concepts of class, structure, interface are subtly different in these languages. And concepts like delegates are significantly different. Concepts of the C# language is what matters for a programmer-mapper and that's what this book concentrates on. In fact, two fictional personages who occasionally intrude upon the technical text are exactly these two potential readers. One of them is a C++ programmer, and another is Java programmer.I did not get the reference to Rowling in previous review. In fact, I was able to talk to the author and she was puzzled by this reference too. The small fictional fragments are merely used to illustrate some harder concepts, that's all. If the author copied somebody, I'd say it's revised standard of Algol 68, which is full of such illustrations. I also did not see anything wrong with the language, but as I mentioned, packers often start as technical writers, so the author of previous review may have noticed something with his professional eye. Anyway, I agree, view several pages of the book before you buy. They are available on Amazon site using \\"Look Inside\\" feature - just click on the image of the cover.So, if you are a mapper kind of programmer who for some reason did not learn C# yet, this book should be good for you. It's good for me. I know C#, but I still have it on my bookshelf for occasional quick reference when working on real products."},{"Title":"The Dark Art of C# Programming: .Net Core Language (Series)","review":"Far from getting a good book full of tips and tricks, the authors present little more knowledge than could be gleaned from a few sample source files. From general misstatements about other languages on, this book falls very flat. Look elsewhere."},{"Title":"The Dark Art of C# Programming: .Net Core Language (Series)","review":"I wish the rating system had something other than stars, like black holes. This book rates many of them. It deserves NO stars.If you are interested in a 5th rate version of Harry Potter, 3rd world English, and a general waste of your time, I highly recommend this book. On the other hand, if you want to learn C#, not waste your time trying to understand a grammatically obtuse collection of words (hardly sentences), and learn how to use a programming language, then go for another book - almost any book.I have a strong dislike for programming books that waste my time. I have no desire to learn about an author's dog or fishing trip, and definitely no desire to read something by a J.K. Rowling wannabe. I don't know what the author intended by the inclusion of such drivel in a software training manual but I, for one, found it a pathetic attempt at communication. Perhaps the worst aspect of this missed attempt at \`something' is that there is crucial technical information contained in this pathetic chatter between her fantasy creatures - you can't just skip the stuff.There is probably some value in this book but, since I lack a fireplace, I also lack any guess at what it would be. Of the several hundred, possibly thousand, technical manuals I have read, this is without a doubt the worst.

Fourteen-year-old Ella Wallis, the daughter of an unhappy working-class family (with a domineering, adulterous father and an insensitive, alcoholic mother) in Bristol, England, suddenly finds herself developing uncontrollable paranormal powers - books fly around her, a forceful whining sound surrounds her whenever she's frightened. As her destructive powers increase, she is ostracized by schoolmates and soon becomes the center of a media circus. The publicity provokes a three-cornered power struggle between psychic researcher Peter Guntarson, public relations mogul Jos&eacute; Miguel D&oacute;la and Ella's avaricious family. As Ella becomes more adept, capable of levitation, teleportation and worldwide healing, her intense friendship with Guntarson appears to give him the victory. But Ella's capabilities are wearing away at her health and sanity, and she may not survive Guntarson's final challenge. Geller's novel recalls the themes of both The Exorcist and Carrie, but it does so with intelligence, wit and an abundance of well-chosen detail, fleshing out even such unsympathetic characters as Ella's father, Ken. Geller's acerbic portrait of the sensationalist media adds a new twist to this predictable but engaging tale.

The book was, for me, truly a page turner. But more - I often find myself getting bored with fast-paced books if there is no sense of meaning underlying the action. With ELLA, I was compelled to keep reading, but even beyond the fully engaging plot there was a strong thematic sense that held everything together, that made me feel like I wasn't just passing the time as I read the novel.In other words, ELLA is a solid and satisfying work of fiction that is more than just entertaining - though it's certainly that as well."},{"Title":"Ella","review":"This book is increadible I mean it makes you feel like you have your own great power of White light WoW!!!

Borsch, Interim Dean of the Berkeley Divinity School at Yale and Retired Bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Los Angeles"},{"Title":"When the Members Are the Missionaries: An Extraordinary Calling for Ordinary People","review":"By the telling of fifteen personal stories of people attempting to participate in God's mission of bringing justice, peace, and compassion into the world Wayne Schwab has challenged Christians to ask the question: \\"Why am I doing what I am doing in my daily, Monday to Monday, everyday life?\\" The book summons Christ's followers to have faith that the God of compassion, revealed in Jesus, is today bringing healing and loving justice to a hurting and often brutal world, and that God's mission will be eventually realized because the forces of evil were unable to conquer the Spirit of God alive in Jesus. The author summons Christians to participation with God in this mission of justice and compassionate action. He offers a very pregnant thought: The Church doesn't have a mission; the Mission has a Church.Wayne Schwab is asking the question: Is God's mission to pluck individual souls of this world of prevalent evil, or is it God's mission to enlist his Church in the resistance of evil by participation in the victory of Jesus who remained faithful in all life's circumstances, and who continues today in the mission of this world's redemption? Schwab would maintain the latter is the Biblical witness.Schwab acknowledges the cost of the mission. Evil is a reality. Fear of evil will either lead to greater selfishness, individualism, materialism, and eventual self-destruction; or finding spiritual strength through the Church (Biblical Word, Sacramental nourishment, mutual sharing and support) Christ's followers can stand against evil and be in mission with the God of healing, love and compassion in their \\"everyday\\" lives.Schwab has given the tired western church, worried about its survival and privileges, a challenge to catch the vision which motivated the first followers of Jesus: The world can be remade according to God's intention. Schwab maintains that the victory of Jesus over the powers of evil, even death, is decisive. This victory, confirmed by the resurrection, the author maintains is the Christian's assurance to overcome fear leading to self preoccupation, and the basis for a life of concern for generosity, fairness, beauty and justice.Schwab has great faith in the sufficiency of the Church to nourish its member missionaries as they daily struggle against evil and find life's meaning in the mission of God within their homes, among their friends, at work or school, in their neighborhoods and local communities, as caretakers of this small planet, at leisure and re-creation, and as members of the Body of Christ.The book has many practical approaches for Christians seeking to join the mission of God in the world, and for churches which want to assist their members to become missionaries to God's work.Wayne Schwab has spoken a most challenging word to his fellow Christians. It is hoped the Church will listen, hear and heed.The Rev. William CooperParish Priest: The Church of The Messiah"},{"Title":"When the Members Are the Missionaries: An Extraordinary Calling for Ordinary People","review":"We hear a lot these days about Lay Ministry from commissions and task forces that never seem to go anywhere. Schwab turns the focus to the missionary role of every church member. Our goal should not be just more members to pad the rolls but more missionaries to affect change in the world. &quot;Grow the mission, not the church,&quot; says the author. The approach promises revolutionary and apostolic changes in the way we celebrate both lay and ordained vocation. Alleluia!"},{"Title":"When the Members Are the Missionaries: An Extraordinary Calling for Ordinary People","review":"I found Wayne Schwab's book to be one of thoughtful inspiration. Too often we assume it's the clergy's 'job' to set us on the right path in living a godly life -- yet Schwab shows us how that responsibility is ours. His tone is conversational and informative, and his book is peppered with lots of personal stories, so you can really relate to what he's saying on a visceral level. A much needed book for our times!"},{"Title":"When the Members Are the Missionaries: An Extraordinary Calling for Ordinary People","review":"...The basic work of the Christian Church is not done by the clergy but by the laity. Each Christian layperson is a missionary in his and her daily life and work. The Christian presidents and CEOs of the major corporations of the United States are missionaries. Perhaps if they saw their work life as missionaries rather than work life, there would be far less greed and corruption.Schwab recounts stories of lay people on mission in their daily lives. George, a letter carrier, speaks up about work conditions at his branch. Bonnie is on mission as she and her husband develop their family camping as a community of love and caring. Gloria is a missionary as she teaches math to children and adults whose math skills are stunted by their cultural conditioning.This book is to inspire clergy and lay people to see they are already on mission in their daily life and work. Following Jesus Christ is the simple yet costly call to a deepened and active Christian life. It is a call to a life of meaning, purpose and power.The book is divided into two parts. The first is to inspire people to see they are already missionaries by telling the stories of fifteen missionaries. The second part is to assist in organizing a parish around Schwab?s vision of the work of the church. I wish I had this book before I retired as a parish rector. It would have been invaluable to Trinity, San Francisco in doing God?s work in the city. Practical steps in changing worship patterns to involve lay people more, developing preaching styles and discovering ways of training leaders are offered.My main criticism is the use of the word missionary. Schwab knows it has the evil connotation of patronizing and patriarchal conversion of people that are poor, marginalized and people in the third world. He boldly uses the word in its true meaning as people sent from God to bring love, peace and justice into the world.Once the reader gets past the word missionary, the book is a dynamic and powerful call to viewing the work of the church not as a numbers game of church growth but as deepening he commitment of each baptized Christian to follow Jesus Christ in the work of compassion in the world."},{"Title":"When the Members Are the Missionaries: An Extraordinary Calling for Ordinary People","review":"I am always dismayed when church bulletins declare every member to be a minister when nothing is being done to offer training and support for what they are already doing. This book is about the way ordinary Christians live Monday to Saturday and it is long overdue. It shifts the focus from congregational maintenance in which churches struggle to survive while maintaining all the institutional trappings. It moves us from the seductive power of numbers towards vibrant mission in the daily arenas in which we laity find ourselves. It sounds a call to grow the mission and not the church. While providing a glimpse into the daily lives of fifteen ordinary people, Schwab grounds his missiology by demonstrating how mission transforms life as the power of God's love and justice works through them. The second part of the book takes the form of a manual to reorganize a congregation to support its members as missionaries, and describes what such a church would look like when the daily missions of its members come before maintenance of the status quo.The call to match our private spirituality with a public spirituality is long overdue and goes hand in hand with a call to move from a relationship with God and the church based upon submission, to one of partnership with God in mission. If I'm treated like a sheep by the church, I'll act like a sheep. Conversely, when mission becomes central, the laity become central. This book offers a way for churches to stop ignoring the way members live. Those called to be clergy in the institutional church are seen as support for those who go out of the church doors each Sunday to their own mission arenas, where they work to transform the world through love and justice and seek to make Christ known. This is God's sacramental work in the world, not merely one more demand to do one more thing for the church. Now there's a twist that could lead us to a second Reformation!How we understand the atonement is central to missionary spirituality. I was especially appreciative of his call for a theology of the cross that moves away from substitutionary atonement to that of Christus Victor. Jesus made himself subject to the sins of those around him and died as a result of our sins, not in payment for them. Missionaries join with Jesus in the ongoing struggle against evil in the power of the Holy Spirit.Having spent some of my life in management roles, I found the chapter on leadership challenging. Drawing upon the work of Abraham Zaleznik, the distinction is made between managers, who make better that which is already working, and leaders, who transform what is working into something new. Such a transformation is central to Schwab's thesis, in which he states that the Mission has a Church, not the Church has a mission. A congregation is designed to get the results it is getting. The culture of the church has made and continues to make the church an end in itself, but God is dismantling the church in order to make it new. Secular organizational development theory helps if we view the church as a system and ask what that system produces. It is not producing members who are missionaries. It is producing compliant, loyal members. I found the following sentence important in clarifying what is the true mission of the church:\\"The result of the Christian mission cannot be to bring people into the church. The end has to be the building up of the world by those baptized in Jesus Christ who live as agents of the reign of God - as missionaries.\\" (Chapter 8, Getting Your Head and Heart into the Vision, p. 105)Mission is at the door of the church. The true mission outpost is each daily arena in which each lay person is found. Such a vision can be realized by any size congregation. To acknowledge this and act upon it means making drastic changes because many congregations are holding on to a belief system upon which they have depended for years.Good training has always been important to Wayne Schwab, and the starting point is provided in the text. Citing already proven methodologies, he provides practical approaches for members to participate in God's mission, and makes no bones about the fact that this involves redesigning the congregation.This book challenges structures and ecclesiologies. Long term change takes negotiation and compromise. When the Members are the Missionaries is a guide for the journey towards discovering what God's mission looks like in a post-Christendom, post-modern context. It is an invaluable resource."},{"Title":"When the Members Are the Missionaries: An Extraordinary Calling for Ordinary People","review":"Christendom is dead.Are we moving into a post-Christian age or a pre-Christian age? Can we recapture the excitement of living on the mission frontier? Can we accept the call in Ephesians 4: 11&12 where apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors and teachers ... equip the members for the work of the church? Can we understand that those called to be \\"ministers\\" in the institution of the church are meant to be support for the ministers who go forth each Sunday into the local mission field?These are not new questions --- we have wrestled with them for years. We have lifted up the ministry of the baptized, the ministry of the laity, every member ministry, the ministry of the saints and any other name we could come up with for the ministry of the people. We held up the vision and said GO.Slowly a few brave souls began to think of themselves, to think of their identity, as being ministers in the world. They came back excited. They proclaimed to all who would listen: the bible was right --- the people are hungry --- the fields are ripe --- the harvest is ready. Best of all, this ministry stuff is fun, exciting, exhilarating! God's not only letting us work with Him, its His plan. WOW!But wait. How can it be that the workers are still so few? The answer is painfully simple. For years we have exhorted, pushed and prodded the laity, but how much real training have we provided.That training --- or the starting point for that training --- is what Wayne Schwab is providing in When the Members are the Missionaries. Not only that, he gives us solid proven methodologies for that training. He starts by holding up models, and not some super human models we can never aspire to, but people just like you and me. People just like those who sit in our pews each week. He then gives us practical easy to follow methodologies. The guidance we need to not only start, but to see the job through.Thanks Wayne. What a great idea. Nice simple directions for a proven process."},{"Title":"When the Members Are the Missionaries: An Extraordinary Calling for Ordinary People","review":"Most lay and clergy in my experience do not have my dream of our functions in Christ's world: Christ's people doing His work in the world with the church as support and encouragement for His people in that work. At last, there is book/manual that describes inspiring laity who are living that dream and a road map for how that dream can be realized for all with a transformation in the institution, the Church. Schwab has written a book for both the laity and the clergy, reaching both with clarity and practicality.In 40 years as an Episcopalian and 6 years on a Diocesan Commission on Ministry and 3 years as Chair of the Commission on the Ministry of the Laity, my frustration has been enormous, because my dream was so far from what was happening in the Church . Now, there is hope at last!!!"},{"Title":"When the Members Are the Missionaries: An Extraordinary Calling for Ordinary People","review":"As an Episcopal clergyperson who has worked for Total Ministry for three decades, I applaud this book for introducing a paradigm change in the ongoing discussion.It gives practical, step-by-step suggestions of how to re-structure congregational life so as to support each member's &quot;Monday Ministries&quot;. This approach gives the reader new energy to try out Schwab's plan."},{"Title":"When the Members Are the Missionaries: An Extraordinary Calling for Ordinary People","review":"Religious activities are a means to the ends of experiencing a more meaningful life. But this is often not the case. Church can become just another place to seek comfort and belonging rather than empowerment.Despite decades spent within the halls of institutional Christianity, this author has a passion to change all that. He can be described as in the clergy, but not of the clergy. His message is that ordinary people can pursue profound mission work in the pathways of daily life.Anyone yearning for spiritual growth and better relationships in their lives could benefit from this book. Although the book is clearly written for church leaders, I think that the non-church going crowd known as \\"seekers\\" might benefit from it as well.Although you have to wade through some church theology (ugh!) to get to it, this book has simple suggestions to improve one's sense of purpose and the quality of relationships. It is applied, not preachy, and much more substantive than some of the \\"spiritual guru\\" offerings that abound today.The author suggests that you sit down and list the six main communities (mission fields) that you interact with in daily life: home, work, local community, wider world, leisure, church (non-church goers could substitute something else here). Then he provides 7 questions to ask yourself about each of these mission fields.Refreshingly, there are many real-life stories provided, showing how other people have utilized the author's approach and questions to improve their lives, as well as the lives of others around them. You meet a working mother trying to find quiet time in her busy schedule, a father who wants to keep peace in his family, an employee who wants to speak up at work.Most notably, the author even shares his struggles in trying to cope with a tendency towards defensiveness with his wife and others.The last section of the book provides thoughtful suggestions for church leaders to develop a culture that would empower the laity to see themselves as missionaries in daily life.The author's own passionate effort to transform people's lives and institutionalized religion is perhaps the best proof that his simple, powerful approach works."},{"Title":"The Lake of the Sky","review":"It's nice Book Lots of pictures in Black and white.

A picture is worth a thousand words."},{"Title":"How to Build Glued-Lapstrake Wooden Boats","review":"This is a great book for any boatbuilder, especially the home builder like I am. I have built 3 lapstrake boats, 2 hard chine boats and 1 cedar strip and I like glued lapstrake the best. John's book has a great amount of detail. I wish I had this book years ago. I really like his method of planking without clamps. He screws down battens instead. The building frame and mold set up allow you to get underneath to scrape excess epoxy before it cures. He focuses on minimizing sanding after the planking is all done. Sanding can easily take as long as building if you do a sloppy job. Many shopmade jigs and neat ideas are shown like such as: angle gauge, gain-o-matic, circular saw batten guide when ripping strakes, and many others. I was very interested in the section on finishing. I saw one of John's boats in person at a Mystic seaport small craft event and I thought for sure the finish was sprayed. It was not. It was beautiful. John's craftsmanship is first rate and probably the best I have seen in glued lapstrake boats. His attention to detail carries over into his writing. Ruth Ann Hill deserves a lot of credit too for the high quality boats and this book. Not many people can do both building and writing well, but they pull it off. I hope he comes out with more boat plans in the future."},{"Title":"How to Build Glued-Lapstrake Wooden Boats","review":"I am someone who has to think twice on which is the business end of a hammer, but after reading this book I am nearly to a point of conversion on wanting a new hobby. In a delightful, light, humorous tone, Brooks and Hill give step-by-step instructions on how to build a glued-lapstrake wooden boat. The book has a drawing or a photograph on practically every one of its 270 pages. Useful drawings and graphics and notes for how to do hundreds of steps pop up every other page. Clever ways to do things, jigs you can build, tools you can construct yourself, serendipitous discoveries, and hints and tricks and lessons learned from their own mistakes appear in jaw-dropping detail throughout the book, shared in a reassuring \\"don't worry, if we can do it, so can you!\\" tone. Brooks and Hill obviously have great senses of humor and untold amounts of patience and resourcefulness which they transmit to the reader, page after page, from the beginning of the project to the bitter end of painting, varnishing, installing hardware, and even launching.Brooks and Hill seem to have anticipated every spot in the process where a builder might encounter a pesky problem or where goofups are common. They are there ahead of time to warn of the potential problem, and they're there after the fact with a fix-up if the goofup occurs anyway. This advice has to be worth its weight in gold, considering the number of complicated steps involved.I am not a religious person, but just knowing that there is a paragraph in this biblical work on what I can do if my keelson warps or how I can fix it if my spiling pattern for the sheerstrake curves out into free space gives me spiritual reassurance. Read it yourself and see if you don't feel just a little better about the state of the world -- even if you never build a boat!"},{"Title":"How to Build Glued-Lapstrake Wooden Boats","review":"Although I enjoy reading John Gardner's books the most, when it comes time to build this is the book I'll have on my workbench. It's packed with more info than any other book I've seen and answers all those nagging questions. It's by far the best Bible on boat building. The only part about his boat building technique I question is the use of screws, battens, and small blocks of wood to replace clamps. Guess I'll have to try it both ways to be convinced it's easier. Hat's off to you John. Good work.Neil"},{"Title":"How to Build Glued-Lapstrake Wooden Boats","review":"Some year ago, I retired from a business career and with no manual skills. Almost immediately I traveled to the WoodenBoat School in Maine to take several classes, where John Brooks was (and I hope still is) an instructor. I made my first \\"breasthook\\", which involves cutting very accurate angles into a single piece of wood, and John then gave it the \\"flashlight test\\". If any light showed between the piece and the sheer plank it was supposed to fit perfectly against ... fail! Yep, I failed. John is a perfectionist, which I imagine most master boat builders have to be..and his own work shows it. One day, just outside of the WoodenBoat shop, I spied the most beautiful little rowing and sailing dinghy I had ever seen, sitting on the lawn, 12 feet in length she was, if I remember correctly. The worksmanship was just amazing. So, the builder just had to be John Brooks! And, of course, it was. So, I took 40 or 50 photos of it, from every imaginable angle. I then purchased the plans for that beauty, which John has named the \\"Ellen\\", along with a copy of his \\"How To Build Glued Lapstrake Boats\\", which describes the easy to follow step-by-step approach to building the Ellen. I then had just enough experience and information to head home and be \\"dangerous\\". I would finally build my first boat. Working on it part time, I completed a 16 foot version of Ellen. Like reading a good novel, I was a little sad when she was finished, but oh so proud of the results. I think even John would give me a thumbs-up on how she turned out, all the way down to the old fashioned wooden mast hoops, and how she sails, with her proud gaff rigged sail, which my wife machined sewed from a kit we found on the Internet. Everywhere we now go to sail, people crowd around with eyes wide and compliment my (John's) beautiful boat. \\"How To Build Glued Lapstrake Boats\\" was my easy to follow guide. I highly recommend this book to someone new to boat building who wants a true beauty for his or her first boat, along with the experience of learning the essentials of a time honored trade.

However, I have never built a boat before and I needed a text which provided information from the ground up.This book is first class. The authors provide a step by step approach to every single minute aspect of the building process. There are many innovative ideas and the book is generally written with great clarity. You will need a working knowledge of marine and woodworking terminology and you will probably spend ten or twenty minutes reading, rereading and reflecting on the techniques and steps involved in many sections. But the sheer beauty of the book is that it is all there so we can all get cracking.Many thanks to the authors for writing such an excellent book and for giving all of us the opportunity to embark on the beautiful craft of glued clinker (lapstrake) wooden boatbuilding."},{"Title":"How to Build Glued-Lapstrake Wooden Boats","review":"The ability to design and build beautiful boats is one thing. The ability to convey an ostensibly complex process with clearly organized, well-written text is another. John and Ruth bring these abilities together to produce one of the best boat-building books that I have come across so far.I bought How to Build Glued-Lapstrake Boats because I am currently building John's 12-foot sailing/rowing boat Ellen, but this book is more than a manual for building one of John's designs. If you are considering glued-lapstrake construction, it is indispensible. Not only is every stage of the process covered in depth, but each chapter is full of woodworking tips, useful jigs, and information on what to do when mistakes are made. In past boat projects I have run into problems that I did not expect. To see these inevitable mishaps addressed with very clear instruction is refreshing and is something that I have not found in other books. John's advice provides elegant, common-sense solutions to a lot of little issues that I have struggled with in the past.The highlights: very clear writing style, comprehensive description of the building process based on years of experience, great perspective on woodworking, tools, how to build efficiently, plus mistakes and how to handle them.The low points: some of the black and white images make it hard to see as much detail as I would like. In fairness, to include higher resolution color images in a book like this would probably not be cost effective.The plans that I received for Ellen are the most accurate and complete plans that I have worked from so far. It is not surprising that the book shares this same detail-oriented, accurate, and comprehensive style that John and Ruth have aspired to.

It has very comprehensive chapters written in practical language for the new boat builder covering everything from plans to finishing. The book is logically laid out and each chapter covers a specific activity of a boat's build. There is also good coverage of the tools, timbers and glues required for boat building. Although written primarily for the North American market, there is no problem with the book for those outside North America, except perhaps the use of the imperial measurement system instead of metric. It could usefully have had both measurement systems to save the reader doing all the calculations. There are dozens of black and white photos throughout the book and these support the text well, although some are a bit dark or too distant to really see any detail. If you were building the John Brooks design 'Ellen', then this book would be a great addition to the plans. Having said that, it would still be an excellent reference for building any design of lapstrake boat.

To my mind, you have to consider his work broadly. First, there's the early work (not published until he was around 40) that made him famous--the surreal Tropics, Black Spring, Hamlet, etc--and then there's the serene, calmer but still freewheeling books (written roughly between the ages of 50 and 90) that show Miller reaching more to live like a Zen master. He is, by 65, almost the complete opposite of the narrator of Tropic of Cancer. Selections of all are here. What you take from this mostly is how much of an honest, thoughtful and warm human being he was, and how freely he recommended friends and other writers.

It has a brutal depiction of Mexican Americans as not just losers, but real idiots as well. I can't believe Pike got away with this in this genre. Then it has Pike's now common, New Age Consciossness as filler. I've already forgotten most of the plot. There's just not much here."},{"Title":"Remember Me 2: The Return","review":"WARNING: This reveiw tells parts of the end, since it was written for school!Remember Me 2: The Return by Christopher Pike was an okay book. Wait, I take that back. It was not bad, or anything, but it was not okay. Why don't we settle on unpleasant?Jean Rodrigues had just gotten pregnant with her boyfriend's baby. She had just told him when she fell off a balcony and the baby died. She would've died too-except now Shari Cooper is assuming the position of Wanderer in her body.Shari's job now is to help the world somehow, in a human's body-particularly Jean's. In this case, it is her job to write books inspiring and helping others.And here is where the problem ensues. (In the book itself.) We have the basis, correct. But where is the actual plot? The rest of the book is almost an unorganized, boring journal entry, lacking plot and excitement. It drabs on to say that Jean meets a patient in the hospital (who later dies) for whom she writes a story. Then, ofcourse, the reader wonders what the story is about, so Christopher Pike makes me wish I never asked, by putting in the entire story. Around fifteen pages.To make things more complicated, the story is completely weird and a tad psychotic. It is about a writer and how one day she discovers how she has a troll for a muse who likes women, money, and long phone calls. She is then forced to give her muse most of her money until she goes to a local author and gets him to solve her problem by presenting it to him in the way of a story-line. So she seduces the troll-muse (content not suitable for children under the age of thirteen (in other words, not exactly pleasant to read)) and locks him in the closet. The end.Then Shari goes on to put to rest the wonders of her friends and family. (Like her house cleaner, for example, (her real mother) who she let know that Shari really loved her as a mother and knew who she was)Okay. Analysis time! Put on your seat-belt, because it is time for my trademark rant. The exits are at the top of the page incase you decide to click the \\"back\\" button in exhaustion!(deep breath)Even though this book was at my reading level, written by Christopher Pike, a sequel to an awesome book, and liked by most, I still can't understand why the publisher published it. Maybe because Christoper Pike signed a book-deal?Okay. It would appeal to the majority of today's teen population as an okay book. I say that mainly because there were a majority of characters who were buff Hispanic gang members who smoked pot and drunk. And were essentially \\"good for nothing\\" as some would put it. However, I think I am the only one (that I know of) to go that far. Most would say Pike accurately depicted the inner-city atomosphere. Which might be true, but I found it as though he was going by some huge stereotype. Another reason most would like it is because it has the whole \\"go for hope\\", \\"there is such thing as a heaven\\", \\"if you do well in this life you get to go back and do good for human kind\\" message. Maybe most teenagers need to believe that, or they do already, and so this book can relate to their beliefs (therefore they like it). Does it make a difference that I don't believe such things? Maybe. Hehe, look at me, as I am ranting on and on here I realized another major reason why I don't like this book:Religious content.Okay, so Christopher is not (to my knowledge) a die-hard religious freak preaching to others who god is and whatnot. But, he did go a bit over-board with the whole god-afterlife thing. Even though in this book god was... well, not what most people believe, you still had to read about three chapters of Shari asking some super-natural from heaven questions about it. That was a little much for me.To go back to the whole plot-thing:This book also had so many different plots and chapters dealing with so many people it didn't work, it was too overwhelming. This might have worked if it was some novel where you needed to know everything, otherwise you wouldn't get anything, but not here, where knowing too much could lead your brain to nearly explode and, therefore, take away from the main enjoyment of even reading the book.As I am sitting here typing this, I realize that maybe Christopher Pike wanted to kind of do an epilogue on Shari and whatnot. But then his publisher told him it had to be around three hundred pages and be an actual story, resulting in a hodge-podge of an epilogue and Christopher Pike's interpretation of the afterlife and Shari's struggle with it. This will remain a mystery forever to those not Christopher Pike or his editor, and so we can only infer.I admit, this book did nicely sum up Shari's life and whatnot. It answered some questions that I had at the end of the first book. But I still would've been better-off if I hadn't read it and left those things to my imagination.I think if I don't end this soon it will never end.So I will end with these last few sentences:All in all, this book didn't really \\"click\\" for me. It was a bit lovey-dovey, without a real plot, and dull. An unpleasant read. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, simply because I didn't like it, but I'm not saying others would hate it. Some people may have loved it, that's just how I felt.(whew)"},{"Title":"Remember Me 2: The Return","review":"How stereotypical can we get?

These beings are called Wanderers, but she is attacked by creatures that have a special hatred toward Wanderers.Shari Cooper did not return into another body until the last 20 pages of the book. In fact, she was barely in the book that was supposed to revolve around her.There were no creatures that she falls into conflict with. There was no conflict at all... or a plot for that matter. After reading this painfully boring novel, I thought to myself, \\"What was the point of this?\\"It was very uneventful... boring if you will, which is shocking for a Pike book because I had never read one I didnt like before \\"Rememebr Me 2\\".Pike's usually so brilliant but this sequel did not live up to its origonal.

She starts remembering things that she's never remembered ever hearing or seeing, etc.Again, this is kind of cliched and may seem a little cheesy, but it is a good read, in my opinion. This is my favorite book in the trilogy (even though I haven't read the third one). There isn't as much action as in the first one.

The sequal, on the other hand, seems to follow the pattern set by authors like R.L. Stine-bad writing and storyline, and improbable characters and dialogue, written as fast as possible. This is what happens when bad books become successful, formerly interesting writers take note of the pattern and start cranking out sludge that refuses to take into account their readers' intelligence. &quot;Remember Me 2&quot; wasn't the worst example of this pattern, but it's definately inferior to its predeccesor."},{"Title":"Remember Me 2: The Return","review":"I have today finished 'Remember Me 2' and thought it was a bit confusing.

Almost half the book is devoted to the story of Jean Rodrigues. Then Shari Cooper comes into play and so the story of her life continues. The rest of the book is devoted to the back and forth story of Shari/Jean and the afterlife of Shari. Overall, I think the book is worth reading.

The story goes as most of us know, but here's the details if you don't remember them. This emperor is fond of fine clothes, but two tricksters introduce their magic cloth that only the wise can see. So the emperor pays them to make him some clothes of that cloth. Then the emperor asks everybody to take a look to see whether or not they are a fool. But since, &quot;there was nothing on the loom to see&quot; nobody could see a strand of cloth. But to avoid being thought of as a fool, they make up comments on the cloth. Then when the emperor can't see the cloth, he worries that he's a fool. So he makes up comments as well and says he'll wear them in the next parade. Everybody, who hears that fools can't see the cloth, wonder, &quot;Will I be able to see the cloth?&quot; Then when the parade begins, everybody pretends to see the clothes until a little girl points out, &quot;But he hasn't got any clothes on!&quot; Then everybody is shouting the whole truth, and the emperor realizes, &quot;He was the fool. He had been tricked.&quot; And he thinks, &quot;Just wait until I get my hands on those tricksters!&quot; But it's too late-the tricksters took off with all the money, and as the book says, &quot;They were no fools!&quot; An interesting detail is the artist's perspective of the famous finale of the emperor having no clothes on(or in modern versions, he's in his underwear), the emperor's underwear is depicted as long underwear(it looks like pajamas)and slippers. Another interesting detail of the artwork is that while the emperor(Prince John)is a lion and the two scoundrels(Foulfellow and Gideon)are a fox and a cat, all the other characters(prime minister, general, townspeople)are all humans.

He finds that agape as verb or noun occurs 262 times in the New Testament; philia as verb or noun occurs 23 times, which does not include philia's derivatives translated \\"kiss\\" or \\"brother\\" nor its adjectival and adverbial forms.An examination of the entire New Testament reveals that both agape and philia are used in reference to (1) the Father's love for the Son, (2) the Lord's love for humans, (3) Jesus' love for humans, (4) human love for Jesus, and (5) human love for humans. Upon examining every instance of agape and philia in the New Testament, Butler concludes that for every utterance of philia there is an example of agape expressing nearly the same idea (70). Ironically, agape is the only love word of the two used to describe the love of humans for Jesus and God, a fact placing in question Anders Nygren's preference for labeling human response as faith rather than agape. Furthermore, the verb form of agape is never used to speak of God's love for humans in the Synoptic Gospels, another fact that should have led Nygren to reconsider his thesis.I recommend this book.Thomas Jay Oord"},{"Title":"Meaning of 'Agapao' and 'Phileo' in the Greek New Testament","review":"This short, punchy work takes aim at the very common view that agapao and phileo indicate very different kinds of love in the NT. Butler fires rapidly but with great precision, and he takes the time to do what few scholars seem to have done: he actually looks at all the uses of the two Greek words in the NT. He shows convincingly that every kind of use of phileo is matched by a synonymous use of agapao. The two words are synonyms, not denominators of vast and mutually excluding theological systems. He concludes that agapao and phileo both mean the same thing, and we have a perfect English word for it: \\"love.\\"Butler was particularly helpful with John 21:15-17. He also writes with real verve, personality, and humor without going over the top.Butler fails almost entirely to discuss linguistics and how it might enlighten the problem. For example, a discussion of sense and reference might have helped him not to overstate his case when it comes to what Mois&eacute;s Silva might call a \\"technically charged\\" use of one of the Greek words in question. But Butler's methods are still generally sound. Who can argue with usage? What this book may lack in linguistic sophistication, it makes up for in punchiness. A quick, genuinely helpful read--and this reviewer has been reading a lot on the topic."},{"Title":"Meaning of 'Agapao' and 'Phileo' in the Greek New Testament","review":"Butler is very thorough in cataloging the instances of both Greek words in the NT, but his logic in comparing them is lacking. Much of his argument rests on the fact that since both words are used in regards to the same relationships (i.e. God to man, Jesus to disciples, disciples to God, etc), they must mean the same thing. Butler is presupposing that phileo and agapao both should be defined as \\"love.\\" This is the fallacy of begging the question. We use multiple words to describe our relationships to other people; this does not make them synonyms. To apply Butler's method to English: If I say, \\"I think about Jane\\" and \\"I talk about Jane,\\" think and talk must mean the same thing!"},{"Title":"Meaning of 'Agapao' and 'Phileo' in the Greek New Testament","review":"Interesting but dated analysis of Agape and Phile. Plows no new ground, nor does it unearth what has always been in the field to discover:* Agape is to Phile as Substance is to Substantiation.* Agape is to Phile as Gold coin is to Value Stamped on itexpressing the metal's intrinsic worth: blank disc vs.finished minted coin with all images denominating it.* Agape is to Phile as Beloved is to Befriending.* Agape is to Phile as Affection is to Expressing of it.* Agape is to Phile as Love is to Lover-of.* The much misunderstood dialog between Jesus and Peter inJohn 21 is cleared up knowing there is no inherent differencein quality of love. Jesus uses Agape twice ending with Phile;Peter uses Phile all 3 times: 'Simon, do you have love forMe more than these others do? Yes, Lord, You know I am alover-of You. Repeat. Simon, are you a lover-of Me? Lord, Youknow all things, You know I am a lover-of You.'* Or phrase it:'Do you consider Me precious gold coinage? Yes,Lord:Drachma/Shekel,heads&tails;,You're all mine!* The main thing missing from this incomplete analysis iscareful examination of Septuagint translation of Old Test.into Greek. When Agape vs. Phile are compared, much lightis thrown onto the New Testament usage. Agape-root is neverused for Expression-of love, love-as-shown such as kiss,embrace, hug, befriend. It's always Phile-root.* Fresh light is also thrown on the concept of 'Friend-of'.This is always a Phile-root, e.g. where Paul mentions beinga 'Philo-theos', a Lover-of God. Contrary to popular beliefwhen Luke writes to Theophilus, it's not 'Lover-of God',butrather 'One whom God is Lover-of'.Unfortunately this book nearly 30 years outdated does not grasp the above distinctions found clearly in LXX of OT clearly informing NT usage.Agape is the noun; Phile is the 'verbal-noun-made-visible-audible' giving expression to the underlying Agape. Or as James would say: just as Faith without Works is dead, so Agape, if it is not expressed and demonstrated a la Phile, is dead."},{"Title":"NATURAL VALUE","review":"This brilliant book contains Friedrich Freiherr von Wieser's statement of marginal utility as formulated by the Austrian school (Book I), his abstraction from differences of purchasing power which make prices deviate from \\"natural value\\" (Book II), his application of marginal utility theory to the valuation of producer goods through \\"imputation\\" (Books III and IV), his interpretation of cost as indirect utility, or sacrifice of wealth capable of other uses than that to which it is actually put, that is, as opportunity cost -- the theorem which later has been called \\"Wieser's law\\" (Book V), and his attempt to extend the theory of value to principles of taxation (Book VI).Wieser's best known contribution to the development of economic thought is his investigation of the relation between cost and value from the point of view of subjective value theory: given the quantity of the factors of production, competition for factors in the different lines of employment will distribute them in such a way that the values of their different products allow them to earn the same total amount in every alternative use. This early version of opportunity cost, as it was later called by the American theorist Herbert J. Davenport, involved abandoning the search for real cost which the classical economists had regarded as desirable. It was a theory of great elegance which used human behavior as the point of departure for the explanation of value in the field of consumer as well as producer goods and gave internal consistency to the whole theory of value. It was the first comprehensive attempt to apply marginal utility economics to the structure of production and thus to unify the laws of value and distribution. William Smart's edition of 1893, which followed the German original (1889) within four years, facilitated its wide acceptance in the English-speaking world."},{"Title":"Textual Criticism of the Hebrew Bible: An Introduction","review":"The book is authoritative and well editted. There is an established tradition in Judaism of how the text was written and how to read what on the surface appears as a deviation from grammar or inconsistency in the meaning of the text. Criticism devoid of any tradition is unfortunately based exclusively on one's chosen ideology. The book perfectly explains this point, which is definitely honest and praiseworthy of the author E. Tov who tries hard to be neutral. The book also shows that all the present day critics are familiar with the Jewish interpretation of the text. Hence, the main lesson one can learn from the book is that although there are many improper ways one can convince oneself why the Jewish interpretation is wrong, the final criticism is always reserved for G-d, the Author of the Hebrew Bible. The claims of the professional textual critics, whether driven by desire to prove that the masoretic text is not authentic or by a desire to fit in among the left-wing academia, or to win yet another research grant by cooking up a new radically deviant interpretation, happen to be mostly a negative contribution to the overall understanding of the text."},{"Title":"Textual Criticism of the Hebrew Bible: An Introduction","review":"The reviews of the first edition were glowing, and rightly so because this is a superb book.

There are some brief introductions around, but they do not begin to match the depth and erudition of this book. Tov is a brilliant scholar, and one of the World's leading authorities on the Septuagint and the Dead Sea scrolls, so he is well qualified to write this book."},{"Title":"Textual Criticism of the Hebrew Bible: An Introduction","review":"Reading \\"Textual Criticism of the Hebrew Bible\\" by Emanuel Tov was both a joy and a challenge. I thoroughly enjoyed immersing myself in the world of the Hebrew Bible. Ancient manuscripts, Dead Sea Scroll finds, ancient versions, textual variants -- all of these things stir the Bible-geek in me. At the same time, the state of current scholarship with regard to the Old Testament text can be a bit troubling to an evangelical Christian. While the New Testament stands affirmed by numerous manuscript discoveries to the extent that almost all textual critics can agree on the vast majority of the minute details of the text, the same cannot be said for the Hebrew Old Testament.Emanuel Tov takes readers of all scholastic levels by the hand as he surveys the field of Old Testament textual criticism. This third edition of his classic textbook, explains things for the novice and scholar alike. Careful footnotes and innumerable bibliographic entries will impress the scholar, while charts, graphs and numerous glossaries keep the would-be scholar feeling like he is getting somewhere. I have no problem admitting that I am one of the would-be scholars, with barely a year of Hebrew under my belt. Yet I was able to work my way through this book, becoming sharper in my Hebrew and awakening to the many facets of the intriguing study of OT textual criticism.Tov has departed from a more traditional stance in his earlier versions, opting instead to follow the evidence from the Dead Sea Scrolls and contemporary studies. He manages to keep away from a fatal skepticism, however, arguing that textual evaluation still has merit. The aim is still to recover the earliest possible text, but the recognition that there are often two or three competing literary editions of the text complicate the matter. An example would be the different editions of Jeremiah, with the Septuagint (LXX) Greek version differing drastically from the Hebrew Masoretic Text (MT). 1 Samuel provides another example with a Dead Sea Scroll offering perhaps a third different competing literary edition. Tov points out the two very different versions of the story of David and Goliath and Hannah's prayer as he expounds on the problem.Rather than trying to solve each exegetical or specific textual problem, Tov aims to illustrate the challenges facing the would-be textual critic. He surveys the textual data, and reconstructs the history of the text - giving more attention to the accidents of history, such as the destruction of the Jewish state in A.D. 70, as weighing into the nature of the textual evidence we have. Rather than the Masoretic Text gradually gaining dominance, it was the de facto winner of the \\"text wars\\". The LXX-style Hebrew texts (which the Dead Sea Scrolls and other finds have confirmed existed), were ignored by the Jews as Christianity had owned the LXX as its own. The Samaritans had their version of the Pentateuch, and the existence of a variety of other text forms, such as those found at Qumran (the DSS) were forgotten with the cessation of a normal state of existence for Jewish people. The Masoretic text found itself with little real competition and over the years came to be further refined and stable. I should clarify here, that this is not to downplay the Masoretic text, as it manifestly preserves very ancient readings, and Tov repeatedly affirms the remarkable tenacity of the MT. Instead, Tov is saying that the majority position the MT holds among the textual evidence and in the minds of the Jewish communities in the last 1800 years should not prejudice the scholar to consistently prefer MT readings. Tov in fact claims that text types, such as are commonly discussed in NT textual criticism, are largely irrelevant in dealing with the OT text. Internal considerations are key in textual evaluation. I will let Tov explain further:\\"Therefore, it is the choice of the most contextually appropriate reading that is the main task of the textual critic.... This procedure is as subjective as can be. Common sense, rather than textual theories, is the main guide, although abstract rules are sometimes also helpful.\\"(pg. 280)Tov's textbook goes into glorious detail concerning all the orthographic features that make up paleo-Hebraic script, and the square Hebrew script we are familiar with. His knowledge is encyclopedic, to say the least. The numerous images of manuscripts that are included in the back of the book are invaluable. His discussion on the orthographic details of the text should convince even the most diehard traditionalists, that the vowel points and many of the accents were later additions to the text, inserted by the Masoretes. Some still defend the inspiration of the vowel points, but Tov's explanation of numerous textual variants that flow from both a lack of vowel points and from the originality of paleo-Hebraic script (and the long development of the language and gradual changes in the alphabet, and etc.) close the door against such stick-in-the-mud thinking.Tov's book details the pros and cons of different Hebrew texts, as well as discussing electronic resources and new developments in the study of textual criticism. His work is immensely valuable to anyone interested in learning about textual criticism, and of course is required for any textual scholars seeking to do work in this field.Tov doesn't add a theology to his textual manual, however. And this is what is needed to navigate OT textual criticism. After having read Tov, I'm interested in seeing some of the better evangelical treatments of the textual problems of the Hebrew Bible. I believe we have nothing to fear in facing textual problems head on. Seeing different literary editions of the text can fill out our understanding of the underlying theology of the Bible as we have it. Some of the work of John H. Sailhamer illustrates this judicious use of contemporary scholarship concerning the literary strata of the text.Tov's book is not law, and he sufficiently qualifies his judgments. He stresses that textual criticism, especially for the Old Testament, is inherently subjective. It is an art. And those who don't recognize that, are especially prone to error in this field. This book equips the student to exercise this art in the best possible way. Tov walks the reader through evaluating competing textual variants, and his study will furnish the careful reader with all the tools to develop their own approach to the text. Tov's findings won't erode the foundations of orthodox theology. I contend that they will strengthen it. As with NT textual criticism, paying attention to the textual details has unlooked-for and happy consequences. It strengthens exegesis, and allows for a greater insight into the meaning of the text. And it can build one's faith.Bible-geeks, aspiring scholars, teachers and students alike will benefit from this book. Understanding the current state of OT textual criticism puts many of the NT textual debates into perspective. Christians don't know their Old Testaments well enough, and studying the text to this level is rare indeed. I encourage you to consider adding this book to your shelf, and making it a priority to think through the challenges surrounding the text of the Hebrew Bible.Disclaimer: This book was provided by Fortress Press.

It certainly has no theological axe to grind. However, I was dissappointed that the major differences between LXX and Masoretic were not pointed out eg. psalm 40:7, may be if a christian was to see its use in Heb 10:v? it might be a bit controversial? May be this would explain why Hebrews nearly did not make it into the canon of the NT? But this is not the purpose of the book! The plates are an excellent idea as you get to see the 'evidence' so to speak. A glossary of terms would be a good idea so that one can easily decipher what 'orthography' and 'morphology' are for example, without having to search for clues. On the whole a most pleasant book which certainly delivers the goods."},{"Title":"Textual Criticism of the Hebrew Bible: An Introduction","review":"As I started diving in translation and text criticism, I needed a pratical introduction to the matter.

This high information-density volume contains a wealth of knowledge, examples, and fairly readable text about the subject - and the CD is actually helpful!At the beginning of the semester I had no idea what material the electromagnetics class consisted of, but now at the end I can look back and see a large number of topics presented in a fairly logical progression. The book's modus operandi is: teach/review the underlying math concept, then use that math to tackle an electromagnetics problem. I enjoyed this approach a lot, though I agree with my professor that the order of presentation is a little questionable. We shuffled between chapters 3 and 4 so as not to dwell on pure math as much and instead deal with physical, practical problems. For example, instead of learning both divergence and curl simultaneously, we first learned divergence and then used it solve some problems involving Electric fields. Then we went back, learned curl, and applied it to different problems.I was overwhelmed with the sheer variety of topics covered in this course. There seemed to be too many ways to do problems, and I couldn't get a good feel for when to use which method. The book's examples and explanations helped for homework sets, but come test time I usually knew three ways to solve it but wasn't sure which way would produce the proper result. In an hour testing situation, I don't have time to try out all three ways on every problem!There must be a way to teach these concepts in a more targeted method, but I don't know how. I feel I have a good knowledge of the material from the book, though, and the CD's examples were very good. The CD showed step-by-step work for problems from the text, and had its own examples not in the book that did a good job demonstrating a concept. Don't throw away the CD!The svelte size of this book impresses me, because it shows the author cared enough to trim his wordage to a reasonable level.

A dynamics book would cover the subject with much less explanation (while allowing more critical thought, although requiring a much closer reading) and leave it up to the reader to fill in the pieces. A great exercise in the critical thinking physics majors need.Engineers need to know the facts and how to approach the problems to get a meaningful result and this is exactly what the book provides.

The short-range organization is quite good, but the long-range organization is weak. Go to the next page and you will likely have a hard time figuring out how the material there relates to what you were just reading. Many good lectures use this kind of structure, but I find that it does not make a good textbook.The text lacks coherent derivations. Ulaby just throws equations at you without linking them together strongly. For instance, the input impedance of a transmission line with an arbitrary load (arguably the most important relation in the entire chapter on transmission lines) is derived piecemeal over the course of several sections. The derivation really isn't hard, though - it could easily have been done in two pages. Ulaby does put nice blue boxes around the particularly important equations, but that doesn't help much.I found the treatment too simple for an upper-division course.

Like other reviewers have mentioned, the book does contain a lot of useful formulas, however it only derives a few of them. Furthermore, from reading this book, I did not gain any intuitive understanding of most of the fundamental concepts of electromagnetics (which is probably my single largest criticism of the book).

Kapleau describes the Buddhist vow to not take life, and how some people consider an animal's life to be different from a human being's life. Kinda silly, when you think about it. I mean, it might seem weird not to kill spiders and bugs because you feel bad for them, but where exactly do you draw the line between a sentient being, and a &quot;mindless&quot; animal? *is* there even a line? The author discusses how different branches of Buddhism regard meat-eating, information on how meat is digested by the human body as opposed to vegetables, the long-standing claim that &quot;vegetarians don't get enough protein,&quot; and the conditions in slaughterhouses in the u.s. as well as in other places, and what exactly is involved in getting a cow or a pig from the farm to your dinner plate. it's not horribly, grotesquely detailed (such that you wouldn't be able sleep at night), but it will certainly encourage the reader to develop an opinion on the issue. meat-eaters may regard it as a simple book describing Buddhist views on meat-eating, while others may realize just what they put into their bodies from day to day and choose these things more wisely.

Once Kaelan's health improves, he leaves the house with Gilly and Nick and sets out on an adventure to right the wrongs done to them. However, they don't realize that their troubles are about to begin all over again.Charlotte Boyett-Compo has developed an alternate world with three-dimensional characters that are entrenched in political intrigue.

With the help of a few friends they meet on the way, their journey crosses many lands and seas to reach their final destination.This book is completely spellbinding, it grabs you from the first sentence and even after you've turned that final page, you still reach for another page. I am definitely hooked and can hardly wait to read WindChance to find out more."},{"Title":"Kiss Hollywood Good-By","review":"A fantastically quick read, Anita Loos combines wit with fine storytelling in this autobiographical piece. She zips all around her life and tells about famous names like Marion Davies, Douglas Fairbanks, D.W. Griffith, Irving Thalberg, Clark Gable, Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald, and other comtemporaries. Even if one has not heard of these people before, which is the case in several bits, a detailed portrait of them will be painted by the time the book is through. Most vivid of these portraits is her husband, nicknamed \\"Mr. E,\\" a manic depressive with a severe need to perform better than his famous wife.Loos lived for quite a long time, so not only does one read about her experiences during the Roaring Twenties, but also about her more modern experiences. What does she think about her films being shown in schools? What about modern Hollywood? You'll find it all out here and probably find yourself agreeing with her."},{"Title":"Kiss Hollywood Good-By","review":"Anita Loos: the Betty Boo of the flapper generation - without the tissues. But with the literary talent to break down the barriers of twenties Hollywood and preceed notions of reactionary feminism by over thirty years.This is the book you thought you would never read. A pamphlet-thin romp through the studio era of early Hollywood is counterweighted with a poignant disection of love and alcholism. Loos reveals the pain of hopeless devotion with the soft touch of a suggestive glance. A bedtime story for cool adults."},{"Title":"Kiss Hollywood Good-By","review":"One of two memoirs written by Anita Loos, this one concentrates on her work for the movie studios, mainly in the 1910s, 20s and 30s. She wrote or co-wrote lots of scripts; many of the early ones were one reel silent movies. Best known as the author of \\"Gentlemen Prefer Blondes\\", Loos was witty and smart in many ways but let her husband take advantage of her terribly.Born in 1894, Loos was a flapper with short dark hair and short skirts. She was a career girl; although she was pretty and social enough to have become a gold digger, she supported herself and her husband with her writing. She worked and socialized with many of the days celebrities; Clark Gable, Marion Davies and William Randolph Hearst, Aldous Huxley, H.L. Mencken, Greta Garbo, Dorothy Parker, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Jean Harlow and many, many more.This volume is a \`sort of' biography; I say \`sort of' because while she tells us what she was doing, she actually tells us more about the people she spent time with. The book is rich in anecdotes about the famous, warts and all, although she is most often very kind in her recollections. She is even kind about her thieving and manipulative husband- it turned out that he was mentally ill and couldn't help but do the things he did to her. Loos throws some social commentary in with the anecdotes and the book is extremely amusing."},{"Title":"Kiss Hollywood Good-By","review":"this is a must read for anyone who loves hollywood in the beginning .This author was there and has a great writing style along with a brutally honest concept of people places and things i would recommend this to anyone who wants to know more about the beginnings of hollywood from a trully great writer who is quite funny and honest about her memories."},{"Title":"Legally Binding (Harlequin Intrigue No. 780)(Shotgun Sallys)","review":"Bart Rawlins in accused of a murder he has not committed.

Style of writing is quite straight forward and concise. However, there are certain inconsistencies which I would like to point out. For example, when writer uses a name, Robert Spencer, he would use Robert in the beginning and so on and later changes it to Spencer in the next few pages and it somehow got me confused and have to refer a few pages back to confirm whether if it's the same person the writer is talking about. This however is not conclusive that the book is not a good read. Most importantly, I think the writer got his point across. Overall, I think this book is engaging and easy to understand. It's a good read on how Amazon.com began its endeavors."},{"Title":"Amazon.Com: Get Big Fast","review":"This is an unauthorized account of an e-commerce leviathan's rise from obscurity. So, if one is looking for a detailed business module or a blue print of its technology, look elsewhere, as this is not the book for you. What this book offers is a very interesting, well-organized narrative on the early, heady days of Amazon.com. when it was just an upstart internet bookseller looking to make its mark big time, as well as a look at its founder, Jeff Bezos, painting a flattering and intriguing portrait of this now multi-billionaire.For its founder, Jeff Bezos, it was not, however, just about the money. If that were the case, he would never have left his seven figure Wall Street job. For him, it was about the opportunity to be on the ground floor of a business that would change the retailing community forever. Jeff Bezos, a true visionary, chose to take that challenge, and in doing so, he would forever change the dot.com world and the retailing community. The author, a business reporter for various publications, delineates just how it was that Jeff Bezos did so.This book offers up an interesting summary on how Jeff Bezos was able to take the online community by storm and upset the status quo. The author provides a biographical narrative on who Jeff Bezos is. It is grounded in the context of where he grew up, his schooling, as well as his early interests. It segues from his Ivy League educational underpinnings to his foray into the upper echelons of Wall Street, deriving the experience that he needed in order to take on the risky proposition of starting up his own dot.com company. It is clearly the story of a visionary and decision maker with heart.The book succinctly details the rise of Amazon.com as an e-commerce force with which to be reckoned. It tracks its growth and change from an upstart, fledging, by- the-seat-of-its-pants-company to one that is now a staple of the popular lexicon. It superficially explores the philosophy of Jeff Bezos in terms of having his business \\"get big fast\\" and the technological, financial, and logistical hurdles that the business needed to overcome in order to do so. The author also keys in on the ability of Jeff Bezos to think out of the box, when so many business pundits said that what he sought to do could not be done.The overall texture of this book is enhanced by Information provided by those with some insider knowledge, such as those who knew Jeff Bezos, those who worked with him in those early halcyon days, rival \\"brick and mortar\\" executives, business analysts, and financiers, among others. This book, which is a look at a visionary and his company, details how that visionary was able to transform his company into a veritable cultural phenomenon unto itself. Those who are devotees of Amazon will find this well-written book heady stuff, indeed, as it makes for absorbing reading."},{"Title":"East of the Sun and West of the Moon","review":"Kermit and Ted journeyed thru Kashmir, across the Himalayas by pony and yak, into Mongolia, hunting the great sheep, ibex, and bear of the regions.

Remove that spit and graffiti. Arrest those people huddledon the steps of the church.\\" (Democracy)The title poem reflects upon the reality that the moon is receding from the earth an inch and a half each year, that one day in the distant future it will finally spiral out of orbit and \\"all land based life will die\\". The moon is our regulator, our constant companion, a mother we have treated badly, defied and scorned:\\"... a motherwho's lost a child, a bad child,a greedy child or maybe a grown boywho's murdered and raped, a mothercan't help it, she loves that boyanyway, and in spite of herselfshe misses him...... and you know she's onlyromanticizing, that she's convenientlyforgotten the bruises and the booze...and you want... to slap her back to sanity...... and then, you can't help iteither, you know love when you see it,you can feel its lunar strength, its brutal pull.\\" (Facts About the Moon)Making peace with the years, Laux appreciates the value of the struggle, the small slivers that drive us from place to place for survival, leaving behind people, places, parts of ourselves:\\"... But I know its only luckthat delivered him here, luck and a lovethat had nothing to do with me. Exceptthat this is what we sometimes getif we live long enough. If we are patientwith our lives.\\" (Music in the Morning)Laux spares nothing in her observations, not nature, others or self, alert to sea changes, monitoring the world around her:\\"Go on, he beseeches,Get going, but the lone elkstands her ground, their noses less than a yard apart.One stubborn creature staring down another.This is how I know the marriage will last.\\" (The Crossing)This collection bears the ring of truth, a view of the world from the street, the earth, nature's embrace, beneath the eye of the watching moon. Feelings are dissected, offering images that inform and transform, the power of language enhanced by an unflinching honesty. This is a poet who isn't afraid to get her hands dirty or her heart broken, a survivor of life's brutality and bounty.

So this title seemed a perfect stocking stuffer, regardless of the content. I was not to worry. Great poems. Lovely transaction. All ended well!"},{"Title":"Facts About the Moon: Poems","review":"Dorianne Laux's book of poetry, Facts About the Moon is a serious and euphonic compilation of work. Throughout most of the book she uses short to middle length free verse. Most of her poems are at least two pages long and use a generous amount of enjambment. Some of my favorite poems include \`The Lost,\\" \\"Facts About the Moon,\\" and \\"My Brother's Grave.\\" Her poems some rarely take a sudden turn, but instead they often end up somewhere far from what I expected. For example, \\"Facts About the Moon\\" begins as the title states, but Laux gracefully begins incorporating the mother to child relationship in parallel to the moon and earth. \\"My Brother's Grave\\" begins by narrating a trip to her brother's grave and within the first ten lines, readers are able to see her loneliness, but it isn't explicitly stated by Laux until the few lines of the poem. The poem \\"The Lost\\" describes a rare type of love that is very interesting and intriguing, but also unrelatable."},{"Title":"Facts About the Moon: Poems","review":"As I read Dorianne Laux's collection entitled Facts of the Moon, I experienced a similar joy for her poems that I had when I read through Susan Browne's Buddha's dogs. Instead of shocking the reader with poetic works about unusual experiences and situations, I enjoyed the use of imagery Laux's poems. For instance, in her poem entitled, \\"Music in the Morning,\\" Dorianne Laux uses each line or set of lines to either describe the setting or the individual that the narrator is talking about. Like a puzzle, piece by piece she creates the scene and the subject clearly.From the first two lines, \\"when I think of the years he drank, / the scars on his chin,\\" right away the audience knows two things: the first being that the narrator is describing a recovered alcoholic in the present day, and second the fact that he has \\"scars on his chin\\" gives the impression that the recovered alcoholic had a rough experience(s) when he was drinking. Rather than painting a picture of a smiley, tan, tall gentleman who survived from an addiction, Laux chose to show the wear and tare, the imperfections, the proof of his past mistakes. Even though the narrator claims to want to believe that \\"he survived\\" for her, the narrator does explain that her desire to have been the reason for his survival isn't reality; in truth, it was \\"luck and love\\" that saved him (lines 18, 25). Although I feel that this is probably my favorite poem by Dorianne Laux (as of the present day), another poem that I enjoyed from this collection was \\"The Idea of Housework.\\"Regardless of one's age, any reader is able to relate to the concept of this poem; what is the point of cleaning dishes? After you clean the dishes from a party you had over the weekend, come Monday evening you're sink is once again filled with dishes that you could have sworn were just clean less than four hours ago. Instead of the creation of another poem about a serious or unfortunate topic or issue, I enjoyed how this poem is both humorous, light, and refreshing to its audience. As it's been drilled into one's head since high school, in the contrasting of showing versus telling, details and imagery make a great deal of difference; it's what makes an okay poem into a work that is remembered by the reader passed the point where they turn the page, shut the book, and/or walk away."},{"Title":"Facts About the Moon: Poems","review":"From the very beginning, Dorianne Laux's collection had me completely engaged in her narrative voice and passion for the world around her. \\"The Life of Trees\\" reminds me of home, my small ranch house nestles up along a line of trees speaking to each other in the dark. Her ability to personify an inanimate object is truly unrivaled. Following this is \\"Democracy,\\" a great poem that values the perspective of the poor and homeless and what it is to need. Laux has a way of capturing just the right image through descriptive but fairly common language and pulling the reader in.One of my favorite poems of the collection, \\"Vacation Sex,\\" speaks on the joys of returning home after a long time away with a lover and reveling in that familiarity and the sensuality it evokes. I loved this poem from the very first line, \\"We've been at it all summer, from the Canadian border to the edge of Mexico, just barely keeping it American but doing okay just the same.\\" I've traveled all over the country in my youth and I can speak for how relatable this sentiment is.Another favorite poem is \\"Moon in the Window,\\" where she describes being a little girl and staring out her window at the moon and feeling different. \\"It took me years to grow a heart from paper and glue.\\" This poem just reeks of adolescent angst and I love it.Laux is also particularly good at describing nature, both on land and in the sky, as well as animals, and how all these things connect to being human.I thoroughly enjoyed every poem."},{"Title":"Facts About the Moon: Poems","review":"Dorianne Laux's \\"Facts About the Moon\\" is a very surprising book of poetry in several different ways. Each poem has a very romantic tone and yet each poem also carries very different and profound feelings of sadness, love, curiosity, and incredulity. Exploring topics from vacation sex to superglue to the lives of trees, Laux is able to create thought-provoking ideas and imagery through her skill with metaphors and her rapt attention to details.One of my favorite poems from this collection is titled \\"Her First.\\" The poem is about the first person her mother, a nurse or doctor, witnessed die in a hospital. It opens with a few lines that have forgotten the logistics of identities or where and when, but quickly and seamlessly slide into details of a wordless conversation that happened between her mother's eyes and the eyes of the patient. The details Laux gives readers creates an up-close image that make it seem like the reader is the mother, the reader is one the holding the patients hand, \\"ushering his soul/into the unknown.\\" Auditory and visual details zoom in on the things that create every hospital experience, but often go unnoted in the minds of those experiencing them, like the \\"tiny rubber wheels,/ that oiled, spun freely, easily\\" and \\"the institutional/ gray walls.\\" \\"Her First\\" is filled with intense emotion and curiosity about the event as well, which is enhanced through the up-close details. The poem ends with the same image that patient's life ends with, an up-close image of her mother's \\"rust-colored eyes saying goodbye.\\""},{"Title":"Facts About the Moon: Poems","review":"Dorianne Laux's book of poetry, Facts About the Moon, reads like a snow angel. The reader takes in the details of the author's life--her marriage, the loss of her brother, her past, her parentage--only in between the lines that expound upon the woes of the moon, the burial of a dead hummingbird, a crossing of elk, and dead, fallen trees. These images mound up and sweep right and left in a strange, surreal dance, changing the reader's perspective, lowering his or her eyes to an uncomfortable, unconventional angle, and there it is: within the heaps of snow, of objects, the outline of a human being.It is in this way, through the poetry of images and objects, that Laux expresses her feelings and portrays the people she cares about. Often, she compounds these images on top of one another, further deepening the comparison. In her poem \\"Cello,\\" Laux uses the image of two trees rubbing together \\"When a dead tree falls in the forest\\" to a stringed instrument, as the dead tree's body \\"[builds]/ Its dead music\\" and uses these two conceits, the trees and the cello, as a metaphor for the 9/11 terrorist attack (89). The trees evoke the image of one tower collapsing into the other, the cello the mournful, keening sound of grief. It is these three images, the trees, the cello, and the towers, that create the framework for the suggested body of the poem: Laux's feelings as the first anniversary of the attack draws near.There is a similar layering effect in Laux's titular poem \\"Facts About the Moon,\\" where Laux compares the increasingly distant moon to \\"a greedy child\\" (40). Slowly, as the poem progresses, the image switches, comparing the dying mother of the child to the moon, \\"her eyes/two craters,\\" and the child to humanity, saying, \\"you know love when you see it,/you can feel its lunar strength, its brutal pull\\" (41). Like an orbit, the reader comes full circle around the metaphor, seeing the relationship between human beings and the natural world, mothers and children, from all sides and leaving him or her to peer into its heart.Laux's poetry, using this outline of images, always leaves an empty core for the reader to fill with his or her own feelings and inferences. Simply stated but gut-wrenchingly real, her poetry explores the little facts of life that come together to form the bigger truths."},{"Title":"Facts About the Moon: Poems","review":"True Dorianne Lux style.

Stemman writes well, and presents the various cases in a professional manner.Because of the wide variety of material it contains and the professional way it is compiled, I'd definitely recommend this book as an excellent all-round book on the subject - and one which would help people who believe they have past life memories themselves.(Note that Stemman appeared recently on the National Geographic channel in a one-hour doco on reincarnation memories amongst Druze children.)"},{"Title":"Reincarnation: Amazing True Cases from Around the World","review":"How can anyone question reincarnation after reading this book?

There are those who say they'd like to believe, and those that think that it is all a lot of nonsense.

Cynicism aside, this makes for a really good read, and in all honesty it is hard to argue the nonsense side when faced with this well written argument for belief.Even if you continue to think it is all fiction, this is a very written look into a contraversial topic.

There she has purchased a fixer-upper, which at times, seems to be haunted, but certainly has a history. After an unknown person has plunged to his almost-certain death off the cliffs,she has to deal with a visitor from the City whom she may or may not have invited to stay with her and whom may or may not be who and what he says he is and seems to be interested in the age-old story of an unknown Stradivarius said to have been secreted away by her house's original owner.While Jake battles the house to keep it standing,she has to deal with this stranger, her 18-year-old son's infatuation with a girl Jake considers to be inappropriate, and,certainly not least, the ladies reading club is meeting at her house this month and her mysterious guest has knocked a hole in her dining room wall.Graves gives us a multi-faceted plot with several story lines, new as well as familiar characters, and, of course Maine. She is a talented writer who is able to keep all the story lines moving right along, keep the mystery moving toward a satisfactory end, and continue to grow her characters.If you haven't read anything in this series, start with DEAD CAT BOUNCE, the first in the series, and you'll read the three other entries. Then, you'll join the ranks of her other fans eagerly awaiting the next entry in this excellent, if not eccentric, series.

At least, that is what he said he was there for. Jake believes that he is there to search for a Stradivarius allegedly hidden in the house by a former owner. Jake believes that this is merely a local legend and is incensed when her guest disappears, allegedly drowned, leaving a huge hole in her dining room wall just days before the local reading circle is due to meet in her home.The visitor's exgirlfriend Charmian arrives to bring home the body(there is none given the currents surrounding Eastport) and dives into the mystery herself. Jon Raines wasn't a graduate student, he was an adventurer who looked for lost treasures. Charmian's uncle wouldn't let them get married(sounds a little like a gothic romance doesn't it?), so he went off to find a real treasure to make his reputation.

When Jonathan's fiancee and her uncle suddenly appear he believes they're all looking for the Stradivarius that is supposedly hidden in her house.Sarah Graves writes an interesting cozy that is dark and foreboding instead of lighthearted and non-threatening.

It's so organized, has pictures for every step of the way, and a nice balance of tips and information. It has a great quick picture reference guide in the center too. I like how it breaks down each movement, pressure, and then each area of the body. Then it also has more specific massages (face, hands, athletic, stress etc near the back of the book) and how to go about making a nice aromatherapy or scrub as well.

I can't say enough about MacQuarrie and his story telling ability. No one can describe better the experience of huddling in a pre dawn duckblind as wings whistle overhead in the darkness. Nor what it's like to feel the sure pluck of a brown trout at your fly during a spring rain. You will feel the glow of the woodstove and relish the ache in your arms that comes from rowing your boat back to the cedar cabin on a North Wisconsin lake. MacQuarrie's literary voice, the subject, and characters of his stories make my heart ache for a time that I was born too late to experience. Buy this trilogy. If you are a hunter or fisherman you will never regret it. If you aren't but take time to listen to these stories, you might find yourself looking at old shotguns, bamboo flyrods, and bluebill decoys in a different light. You might even find yourself in sleeting rain on a North Lake someday as wings whistle overhead."},{"Title":"Collected Poems Of Robert Service","review":"I HAVE BEEN A FAN OF ROBERT SERVICE FOR MANY YEARS.

Amazon is always a good place to order from."},{"Title":"Collected Poems Of Robert Service","review":"The poetry of Robert Service has been very widely read, but its great popularity has not impressed the critics of the academy. For most of them he was simply a versifier whose lines did not have the kind of complexity, ambiguity, irony and difficulty they argue makes for 'real poetry'. Service's writing is clear on the surface and often tells a story. It is eminently understandable in its first reading or hearing. It often has couplet- rhyme and memorable lines. It is highly enjoyable and is imbued with a sense of adventure. Service was a man who went through many different worlds of experience, in his native Scotland, in Canada and of course in the Yukon. He too saw the horrors of the first World War. He has a strong feeling for the perils and joys of Nature. His work too has humor and a certain sense of suspense. This is felt in two of his most famous works, 'The Dangerous Dan MacGrew' and 'The Cremation of Sam McGee'. In a sense Service's work is 'easy to read' certainly much easier than the kind of poetry that most critics consider of highest value. I find reading the poems both enjoyable and interesting as Service also tells much about the different worlds he has explored. The fact that his work has given such great pleasure to many certainlay suggests that it is work of real value."},{"Title":"Collected Poems Of Robert Service","review":"Everything I expected, this complete collection of Robert Service's poems captures the spirit of the rugged lives of those who struggle against the harshness of the cold and frozen Yukon and other points north. After a recent trip to Alaska where every Bed and Breakfast had a copy, I couldn't wait to get back and order my own. My childhood memory of the \\"Cremation of Sam McGee\\" only added to my delight of the book. The only drawback you know before you order, it is all one author. Therefore, the style is much the same from poem to poem. However, to me, that just made the rhythm of his words more of a song in my head and I found that delightful.

All of her favorites from way back. I am very happy with the purchase and would recommend it to anyone looking to purchase a great collection! Service is absolutely wonderful!"},{"Title":"Collected Poems Of Robert Service","review":"I first remember hearing a Robert Service poem as it was read by my father. Though my mother did not really approve as he started out, by the end of the Cremation of Sam McGee we were all laughing. That memory is as much about hearing my father, a Mainer who could spin a good yarn, bring the poem to life with his rich baritone voice as it was an introduction to a wonderful writer.It is a tribute to Mr. Services story weaving ability that his poems were not only appreciated by my father, but that all three sons have a nicely worn copy on their bookshelves.To anyone who likes the outdoors or even just wants to read about it, this book should be close by your favorite chair.

Robert Service is without any doubt my favorite poet. His poems are classics. But many years past when I was just a youth, I stumbled onto a volume of Robert Service where he wrote short prose introductions to his poems. Hoping one day to become a poet myself, I thought these prose introductions provided the greatest insight to how a poet creates. I looked and looked and looked but could never find that volume. Then one day in a second hand book shop some where I found it. It was this volume. I paid a good price for it. I've recorded all these poems with the prose intros on my karaoke and I play them for myself sometimes at bed time. My wife has her \\"ears\\" on her burrow (she's hard of hearing) so she is not disturbed. In my opinion Robert is the epitome of fine poetry. He has it all humor, pathos, romance, intellectual content, melody, beauty, intensity, warmth, toughness, manliness - you name it; he's got it.

This compendium of 6 different books of Service's work will take you from his Gold Rush Days of the Yukon, to his escape to the Bohemian Quarter in Paris to become a 'Serious Poet', and to his volunteering to become an ambulance driver for the Red Cross in the First World War. His ballads are remarkable in how they take you deeply into the the person's life for that brief time as you read. There is the lighthearted comedy he is known for with &quot;The Cremation of Sam McGee&quot;, as well as the first person accounts of the unimaginable horrors and uplifting glories of battle in the trenches.

The effete literati sneered at his work, and accused him of writing doggerel. But, the people have always loved his work. He was truly a 'people's poet.'His first volume of poetry, The Spell of the Yukon and Other Verses, sold out while it was still on the presses. Two of his ballads, The Shooting of Dan McGrew and The Cremation of Sam McGee, are among the most memorized poems in history.The Shooting of Dan McGrew alone made him a half-million dollars, which was a sizeable fortune in his time. He never had to do manual labor for his bread again, after its publication.This volume of his work contains his best-known poems (those contained in both The Spell of the Yukon and his second, longer collection, Ballads of a Cheechako).This is a book that you will not only delight in reading before the fire on a winter's evening or when that confining office job is getting you down, but it will also provide an endless source of conversation and amusement for your friends, many of whom will no doubt be able to recite large portions of some of his poems.For Robert Service is, without a doubt, one of the best-loved of the world's poets. His poetry stands alongside that of Kipling, Coleridge and Poe in the public's affection.Joseph (Joe) Pierreauthor of Handguns and Freedom...their care and maintenanceand other books"},{"Title":"Collected Poems Of Robert Service","review":"I first came across Robert Service about third or fourth grade and the book was confiscated first by my teacher and then by my parents as \\"unsuitable\\".

If ever you were stuck for a party piece, try \\"The Shooting of Dan McGrew\\" or \\"The Cremation of Sam McGee\\", either will generate a terrific response and with appropriate drama, a standing ovation.Most of all, there are poems here which capture an era long gone and soon to be forgotten.Robert Service will justifiably survive the majority of 20th century poets"},{"Title":"Collected Poems Of Robert Service","review":"This is possibly the finest poetry collection ever authored. This collection includes Service's best known poems from Songs of a Sourdough, including The Call of the Yukon, The Shooting of Dan McGrew, and my personal favourite, The Cremation of Sam McGee. If these poems don't have you booking a trip to the Yukon, nothing will.Service was a man's man, living in northern Canada in White Horse and Dawson. This gives his poems a rarefied feeling that cannot be counterfeited. If Louis L'Amour had lived in northern Canada he would have been a soul mate to Robert W. Service. They both loved the outdoors and loved the men of the outdoors. Perhaps the most amazing thing about Robert W. Service is that his life story is even more compelling than his poetry. To read The Men that Don't Fit In is to get a glimpse of the man who fits.This is poetry for the soul that requires no degree in literature to appreciate."},{"Title":"Collected Poems Of Robert Service","review":"As anyone who has read my Amazon.com review of \\"The Poetry Of Robert Frost\\" knows, Robert Frost is my favorite poet. Robert Service comes in a close second. \\"The Collected Poems Of Robert Service\\", consisting of Service's poems up to 1940, reveals the breadth of his work. The \\"Bard Of The Yukon\\" is well represented in this collection, but this collection goes far beyond the Yukon. In addition to the Northern Nature poems for which Service is famous, this collection includes poems set in World War I which reveal the common humanity of soldiers and the inhumanity of war. Poems set in Europe between the wars provide an insight into that Bohemian world. Whatever the topic, the reader will be touched by the poems. Some will provide lines to remember and quote, others insights to contemplate, some just entertainment.Service's poetry is readily understandable, enjoyable and reveals much about human character.Pick up and read!"},{"Title":"Collected Poems Of Robert Service","review":"Service's works range from frivolous to morose.

That is just fine by me. The only problem here is that because of this \\"looking down upon attitude\\" many, who like to associate with such people may not read Service's work for that reason. That is a shame because they are missing some great poetry and a whole group of fun. Recently, the \\"cow boy poets\\" in our country are making a come back and rightfully so. These \\"unsophisticated\\" poems reflect our culture, tell a story and are simply good. Service falls withing this genre. I enjoy poetry in most forms and I certainly would feel much poorer for not having read this author's work. Service tells simple stories with simple words, that are to the point and few frills. There is little pretentiousness here. These are stories from our past and need to be treasured. Recommend this work highly."},{"Title":"Collected Poems Of Robert Service","review":"I was introduced to Robert Service while attending Jr. High in Alaska.

This work does not seek to argue for Theonomy on a Scriptural basis, instead it seeks to show that the teachings of the Theonomic position are not new, but consistent with the views held by Puritan and Westminster Divines."},{"Title":"Into the Light (Harlequin Superromance No. 196)","review":"And, another of this author's titles from the mid-1980s.Natalie Carter is a single mother with a 10 year old son, Patrick. Although she lives in Los Angeles now, her roots are in the logging country of rural British Columbia. One summer she returns as a beloved father-figure \\"Doc\\" is not well and she travels back home to look after him for a few weeks.Whilst there she comes into contact with Adam Rutherford, the father of her son. Adam is a hugely successful wildlife photographer and documentary film maker and he is in the area scouting locations for a shoot.When Adam discovers he has a son he is initially outraged and angry but he soon becomes besotted with Patrick and it's a mutual feeling. Father and son are clearly delighted in each other.However, Natalie has a big secret in her background that has coloured her whole life. When 16 year old Natalie discovered she was pregnant, before she could tell Adam her stepfather found out. What then happened was horrific - to say much more would be a spoiler - but the episode caused her to leave for California without even speaking to Adam who therefore never knew he was a father.The story is mainly about how these three people learn about each other and gradually form a proper family unit. My main quarrel with this story, and the reason why I can't give it 5 stars, is that I feel the author allowed Natalie and Doc to handle the tragedy that occurred just before Patrick was born very badly. I feel the decisions the author allowed them to make were simply incredulous and I could not accept them as realistic behaviour - indeed, I cannot believe that a hospital would not have reported what had happened to the police.That said, it's a good story in a beautiful setting. Probably not a keeper but an entertaining read and full of the author's intimate descriptions of domesticity and scenery."},{"Title":"Shadow on Summer 1ST Edition","review":"At first you are taken in by the beautiful imagery, the way in which Christy Brown explains everything. You are enraptured.Then you hit page 100 and you get thoroughly sick of people who don't talk like real people and vivid descriptions of every single little thing like its a Walt Whitman poem.A writer travels to America to work on his second book and there he hooks up with a photographer, but since he's so full of self-loathing and doubt he can't communicate with her. There's also another character who is his friend who tries to control him every step of the way. He's also supposed to be in love with her, but she's such a harpie, you wonder why he is even talking to her, much less being in love.Ultimately this book is like a Harper's Magazine article - a lot of verbage that ultimately fails to cover up the lack of interest in the plot, character or style. (There's even a character who kind of swears and is almost interesting, but exits stage left just as soon as you suspect that the book might turn interesting.)"},{"Title":"Gregg Speed Building for Colleges, Diamond Jubilee Series","review":"This is an advanced book.

I highly recommend this to the serious reader or student."},{"Title":"The Seven Lady Godivas/the True Facts Concerning History's Barest Family","review":"\\"A beautiful story of love, honor and scientific achievement\\" is how Dr. Seuss, with tongue in cheek, describes this book. Touted as Dr. Seuss's first book for adults, The Seven Lady Godivas was originally published in 1939 and reissued in 1987. It tells the story of not one, but seven 11th Century Lady Godivas. They are sisters sworn not to marry their beaus, the seven Peeping brothers (yes, Tom is one of them) until each of them discover a scientific truth about horses. They were driven to this oath by the death of their father during an experiment using a horse as a means of transportation.The history is confused, but the fun never stops. Dr. Seuss's full page drawings (in red, black and white) illustrate every other page. The end papers are a fanciful illustration of the Godiva family tree. The text, though wordier than his childrens books and not in rhyme, is thoroughly Dr. Seuss. He explains the seven sisters preference for nudity by saying they had brains and were not given to vanity. He goes on to say \\"they were simply themselves and chose not to disguise it.\\" Although this is a great summation of nudist philosophy, it doesn't say much about his regard for women who choose to wear clothes. Instead of scientific truths we are treated by the author to fanciful origins for seven proverbs about horses as each sister discovers her \\"horse truth\\" and goes on to marry her boyfriend.If you enjoy Dr. Seuss, you will find these drawings and this story delightful. Although described as an adult book, children will enjoy the story as well. Today's young folks may not be familiar with all seven of the horse proverbs that Dr. Seuss relates in a book that is over 60 years old, but it should not deter from their enjoyment of this amusing tale. The drawings are not detailed enough to offend even the youngest of readers."},{"Title":"The Seven Lady Godivas/the True Facts Concerning History's Barest Family","review":"A must read for any Dr Suess lover over the age of 18; it is truly meant for adults, but not off color in the least. Lets hope the publisher runs another edition for those of us who love an erudite Dr Suess."},{"Title":"The Seven Lady Godivas/the True Facts Concerning History's Barest Family","review":"The Seven Lady Godivas, in my opinion, one of the best books ever written by Dr, Seuss. Yes, that's right! Of course, Theodore Gissel has a great appeal to the young at heart, but this book is a HOOT!"},{"Title":"On the Outside Looking Out: John Ashbery's Poetry","review":"This book offers an incredibly rich and densely historicized account of Ashbery's poetry (through Flow Chart), with a lot of attention to the various contexts (Ashbery's time in France, the New York art scene) and sources (poetry, fiction, art, pop culture) that feed into the work. But Shoptaw is not just a patient and scrupulous researcher; he is also, quite simply, one of the most brilliant and persuasive poetry readers I've ever encountered. Every chapter is full of revelations--this is a book to be read slowly and savored, bit by bit. Every reader will have personal favorites; some of mine are the stunning analysis of \\"The Nut Brown Maid\\" (constructed, Shoptaw shows, from discarded manuscript fragments) and the wonderfully textured reading of \\"Self-Portrait in a Convex Mirror,\\" a poem I think I hardly was reading at all until I read it again with Shoptaw as my guide.It's also worth noting that Shoptaw was the first critic to bring Ashbery's homosexuality into the story, not as a \\"hidden content\\" but as something that helps shape what Shoptaw terms Ashbery's \\"misrepresentative poetics.\\" I often find other versions of this kind of criticism vulgarly reductive, but Shoptaw's readings, even when they draw on Ashbery's biography, always hold up--probably because it is so clear that it is Ashbery's poetry, not his life, that is Shoptaw's real subject.In short, this book provides an unsurpassed introduction to Ashbery: learned, subtle, and intelligent (and engagingly written to boot). My main caveat is that it is not suitable for anyone looking for the one key that will all at once unlock Ashbery's difficult and protean poetry. Though theoretically informed, Shoptaw's study does not cleave to any single perspective or agenda; theory serves reading rather than the reverse. Indeed, like its notoriously elusive subject, the book is simultanously conservative and avant garde--as one might deduce from the back cover, which carries enthusiastic blurbs from both Harold Bloom and Charles Bernstein."},{"Title":"On the Outside Looking Out: John Ashbery's Poetry","review":"I am doing extensive research for my master's thesis on Ashbery and this was by far the worst resource I could have invested in. My main complaint is that this book lacked coherence, though it seemed to have done thorough research. It did not clearly articulate ideas, but rather used every opportunity to quote fragments and attribute random details rather than clearly get at the heart of Ashbery's poetry. I found no useful arguments and it was very difficult to get through to what the author was saying. Very disappointed."},{"Title":"On the Outside Looking Out: John Ashbery's Poetry","review":"I am alas an ordinary reader and I was curious to see what this Ashbery fuss was all about. I found Ashbery's poetry to be quite obscure and thought Shoptaw's book might help me make some sense of it. I was greatly disappointed. The book was clearly a tour de force of rank archanery. Shoptaw seems quite impressed with his ability to dazzle us with obscure jargon but it left me baffled. In the end I was no closer to understanding or appreciating Ashbery. To write that the \\"cryptographic process is indecipherable\\" is itself on the very face of it patently indecipherable. This book may impress fellow members of his academic cult but it did not speak to me and,I venture to guess, other ordinary readers."},{"Title":"The diaries of a Cabinet Minister","review":"A friend told me how she had gone canvassing for the Labour party in rural Oxfordshire during the 1966 general election. On most of the grand estates the agricultural workers tugged their forelocks in deference to the landowners, but on one estate they were full of socialism and the brotherhood of man. It was the estate of squire Richard Crossman.He was an intellectual socialist, the product of the best English education. He was not exactly rebellious, but he was iconoclastic and unencumbered by sensitivity. He became a member of parliament, where his outspokenness earned him Attlee's and later Gaitskell's mistrust, and he was best known as an academic and journalist. However where there's death there's hope, Gaitskell died in 1962 and was succeeded as leader of the Labour party by Crossman's friend Harold Wilson, and he was promoted to the opposition front bench where he shadowed the Minister of Health. When Labour came to power in 1964 Crossman naturally expected to be appointed minister in that department, but Wilson perceived housing as the issue most likely to make or break his government, and Crossman got that job. The first volume of his diaries records his 2-year career at Housing until he was further promoted, and it must be a document of first-class importance to political and constitutional historians and theorists. For me as a general reader who remembers the period well, the book is utterly fascinating. It is not just about politics, and it has very little about his private life. It is about government in Britain, and its significance is in its candour and intellectual muscle. It is beautifully written too. Crossman is not blowing his own trumpet or putting a personal spin on events as is invariable in prime ministers' memoirs. He does not suffer, of course, from any false modesty nor is he prone to self-doubt. He is about as objective as such a personality can be expected to be, analysing his successes and failures as he honestly perceived them, and summing up his record at Housing in the last chapter. He sees himself as a competent minister who failed in his main objective which was to have more houses built, because that matter was ultimately controlled not by the Minister of Housing but by the Chancellor of the Exchequer. He even understands, though he does not particularly regret, the brutality of the way he treated some of his civil servants, pointing out simply that he was brighter mentally than they were accustomed to in a minister and that was just their look-out.I took to him then, I take to him now. He was not really ambitious in the sense of wanting to climb a career ladder. Indeed he adored his job at Housing, and he was regretful and depressed when he was promoted out of it. I see no reason to dispute his general estimate of himself, nor his assessment of his colleagues both in government and in the civil service. He is not at all malicious or resentful, but he does not wrap up his opinions in any polite verbiage, and they must have been deeply hurtful to many, particularly to his formidable Permanent Secretary Dame Evelyn Sharp who had served and dominated several previous ministers before meeting her match in Crossman. There is no doubt about his passionate involvement in his work, but there's an odd detachment about his account too. The academic in him is always analysing the government processes from his new insider's vantage-point, and it's almost a pity that he does not sum up his Cabinet colleagues in the way he sums up \`the Dame' because his passing comments on them are fascinating and I would have loved to see his general summation. At one point George Brown, for instance, is called \`30% madman' although a good deal of other comment is flattering.His diaries caused a good deal of outcry, some of it but not all just pompous, through their sheer insensitivity, which in the long term is the best thing about them. They don't convey to me either the sense of constant crisis or the frequent aspect of a comic-turn that in the eyes of the public beset the first Wilson government. Other actors are reported very fairly, but one never really has the sense that Crossman understands what makes anyone else tick, and that is his strength as well as a failing.Where have they all gone? Labour lost power in 1970 but regained it in 1974 as the perceived lesser of two evils, before Britain finally succumbed to the Thatcher Terror in 1979. Disillusion bit deeply into many of the participants in this book - Roy Jenkins founded a new political party, Richard Marsh joined that, George Brown's behaviour became more erratic and clownish until he finally died a Conservative, and even the son of Clem Attlee himself turned Tory. More or less all the political personalities mentioned in this book are dead by now, Crossman himself falling victim to cancer in 1974. Unutterably sad is that his son, pictured here at age 7, hanged himself 10 years later. Labour has, of course, risen from the ashes in a new form under Blair and Brown, and the major survival of the era depicted by Crossman is Denis Healey, comprehensively critical of Blair but perhaps not so much so of Brown. How many more chapters in the story I shall survive to see I obviously don't know, but my understanding of what it is all about has gained incalculably from what I have read here."},{"Title":"Greece and Rome at War","review":"Why do I say this? First of all, it's very readable and approachable. Even kids will love it. (OK, admittedly, few will read it cover-to-cover, but that's hardly the point. DON'T be surprised if they do, though. In spite of its density and scholarship, I've known a few lads who've mined seemingly every page.) The pictures in it are absolutley wonderful, as well. Connolly is an excellent illustrator, and his pictures are still unsurpassed. (Incidently, Connolly put out some excellent children's books as well, some of which are still in print.) For the older reader, though, Connolly is still a must-have. He knows the archaeology as well as anyone. What makes him unique is that he's enough of a craftsman to go out and try to make these things so that he could get a feel for how they were used. Thus, his attempt at re-creating a Roman shield found in Egypt caused him to create a revolutionary theory for how the legions fought in the republican period. Likewise, his reproduction of a Greek hoplite shield led him to modify his understanding of how the Greek and Macedonian phalanx differed. Further, while most books before him concentrated heavily on the &quot;ideals&quot; (i.e., the fully developed Roman legion or Macedonian phalanx), Connolly took some time to spin some theories on the transition phases through which these things developed. Thus, for example, he spins a novel theory on how the Macedonian phalanx developed out of the Theban tactics of Epanimondas and that the odd-shaped &quot;boetian&quot; shield was a part of this development. All of this is not to say that he is an unquestionable authority on such matters where we are bumping up against the available data and controversy results. Nevertheless, Connolly is a wonderful teacher in those areas where consensus reigns and an important voice to take into account even where he may be controversial."},{"Title":"Greece and Rome at War","review":"This is truly an outstanding book that does an excellent job of sketching the advancement of the Greeks and Romans in the Military Art. There are outstanding illustrations that give as accurate a picture as possible of the arms, armor, and tactics of these two dynamic civilizations. Most of us are visual learners and the diagrams of the warriors, equipment, and formations of this period helps one to visualize the Greek phalanx or the Roman cohort in the attack and what were their strengths and weaknesses. There are also outstanding illustrations of siege equiment, ships, and fortications. I must confess that this book helped to inspire me to write the novel, The Chief Centurion, as I was able to picture in my mind much clearer what that soldier looked like and what it must have been like to have had to march and fight in the armor of the period. I strongly reccommend this book for anyone who wants to learn more about the Greek or Roman soldier and wants to be able to visualize how he looked and fought."},{"Title":"Greece and Rome at War","review":"This book is magnificent benefit, which maintane describe of military antique world (Greece and Rome), armour and arms.

I will be very glad to acquaint with you."},{"Title":"Greece and Rome at War","review":"Excellent image/pictures, graphics and text to go with it. Connolly has managed to take an overwhelming subject and hit just the right points for novice as well as expert. For the novice, concise but detailed explanations on a huge range of subjects; from pitching camp on the march, to type of cloak worn underneath a legionnaire's cuirass. For the expert, not often seen or described details regards Camp minutia. Fluid writing, detailed graphics to compliment the text. Well worth the price."},{"Title":"Greece and Rome at War","review":"I really enjoy reading this book. It has great information about the various military structures of the greek and roman armys. The book goes in detail about how they fought, what armor they wore, how the marched, even what kind of food they ate. But this is only about half the book. The other parts of the book talk about differnt wars, battles, and campaigns. One of my favorite part of this book is about how the romans gradualy took over italy. I thought this was very intersting. I am a big military history fan so I already knew some things about Marius, Ceaser, and the Punic wars, but never had I come upon a detailed acount of how the romans really came to power in italy. It was also intersting to read about the early italian military systems.The book went into great detail about many ages of fighting, and gave detailed accounts of battles acnd campaigns. This book is a great book for anyone to read. It has the detail to impress any hisorian and also has cosmetic appeal to keep you intersted.This book is well worth your money."},{"Title":"Greece and Rome at War","review":"It is one of the best books I' ve ever read!

He loved it."},{"Title":"Greece and Rome at War","review":"There are a number of excellent reviews of this book already in place, so I won't go into great detail about this book's content. Suffice it to say that like others, I read this book as a child, and have rediscovered it with joy as an adult. The author's fine paintings and illustrations make it a stand out book, and the in-depth text is also rich in detail.For those who want to know more about warfare in ancient Greece and Rome, this book is an absolute MUST. Enough said.Ben Kane, author of The Forgotten Legion."},{"Title":"Greece and Rome at War","review":"This extensive work is a great compilation of the ancient Greek and Roman military history. Very detailed specially on armor and weapons with additional details on battles and wars fought by those great ancient armies. I wish the detail of arms an armor could be downsized concentrating more on circumstances of the battles, reasons of such developments and conclusions.Congratulations to author Peter Connolly!"},{"Title":"Greece and Rome at War","review":"Well, what can I say?This is a great book for anyone even remotely interested in this period. It gives you the broad perspective, as well as details. Best of all the author gives ample archeological evidence and often comments on how he was able (or not) to use the weaponry.You really get to feel the period with the Greek politics and Roman tenacity and understand how thing happened.This might not be your book if your interest primarily is about wargaming. But if you want more than only a game then this is the book to buy and get a better understanding why battles were won and Nations lost."},{"Title":"Greece and Rome at War","review":"This book was pretty sweet. Peter Connoly really knows his Ancient Greeks and Romans. Copious detail is given about just about everything you ever wanted to know about Greek and Roman Warfare. Like other Connoly books the pictures are at least half the fun(if not more) and this book includes totally fly pics of everything from archaeological remains to modern reconstructions. I would say the copious info and incredible pics from a consummate professional in the field make this book well worth your time and deserving of five stars."},{"Title":"Greece and Rome at War","review":"This book is a very well illustrated study on the armour, weaponry, tactics and soldiers of both the Greeks and the Romans. This is a great book for someone starting off in this subject and yet it is thorough enough to be used and referenced by proper scholars as well. I think this book is a must-have for anyone interested in classical warfare but I have noticed that on the American site this book is listed as out of print. Therefore I highly reccomend that anyone who wishes to purchase this book for a decent price (since I have noticed that the used books available on here go up to $80!!) go to the UK Amazon site (www.amazon.co.uk) where this is still in print and is around 19pounds and shipping to the states is very reasonable. Enjoy!!"},{"Title":"Greece and Rome at War","review":"Connolly has written an almost comparative book which lays out clearly some of the agreed upon and not so agreed upon &quot;facts&quot; about ancient warfare in Greece and Rome. This is a great starting point for research into ancient war and weapons though not detailed enough for the specialist."},{"Title":"The Lonely Land","review":"I was looking on information on old canoe routes of the voyageurs and I came upon this book. It tells the experiences of Olson, a famous naturalist of the 50's and 60's, and 5 of his friends, as they paddle three wood and canvas canoes down 500 miles of the Churchhill River in Saskatchewan in 1960. Olson describes the setting and experience so completely, including diary entries of famous fur trappers who traveled the same route, that I have thought of nothing else but going to see the country he describes, the Canadian Shield of Northern Saskatchewan. It is a different place now than it was 40 years ago, less lonely I imagine, but still something I must do. I would recommend this book to anyone who longs to experience this land, North America, before it became overpopulated."},{"Title":"The Lonely Land","review":"I read this book while in Antarctica, and I spent several storm days lost in Olson's vivid tale of an epic journey through the vast Canadian wilderness. His insight into the socio-historical condition of the indigenous peoples and French-Canadian missionaries and traders is unique. Also, I found the illustrations by Frances Lee Jacques to be immaculate line drawings worthy of admiration in their own right. &quot;The Lonely Land&quot; fueled the wanderlust and naturalist in me as much as any Ed Abbey or John Muir book."},{"Title":"The Lonely Land","review":"This is a book I can pick up and read anytime I need to feel the fresh clean air of the Canadian Northwoods. Olson &amp; 5 other experienced and accomplished comrades follow the route of the early Voyageurs down 500 miles of the wild Churchill river. A bonding of men, rich in history, enough adventure to stir the imagination of any outdoorsman or armchair adventurer. I have read this book many times, it has become a comfortable old friend."},{"Title":"The Lonely Land","review":"I first obtained this book in my youth through the old Outdoor Life Book Club (which also introduced me to other classics such as John J. Rowlands' Cache Lake Country). I'm not sure I read The Lonely Land all the way through at that first encounter, but I recently rediscovered it when cleaning out a family home. I picked it up out of nostalgia, but I soon found that I couldn't put it down.Apart from the inherent interest of its subject matter -- the majestic wilderness of central Canada's Churchill River drainage -- I was quickly taken by the immediacy of Olson's account. The wind, the waves, the thunder of approaching rapids all spill off the page in vivid detail, as do the detailed descriptions of each night's camp and its routines. As compelling is the exuberance of Olson and his five companions as they explore pristine lakes, shoot the Churchill's wild water, and find refuge time and again on the solid, reassuring outcrops of the Canadian Shield.Finally, at each stage of the journey, Olson quotes from the journals of those who came before him, the \\"bourgeois\\" who led the brigades of voyageurs into the heart of the Lonely Land in search of furs. Men like Alexander MacKenzie, George Simpson, and David Thompson, who worked for the Hudson's bay Company or its competitors: the record of their observations informs Olson's account with vivid descriptions of the land as well as a sense both of how much and how little had changed over the one hundred and fifty years since they had last paddled, poled, and lined their way up the same great river system.I know that Olson has many well-regarded books to his credit, but a new reader could do worse than enter this world of woods and water by way of The Lonely Land."},{"Title":"The Lonely Land","review":"This book is an account of Olson's canoe journey down long stretches of the Churchill and Sturgeon Weir rivers in Saskatchewan. Olson was a leading popularizer of the notion of wilderness, associated with the North Country of Minnesota and Canada.The story of someone else's canoe journey risks being mind-numbingly boring: \\"we paddled, portaged falls, and then paddled some more.\\" Olson's story isn't any different than that basic narrative, but he manages to make the journey more lyrical. Observations about the empty land they traverse, the comraderie of the company of six, reminiscences of the voyageurs of old, and occasional encounters with other people leaven the basic narrative.It's a great read, and I literally didn't put it down (I was stuck on a transatlantic flight, but even so). Heartily recommended."},{"Title":"The Lonely Land","review":"This is one of my favorite reads. I have read this book dozens of times and will until the day they throw my carcass to the scavengers."},{"Title":"The Lonely Land","review":"Great to be able to get an out of print book at a good price and prompt turn around. Product exactly as described. Thank you!"},{"Title":"The Lonely Land","review":"After I read this book I had a burning desire to visit the Canadian Shield and paddle a wood and canvas canoe on the Churchill River. I only wish I could have done it in 1960, when this book was written. It is a much different place today. This is an excellent book about a canoe trip of 500 miles by six friends. I only hope I will be as lucky to do such a trip someday."},{"Title":"The Lonely Land","review":"It's a great book. I haven't paddled the Churchhill River yet, but rivers closeby, and you still find the wilderness and the loneliness that Sig Olson describes.

See my separate lists and guides for an overall orientation.Including this book, Max Gallo has written an ingenious and significant work of fiction of four volumes spanning the inner life of Napoleon Bonaparte. This volume is the third of four volumes recently made available in English for the United States market. This book, which I have seen often on news stands of Paris in recent years, covers the time from the immediate aftermath of the French victory at Austerlitz up to the moment just before the Grand Armee embarks across the Neiman on the road to Moscow.I read Napoleonic fiction for personal perspective on the historical events. As with most fictional accounts, this work follows from imaginative extrapolations of first hand accounts of events.Professor Gallo offers the highly personal perspective from within the mind of Napoleon himself. The structure of the novel is based on the personal correspondence of Napoleon. In the genre of Napoleonic fiction, Gallo operates on par with Patrick Rimbaud for writing skill. He falls just below Stendhal and Tolstoy as the leaders in historical fiction based on the Age of Napoleon.For the avid follower of the genre, Gallo's work is extremely valuable in at least three respects. First, it is comprehensive. Second, it develops the inner psychological perspective of Napoleon himself. Third, in a completely modern technical style, it imparts a sense of virtual reality from where the reader can see events of fifty years compressed into a single life.An earmark of this volume (as with the other three) is the torrid pace of events comprising the 7 years from Austerlitz to the Neiman. Very noticeably when you first take up the Gallo books you feel rushed. You feel like you are watching a slient movie with characters speeding from one scene to the other. It feels like a 33 rpm record played at 72 rpms, or a video locked in fast forward.The sense of rush will be less if you begin with the first volume of the series called The Song of Departure because it winds up more slowly with a careful development of the childhood of the Napoleon and his early path to power. Regardless, however, of where you begin, before long you will settle into the pace and begin to view events in a natural rhythm from the personal perspective of Napoleon the man.As a caution to the uninitiated, I can't see how anyone uninitiated in the events of Continental Europe between 1789 and 1815 can possibly read, comprehend and enjoy Max Gallo's Napoleon. In this book alone, the momentous battles of Jena, Eylau and Friedland pass in a moment. The same is true of Aspern-Essling and Wagram. Important characters like Calaincourt, Fouche and Talleyrand, along with many others, pass in and out of the story rapidly. In the meantime, our attention is focused on the foreground of Napoleon's thinking and on Josephine, Maria Waleska, Czar Alexander, the King of Rome and Marie Louise.It seems practical to me to say that the only way to enjoy fully this book and its companions is to read them in parallel with a comprehensive historical account of the Napoleonic Campaigns. Lesser works might do the job of historical concordance, but my choice for the duty would be David Chandler's exhaustive Campaigns of Napoleon. By reading such a work along with Gallo, the full scope and power of the age becomes visible and, on the personal human scale, the struggles of the man at the center of the story finds more meaning and context.This book is obligatory for any serious student of the Napoleonic Age. The times cannot be mastered without this valuable and interesting viewpoint. If Gallo had not written from this perspective, someone else would have had to do so eventually. The lesson of the work is that even in one of the greatest lives in all of recorded human history, there is still only 24 hours to a day and still only a finite time over which the narrow path of life leads us all to our destiny -- no matter how great or small we may be."},{"Title":"The Complete Illustrated Guide to Everything Sold in Hardware Stores and Garden Centers","review":"The _\\"Complete Illustrated Guide to Everything Sold in Hardware Stores and Garden Centers\\"_ (published by Running Press/Courage Books imprint, 2002) has two parts: 1: \\"Complete Guide to Everything Sold in Hardware Stores\\" (729 pages, originally published by Macmillan in 1998) and 2: \\"Complete Guide to Everything Sold in Garden Centers\\" (368 pages, originally published by Macmillan in 1990). Because they were originally published as separate books, the two sections of this book each have their own introductions, tables-of-contents, indexes, and pagination. If you see this 2002 title/edition listed as only 368 pages, do not despair - it actually has 1,097 pages. So far, all the reviews I've seen have only reviewed the _Hardware Stores_ section.1:I would like to add a couple of comments to colobbfan's May 22, 2003, nice review of that section. In the introduction, the author specifies that this buying guide is meant to assist your average/traditional do-it-yourself, renovation or restoration projects. He states that in this book \\"[y]ou will not find heavy construction materials, or professional tools, or esoteric cabinetmaking tools, or hobby materials.\\" He also says he purposely did not include automotive, boating, electronics, home security or house-wares even though those items may appear in some hardware stores. Appendix A, \\"Metals and Finishes\\", is a glossary of 20 terms related to describing metals from \\"blued\\" to \\"zinc-plated\\". Appendix B, \\"Basic Tools and Materials Every Homeowner Should Have\\", is divided into three parts: Hand Tools, Power Tools, and Materials. Stars (*) next to some items on the list denote absolute basics one should have. The starred items would make an excellent gift to college students moving to their first apartment or home. (Don't forget that us ladies need to be self-sufficient, also! Often then index (or lack thereof) makes or breaks a reference book. This one has an excellent, easy-to-read, well-organized index with numerous cross-references. Part of the _Hardware_ section's 37-page index is included in Amazon's \\"Browse Sample Pages\\" area, so go take a look at it. The typeface of the hardware section is easy to read and the format is suitable for quick browsing.2:I venture to say that despite the difference in page length, the _Garden Center_ section has just as much information as the _Hardware_ section - the difference lies in smaller type with less space between lines, and fewer illustrations (they aren't needed when you are talking about different types of fertilizers, pesticides, and mulches). The Table-of-Contents is separated into three areas (Supplies; Tools Equipment & Accessories; Appendixes) with detailed headings, subheadings, and sub-subheadings (see Amazon's sample pages - since that is available I won't talk much about the different types of garden center items included). The introduction of the _Garden Center_ section states you will not find \\"pet supplies or farming equipment or landscaping materials [in this section]... Regular home gardening, with a slight nod to decoration is the limit.\\" While the title states that plants are not included in this guide, Appendix A is a 7-page \\"General Buying Guide for Bulbs, Seeds, Plants, Shrubs and Trees.\\" The main area of the book is chock-full of general buying tips in broad categories as well as for specific products, use tips, and descriptions of specific products. Sometimes popular brand names are listed (not as endorsement but as an aid) and where applicable other terms that may be used to describe a specific item are included. The _Garden Center_ index has much smaller type than the Hardware Store index, so you may want a magnifying glass for it. Overall, I would say that that the format of the _Garden Center_ section is less suited to browsing and more suitable for reading full sections because it includes more discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of particular products.The arrangement of both the _Hardware Stores_ section and the _Garden Centers_ section is to group the contents as they are usually grouped in those respective stores, which makes the guide very user-friendly. My one complaint is that thumb-tabs or coloration on the page edges would have been useful to distinguish the two indexes from the rest of the book (especially since the index to the _Hardware_ section is in the middle of the book). This book is one of the best gifts I have ever received, though I wish I had discovered it 10 years ago when I first moved out on my own. I expect it to be useful in all my new home repair and gardening projects and it has already earned a prime spot on my closest bookshelf."},{"Title":"The Complete Illustrated Guide to Everything Sold in Hardware Stores and Garden Centers","review":"Steve Ettlinger writes books that are basic lists of explanations on various subjects.

It's set up in a logical manner, gives alternate names the tools are known by, explains the basic function and is an outstanding value, esp. if you can get a good used copy (which, by the way, cost me less than a footlong Subway sandwich WITH shipping).There's lots of different home improvement books out there and most of them touch on things that may be helpful to a certain extent. This book is an absolute home run by comparison and is a nuts and bolts (pun somewhat intended) guide for practical, everyday use.Know someone getting their first home?

Allen and Christopher Allen is more than the story of how the &quot;other half&quot; lives. It is a picture of dedication and work ethics which are much needed in our world today.

This story is a refreshing break from Boy Wizards and Vampires. The tone of the book is upbeat. The reader feels a connection to Chris Allen during the story, who displays a remarkable work ethic and witty outlook on life. I look forward to reading Ms. Allen's further work. She has definitely earned a five star rating for this review."},{"Title":"A Butler's Life: Scenes from the Other Side of the Silver Salver","review":"My husband and I had the privilege of staying at KIm and Chris' Inn in Southampton, NY this past May. Our son and daughter-in-law have stayed there several times and bought A Butler's Life for me in July. From the first page to the last I was totally engrossed in the book as how the wealthy live, Mr. Allen's life as a butler, and people's expectations of their staff. Knowing Mr. Allen I could visualize him going around Europe, the US, and being in the various comical situations described in the book. The book is descriptive, but not overly, to bore the reader. Having been to the south of France, California and the Hampton's I could easily picture all these estates and locals.I would suggest this book to anyone who wants to know \\"how the other half lives\\" and who wants a \\"an interesting, but light book\\". The recipes and entertaining tips in the book are also very helpful."},{"Title":"A Butler's Life: Scenes from the Other Side of the Silver Salver","review":"Truly enjoyed this book buy getting behind the scenes!

She autographed my copy of this book, and when I got it, I began reading immediately. What a find. Not only do she and Chris open up the world of \\"butling\\" with all its traditions, etiquette, and unwritten rules of confidentiality, but they also provide a wide variety of tips on ironing, cooking, serving--skills that a regular person could use in the real world of those of us not well off enough to have someone else perform these tasks for us.

Thank you."},{"Title":"A Butler's Life: Scenes from the Other Side of the Silver Salver","review":"Ever wonder what it is like to be a butler? Chris Allen shares his experience and pulls no punches in this fascinating account of the Butler profession. He worked in upper-class restaurants, on luxury yachts, a very formal English residence in the south of France and Switzerland, and also relates his culture shock at taking a position in southern California. Chris is a gentleman's gentleman, relating the finer points of everything from tableside cooking, silver service, large dinner parties, dressing, and handling difficult employers to overseeing large contracting and remodeling jobs as well as catering. Having done a good bit of catering and business conference work myself, I can tell you that Chris is spot on about how much work goes on in the back of the house to make your dinner or business conference run smoothly and appear effortless.A good butler can handle anything with apparent ease, and Chris is the best of the best. He even includes helpful recipes and lists of hints. If you have ever wondered what life is like behind the scenes in the service industry and behind the gates of those giant estates, A Butler's Life will show you.

Apparently this book was scanned using (very poor) optical character recognition. The publisher, General Books LLC, did not find that they needed to edit this in the slightest. As a result, your reading experience will be flooded with phrases like this, an actual quote from this book: \\"owner's v legal righL af.-e?eciijig-the occupant.\\" The chapters are also not organized properly, paragraphs are spaced terribly, and unnecessary line breaks run amok.Save yourself the hassle of trying to interpret this machine-scanned garbage, and buy a legitimate copy of Equality from a legitimate publisher."},{"Title":"Equality","review":"50 years ago my father gave me his copy of Bellamy's Equality - a well-worn often read tome in our family. It formed a critical part of my thinking ever since, and has guided me in making fundamental decisions about what is right and wrong, good and evil, and just and unjust. Anyone interested in social justice, or the abuse of political, religious, or financial power, should read and internalize what Bellamy was visualizing in his view of an ideal society in the late 1800's, based in part on his earlier work on his looking back from the Twenty-first CenturyLooking Backward: 2000-1887 (Penny Books)."},{"Title":"Equality","review":"I found the story enjoyable, and while I personally appreciated the explanation of what I believe to be the lost message of Jesus, it's dream has yet to be realized, suggesting yet to be resolved challenges in implementing a society which is totally satisfying for all."},{"Title":"Equality","review":"In sharp contrast to the raving, misanthopic Capitalist who gave this excellent book one star, Bellamy laid out his vision for a humanistic society... one which was natural and beneficial to humankind, rather than one which takes advantage of the poor, weak, or less talented. It is sad that Bellamy's vision for the 20th century only saw some chance of coming true with the New Deal and some of the social movements of the 1960s. Today, when crony coporate capitalism, fundamentalist religion, and evil seekers of oil, money and power rule the mindset of this once hopeful country (USA), the chance for humanism is slim indeed. If only the likes of those misanthropic capitalists who mock and distort Bellamy were to dissapear, we'd have a much healthier planet.And by the way, what we saw in the former USSR or in China today is NOT what Bellamy had in mind; but itself a misantropic, power-based dictatorship-based government which was/is just as unhumanistic as the U.S. is now."},{"Title":"Anthropology: The Exploration of Human Diversity","review":"This book is great for beginning anthropology students or people who just want to learn a little more about it! Basically, the author hits the main points (kinship, culture, primates, language, etc.) in an extremely easy to understand fashion. There are clear, concise definitions throughout, which I found to be very helpful when using it in the college classroom. Overall, a great choice for an introduction to the study of anthropology!"},{"Title":"Anthropology: The Exploration of Human Diversity","review":"Kottak is a model for scientific writers.

To me this story was unique. The history about the demons living on earth and being run off by humans was intriguing. You'll find the usual commonly used fantasy creatures alomg with some interesting new ones such as the leshies. The characterization was great. Most of the main characters developed throughout the whole story. The writing was typical for a bean book , nothing too fancy but enough detail for your imagination to bring the story to life."},{"Title":"Demon Blade","review":"It is an action packed journey for a band of heroes to complete their mission. It has humor, action, life and death, and even romance. I found it to be a very good read that kept me reading straight through, but it seemed I had just picked up the book.I would recommend the book to any fantasy and adventure avid reader. Plus it is great for both males and females (me) equally."},{"Title":"Demon Blade","review":"Although it is thrilling, the book lacks a few things.The whole stroy plays out in less then two hundred and fifty pages, which this story was not meant for to. The caracthers come and go without much order or a hint of it and Garland mostly centers on main caracters leaving the rest a little gray. The last battle is easily won and without much description of the actual event ( too much similar to the whole book ). It is as if Garland sometimes lost his concentration which resulted in such writeing.The good part is that the main caracthers are likeable and Garland developed them through the book both mentally and emotionaly. I also liked the history of the demon blade world and the way magic works is quite original.All in all a very good book."},{"Title":"Demon Blade","review":"Good combination of internalization of characters' thoughts (and character development) along with action and adventure. Plot is pretty predictable, but who cares? It was enjoyable and entertaining. Not great literature, but excellent for a couple of evenings' escape reading. \\"Frost\\" is the sequel, I understand. Wish I could download it to my Kindle."},{"Title":"Resurrection","review":"This book chronicles the generations of women in London who pass on the responsibility of guarding the secret treasure buried beneath a &quot;holy spot&quot; directly under St. Paul's cathedral. It is a fascinating history of the people and the changes that take place from BC to modern time. It is absolutely great!"},{"Title":"Resurrection","review":"The prologue of this book starts 15,000 years ago at the site of what will become modern day London and the book ends at the same place in the 1940's. Between these vast periods of time Mr. Boast has woven a spell which will keep the reader enthralled. The central \\"character\\" in the story is St. Paul's Cathedral, or rather the site of the present day one and the secrets that the place has held for many centuries. Five cathedrals have been built on the site that has seen violence, mystery and of course worship. To go too deeply into the plot would spoil the book for the potential reader. Suffice to say that this is an intriguing book and one that is well worth reading."},{"Title":"Resurrection","review":"I love this book. It traces a family of women through thousands of years of history as they guard one of the most sacred books ever. It has a real sense of continuity and even though there is only a 100 pages or so dedicated to each woman all of their stories are developed thoroughly so that you feel strongly for each one. You sense the growth of a country and notice the changes of the world and it's attitudes as you move through the book. My favourite story was Ellen's - she was a really strong and admirable character. I've not read any other books by this author but I will try and find some. This book entertained me for several hours - I couldn't put it down!"},{"Title":"Clown Scenes","review":"The Golden Age of Clowning was in Paris from the late 1890's through the 1920's. At that time, there were a dozen or more permanent circus buildings throughout Paris, and every week thousands of people flocked to the circus to see what new acts the clowns were going to perform. During this time, clowns actually spoke during their routines, and performed scenes with one another. Everybody knew the names of the clowns-- Charlie Rivel, Footit et Chocolat, Toto, Coco, and Marceline, to name a few.Tristan Remy, famous French circus historian, has taken 48 of the best clown routines and written them down in a fascinating document. And while they are primarily historical scenes, they are also blue-prints for proven comedy scenarios. I don't love the translation, but these are great tools for the working clown. Use them for good and not for evil."},{"Title":"Reshaping National Intelligence for an Age of Information (RAND Studies in Policy Analysis)","review":"There are other books on intelligence reform--the best being those by Bruce Berkowitz and Allan Goodman and by Loch Johnson--but this book is very special because it is written by an insider who has come to grips with the imperative for change and who is able to articulate the case for change in a way that others have not. This is arguably the single best and most elegant presentation for why our $30 billion a year intelligence industry must be turned upside down and shift resources away from secret satellite technology and toward analysis, analytic tools, and access to open sources of information.The author very correctly focuses on the fact that intelligence is about getting useful tailored information to the policy consumer, not about secrets per se. He is perhaps the best spokesperson for the view that the old paradigm--collecting secrets at great expense about a single enemy--must be replaced by the new paradigm--making sense of vast quantities of information that is not secret and covers a diversity of constantly changing targets. He correctly focuses on the selection and intelligent analysis of information rather than the collection of isolated secrets--on making the most of open information.The book is rich with anecdotal examples and makes a compelling case for dismantling the current intelligence stovepipes while simultaneously dismantling the culture of secrecy that prevents the sharing of useful information, not just within the Nation (e.g. with state and local law enforcement) but with coalition government and non-government allies of the moment.The author, a past Vice Chairman of the National Intelligence Council and a learned man with deep ties to Harvard, the Council on Foreign Relations, and RAND, concludes on a bitter-sweet note that demands Congressional and Presidential reflection. He firmly believes that both the intelligence community budget and as much intelligence analysis as possible should be made public and be in the public service. This book is highly recommended, and could-together with the the other intelligence reform books published in the past two years--reasonably be used as the starting point for a complete make-over of the U.S. Intelligence Community."},{"Title":"Reshaping National Intelligence for an Age of Information (RAND Studies in Policy Analysis)","review":"Greg Treverton has written a much needed overview of the national intelligence process and correctly identified the challenges which face the US, in a post-9/11 world. His views of the world beyond 2010 are quite revealing and his challenges to the intelligence community to assess threats to the US are precisely focused. His views on the major intelligence entities reveal urgent modifications of structure and process, if the intelligence community is going to regain relevance with national customers. As a teacher of intelligence process, specifically as it relates to strategic warning, I believe this book is essential reading for anyone who aspires to be a true intelligence professional. This book will help even the wisest analyst understand how to maximize available sources and methods. The quest to provide the best possible intelligence is a goal which must be achieved."},{"Title":"Mr. Beddle had a lamb.(short story): An article from: Jack & Jill","review":"Absolutely Adorable!This is one of the most precious children's books I've ever read!This author has a way with words that will amuse the adult reader as well as the child."},{"Title":"An Introduction to Neural Networks","review":"This is one of the best books I have ever read. It introduces neural networks, with a strong emphasis on biological plausibility. For example, the book compares the visual systems of simple animals with neural network feature extraction. Anderson moves effectively among evolutionary biology, cognitive science, artificial intelligence, and behavioral psychology. His insights are important, clear, and often funny as well. The book gently introduces source code for implementing the various neural networks that he describes."},{"Title":"An Introduction to Neural Networks","review":"There's nothing really wrong with this book - it's just not useful for someone wanting to actually program a neural network system.I read all sorts of stuff about the nervous systems in horseshoe crabs, but I don't find myself able to do anything with neural networks. Therefore, I'm scouring the Internet to find some source code examples or a tutorial of some kind.If you want to know miscellaneous information about neural networks, go ahead and buy the book. But if you actually want to construct neural networks, buy something else."},{"Title":"An Introduction to Neural Networks","review":"I highly recommend this book to anyone looking to learn about neural networks. It starts with a good overview of the biological basis that will be appropriate for the engineering student. The author is witty and appropriately cynical."},{"Title":"An Introduction to Neural Networks","review":"As the book states, this is an INTRODUCTION, it is not a reference or practical guide to construction. It is rather informative, specifically in the biological sense, and the author does a good job introducing necessary information before using it, such as a review/introduction to vector and matrix mathematics; however, some external reading my be necessary to understand if you do not already understand some of these basics.Note: I have only read the first 1/3 of this book so far as my first book on Neural Networks.In my opinion, the author does not write very clearly as he often provides examples or explanations that require a fair amount of assumptions and/or inferences to understand them clearly. On the other hand, he is to the point with no off-topic text. There are also a fair number of errors (typos) in some mathematical formulas and computer code, usually the usage of i or j where the other should have been used or a missing line of code that is clearly described in the text, but forgotten in implementation (the appendices may be correct, but you must download them from [...] ). If the math doesn't make sense to what is written, keep reading and a later formula is usually correct. He also often skips several steps when deriving formulas without explanation beyond, \\"if [formula] then it is obvious that [new-formula]\\" so you may have to stop to think about the math involved.The author is obviously not an advanced computer programmer. The code fragments are in Pascal, which can be easily translated to C/C++, but I would recommend against using this author's code for any reason other than the learning experience in association with reading the book for several reasons: First, the code is not object oriented, and thus will become more complicated than necessary, and second, because he speaks of how important optimization of the code is due to the large number of computations required, and then he immediately provides a 3 line function/procedure that is to be heavily used but could have been 30% more efficient by re-ordering the math (he did suggest the alternative math, and then went ahead and used the less efficient method). Finally, this code was written over 12 years ago in a language that is rarely used. Surely there are more comprehensive and more efficient libraries of code that would be more understandable in your native (primary) programming language.Let me finish by saying that I am in fact glad to own this book and recommend it to anyone (College level or above) who does not already, but wants to understand the roots of Neural Networks, the links to biology, and get an introduction to many of the most common types of Neural Networks. Be advised, the required reading level is rather high, but the mathematics (at least in the first third of the book) do not go beyond a little calculus (derivatives, integrals, and some partial derivatives), basic Linear Algebra (basic vector and matrix operations, and eigenvectors/eigenvalues), and a basic understanding of statistics."},{"Title":"How to Start & Run Your Own Bed & Breakfast (How-To Guides)","review":"I just read a library copy of this book, and now I'm buying my own copy for future reference. It was filled with essential information about innkeeping, and not just for those who want to start a two to three bedroom B&amp;B in their house.

It is definitely the best book I've read on the subject so far (out of about six books)."},{"Title":"How to Start & Run Your Own Bed & Breakfast (How-To Guides)","review":"While this book seems fairly complete as a guide, it certainly is for total novices, not only to B&amp;Bs but to those running their own business as well. Much of its information is common business sense in its foundation and offers little that one would not realize on one's own-unless they had never run any sort of business in the past. Even an individual who has operated a business for someone else, especially if that business were in the service industry, would know much of the basics found here. Most obviously lacking is any discussion of the value or how-to of Internet marketing, research, promotions, reservations or purchasing. Secondary to that is a lack is discussion on yield management, rate versus occupancy managment and adapting one's room rates to current occupancy and market room-availability and other market forces. The author also provides no discussion of purchasing principles or the advantages of economies of scale that can be gained with co-oped or group purchasing ventures."},{"Title":"How to Start & Run Your Own Bed & Breakfast (How-To Guides)","review":"Tells the nitty gritty of running the business aspect of a B&amp;B without going into the details of how someone should decorate.

It touches on many different subjects and gives an aspiring innkeeper a better idea of what it takes to run a B&B. They have great information about marketing, web sites, zoning and more.

I found it so frustrating to read!! I think the story is VERY hard to believe. I felt the urge to just shake Rosee a good deal of the time because I couldn't understand why she made all of those bad decisions. A lot of times it felt like she didn't WANT to be happy.Another reason it felt frustrating was the amount of time that elapsed in the book. I felt like in real life years fly equally fast. Hard to explain.It also bothered me A LOT how absurd a lot of things described in this book were. I know it's just fiction but it should be at least credible!I still think Cecilia Ahern is a gifted writer but I just didn't enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Where Rainbows End","review":"This book is a wonderful, light, easy to read and connect with the characters book.

Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Where Rainbows End","review":"A wonderful book which really made me laugh out loud a few times and had lovable characters and Ahern's trademark warmth.

It's a good quick read and written quite differently from anything else I've read."},{"Title":"Where Rainbows End","review":"In this excellent, epistolary novel, Alex and Rosie are kept apart by circumstances both within and without their control. The only reason I'm giving this book four stars rather than five is that one of the \\"reasons\\" keeping them apart was clearly a plot contrivance meant to add another 100 pages to the book, when it was an easily solvable \\"problem\\" in real life.My favorite character in the whole story was the solid, reliable, no-nonsense Ruby, who calls it as she sees it and is correct from the get-go in that Alex and Rosie are mad for each other and just have to face that for themselves.A friend of mine said a couple years ago that \\"love leads us down strange pathways.\\" This immensely entertaining novel is an apt demonstration of that belief."},{"Title":"Where Rainbows End","review":"This book had me gripped from the start! The characters all tied in so well. It made me smile laugh and cry, what more could you want from a book! :) would recommend to anyone whoLikes a heartwarming story"},{"Title":"Where Rainbows End","review":"Yes, it's been mentioned before, but I feel it is important to stress it: this book is also sold as 'Love, Rosie' and 'Rosie Dunne' - it's all the same book, people! So don't buy it more than once. (Even though I did, because I own it on Kindle, and I owned it in paperback, but it started falling apart after the millionth time I read it - only a slight exaggeration, I assure you - so I bought a hardcover copy too!).I have read this book too many times to count. It's the story of Rosie Dunne and Alex Stewart, who have been best friends since childhood. You can tell from the very start that it's a love story, and that Rosie and Alex are meant to be together, but they never quite seem to manage it, and go through all the hurdles life throws at them (including children, and several failed marriages) together. It's the story of the strongest kind of friendship, and is full of moments that still make me cry from laughing so hard, even after all the times I've read it. It's also got some beautifully written words in one of the characters confessions, and the whole story is written in notes, letters, emails, chats, etc. which makes it great to read.Basically, this book will make you laugh, cry, and get so frustrated with the characters apparent inability to work things out that it will drive you insane - but you'll love every page, I guarantee it!"},{"Title":"Where Rainbows End","review":"I absolutely love this book, but I don't understand why it's published under three different titles.

I thought it was be something more fun and spectacular. Bad things happened to this girl her entire life. Then, at the end, the story is 100% predictable. Not your average chicklit, sadly. I expected better. I found myself bored at times. And it is very confusing to see all of this email and text messaging going on 30 years ago.

I couldn't put it down! I did get caught up in the drama of Alex & Rosie and longed for them to be together and something inside of me sparked wishing I had a childhood friend like that where through the years you know they'll always be there and you can count on them!

I couldn't put it down. Absolutely fantastic and original read, comprised of letters, emails, IMs, all the ways of communicating without being face-to-face.I don't think I've ever laughed so much while reading a book, or felt so much for two characters and how separated their love is. You watch as Rosie and Alex grow up, and meet new people and have children and become different things, the entire book leading up to an ending you, as the reader can predict, but in a nice way. It's really heart-warming and excellent, although this kind of love is frustrating because you just want them to get together already! :) A very excellent read, especially when you want some entertainment on a very long, very boring planeride."},{"Title":"Where Rainbows End","review":"Even though all cecelia's books are my favorite, my heart probably went out to this book the most. Its a great book, no doubt and she took the liberty of penning the story in such a way that it is portrayed in letters, emails, etc.I felt really sad throughout, despite the humor and all. It was relief, to disappointment, to humor, and back to disappointment again. So much hints, so many second chances and all thrown away. This book remain the most realistic to our lives, in my opinion.A story about two best friends who grew up together, not realising that they were meant for each other all because of a chance that was missed and words left unspoken. They see each other through jobs, marriage, heartbreaks, and alot more. Until when they're finally at their retiring age, do they realise that they do love one another more than anything else in the world.It saddens me when I comtemplate about the time wasted, and all the words that were dragged on.'Where Rainbows End' is TRULY an endearing tale.If you're the emotional sort, read it and you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Where Rainbows End","review":"HiI really enjoyed this book but I don't understand the time frame thing. I am nearly 40 and when I was in primary school there was no instant messaging or emails. At the end of the novel Rosie was 50 so surely email didn't exist in the 70s? I am wondering if Cecilia Ahern is so young she didn't envisage a life without email. Was I too old to have read this book????I have tried to read as many reviews about the book and no-one mentions this. Perhaps the target audience is younger than me- I can remember a time when we didn't have computers and the only options were letters and phones (born in 1970). Is anyone with me on this? Would welcome anyone's comments.Cinds"},{"Title":"Where Rainbows End","review":"It was a wonderful book with one of a kind form of writing. COmpulsively readable. Will have no regrets of reading it."},{"Title":"Where Rainbows End","review":"This book was great! I laughed, I cried, I couldn't put it down. This is the first book I've read by Cecelia Ahern and I will be reading more."},{"Title":"Where Rainbows End","review":"This is one of the most original books I have read in a long time. It's seems completely fictional, but it consists of nothing but notes passed in school, emails, instant messages, text messages, and the good old fashioned way, letters. It also spans over 40 years just in one book. Of course, only the important events occur, years sometimes passing in the turn of a couple of pages.There's no particular no time period in this, as instant messaging is included quite early on in the book, and for it to span over 40 years, there's no specific year the book starts and ends. It can be quite confusing that way, but don't let your mind dwell on it.The book is about Rosie & Alex, who start off as best friends at school, and over the years, they encounter all the important events together: first loves, first jobs, pregnancy, marriage (to the wrong people at that), divorce, loss of jobs, reappearance of old girlfriends/boyfriends - basically everything you dread to happen in your life. Throughout all this, they argue, talk to others about what they can't tell each other, marry others ... The list goes on. They want to be together, but there's always some kind of obstacle.At first the book can be severely hard to get into, considering there's nothing but emails etc. But I've now read this book more than once (it must be 4 or 5 times now), and I still find it exciting!I identified a lot with this book, cos I'm a terrible hoarder, not only of material things, but stuff like emails & texts too. I have saved any email that ever meant anything to me, and the same goes for texts. I've saved some IM chats with my friends (which are somewhere), but I'm terrified about ever losing all my emails. They tell a story. They're nice to look back over every so often.I love \\"P.S I Love You\\" too, but \\"If You Could See Me Now\\" was confusing and disappointing, and I still haven't managed to read more than halfway through the book. I haven't even managed to GET halfway. I hope her next book follows on from \\"P.S. I Love You\\" and \\"Where Rainbows End\\", cos then it'll be great."},{"Title":"Where Rainbows End","review":"This book is fabulous! It's my favourite novel lately and I can just recommend this book to everybody liking humour as well as heartshattering stories...Well, why this book is one of my favourites:Alex Steward and his best friend Rosie are growing up together. Their connection is strong enough to stay years and years of pain, luck and the most irritating thing... fate. When he moves to Boston one year before graduating at High school,Rosie can be hardly happy. When Alex is supposed to come over for the debs ball, something keeps him at home. But that night should change Rosie's life. The hotel - fanatic girl planned to move over to Alex in Boston, where the two of them wanted to study. Instead Rosie becomes pregnant and nine month later little Katie is born.What I can report now is - without telling the whole story - is that Alex is getting married twice and Rosie once. And though, through all those years they loved each other with all their heart. They just had a bad timing.At the end a small surprise waits for the reader, a surprise that perhaps nobody would have expected and I do not mean the final love meeting between Alex and Rosie, but find out yourself and feel the joy of being taken onto a rollercoaster of emotion.Don't be surprised, the book includes a lot of emails,letters, etc...Have loads of fun with WHERE RAINBOWS END!!!"},{"Title":"Where Rainbows End","review":"I speed through this book quicker than most books I have read recently as it kept me interested, I quite liked the way it was formatted through emails & conversation a nice change.I kept wanting to skip to the end to find out what was going to happen.Thanks"},{"Title":"Child Custody Made Simple: Understanding the Law of Child Custody and Child Support","review":"This is a great book on custody and support issues.Webster Watnik, the author, presents a huge amount of information with accuracy, clarity, and simplicity.

It gives a simple explaination how to negotiate the court system, what forms need to be filed, how to find an attorney, and how to determine child support.Unfortunately, we were already deep into our pursuit of custody of my step-daughter when I purchased this book and found the information to be too vague. We also felt the book is targeted to mothers and did not address the issues fathers have to face when seeking a change in custody.Despite the above, this book was a useful piece of reference material.

There is some good information here (\\"Your lawyer is your lawyer, ... not your lover\\"), but not enough emphasis on the fact that laws vary from state to state. All examples given were from California law, which is not representative of the majority of states.An adequate portrayal of the custody laws in the US would fill several volumes. This book is superficial at best; it contains a chart with state-by-state list of most common statutes. BUT it does not sufficiently emphasize that these are subject to change! There is nothing \\"simple\\" about a custody battle, and the attempt to make it so is horribly unrealistic.I also found the story of the couple going through the process of a custody battle that was interspersed throughout the book to be offensive and stereotypical. The husband is painted as a real idiot who doesn't even know why he really wants custody of his son. Well, not many judges are going to award custody to a guy who can't even say WHY he wants it - much less one that is only sporadically employed!The wife is shown as having an all-too-helpful \\"friend\\" who stuck her nose into the couple's business, encouraging the breakup of the marriage and discouraging reconciliation.

It reprints, in one handsome sturdy volume, the complete contents of Robert Bloch's first two Arkham House collections, and also includes three tale previously uncollected -- 39 tales in all!! It stands as the finest collection of Robert Bloch's weird fiction, and shews how his style matured from the very early years (when he began to write under the influence of his mentor, H. P. Lovecraft, who suggested to Bloch that he try his hand at writing fiction) to his sly and cynical mature style. Here we have the very early Cthulhu Mythos stories such as \\"The Mannikin,\\" \\"The Faceless God\\" and \\"The Shambler from the Stars\\" to those very cool and unique mature tales that only Bloch could have written: \\"The Hungry House,\\" \\"Enoch,\\" \\"The Light-House\\" (a completion of an Edgar A. Poe story!), \\"Return to the Sabbath,\\" and so many others. I wish some wise publisher would reprint this book and add to it \\"The Skull of the Marques de Sade,\\" which would then make it the one indispensable Robert Bloch edition of his short fiction.

Since the whole thing is told from Eisenhorn's point of few, there are no infuriating cliff hangers. Things get resolved, one way or another, before you forget about what was going on.

Individually I think the books would have been to short, but all together make for a very full read. 5 STARS!"},{"Title":"Eisenhorn (A Warhammer 40,000 Omnibus)","review":"If you love epic science fiction, mind blowing environments, catastrophic battles, sinister characters, and you can overlook a few flaws, you'll love this book.Story:This omnibus features a trilogy of novels and two short stories chronicling the life of Imperial Inquisitor Gregor Eisenhorn. An Inquisitor is an agent who carries out the Emperor's will and combs the galaxy in search of heretics who have been touched by the forces of Chaos. When heretics are found, they are forced to confess through nine steps of unpleasant 'interrogation.' An Inquisitor follows a strict moral code, and must be very careful not to be corrupted by the forces that he is exterminating or he himself may be hunted down and interrogated... most unpleasantly.World:The Warhammer 40K universe is amazing. It is designed around an empire in a tumultuous existence fighting everlasting wars for thousands of years. The galaxy is war torn and just about every object in the world has been built to kill or withstand bullets, lasers, and blasts. The people are hardened, heroic, and loyal to their emperor. Just do a Google image search for \\"Warhammer 40k\\" and you'll see what I'm talking about.These books do an outstanding job at describing the landscapes, the vehicles, the weapons, the armor, the aliens, the demons... It will push your imagination to its limit.Characters:The characters are a mixed bag. Gregor Eisenhorn is well written and you understand his emotions and feel for him as he makes very difficult decisions. The rest of his allies are somewhat expendable. Many die off screen in a few words. \\"Fred was vaporized.\\" Or \\"Fred died.\\" Then Fred is suddenly replaced by Dave. Because of this, it is difficult to get attached to Gregor's crew.The villains in this series are excellent. They are dark, malicious, deceiving, and usually have some pretty scary physical characteristics. One antagonist is another Inquisitor who had his bottom jaw destroyed and replaced by a steel one. At first I thought, \\"bear trap.\\" Then I imagined it as real as possible, an uncanny valley of steel complete with a chin and bottom row of teeth, with squealing metallic sounds whenever his mouth moved. It's really fun to imagine the villains.Writing Style:Dan Abnett's writing style is a mixed bag. He does some things great: The Environments, the Battles, the Characters' Personalities, and the Villains.But there were a few things that really bothered me:1) Sentences are not written in chronological order.Example: \\"This is Medea Betancore,\\" I said, once his strong metallic grip released my hand.If you are trying to visualize this scene, you hear a voice say the line... then realize it was Eisenhorn... then realize that he shook hands... with a cyborg... Sentence structure like this will throw you off if you enjoy \\"watching movies in your head\\" as you read fantasy. It is a minor detail, but as these creep up, you'll find yourself re-reading sentences and paragraphs over to get a better idea of what happened.2 PacingAt times, the book goes into great detail about where the crew went, but glosses over important details with just a few words. \\"We spent 2 months on X moon, then a year on Y planet, then traveled to a distant star for 3 months. And Fred was vaporized. And then we visited Inquisitor Z in a space station...\\" Wait a second... Fred died?! He was my favorite character and that's all we get? Why was Fred's death buried in a massive section of Warhammer codexes? Fred deserved an on-screen heroic death! Sigh... I'm gonna miss Fred.3 MomentumThe books typically start out with a main goal, but the characters end up on a lot of side quests that almost feel like 20-50 page tangents. Then it's a big rush at the end to tell what happened. This book would have been much better if the important events were given more \\"screen time\\" and the story was paced more evenly.These things won't bother most of the Warhammer 40K fans, though.Action:The action in this book is pretty damn awesome and has some of the most epic battles ever written. There are wars, skirmishes, demons, psykers, battle titans, space battles, robots, lasers, metal slugs, aliens... Warhammer fans will be happy to read these. They are \\"crazy-over-the-top-super-epic!\\"Maturity: Older Teens - AdultsThis book features violence, gore, torture, swearing, demonic possession, aliens, and mass destruction. So... umm... it's not for kids.Overall:I understand why Warhammer 40k fans love this book. Dan Abnett got all of the important stuff right. There are great battles, a deep story, great villains, and fantastic descriptions of environments. It definitely puts you in the heat of battle! This book also contains some unforgettable scenes of carnage! However, the books do have some flaws with the things that don't matter as much. If you're just in it for the Warhammer 40K Greatness, you will give this 5 stars. If you want to enjoy this as a book or focus on the writing style, then some of the little flaws will bother you.Read this book if you love the Warhammer 40K environment.Read this book if you want to push your sci-fi imagination.Read this book if you love BATTLES!!!Read this book if you love dark characters and dark stories.Avoid this book, if the writing quirks that I mentioned are deal breakers.Avoid this book, if you like happy stories."},{"Title":"Eisenhorn (A Warhammer 40,000 Omnibus)","review":"i never read fiction...but this one was awesome! def a great book, even if u dont like to read, the only issue i had was that the binding on the book broke before i finished it! i read it everyday at work untill the end adn prob 20 days after i got it, parts of the book were comming off of the binding becasue it was soo thick and the glue wont keep the pages attached for the cover,,,,great book to read, but dont plan on letting ne one borrow it or save it for posterity"},{"Title":"Eisenhorn (A Warhammer 40,000 Omnibus)","review":"Eisenhorn takes place in the Warhammer 40k universe and if you haven't read a book in this particular genre then you could do worse than start here. Eisenhorn describes the life and times of Gregor Eisenhorn an Imperial Inquisitor. The Inquisition is what you might expect given the naming; it's an organization that ruthlessly seeks out and destroys the 40k version of heretics and other things deemed improper by the Imperium of Man (the human side of things in this universe). Those improper things encompass a wide range, but primarily the Inquisition seeks out and destroys those forces dedicated to spreading Chaos. Chaos in the Warhammer 40k universe is a malevolent force that derives from the Warp and manifests itself physically in the form of daemons and those who utilize the Warp energies to further the agenda of Chaos. That agenda is nothing less than the destruction of the universe and the order it represents.That's the basis for what Gregor Eisenhorn fights against and it's a constant struggle for members of the Inquisition against Chaos as Chaos is able to corrupt so easily and members of the Inquisition are so frequently exposed to sources of Chaos. The Eisenhorn stories are part action adventure and part mystery and Abnett does a good job of pacing things and keeping the reader on their toes. The various stories in the book describe Eisenhorn's wide ranging adventures in his fight against Chaos and the temptations that he avoids and those that he falls prey to. Eisenhorn employs a large coterie of characters as part of his retinue so the book is not solely focused on him, though it tends to revolve around him.The weak point of the book takes place in the last third as there is a time shift that disconnects the first two books from the last and leaves the reader feeling somewhat adrift as many of the familiarities of the first two books are swept away. The last book also loses some of the breakneck pacing of the first two and drags a bit. Other than that the Omnibus itself is overall quite entertaining. While Abnett has not really written any more Eisenhorn stories he continues in this vein in Ravenor. The Ravenor character is derived from these Eisenhorn stories and while not required it's probably best to read this set of stories before reading Ravenor."},{"Title":"Eisenhorn (A Warhammer 40,000 Omnibus)","review":"Characters so real you feel honest emotions for them. Really so much more then a WH40k book. Only wish there was a audio book that i could listen to all the time."},{"Title":"Eisenhorn (A Warhammer 40,000 Omnibus)","review":"Fantastic volume. Dan's vision of the GW world is brilliantly presented. Really enjoyed the story line and would love to here more, if he ever brings the charactor back.Mark."},{"Title":"Eisenhorn (A Warhammer 40,000 Omnibus)","review":"This is the first book I've read from Dan Abnett, and also my initiation to the world of WarHammer 40k.Without going into the plot itself (you can read about it in other reviews), I just wanted to say that it's very well written, and I was really captivated during the entire read. I found it hard to put it down, always wanting to read 'just one more page'.Dan Abnett's style here is superb. I've never heard of WH40k before, but Dan explains everything in such a way that even if you don't understand some reference or term immediatly, it'll be explained shortly after.In a nutshell, I really liked this book. HOWEVER, and this is the reason why I'm writing this review (my first), if you picked up this book and liked it, it doesn't mean two things -1. You will like further WH40k books.2. You will like other books from Dan Abnett.I've read 'first and only' from Dan, as well as the 'Ravenor'(spelling?) trilogy, and I was quite disappointed. Those two books (actually 2 trilogies) are nice, but they fall way short from Eisenhorn. The style isn't as good, the plot less interesting and the characters are fairly shallow and predictable.Just wanted to give a small warning to people who really liked this and was thinking of buying more of Dan's books before researching them a bit."},{"Title":"Eisenhorn (A Warhammer 40,000 Omnibus)","review":"There's not too much that I can write that hasn't been said already in one of the many other reviews. Still I wanted to add my comments. I just have to say that this is probably my favorite Warhammer book ever. I don't know if it's just that it's done from the first-person so it's unique and fresh or it's the delightful characters and settings, but either way the book just works. I think my favorite book is the first one, because of the change in circumstances for the second.The two additional mini stories were okay. I rather like the first one, but the second one I found kind of lackluster. Still it was nice to have a couple more scenarios from the guy's life.I guess I'll stop here; I really just wanted to give this a five because the book was so great. If you like Warhammer at all are attentive interested in what it is, then get this book you'll really really enjoy it."},{"Title":"Eisenhorn (A Warhammer 40,000 Omnibus)","review":"Great storyline, great environments and great character development. I couldn't ask for more. Scratch that. We could ask for another Eisenhorn to go to market. A post Ravenor story."},{"Title":"Eisenhorn (A Warhammer 40,000 Omnibus)","review":"There's something Lovecraftian in the Dark Forces the Inquisitor Eisenhorn fights with cunning and determination, but nit without angst and doubts generated by his strange dreams. This is space opera with a dark flavor, and unspeakably dark forces are sought by apparently respectable families. Military intrigues, harsh battles, intriguing stellar and planetary backrounds, great galactic scope make this series at par with the Night Dawen Trilogy by Hamilton and the Foundation Trilogy by Asimov, and the Demon Princes Series by Vance, with in plus the bitter flavor of the Hooded Swan series by Stableford.A must have for Space Opea fans!"},{"Title":"Eisenhorn (A Warhammer 40,000 Omnibus)","review":"This is an excellant piece of literature. Dan Abnett does an excellent job of creating characters that you become attached to, and the plot twists just keep coming. I tried multiple times guessing what the twists might be coming up, but you might as well not even try.Also, I was a little surprised the book was written from a first person point of view. This isn't really a big deal, but I just haven't read a book in a long time that was from this perspective, and I was a little taken aback."},{"Title":"Eisenhorn (A Warhammer 40,000 Omnibus)","review":"This was truly good stuff. I read about Ravenor first and so i had to come back and pick up Eisenhorn. I loved it. Some complain about Dan's endings and the loose ends but that gives it more of a real feel.Maybe someday someone will read this, ala Pete Jackson, get jazzed and do a mega trilogy. It would rock."},{"Title":"Eisenhorn (A Warhammer 40,000 Omnibus)","review":"This book was a surprisingly fun and smart sci-fi romp!Characters are interesting, the 40K universe was described in a non-childish way, the plots and locales were remarkable.I haven't enjoyed a book this much for quite a while.Great job, Dan!"},{"Title":"Eisenhorn (A Warhammer 40,000 Omnibus)","review":"Eisenhorn is a wonderful story with lots of action. I love playing the Dawn of War game and wanted to learn more about the Warhammer 40k Universe. After the 40th page you just want to read more and more.

I have never gotten into Warhammer 40K, but I read about this book because it coincided with the Dark Heresy RPG. On a whim, I decided to buy it, figuring that if I didn't like it, I could re-sell it. Well, was I SURPRISED. Fast paced and cohesive with characters that you really get attached to, it was like reading an action movie. First-rate, off-the-top-shelf writing makes this trilogy the best sci-fi I've read in a long time. It's dark, gritty, and lethal - everything you would expect from the Warhammer 40K universe. I loved it so much, that I bought a bunch of Abnett's other works. Moving on to the Ravenor series now. I can only hope that it is as good as Eisenhorn. My greatest disappointment is that the story ends. I wish I had drag in Hollywood, because I'd snap up the rights to this and start shooting tomorrow. Buy it, read it, sit back, and enjoy the ride. Just phenomenal!"},{"Title":"Eisenhorn (A Warhammer 40,000 Omnibus)","review":"Eisenhorn is a fantastic read from the best author in the Black library stable, Dan Abnett.Previous reviewers have done fantastic job of reviewing and highlighting the books contained in this Omnibus so I leave you to check out others reviews, so I'm just adding my voice to the chorus.Buy it, read it, enjoy!"},{"Title":"Eisenhorn (A Warhammer 40,000 Omnibus)","review":"I was looking for a good 40K novel to read and stumbled on Eisenhorn. The rave reviews gave me a reason to check it out. I admit that I have only just started penetrating the 800 or so pages, but I already can attest to it being a great read. When I was younger, I read a compilation of Warhammer Fantasy stories (the book was called Ignorant Armies) and I was disappointed with the poor quality of the writing. Eisenhorn, however, is a much MUCH better book and it is a very good read. Dan Abnett is an excellent storyteller and he does a good job of carrying the reader along. I particularly like the personality of Eisenhorn. He is an Inquisitor, but you also have a chance to see his compassion and bits of humor. My hats off to this book, I can already see it deserves the full 5 stars."},{"Title":"Eisenhorn (A Warhammer 40,000 Omnibus)","review":"This, for a BL novel is what i would consider its golden child and somewhat a masterpiece. Enthralling plot and likable characters, highlighting the difference between the Inqusiotor game and 40K. Ultimately the novels were written to sell the Inqusitor game and you can tell this as it is of a higher standard than most BL books and reflects the different aspect of the world.I really couldnt give this a higher recommendation, sheer brilliance on Abnetts behalf."},{"Title":"Eisenhorn (A Warhammer 40,000 Omnibus)","review":"Eisenhorn, as the collected works are now known is the quite possibly best of Dan Abnett's work. Originally published as three separate paper-back novels named Xenos, Malleus, and Hereticus this new edition includes the unabridged contents of those three books as well as two \\"arching\\" short stories of about twenty pages that connect books one to two and two to three. This is an amazingly opportunity.Covering a period of nearly three hundred years, Eisenhorn is an epic tale of the far distant future of humanity. The galaxy has been colonized by mankind and is united together in one glorious and dark Imperium that spans nearly forty-percent of the galaxy, untold trillions of human beings spread across thousands and thousands of worlds struggle for survival as the Imperium's tenuous hold on its territory and its way of life is threatened from without and within by forces both malevolent and ancient. Principle among these foes are the insidious taint of warp-spawned daemons and their corrosive chaos that corrupts the very soul of and body humanity, aliens who range from disdainfully arrogant to primordially evil, and the threat of insurrection from within the ranks of humanity itself.Set in the Helican Sub-sector, Scarus Sector, Segmentum Obscurus, but a small part of the massive Imperium, Eisenhorn will sweep you away across a region of the galaxy which spans nearly two dozen worlds. Named for the central protagonist of the novels, Gregor Eisenhorn, this tale follows his life of as Imperial Inquisitor, a man who has the power to devastate worlds and commandeer virtually any of the forces of humanity in his pursuit of the purification of the human race and the eradication of the mutant, the alien and the heretic. It is a tale with more in common with the epic poems of the Norse and Greeks than with modern science fiction for not only does it cover matters military but it has more than its share of, intrigue, desperation, a vast cast of characters, poignant moments of drama, betrayal, hopeless odds, sacrifice and mad hope.Abnett's setting and visuals almost leap out of the page and his characterization and storytelling is not only the best in the Black Library but one of the best in genre. Part Tom Clancy and part Robert Jordon, Abnett's tale of Gregor Eisenhorn from age 30 to nearly three hundred is a magnificent experience both sinister and sublime. You will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Eisenhorn (A Warhammer 40,000 Omnibus)","review":"Much as we love its products, Games Workshop and its related entities (Forge World, Fanatic Press, et al) are not best known for 'value pricing.' One such, however, the Black Library, has done its readers a tremendous service--anddone it for a terrific price, as well.Dan Abnett is almost universally lauded as the best of GW's stable of writers exploring the grim, dark future of its Warhammer 40,000 universe. While his 'Gaunt's Ghosts' series is probably his most popular, and its gritty,in-the-trenches, on-the-front-lines view of the 40Kverse appeals to readers of both SF and military fiction, his three volume series about Inquisitor Gregor Eisenhorn and the goings-on within the vast Imperium of Man behind those front lines is arguably his best...so much so that the three paperbacks which made up the series--'Xenos,' 'Malleus' and 'Hereticus' (named for three major branches, orOrdos, of the investigatorial Imperial Inquisition which Eisenhorn serves)--quickly sold out and became secondary market collectibles.Readers have clamoured for an omnibus edition of the three under one cover--and the Black Library has now delivered that, with 'Eisenhorn.' They've added to the collection, however, by including an introduction from Abnett outlining the origins of the project, as well as two interstitial short stories otherwise available only in old issues of the much-missed GW fiction magazine 'Inferno!' They've topped it with a terrific cover painting of Eisenhorn by ClintLangley (after Adrian Smith's original); and then they've priced the whole package for little more than a third of what the original novels alone cost, new.This is a tremendous series: if you are a fan of action/adventure, space opera, borderline superheroics, or military fiction (particularly of the 'small band of specialists on a mission' subgenre), you are going to find as much toenjoy as the dark science fiction reader the book is ostensibly aimed at...and if you've an interest in any corner of GW's richly-detailed 40K universe, you will not get a better 'feel' for it than you will here. Abnett draws hischaracters richly and emotionally, conjures a plot around them over the course of the three novels filled with wonderful small moments and an occasionaljaw-dropping sequence (the beginning of 'Hereticus' is so good, you will wonder how its climax can ever begin to equal it), but--probably best of all--never loses sight of the series' real star: the unique universe of GW's 41st millennium,which he never fails to find an opportunity to detail and explore, always convincingly.The three books of the 'Eisenhorn' trilogy are my favorite 40K novels thus far. Having them under one cover is a real 'fanboy' delight, a pleasure increased by the bonuses the Black Library has thoughtfully included. And the pricepoint means I will be able to introduce the Warhammer 40K universe to more than a few friends who do not play the games, but whom I know will enjoy these stories.Well-done, GW. Of course, a limited edition of the collection in hardcover would still be even nicer....Christopher Allen+++"},{"Title":"Eisenhorn (A Warhammer 40,000 Omnibus)","review":"This compilation includes the novels: Xenos, Malleus and Hereticus. The trilogy chronicles the progression of Gregor Eisenhorn from \\"puritain\\" to \\"radical,\\" along with his trusted staff, one of whom - Ravenor - has spawned his own series.The characters are well developed and engrossing, the \\"sets\\" immersive to the reader, and the plot keeps you turning the pages (and wishing for more). Abnett brings out the best in the Warhammer 40K canonical background, capturing the dark essence of the Inquisition in this case, as he similarly captured the core of the Imperial Guard in the Gaunt's Ghosts series.In short, this is one of the \\"essential library\\" for any 40K fan, and makes for a good read even if you don't fit into that category."},{"Title":"Eisenhorn (A Warhammer 40,000 Omnibus)","review":"I picked up this book mostly because of the cover art. It is one of the most gripping covers I've seen with the Inquisitor Eisenhorn looking like the Grim Reaper loaded for war.The book is just as compelling and it surprised me in the depth and complexity of the characters created.The book revolves around the Inquisitor Eisenhorn and his life's work to combat chaos and protect humanity.The colorful and insightful characters are deep in the politics of the Imperium and delves into the moral questions of right and wrong, good and evil, and do the ends justify the means.The plot never seemed to stagnate throughout the almost 800 pages of this trilogy.Dan Abnett is an author that I would look out for and I have purchased several of the Gaunt's Ghost series (I'm waiting for the delivery)This is my first Warhammer 40K book but I never felt like I was missing from the story by not playing/or having a history in the game.I would not hesitate to recommend this book for non- Warhammer 40k readers as I would classify this as a very good science fiction tale."},{"Title":"Eisenhorn (A Warhammer 40,000 Omnibus)","review":"I was always intrigued by this Universe ever since the early 1990s when a friend of mine from university introduced me to the gaming Warhammer Space Marine miniature figurines (which I was always fascinated with) but which I never collected, painted, played or saw anybody play. I'll ask true Warhammer fans and connoisseurs to forgive me as I review this book and share a little bit about the Universe of Warhammer from an outsider's perspective. If you don't know science fiction, I'll ask you to stop here as what I'm about to write will be unintelligible to the non sci fi fan.This omnibus is actually 3 entire books which tell the story of the Imperial Inquisitor Gregor Eisenhorn. What is an Inquisitor? Well let me tell you about the Universe to help provide context. Warhammer 40,000 Universe is set circa the year 40,000 in a time when humanity has colonized countless millions of planets throughout a good portion of the Milky Way. The whole Imperium is ruled by an Emperor centered on Earth who exists in a half dead state (he's ruled for thousands of years in this state....The Horus Heresy books tell the story of how the Imperium came to be) and the whole administration of the Empire is somewhat Feudal and Medieval with gargantuan bureaucracies and religion seems to permeate a significant portion of people's lives. So many technologies have been invented and forgotten that technology has come to be regarded as technomagic and there's a whole religion associated with technology. There's an Imperial Army and there are Space Marines, the Emperor's elite, genetically engineered, and powerarmour augmented fighters. In this time, faster than light space travel is through something called the Warp also known as the Immaterium (hyperspace) but hyperspace is not empty like in Starwars or Star Trek, hyperspace is teeming with demons and lost souls that are just ready to rip a spaceship that is not protected appropriately -- This realm of the Immaterium is also known as Chaos. In certain places the Imaterium is very close to real space (the two realities, ours and chaos, are very close to each other and here demons will sometimes spill out into the real universe and invade and corrupt real worlds and people (they become tainted with chaos)). In addition to the threats of chaos, there are orks and elves (homage's and elements of traditional fantasy, Tolkein etc)and insect like creatures (homage's to Starship Troopers and the Forever War) and ancient powerful creatures from millions of years ago --- and everything is fighting everything in this Universe (homage's to Brin's Earthclan etc). So there is plenty of evil to go around.With me so far? Here then the Inquisitor's job is to seek out and find the taint of Chaos, mutants, orks, xenomorphs, elves etc throughout the Imperium (basically orks and evil elves, genestealer cults, and demons). Inquisitors are very independent but they each carry the full weight of the Emperor, each has his own way of doing things but they have a hierarchy and they go out throughout the Universe seeking anything evil and once they do (each in their unique way) then they focus the Empire's legions to destroy it. They're like the white blood cells of the imperium by finding evil, tagging it, and then having space marines or imperial legions to come and destroy the evil.What we wind up with is a very Gothic, dark, dystopian and dystopian in the sense that this Universe entirely unapologetic in the torment and suffering of its people (hopelessness, war, terror, is the norm). Seems dark huh? It is....Begin tiny spoiler ****The Omnibus of Eisenhorn finds Eisenhorn already a full fledged Inquisitor hunting evil and traces his development as his devotion to emperor has him use more and more marginal (almost heretical) approaches to hunt Chaos and finally leaves us with an Eisenhorn who is devoted to the Emperor but who will use even Chaos to fight Chaos....is Eisenhorn good or evil - hard to tell....and this also leaves the gamers with the character as the gamers and their miniature games portray him....a Super Inquisitor***************End SpoilerI loved this book -- if you're going to jump or dabble (as I) in the Warhammer Universe --- this book is probably the best to open the doors and show you the Warhammer Universe. If you want some background on how the Warhammer Universe came to be, I highly recommend Horus Rising also a tremendous book from Abnett. Eisenhorn will show you some of the greatest parts of the Imperium as well as some of the worst evils and you'll even be rewarded by Abnett by him giving you glimpses into almost every facet of the Imperium including some glimpses into some Space Marines, Chaos Space Marines, and Titans and Chaos Titans (giant sentient Battletech like robots -- Warhammer fans, don't shoot me for comparing Titans to Robotech).Adult Context and note to PARENTS (next two paragraphs)A couple of things I didn't like about this book in fairness. Inquisition brings back thoughts of the Spanish Inquisition and some of the other horrible atrocities like the Holocaust that we as humanity have done to our fellow man and especially some of the atrocities towards the Jewish People. Also, this Universe is very very dark and grim - aside from being gothic it is filled with endless suffering and there is no hope for this suffering to ever end so it seems so unending but that is part of the appeal to the Universe. Also, I imagine by writing about Inquisitions and these terrible dystopias, in some grim sense - it helps us remember some of the horrible things we've done and how important it is to try to keep our real universe from becoming a Warhammer type Universe (I imagine WWII felt very much like Warhammer).Off the soapbox and back to the book, Eisenhorn and his company of travelers (and it felt formulaic in a the sense of having an almost D&D; or Final Fantasy where Eisenhorn builds a company of companions and then goes on quests and solving the world -- regardless, they all became very real to me and I connected with them. I've read some of the other Space Marine books since then etc and I must say writing for this genre is very very hard especially for Space Marines (they're very one dimensional) so once you finish Eisenhorn and you decide to venture beyond, you will find much more one-dimensional characters and writing appropriate more to young adult audiences (although don't know if I want my young adult reading this without the context of the holocaust, WWII, Khmer atrocities, Rhwanda etc so if you're a parent and your 12 year old is reading this genre - definitely consider pulling them aside, sitting them down, and provide some context...would I let them read? don't know - your call.Abnett did a great job with Eisenhorn (probably the best Warhammer Novel I've read -- although i'm working through Horus Rising and that's also truly fantastic). Disclaimer, I'm not a gamer or a Super Diehard Warhammer person and I'm definitely not Goth in any way. I'm glad I read it and I'm glad I got to peek into this fantastic and rich Universe that brings so much enjoyment to so many and which to me is comparable to the Dune, Starwars, Startrek in matter of complexity and Scale. So connoisseurs please don't bash me for highlighting this as a dark dystopian universe or analogies to holocausts etc.....the darkness is the appeal and so long as we approach it from a mature standpoint, this has tremendous entertainment value as proven by an almost 20+ year longevity and worldwide following. Fantastic!On Abnett -- Fantastic writer. You can tell he is very literary, very well versed, and has complete mastery of storytelling. I've loved every book I've read from him. His characters are real and I definitely connect with them.On Amazon - Discovered and bought this from Amazon. When I was done, I went to a local bookstore to look for something else Warhammer and found a very limited selection (Its gotten better lately as this genre has gotten more popular though) but overall, for some of these harder to find books or the latest Warhammer releases - I find Amazon the best."},{"Title":"Eisenhorn (A Warhammer 40,000 Omnibus)","review":"\`Middle Ages in space' doesn't do justice to Warhammer 40000, which draws on elements across the tapestry of western history to create a dystopian but many-layered future universe. Where Warhammer was confined by its late medieval setting, 40K gets to indulge a smorgasbord of historical flavours - Imperial Rome, Victorian England, 20th century fascism - while keeping Elves, Orcs and other medieval fantasy staples, only adding spaceships and guns. Hardcore science-fiction buffs may sniff as such quarrying of the past as intellectually lazy and tacky, but that's their loss.It's this sort of descriptive opulence that makes the Eisenhorn novels worth the read. In contrast to his Gaunt's Ghosts series, which can qualify at a pinch as military fiction, Abnett's trilogy of the plucky Inquisitor can't aspire to the detective genre. He gives us a sequence of events rather than well-defined plot lines leading to a resolution, admittedly a criticism that could be applied to many Sherlock Holmes stories. The trick is that the reader doesn't notice because he (more occasionally, she) is absorbed with the events themselves and the backdrop against which they take place. As Abnett acknowledges in the preface to the one volume edition, the idea was to give readers an insight into the texture of the 40K universe, so often sublimated into the pervasive violence associated with Games Workshop. The \`storyline' is Eisenhorn's self-narrated personal journey, which is used to showcase the 40K universe and serve as a metaphor for its moral paradoxes, with liberal doses of bloodshed, psychokinesis and daemonancy thrown in along the way.An Inquisitor was the obvious choice for this role, not just because he gets to travel but because the Inquisition is the Imperial institution par excellence, its raison d'etre being to root out difference within Imperial society and burn it - sometimes literally - in the name of species survival. The first paradox is obvious: to save humanity one has to crush it, in spirit and often in flesh. The second and connected one is more subtle: to fight the darkness one must flirt with it, a dilemma Abnett achieves primarily through the daemon Cherubael, who despite being more a device than a character and warp spawn to boot is one of the Black Library's more memorable creations. The implications of this ethical impasse aren't pretty. Everything Eisenhorn is attached to as a human being (even his own body) is progressively destroyed, leaving him stalking the shadows alone, or more precisely with an imprisoned daemon for company. The God-Emperor's work is a hard calling.As expected of a 40K novel, Eisenhorn is not exactly a light read. Occasional scenes of poetic charm and even beauty relieve a sea of grimness, in which most characters eventually die with varying degrees of unpleasantness. It seems to be the First Law of Science Fiction - the more dystopian the universe, the more readers relate to people living in it - and Abnett, who's perhaps better known for his work on the 2000AD (Judge Dredd) franchise, is an old hand at this. I can't think of a novel that better captures the baroque and sometimes frankly disturbing appeal of Warhammer 40000."},{"Title":"Eisenhorn (A Warhammer 40,000 Omnibus)","review":"I picked up Eisenhorn not really knowing what to expect as it was the first Warhammer 40,000 book I had read. I was pleasantly surprised at the depth of the characters, the complexity of the story, and the multiple plots Dan Abnett devolves throughout the 800+ pages.Eisenhorn is a compilation of three books. The continuity of the story and consistency of the characters warrants putting all three under one cover. I found each book; Xenos, Malleus, and Hereticus quite entertaining. The entire Warhammer 40,000 universe is based on the monolithic struggle of man vs. machine vs. evil vs. everything else. The Eisenhorn character is an agent of the empire of man whose primary mission is to stand between the onslaught of evil and evil machines and the countless billions of humans who exist in a quazi-techno hell set in the far future (*breath). His purpose is to stamp out \`Heretics' desire to obtain forbidden technology and the countless incursions of beings from an alternate universe called The Warp. He is accompanied by several characters throughout the book that are developed in concert with Eisenhorn.If you like to read about a never ending war with death and destruction on this kind of scale then I would think you would enjoy this book as much as I did. I could barely put it down as I was pulled right into the development of Eisenhorn right from page one.I reccomend this book to anyone who is a fan of Sci-Fi"},{"Title":"Eisenhorn (A Warhammer 40,000 Omnibus)","review":"I just finished the Eisenhorn novels, and I must say that they were not only thefinest work of 40K fiction I've read, but were one of the finest sci-fi worksI've ever read period, right up there in a near-orbit with the likes of FrankHerbert and Roger Zelazny.They were everything I had hoped the Inquisition War novels might be and wasn't.Abnett does a superb job bringing the 40K universe to life, and his charactersare excellent. Eisenhorn and his warband of henchmen are engaging andthree-dimmensional, so that by the end of the first book you think of them asold friends. He treats the characters so well, and with so much individualintegrety and attention to detail that he is able to go beyond the bounds thatmost authors could go without alienating the readers.His descriptions of Imperial life, both glorious and mundane, are so expertlyrendered, niether underly descriptive or overly verbose, that it literallypaints a picture in your mind. In addition, Abnett expertly grabs threads fromdisparate genres; Space Opera, High Fantasy, Lovecraftian Horror, Cyberpunk,Steampunk, Spy Thriller, Historical Renaissance and Religious Devotional, andexpertly weaves them together into a rich and beautiful tapestry which few worksof science fiction can rival, and which is at once both completely unique andcompletely in harmony with the 40K universe which I've always imagined.Kudos Dan!! Great read...I highly reccomend it to anyone who is interested in 40K or in Sci-fi ingeneral."},{"Title":"Eisenhorn (A Warhammer 40,000 Omnibus)","review":"Although Warhammer books have an unfounded reputation for being cheap-thrill paperbacks filled with nothing but explosions and interplanetary chases, Dan Abnett has taken the Warhammer universe as the backdrop for a seriously good work.\\"Xenos\\", \\"Malleus\\" and \\"Hereticus\\", the three books of the Eisenhorn Trilogy, are the best I have read by Abnett so far, better even than the ongoing 'First of Tanith/Gaunt's ghosts' series. The best thing about these books is undoubtedly the group of unforgettable characters we are introduced to (that fortunately we will find again, see \\"Ravenor returns\\") and the agile, gripping plot. I particularly liked the lead character, dedicated Inquisitor Eisenhorn, and his personal nemesis, the intriguing Cherubael.Believe me, this book won't let you remain detached. You'll find yourself taking sides and judging decisions as if you yourself were a part of Eisenhorn's team, and when you reach the last page there'll still be many questions that you will have to answer for yourself.A must-read for Warhammer fans, or for people who like coherent, intelligent adventure."},{"Title":"Eisenhorn (A Warhammer 40,000 Omnibus)","review":"Edit: WHAT? STILL NO HARDCOVER EDITION? HERESY!I have returned again and again to this author, but sadly nothing has quite matched the scope and force of his tour de force, the Eisenhorn saga.An epic you will remember. The characters and their fates and relationships will stay with you like few do. Years later I still remember key events vividly, and this marks the THIRD time I have frickin bought these particular stories, after twice having erroneously decided that saving weight and discarding non-essential personal belongings prior to making military moves around the world were more important than a good read.That said, there are some gripes.- Lack of occasional polish. Some endings feel rushed.- Some fight scenes are a bit silly, at least to the ex-mercenary, deepsea diver military man that I am.- He tried a little too hard to be hip, steampunk-ish and street-creddy in the scene where two of the main protagonists hit the slums.- Though he generally does a good job of keeping the fantastically impossible to a minimum, there are exceptions, where you just kind of groan and wish he'd just pay attention to the laws of physics and facts of old age a bit more. Heroes can be heroes, and a certain amount of suspension of disbelief is necessary, but sometimes he goes too far.- Hanging on to gravity-defying deadly raptor-like dinosaurs anyone?- Leaping from crashing speeder-bikes that are described as waaaay too fast to really allow such a thing?- The occasional unexpected introduction of a new central character that by all rights should at least have been mentioned before?Otoh, you will remember some little inventions of Mr. Abnett long after you've finished reading the stories. The coded language, the long and superbly drawn-out battle of wills between one man and one daemon. The self-sacrifice and the pride. The rise of man and the fall of man.A timeless classic that deserves the full treatment of the people who did the CGI Final Fantasy feature movie. Or the Peter Jackson treatment. Or a full set of Computer Game adaptations.Bravo, Mr. Abnett. Bravo. Your courage in letting this body of work stand, without resurrecting the main character, is admirable. And rest assured, though you may lose the rights to that character, no-one will ever equal what you created."},{"Title":"Eisenhorn (A Warhammer 40,000 Omnibus)","review":"The Eisenhorn omnibus is an epic collection from the 40k universe. Abnett is a master of his craft and takes the reader on a journey across the galaxy in a quest to purge the Imperium of evil. The characters, plot, and setting are all dynamic and you can almost see events unfolding before your eyes. An excellent series for anyone who loves Warhammer or science fiction in general."},{"Title":"Eisenhorn (A Warhammer 40,000 Omnibus)","review":"as a big fan of baroque, surreal sci-fi, I admired Abnett's vivid descriptions of some of the settings. I also appreciated the fact that he isn't afraid to use three syllable words or spend a few paragraphs describing the appearance of a world and the customs of its inhabitants. but unless you like thirty page play-by-play descriptions of chases and gunfights, those few sections are the books' only perks.the blurb on the back calls it an \\"interstellar epic,\\" but it's not nearly meaty enough to earn that title. like michael moorcock's elric books, it implies more than it explains, but does so much less elegantly. worse than that, tho, is the books' poor structure and lack of continuity. we're never given much in the way of clues, the characters don't evolve, and each of the three novels gave me the feeling that Abnett wrote it from beginning to end without any idea where it was going to go.the stories start out pretty good, get to an interesting climax and then get bogged down in some excessively detailed shootout. then, as if abnett suddenly realized he only had a hundred pages left to go, we fast forward through some hack resolution. the inevitable fight at the bad guys' fortress gets about fifteen pages, since he already wasted the bulk of the novel on fight scenes of lesser importance.but hey, this is a warhammer 40k novel, not a nebula award contender."},{"Title":"Eisenhorn (A Warhammer 40,000 Omnibus)","review":"The Eisenhorn Omnibus is a great deal for fans of the 40k series, and of the books. It constitutes a very high quality dark science/fantasy fiction. At the same time, it is very dry, and I found myself unable to get through it. I read to the end of the first book (the Eisenhorn arc is a trilogy), and put it back on the shelf, where it has sat for quite some time, waiting for me to try again.What I did read, I liked. I just felt that, after three hundred pages of Eisenhorn, there was no reason to carry on.I'm not a huge fan of 40k--frankly, I like the Eldar more than the Space Marines and Imperium at large, but the majority of the Black Library's fiction deals with humanity.As I've said, if you're into the 40k fiction, it's worth it. If you're only tangentially interested, as I am, it's a crap shoot."},{"Title":"Eisenhorn (A Warhammer 40,000 Omnibus)","review":"One of my favorite Warhammer Omnibus.

My first foray into 40K novels was the Ultramarines Omnibus which I enjoyed immensely so i decided to expand my library. After going through the entire book I was extremely disappointed at the lack of pull it had compared to Graham McNeils book.The characters in the story were pretty lame and really lacked polish. One part i particularly disliked was when he was using these terms to describe sword techniques.

When Abnett's characters suffer, you feel for them. Abnett's word use in environmental portrayal is terrific."},{"Title":"Eisenhorn (A Warhammer 40,000 Omnibus)","review":"Dan Abnett colors his Warhammer40K universe in a dark sci-fi/fantasy stew. Perhaps 'gothic' is the operative word here. If there ever was a book that evoked the strange otherworld of, say. H.R. Giger (the Swiss surrealist) it would be Dan Abnett's EISENHORN.This book was my first introduction into the whole WARHAMMER UNIVERSE. Until EISENHORN I had no idea what all this WH40K stuff was about. Now I'm hooked.I love these omnibuses. You certainly get your monies worth. My incentive now is to try several of the authors' whoose characters and/or storylines look interesting. EISENHORN (the omnibus) ranks up there with some of the best sci-fi I've read.Since EISENHORN I've read the 'CIAPHAS CAIN: Hero of the Imperium' omnibus by Sandy Mitchell (quite different in effect) and next on my list is a trilogy that's part of the WARHAMMER (Time of Legends) series calledThe Rise of Nagash (Time of Legends)by Mike Lee.For a WARHAMMER intro, EISENHORN is the book!!!"},{"Title":"Eisenhorn (A Warhammer 40,000 Omnibus)","review":"I will keep this short. Dan Abnetts \\"Eisenhorn\\" trilogy is one of the best sagas I have read relating to the WH40K universe.It gets right down to street level (the nitty gritty) and shines a light on how the non-immortal civilians of the Imperium live and go about thier daily business.Space Marine and \\"big battle\\" novels are absolutely fine and enjoyable but they lack some kind of substance. Eisenhorn's trilogy really does introduce you to complex characters, it gives the reader a chance to get intimate with Imperial society, it takes you through the dirty lowest levels of a hive and right to the top echelons of Imperial society. It gives you a rare glimpse at how an Inquisitor operates when he is not commanding massive attachments of Imperial Guard or Space Marines.I thoroughly recommend the Eisenhorn novels/omnibus to anyone familiar with WH40K or any sci-fi readers out there.If you enjoyed Eisenhorn, check out \\"Mathias Thulmann - Witch Hunter\\" thats is a top read aswell.Have a fantastic day."},{"Title":"Eisenhorn (A Warhammer 40,000 Omnibus)","review":"If you like the idea of jedis battling truly DARK forces, then you'll love this book.

If you aren't, it still holds up quite well as it more than adequately sets the world for a reader. The story chronicles the life of Gregor Eisenhorn, a man who strives to maintain purity and justice in the dark future. The story does a fantastic job of showing how morals can decay, and beliefs change, some times out of necessity. Sometimes you must become the very thing which you want to destroy, in order to do so.

As a general rule, the 40K universe is so grim that it is almost a caricature, but Dan Abnett does a great job of toning down some of the sillier elements of the universe while still packing in enough action to choke an Ork.If you're a 40K fan, chances are you've read this, but even if you know nothing of the game or its setting I think you'd enjoy this trilogy if you like action, intrigue and a, sweeping, kaleidoscopic landscape of alien worlds."},{"Title":"Eisenhorn (A Warhammer 40,000 Omnibus)","review":"Eisenhorn is the name of the Omnibus that contains three novels and two short story's around the Imperial Inquisitor Gregor Eisenhorn.

But this trilogy is a whole new level. His prose paints dark mental images of the creepy 40K universe. The plot gets better and better. Months after reading it, I still remember vividly some of the critical events.This is not the book for a newcomer to the Warhammer 40K genre. But for someone reasonably familiar with the concepts, this is the best yet. Really, it's that good."},{"Title":"Eisenhorn (A Warhammer 40,000 Omnibus)","review":"The above reviews are dead on and I'm not sure what I can add except this: I am not( or should I say wasn't) a Warhammer 40k fan when I picked up the book. I almost didn't buy it because I thought It would be too difficult to drag myself through all of the game specific terminology since I don't play the game. I was WRONG. Dan Abnett truly tells a compelling, in-depth, page turner of a story that's 1 part Sherlock Holmes, 1 part Raiders of the Lost Ark, and 1 part Lovecraft's Cthulu. The Eisenhorn Ominbus edition covers all three books and 2 chronlogically organized short stories.Inquisitor Eisenhorn is truly a character you can invest in and his tragic flaws only make more him more endearing and believable. This is not a superhero, James Bond series where the main characters always save the day and emerge unscathed. These stories are really about Eisenhorn's transformation as he is drawn deeper and deeper into crossing the line of heresy in his crusade to save humanity from the terrors of Chaos. How much sacrifice is acceptable and can the ends justify the means? The beauty of this SF epic is that Eisenhorn explores these concepts while providing a blood-soaked, action packed, thriler of a ride.I just chucked Dune and Starhship Troopers off my bookshelf. Eisenhorn deserves to stand alone at the top of the SF heap. My best comparison is LOTR. This is a definite buy-it-in-hardback-if-you-can-find-it so it can endure the wear of re-reading."},{"Title":"Eisenhorn (A Warhammer 40,000 Omnibus)","review":"As usual, with Dan Abnett you get exactly what you expect:a fast paced, well written, action packed page turner.

If you want a quick read that willtake your mind of things, this will do the trick"},{"Title":"Eisenhorn (A Warhammer 40,000 Omnibus)","review":"I've never read a Warhammer 40,000 novel before and picked the Eisenhorn omnibus because of the good reviews it was getting. I must say I came away a bit disappointed. Three stars, because I did find it an enjoyable read mostly to learn about the Warhammer 40,000 universe. But the three stories in the omnibus - Xenos, Malleus and Hereticus - do have flaws.Almost every encounter ends in the same way: inquisitor Eisenhorn and his allies charge in, guns blazing. They begin with stealth and infiltration, but their subtleties run out very quickly every single time - or is that Dan Abnett's imaginition failing to come up with a different conclusion to a scene?The finales of the three parts are also remarkably similar: large-scale attacks of troopers on a heretic undertaking. Eisenhorn waving a book around everybody wants (the Necroteuch or the Malus Codicium) and then destroying it.Hilariously funny - but not meant to be so - is the scene in which Eisenhorn tells Bequin she is an Untouchable. She takes it hard and starts sobbing, as if she has just been dumped. But no, she has just been told that all people have a soul, a signature in the warp, but that she is Untouchable and has no such psychic presence and she can therefore act as a damper on the psychic powers of others. All this happens off-camera, it just reads that Eisenhorn tells her she is an Untouchable and that she cries. The proper reaction would be one being dumbfounded :)Despite its remarkable repetitiveness (why do we need to know in such painstaking detail all the time what characters are wearing - is this the gritty universe of the grim future or a fashion show?) the omnibus has some redeeming features. Eisenhorn's meddling with forces he shouldn't meddle with is interesting, even as his 'change' comes pretty abruptly and coarsely. The daemonhost Cherubael is very well done, the best character in the book, especially when he does not use his superpowers but just his insidious whispers.So sure, fans of the universe should probably want to read Eisenhorn. But the general feeling of disappointment, that comes from knowing that if this is the best Black Library book ever, remains."},{"Title":"Eisenhorn (A Warhammer 40,000 Omnibus)","review":"One of the great books in the Black Library, it is a definite must read. Superb characters, setting and Grim Dark flavor. Truly one of the best sci fi books Ive read!"},{"Title":"Eisenhorn (A Warhammer 40,000 Omnibus)","review":"This was my first experience with Dan Abnett's writing and I see why he is so highly recommended. His writing is just complex enough that you have to pay attention, but still an easy enjoyable read. One of the things he likes to do is describe a scene without giving you any knowledge of the equipment or techniques or terms he is using. Just when I think I missed a few pages, Abnett starts filling in the gaps and everything makes sense. The whole book is filled with \\"Oh!\\" moments when paragraphs you have already read suddenly make sense. It can be a bit jarring at first, but just keep reading and it will all come together as the vocabulary is learned. The characters are all amazing. I really cared about what happened to them and Abnett does a fantastic job giving them depth and texture.There really isn't much to say that hasn't already been said in the reviews here. It's one of the best books I have on my shelf."},{"Title":"Eisenhorn (A Warhammer 40,000 Omnibus)","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed all three books. Great action, good stories. However, I did get rather tired of everyone except Eisenhorn dying. Also, I think the character Fischig was developed well up until the last book.

Get it now and prepare for a wonderful tale that will take you on a epic journey and wont let you down. There are too many moments to highlight from the Omnibus that I'd rather tell you to just buy this book and you will also see for yourself.This one will most likely be read and reread many more times as it since in my library of 40k books."},{"Title":"Eisenhorn (A Warhammer 40,000 Omnibus)","review":"This compilation was the 'last chance' read for dan abnett in my book, after what I considered contrived or overt insertion of coincidences to introduce plot items or devices/resolutions in First and Only and Fell Cargo. I particularly felt first and only was entirely too contrived in the introduction of elements of gaunt's background, each as needed for the plot. Maybe he was limited in space or had strict outlines there, but in any event....this series had none of those flaws. First-person narrative read well, and usually quickly, with no sense of contrived coincidences just to move the plot along, and few if any of the cliche plot turns that I disliked in the books i mentioned above. Furthermore, Abnett shows his tremendous ability to describe enviroments, worlds, cities, through language. When he describes a Hive-city, a small village, a trans-alpine railway, you feel like you are seeing it.Another great strength of this story, particularly Hereticus, is the development of his ability to write very competent antagonists. A major defect in much sci-fi, BL and not, is the use of cardboard-cutout antagonists, who leave you wondering how they ever rose to their position in the first place. The major antagonist in this trilogy, Pontius Glaw, shows early signs of the extreme competence without omnipotence that some villains from his later Ravenor series show.Edit - 4th re-read, 08.2008 - Having read everything else by Abnett, and gained a lot of familiarity with W40k in general, I would like to offer that this is a great trilogy.One thing that caught my eye this time was an aspect of Ravenor that was apparently dropped in the Ravenor novels - His Lord Seer eldar that he referred to in the last part of this trilogy. The implication was that Ravenor was subservient or at the very least allied with the Eldar, something Abnett seems to have just dropped in the follow-up series."},{"Title":"Eisenhorn (A Warhammer 40,000 Omnibus)","review":"The larger print makes it a lot easier on the eyes when reading and in comparison to the trade paperback versions. It is also cheaper to buy the larger version than the books individually.The writing style of Dan Abnett creates vivid and real characters rich in detail. Each setting and engagement places the reader into that scene as a participant. The action and storyline flows in battle against the Chaos that threatens humanity in the Warhammer 40k universe.The books starts with one lone Inquisitor and later ends with him having created a full staff, complete with training schools and subordinate Inquisitors. One can become easily attached to the characters in the series, just like in his Gaunt's Ghost series.The science fiction world created by Dan Abnett is amazing and I truly prefer his stories over those of the Star Wars universe where main characters were stagnant, \\"evil\\" Imperial forces were destroyed by the thousands and the good guy Republic always triumphed with minimal losses. I actually have the full X-wing series and many of the original trilogies and mini-series of Star Wars books from the 1990's. But now, Dan Abnett has become my favorite in Science Fiction and enjoy his writing much more than Stackpole or Zahn. Both Stackpole and Zahn are also excellent writers, but really do enjoy Abnett's writing more.Abnett's characters evolve and some favorites will die in a dark universe where humanity is fighting for its survival. This is not a book that ends happily ever. Will humanity overcome the Chaos that threatens or will he fall prey to it in the attempt of learning and fighting it?Warhammer 40k universe is very grim, dark, and compelling to read with other fine series of books written by William King and Ben Counter."},{"Title":"Eisenhorn (A Warhammer 40,000 Omnibus)","review":"Eisenhorn is great.Like all of Abnett's books (that I know of), Eisenhorn is set in the Warhammer 40K universe. That doesn't matter, in that no prior knowledge of the universe is necessary to enjoy the books. And it matters a lot, in that the WH40K universe is a handy setting for exploring certain questions.And Abnett is angling for very big questions. Is it okay to use evil to fight evil? How much? Should dangerous knowledge be locked away or destroyed? What about dangerous people? Is a bad person ever beyond saving?Would you voluntarily sacrifice one innocent life to save others? Who?In the WH40K universe demons are real, heresy is contagious, and the church and the state are one. Gregor Eisenhorn is an Inquisitor, tasked with uprooting and destroying the major threats to human civilization: aliens, mutants, and heretics (the three branches of the Inquisition, and the titles of the individual novels, are Xenos, Malleus, and Hereticus). Thanks to advanced technology, high caste humans of the far future have lifespans measured in centuries. The Eisenhorn trilogy spans something like 300 years, during which time Eisenhorn builds up a supporting organization, tackles ever more dangerous adversaries, and increases his own knowledge and power. Whereas most WH40K novels deal with soldiers and combat, the Eisenhorn books are more like mystery thrillers. Well, science fantasy mystery thrillers punctuated by frequent firefights, anyway.Some reviewers (here and elsewhere) have knocked Abnett for a couple of things that turn up in a lot of his books: he has no compunctions about killing major characters, and his endings tend to be a bit abrupt. The first one is not really even a complaint in my book. It's more like a compliment for writing characters that we care about and still being tough enough to tell the necessary story. It's also true that Abnett's books come to quick ends; you can't help noticing that there are only 15 pages left when you're still gearing up for the final confrontation. On the other hand, this ain't Return of the King. You're not going to cry at the end and neither is Samwise Gamgee, so there's no reason to drag it out for half a dozen endings. I know it's cliche, but really, seriously, the Eisenhorn trilogy is about the journey, not the destination. It's not what Eisenhorn does to the bad guys that's of primary interest; it's what he does to himself and his loved ones along the way."},{"Title":"Eisenhorn (A Warhammer 40,000 Omnibus)","review":"If you're a fan of Warhammer books or Dan Abnett, Eisenhorn can't be beat. And, if you're not a fan of Dan Abnett, I can only assume you haven't read his books. This is one of his best, along with both the popular Gaunt's Ghosts series and Ravenor, which is a spin-off series from Eisenhorn.Following the life of Inquisitor Gregor Eisenhorn, the books have a detective novel feel to them, which is effectively conveyed through the first person narrative. When coupled with Abnett's marvelous skill at bringing to life the stunning 40k universe, this is a must read. Oh yeah, and there's also the fighting, which is very tastefully done in Eisenhorn, and almost always patently believable. Abnett does a masteful job of sketching out Eisenhorn and his close circle of associates, and throughout the series you can't help but feel empathy for them.As for the Omnibus version, which is being reviewed, I would recommend it for the two short stories that readers of the individual books missed out on. The more Eisenhorn, the better.If you're absolutely new to Warhammer, there are probably better introductory texts out there. Then again, none of the other Warhammer authors write as skillfully as Abnett, so I would be loathe to recommend anyone else. Therefore, it would be smart to read the Gaunt's Ghosts novels or this first. Only read Ravenor after Eisenhorn, for the sake of continuity."},{"Title":"Eisenhorn (A Warhammer 40,000 Omnibus)","review":"I went from reading all of Dan Abnett's \\"Gaunts Ghosts\\" books right into the Eisenhorn Series. It was a natural segue and a continuation of the \\"fight against Chaos\\" theme. It was fascinating to me to step back from the front line fight against Chaos of the initial books into the battlefield of the Inquisitors. Abnett does an amazing job in weaving his tale between the three books in this omnibus. His characters are rich and believable. Abnett explores interesting ground again as Eisenhorn dips into the world of Chaos to save the mission of the Inquisition. A must read! I would definitely recommend reading all of the Gaunts Ghosts books before reading this Omnibus."},{"Title":"Eisenhorn (A Warhammer 40,000 Omnibus)","review":"[this review refers to the first of the 3 books contained in the omnibus]For the most part, my gaming days are behind me. However, something about the dark, brooding covers from the Warhammer 40,000 books beckoned to me, whenever I saw them at the book store. I did a little Amazo-research and it seemed like DA was a good guy to start with. Then I found Xenos at a Half Price and decided to give things a whirl.I expected some enjoyable, but very two-dimensional escapist fare. But I'm pleased to say that Mr. Abnett proved me deadass wrong. Not only does this rise above the typical comic book-RPG-movie adaptation crapola, it's just a really excellent and layered SF novel. It has lots of characters, action, and multi-layered plots. My favorite thing was that throughout the book, the author references past, present, and future events that more than hint at a very diverse and four-dimensional universe.The other-dimensional aliens and their space-Necromnicon really put a creepy twist on the proceedings. It's David Drake (military action) meets Frank Herbert (layered world-building), smothered with a sticky and chaotic Lovecraftian sauce. \\"Too hyperbolic\\", you say? I beg to differ. This book delivered on all fronts and I look forward to more."},{"Title":"Eisenhorn (A Warhammer 40,000 Omnibus)","review":"Eisenhorn is a Warhammer book by Dan Abnett, arguably the best Warhammer author out there.In the book, Abnett describes the advantures and life long quest of the Inquisitor Eisenhorn and his war on the Heretic, the Alien and everything tainted with Chaos.Eisenhorn's adventures are breath taking and exciting as he tangles with increasingly tougher enemies as his enemies get mightier. Through his undertakings we learn about the human Empire in the 41th century.You don't have to know Warhammer to enjoy the book as everything is explained in excruciating details.The career of Eisenhorn is outlined in this omnibus and following this possessed Inquisitor in his often bloody job while he fights for the soul of humanity is one of the rare joys found in literature today."},{"Title":"Eisenhorn (A Warhammer 40,000 Omnibus)","review":"I unfortunately made the mistake of reading the \\"Ravenor Omnibus\\" first so that kinda gave me a distorted view of Eisenhorn, however, despite this it was still on of the best books I've ever read. The story lines were second to none, and kept me on the edge of my seat the entire way through the book. Character development was unbelievable and I actually felt like I knew them. Dan Abnett is in my opinion one of the greatest writers of our time, and I have enjoyed every one of his books I have read. If you enjoy a good story, and love the world of Warhammer 40k READ THIS BOOK!!!"},{"Title":"Eisenhorn (A Warhammer 40,000 Omnibus)","review":"I'm a bit of a picky reader, and while I prefer Science Fiction, I am, in general, strongly turned off by the idea of churned out fiction set in somebody's IP, like Star Wars or Star Trek. I'd heard a lot of good things about Eisenhorn, but I couldn't really bring myself to buy it. However, I found a friend with a copy, so I borrowed it and read it.I found myself immersed in the book, and wound up reading the trilogy in about a week. The story has a knack of seemingly small, innocuous events and characters becoming more and more important as the story progresses, and I found myself making excuses to my family to sneak back and read further along to find out what happened.You would probably benefit from having some knowledge of the 40k universe before reading this, but most important topics are explained in sufficient detail that a newcomer could read this book. As an Inquisitor in a world where magic is real, it reads like a supernatural mystery. The stories were, I thought, somewhat reminiscent of the Lovecraft mythos-- Eisenhorn meets supernatural evil that corrupts humanity and is powerless to stop it-- but with the twist that he has a choice to make-- the choice to maybe use a small part of that corruption to actually defeat the larger evil.I was pleasantly surprised. I will be picking up my own copy of Eisenhorn and will recommend it to my friends. I might even go so far as to read another Black Library book...preferably something written by Dan Abnett."},{"Title":"Eisenhorn (A Warhammer 40,000 Omnibus)","review":"I loved these books, they were well written and offered something I think is rare in the 40k universe; that is deeply engrossing characters in a very pulpy setting. Took me a while to get used to the style of writing though as I have never seen anyone use 1st person omnicent and that threw me for a bit. After I got used to that I just soaked up the flavor that Mr. Abnett put out and loved every second of the endless adventure. If you want a book in the 40k universe that is not totally over the top crazy all the time then this is your book. It is very grounded as you see things through the eyes of one particular Inquisitor. I wish Mr. Abnett would write more books of this idea, it was refreshing for the hero to not be the unfalliable space marine and just a man doing the Emperor's work. Buy this book you will not regret it."},{"Title":"South Africa: A Narrative History","review":"Frank Walsh has made South African history compelling, from the early colonial period to the present day. Dense, but readable, the narrative style contributes greatly to the flow of events. Particularly enlightening is Walsh's method of including &quot;mini-psycho-biography&quot; as an aspect of character analysis. The Boer colonials are more alive than in any history I have previously read. Their foibles and human weaknesses are shown with sometimes tragic-comic insight. My understanding of the tribal situation has grown greatly from reading this book, so the present day Zulu-Bantu power struggles gain new meaning. Kruger, Malan, DeKlerk, Mandela, Biko, Buthalezi...are all here, along with the ghostly spectre of the all but extinct KhoiKhoi (Hottentots). Walsh has made Africa's pariah a thing of flesh and bone, in which we can see all of our humanity too well. Read this history if you wish to understand today's South Africa."},{"Title":"Dennis the menace, busybody (A Fawcett gold medal book)","review":"\\"Dennis the Menace\\" is one of the most endearing comic strips because no matter how good their child is, each parent experiences some of the behaviors of Dennis. Furthermore, nearly every neighborhood has a grumpy old Mr. Wilson; in my neighborhood it was Mr. McConnell. A boy on a mission, Dennis is a child that is on the extreme of the spectrum of behavior, yet he is also endearing, because at times he does things that melt your heart. While no child is all bad, all children are bad at times so we can enjoy Dennis from a distance and see our children and relive some of the more memorable events from our childhoods."},{"Title":"Ralph Waldo Emerson Bicentennial Handbook","review":"In celebrating Ralph Waldo Emerson, Mr. Makinson gives a good summary of Emerson's message to his own age and to this age."},{"Title":"Lithuanian Jewish Communities","review":"A wonderful and absolutely essential reference for anyone interested in genealogy!"},{"Title":"Lithuanian Jewish Communities","review":"I was pleasantly surprised by this book. The description and previous reviewer did not due this book justice. It begins with an excellent overview of the history of Eastern Europe and the travels and travails of the Jewish population. The emphasis is on Poland and the Baltic which needs no explanation. Also, with each town listed you get a few details that while not of any depth is interesting.This book was written for those who want to research their family origins. It would be an excellent resource for this."},{"Title":"Baton Change: Releasing the Next Generation","review":"For those who wonder if the church can still be relevant today, this book is a gripping and honest account of how young leaders working with spiritual fathers who are young at heart can impact a new generation with good news and a radical lifestyle.

If you are looking for a no-nonsense, easy-to-do, anywhere/any time workout routine then this is the book for you. It is concise and clear. The instructions are well written, and the pictures provided help you visualize the exercises. There is also good information on staying healthy and eating well.You can start implementing the techniques described immediately. This book offers a workout routine for the gym as well as for home! Your start up costs may be mimimal, depending on whether you want to work out at a gym or in your home, e.g., you may choose a gym membership or a few free weights and a workout bench or a full-blown home gym.I've investigated/tried a lot work out programs that look good but aren't always convenient to use on a consistent basis. I am a working mom with five children. I commute and travel for my work. This doesn't leave a lot of time to exercise. I can do these easy routines anywhere/any time and began it with mimiumal expense. Even when I travel, I can use many of the exercises without my weights (dumbell/barbell/leg) or my benches!It would be nice if the publisher would reprint this book. I think more people would consistenly workout if they had this resource available."},{"Title":"Hard Bodies Express Workout","review":"This book is a fitness classic. I occasionally try other weight training programs, but I continually return to this book. Though a gym routhine is provided, I use the at-home routine exclusively, and still get great results after all this time (I have been using this workout for ten years, and I'm still challenged because of weight progression). There is no better summary of weight training information anywhere, and I appreciate only having to find time to work out twice a week instead of the usual four times a week found in other weight training programs.

She looks great."},{"Title":"Hard Bodies Express Workout","review":"As a rank beginner, I found this book helpful. The instructions and pictures are easy to follow. The only drawback for me is that the authors seem to subscribe a bit to the &quot;no pain no gain&quot; theory.

I find twice a week easy to stick with, too."},{"Title":"Hard Bodies Express Workout","review":"I bought this on sale about 12 years ago. I've had people borrow it and I've had to go get it back.

Time-Life called upon the talents of wonderful writers like Peter Feibleman, playwright, essayist, and sometimes-lover/sometimes-collaborator of Lillian Hellman's to write The Cooking of Spain and Portugal. (Feibleman was co-author of Hellman's last book, Eating Together, which one should read for the writing as much as for the recipes therein.)Feibleman often lived in Spain, and he grasped its various cultures well. He took the time, both as a lover of good food and a lover of a good story, to learn the history of traditional dishes and the various regions from which each came. He brings the settings of the cuisines to life, explaining for example, the history of Gazpacho, which comes originally from the breathtakingly hot region of Andalusia.\\"If there is a single key to the quality of the Andalusian kitchen, it is lightness,\\" he writes. \\"In the blistering, sun-steeped cities...food must be so lacking in heaviness and so easily digestible as hardly to appear to be food.\\" He goes on to describe Gazpacho:...Andalusian's food must somehow exist under the ponderous southern sun without wilting. It seemsa conglomeration of nothing...for Andalusian dishes like Andalusian jokes do not bear heavy scrutiny.He then goes on to describe the traditional method for making this extraordinarily delicious, light vegetable \\"soup\\". Just how did people manage to eat healthy, unspoiled food in blisteringly hot regions for centuries before refrigeration ever existed?After the ingredients are ground together with mortar and pestle and placed in a cool clay bowl,which imparts its own delicate flavor to the mixture, they are \\"placed in shadow and moved as the shadow moves through the day.\\"Feibleman gives us an immediate connection with the foods of Spain and Portugal by examining their regions within their historical context:The original paella came into being near La Albufera, the freshwater lagoon close to the city of Valencia.The three ingredients cooked with the rice were local snails, green beans and eels, and the dish was eatenwith whole small onions rather than bread...From a simple beginning there is now a rainbow of paellas...I have made many of the recipes in this book, and I have yet to find a dud among them. One of my favorites is the flamboyant,fabulous sweet almond cake from Portugal, locally referred to as Toucinho do Ceu, or \\"Bacon From Heaven\\". Once you eat this confection, you will find it as addictive as the meat for which it is nicknamed. Luckily the time involved in making it deems it something I can make occasionally, not daily.If you are, as I am, a fan of Tapas, you will find many of the recipes in this book lend themselves very well to these delightful small dishes. Figos Recheados (Dried Figs Stuffed with Almonds and Chocolate) are easy to make and serve in a pinch. But many of the dishes that require a longer preparation time and which one would serve for a main dish also transfer well as leftovers to being served cold on small plates with wedges of lemon and olives and a sprig of fresh herbs. Cold fish, it turns out, is absolutely delicious when it was prepared well to begin with.I highly recommend any Foodie explore all the books in these wonderful series. In addition to cultures around the globe, Time-Life went on to publish another series on the regional cuisines of the United States. From New England to Creole/Arcadian to Southwestern savor to the salmon and dairy delights of the Northwest, you will be introduced to the richness of food and cultures that have long existed in our own country, a United Nations existing within the borders of one remarkable country."},{"Title":"Finger Alphabet (Beginning Sign Language Series)","review":"I THINK THIS BOOK IS EXCELLENT FOR THOSE WHO WISH TO LEARN TO SIGN.

Nothing that followed could possibly have compared. The characters are crafted so wonderfully that it's impossible to not feel like you know them. Reinhard is particularly captivating, with his kindness, his wandering soul, and his enduring love for a girl he never manages to get. Watching him slowly be replaced in Elisabeth's life is painful - as painful as it is to observe his youth and vigor slowly slipping away. Geez - I read this stupid thing today, and even now it haunts me."},{"Title":"Immensee ;","review":"If someone who speaks modern German has problems with the translation it's because of dialect, high German or Low German and time period. Coming from a German family who came to America in the 1860s I learned a German language that is a bit different from modern German language. From what I have been told is that there is a lot of variation depending on which area of Germany the person comes from and when. Anyway, this little book is completely in English. It is literally translated from German but contains no German."},{"Title":"Immensee ;","review":"It's a really small book, about 35 pages, so I read it in one day (even with my poor German).

There were a few irritating mathematical mistakes, but what math book doesn't have those. Seriously, are any of them perfect? A word to the wise though, this, like the others in the Forgotten series, were intended as refreshers for people who have already conquered algebra. For those of you about to dive in, this book isn't bad but you really need to study another, more rigorous mathematics text afterward. Remember, all math is cumulative. If you don't learn your algebra/trig then your going to struggle with pre-calc and then probably fall flat on your face in calc. That is, for those of you continuing in your mathematics training. For those of you just looking pass some core math courses then I guess you can practice the \\"suck it up, regurgitate it, and forget it\\" method of study. Either way, this book ain't bad! Good luck!"},{"Title":"Forgotten Algebra: A Refresher Course","review":"I'm glad I waited a while before reviewing this book.

If you're taking the SAT, use this book. If you're already good at algebra, become better, use this book.Insane book, the Second edition is also on amazon...for about a buck.

I finally quit looking at answers in the higher chapters because I lost confidence that it would tell me the correct result.

It explains mostly anything that you could need to know. The only part in this great book that wasn't so good was when they got into the higher chapters with the high level of difficulty they didn't explain the concepts well enough to have a totally thorough understanding.

Math isn't supposed to be scary, and there's usually a very straightforward way to approach each problem -- this book shows you that way.That being said, Forgotten Algebra is designed for people who have been exposed to Algebraic concepts (perhaps in high school), but don't remember things like manipulating fractions, factoring, or the rules of exponents. (Wait! If those words made your spine shiver, no worries -- this book will take away that fear.)Of course, if you've never taken any kind of algebra, this book will be a bit over your head. Likewise, you don't need this book if you've recently taken algebra. Other than a few errors in the answer key (thus, the four stars), this book is well organized and quite good. It helped prep me for a college calculus course 13 years after high school, and it can help you too."},{"Title":"Forgotten Algebra: A Refresher Course","review":"I recently decided to go back to college, so I needed a book that would remind me of all the Algebra I had forgotten in the past ten years in order to pass a math placement exam. Not only did I pass the exam, but I did BETTER than most of the incoming Freshmen!I do have to agree with everyone else, that there are a few errors. However, there are so many practice problems in the book, that they can be overlooked. I only wish that EVERY problem was worked out in the back."},{"Title":"Forgotten Algebra: A Refresher Course","review":"I have not finished the book yet, but can already tell you what a great resource this is. I haven't taken algebra since my sophmore year in high school and I had pretty much forgotten everything I had learned. That was 13 years ago and so far this book is teaching me in a matter of days what took two years of high school algebra back then. Before this book, I was sure that when going back to college I wouldn't fair well on the math placement exam and would have to take a couple of basic classes to get me up to speed. Now I am confident I can go straight to college algebra and do very well. Buy the book and tell anyone who needs to relearn algebra about it."},{"Title":"Forgotten Algebra: A Refresher Course","review":"I'm 31 years old, educated in Louisiana and trying to go back to College in Texas.

Barbara Lee Bleau has assembled all the major subjects in algebra and put them together in a fashion that just about anyone with a previous knowledge in algebra can understand.Please realize that this book is entitled \\"Forgotten\\" algebra. This implies that the reader once knew some algebra but has forgotten the operations and functions. This is not a book for beginners in algebra. Beginners are advised to find a simpler source that explains the basics step by step.This book assumes that the reader knows the basics of algebra, but just needs a refresher to bring it back to life again. And this is exactly what it does - it explains exponents, fractions, polynomials, quadratics, graphing basics, systems of equations, inequalities, logarithms and right triangles. When you finish this book, and there are many sample problems to work through, you will have a great working knowledge of basic algebra.I have used this book with my children to teach them algebra as they are learning it for the first time. Lee Bleau knows how to teach algebra and her course is easy to understand, grasp, and master.I highly recommend this book for anyone who needs a refresher course in algebra. It will definitely be a great help.Jim \\"Konedog\\" Koenig"},{"Title":"Forgotten Algebra: A Refresher Course","review":"I rate the book a 4, subtracting one point for the errors. The best thing about this book is at the beginning and end of each chapter it gives written step-by-step procedures on how to solve the problems given.

I wish the T-86 would be used but I am satisfied with the T-83.Anyway, thanks for this great book. Despite the errors, it was still well worth the money.

If you follow the procedures, every single problem can be answered. I can't say the same for Algebra the Easy Way, which has its own strengths over this book in some ways.Two down sides:Playing Peek-A-Boo with practice problemsFor the small problems within each chapter, you're given a space to work with, and the answers are right on the bottom of that space. I found it very difficult to do a lot of those problems when the answer was already staring me in the face, so I was always trying to devise ways of not looking at the answers while copying the problems on a sheet. What a pain. Please put the answers to the practice at the end of each chapter instead. The main problems, though, are presented at the end of the chapter, and their answers can be found at the end of the book, so that's no issue there.Secondly, I don't think this book goes far enough in algebra. There are topics I see covered in other books that don't get covered here, such as matrices, functions, and imaginary numbers. I want to be completely thorough for myself, because I'm trying to learn up to calculus on my own.

This was a proposed volume 1 promising a second volume that would evaluate how accurate Calvin's use of Augustine actually was. The proposed second volume was never written, but this first volume is a treasure to have since Smits does all the hard work for you in outlining in great detail the increasing amount of Augustine citations in his works, whether it be the many editions of Calvin's Institutes or his famous debate with Pighius about the libero arbitrio. Smits does make the initial conclusion that Calvin's use and citation of Augustine is primarily reliable and accurate. More recent Calvin scholars might be less generous and consider Calvin's use of Augustine in his works against Pighius to stretch the bonds of credulity, but Calvin's use of Augustine with regards to the eucharist, though not identical in understanding, is relatively accurate. If you want a more recent and respectable work regarding Calvin and the church fathers, then see Anthony Lane's work, but much that Smits covers here is not discussed there."},{"Title":"Smart French","review":"I find this piece to be a life saver for anyone who has been struggling to learn french.

This book is not meant to be a stand-alone language instruction book, nor should it be used as a form of dictionary since it is literally a list of words, one side in French and the other side in English. And, it only covers those words that are much alike the English ones, so it's a bit useless as anything other than a supplement.Allow me to give you an example of what you will find in the book:There are two columns, with one side being a French word, and the other being English. so, you will see something like this:amusement amusementanachronism anachronismanalogie analogyextraction extractionextradition extraditionand so on and so forth.They do come in alphabetical order, but the one thing this book severely lacks, and the only thing to make it really useful (in my opinion), are accent marks or stressed emphasis on pronunciation with some of the words included. Quite frankly, everything you find in this book, you will find in a really good English-French dictionary, except the dictionary, you will find more useful.I think its strength is that it compiles the majority of the words that are the same or similar into one book, which would be great for those who are actively seeking out a book or list of that type of thing. And, using it as a supplement along with a course and a good dictionary, one can kind of cut their workload by scanning this book and seeing that they will already know almost 2,000 words. So, I suppose it does have its usefulness in a way.I would only recommend this book to someone that is studying French and is familiar with the grammar, and only as a supplement.I received this book as part of the Dorrance book reviewer's program in exchange for an honest review. the opinions in said review are entirely my own."},{"Title":"SEVEN DAYS IN JANUARY: WITH THE 6TH SS-MOUNTAIN DIVISION IN OPERATION NORDWIND","review":"Lots of good reference material on small unit actions in and around Wingen during operation \\"Nordwind\\" in 1945; both U.S. and German.

I have a special affinity for this book as it describes the efforts of my two \\"favorite\\" infantry divisions: the US 45th and 70th. My g'father was in the 70th but was in their artillery and thus not present at the Battle of Wingen-sur-Moder, which - as it turns out - had some effect on the battle. The author expertly describes his own role in the battle while using official American after-action reports and memoirs to flesh out the opposite side's activity. See Wallace Cheve's account for an American perspective. Zoepf's end-of-chapter analyses of communication (thus the title of this review), command/control, etc. are wonderful. His accounts of the civilian experience are short but sensitive. I liked best that he did not overwhelm with the \\"big picture\\" except as necessary. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"SEVEN DAYS IN JANUARY: WITH THE 6TH SS-MOUNTAIN DIVISION IN OPERATION NORDWIND","review":"This is a very informative book about the history of the 6th SS-Mountain Division NORD. Although it does discuss their time in Finland, the bulk of the book focuses on Operation Nordwind, and more specifically, the battle for Wingen-sur-Moder.The first quarter of the book is given over to the first three years of NORD'S experience, in Finland. The author draws on his own experience, as well as archival sources to relate the history before he joined the division in the summer of 1941 as an enlisted artilleryman. After graduating from an officer academy in 1943, he was assigned to the 3rd Battalion, SS-Mountain Infantry Regiment 12 \\"Michael Gaissmair,\\" as the battalion adjutant.Combat in northern Karelia was nothing like that which was fought on the steppes to the south. There were none of the raging battles of maneuver, led by Panzers and SPWs. Instead, the men slogged through deep snow. There, sweeping maneuvers were conducted on skis, far behind the enemy front line. Still, the nature of combat in this area was much more positional than elsewhere on the eastern front. There was serious combat on their front. Soviet troops twice were able to sweep around NORD'S flank, and strike towards the rear area. Both times, though, the thrusts were stopped, and repelled. Just this part of the book was worthwhile for me, simply for the information it provided about the fighting in northern Karelia.The focus of the book begins after the withdrawal, with OPERATION NORDWIND. This operation was launched on 1 January 1945, just two weeks after the \\"Battle of the Bulge.\\" As the battalion adjutant, the author had a very good view of the battle. He has put together a narrative of this operation that is probably be best available. He has drawn on American resources, so that he can provide glimpses of the American view as well. It provides for a well-rounded story that is very interesting to read.From the initial insertion, on foot, we learn of mistakes that are made. There are failures of command, and plain errors that impact greatly on the operation. The mission of the Nord men was to take the town of Wingen-sur-Moder, and the bridge there. The objective was to form a bridgehead to allow mechanized units to break out into the Alsation Plain. Although the Combat Group was successful in their mission, there was no way for higher headquarters to give them the support they needed to exploit their success.The operation only lasted a week for the author, as he was captured by the Americans pulling out of the town. Until his capture, however, he is able to tell a riveting tale of what went on in and around Wingen. He tells of bravery and valor on both sides. He tells of the joy the men experienced at something as simple as capturing a stock of American underwear. He talks about eating captured American food stores. One of the things that really surprised these men was the difference between fighting Americans and Russians. The Americans didn't do much night fighting. The Germans were quick to take advantage of this, having become experts at night fighting while in Karelia.Still, in the end, these men were outnumbered, and outgunned. They were ordered to withdraw. Again, it was a fighting withdrawal, and the author was captured moving through the American lines. Though the division regrouped, and fought on to the end of the war, this narrative ends with the author's capture.This book is well written, and reflects the author's training and experience. There are only a few photos, however, due to multiple factors. There are several maps and diagrams to aid the reader in following the action. The maps that actually show Winger are detailed enough to make out individual streets and buildings that give the reader a much better view of what went on in the town.So that none can challenge my objectivity, I must indicate that while I had nothing to do with this book, I am associated with the Aberjona Press."},{"Title":"SEVEN DAYS IN JANUARY: WITH THE 6TH SS-MOUNTAIN DIVISION IN OPERATION NORDWIND","review":"Great book,definately portrays a German view of the ill-fated operation \\"NORDWIND\\" from an ordinary soliderfrom the 6th SS Mountain Divison,the author also givesa brief overview of the role of the divison in actionagainst the Soviets in Finland,and then its subsequenttransfer to the Alsace-Lorraine sector of France toparticipate in Himmlers ill fated offensive to recapture Stasbourg.Altogether a good book."},{"Title":"SEVEN DAYS IN JANUARY: WITH THE 6TH SS-MOUNTAIN DIVISION IN OPERATION NORDWIND","review":"The most detailed account of Operation NORDWIND ever published, from both a German and US military perspective. Focused on the author's first hand account of the fighting at Wingen, but includes other critical actions in the Vosges mountains that influenced this battle. A must read for all seeking a clear picture of combat during the last major German offensive of WWII in western Europe."},{"Title":"SEVEN DAYS IN JANUARY: WITH THE 6TH SS-MOUNTAIN DIVISION IN OPERATION NORDWIND","review":"The author of this book, Wolf Zoepf, was an officer (battalion adjutant actually) in the 6th SS Mountain Division. He has written what can only be characterized as a classic in military history about the role of the SS Nord division in Operation Nordwind. Nordwind was the last major German offensive in the West during WWII, starting a week or more after the much more celebrated Ardennes offensive. The goal of Nordwind was to punch through the Allied lines in the Alsace region and recover this mountainous terrain to anchor the German defense of the Fatherland. It was also hoped that a direct route through the Vosges mountains could be opened to permit German armored reserves to break out into the plains in France.There are so many things to love about this book. First, it really is a tribute to the fine soldiers of the 6th SS Mountain Division and to the brave Americans (primarily from the 45th and 70th IDs) who opposed them. Zoepf pays a great tribute to the skill, courage, and determination of all the combatants. Second, this book contains one of the best, most detailed discussions (analyses really) of the tactical situation at virtually every stage of the fighting. I've read so many military histories in which attacks failed because of bad weather, poor logistics, etc., but the details are never explained. With great detail, Zoepf describes how (and why) tank support didn't show up, the effect of losing radios, lack of ammo, the complications of coordinating attacks. As you read this book you will, I believe, get a sense of how it must have been for individual company commanders and why some things succeeded and others failed. Third, this is an extremely well written book. It is detailed and compelling, but easy and enjoyable to read. You may well read the whole thing in one sitting.The perspective of the book is divided pretty much 50/50 from the German/American perspective. The first 20-30% of the book is a history of SS Nord from its disastrous attack on Salla in 1942 until Nordwind. The 6th SS Mountain Division spent most of the war in Finland and the Soviet Union above the Arctic Circle battling the terrain and climate as much as the Red Army. When it arrived on the Western front in late 1944, it was probably one of the best units in the German Army. After the discussion of the history of SS Nord, the rest of the book is divided into one chapter per day (i.e. seven days!). This isn't so much a complete history of Operation Nordwind, but is primarily the story of the role of two battalions in this operation. Enough large scale description of the entire operation is given to put the role of the 1st and 3rd battalions of the 12th SS regiment's advance on Wingen-sur-Moder into perspective, but you'll have to look elsewhere for a complete story on Nordwind. Without giving too much away, two mountain battalions advance via a night march through the mountain in winter to an important cross roads (Wingen-sur-Moder) with orders to hold the town until relief arrives and German armored reserves can pass through the town on their way to the plain. Can they hold out until relief arrives, or will then be surrounded and destroyed by the Americans?This is destined to be a classic in military history I believe. All of the other Amazon reviews are enthusiastically positive as well. This book would be a good companion to Johann Voss's memoir Black Edelweiss (I think you can buy them together). My only negative complaint about the book is that the ending is rather abrupt. A few more pages could have been added to tie everything together. According to the dust jacket, the author passed away only three weeks after the book was completed. Perhaps he intended to add a bit more? In any case, this is really a must have for anyone who reads/collects books about the ETO. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"SEVEN DAYS IN JANUARY: WITH THE 6TH SS-MOUNTAIN DIVISION IN OPERATION NORDWIND","review":"This was an interesting book, but it is not much of a first hand account. The author obviously went through a lot, but he was at a very high command level and his participation in the battles were very limited and in all honesty not very entertaining. If you want an exciting book to read about Nord and what it was like to be a soldier, I highly recommend \\"Black Edelweiss.\\" This book is a very detailed account that often goes over the logistics of the battle and the planning on both sides.

The book is well written and of great historical value for people interested in the battle of the low Vosges.The book describes the battle of Wingen sur Moder from the point of view of a very young German officer leading a whole battalion.In January 1945, Wingen was 2 miles behind a stabilized front line. It was the hardest Winter of the century in Alsace. The aim of the Germans was to seize a valley in order to send 2 tank divisions to take Strasbourg. The 6th SS mountain division which has been fighting the Russians for 4 years were sent to take Wingen. They slipped through the main front line and took half of Wingen.The memoirs available on line of the veterans of the 70th infantry division describe the battle seen from the US side. Wolf Zoepf gives us a stunning description from the German side, from a battalion commander view.Leaving a few miles from Wingen, I was truelly impressed by the precision of the description of the battlefield."},{"Title":"SEVEN DAYS IN JANUARY: WITH THE 6TH SS-MOUNTAIN DIVISION IN OPERATION NORDWIND","review":"The book was good but the binding gave out almost right away. I have a nice collection but this book looks bad because the pages are all falling out."},{"Title":"SEVEN DAYS IN JANUARY: WITH THE 6TH SS-MOUNTAIN DIVISION IN OPERATION NORDWIND","review":"Wolf Zoepf's \\"Seven Days in January\\" is a solid piece of work documenting the 6th SS Mountain Divison. The title is however a little misleading as at least 1/3 of the book deals with the trials and tribulations of the early 6th Mountain in it's time above the Artic circle in Norway. While this is an interesting history on it's own I was disappointed to have to read so much background that ultimately didn't frame the Nordwind battle any clearer. Having stated this caveat, Zoepf's discussion of the Operation Nordwind was however fascinating and enlightening. Clearly the 6th was an elite force that was sacrificed at the alter of battle at the end of the Ardennes Offensive.Aside from the slightly dull and unnecessary introductory portions cited above this is a solid 4 star book, with the intro it slips to a decent 3 star book. Probably not worth full new book price.UPDATE (March 12, 2004): Upon reading another Aberjona Press book, Black Edelweiss by Johann Voss, I feel it is necessary to modify my original review of Seven Days in January. While I stand by each of my original comments I would add that if read together with Black Edelweiss - a wonderful combat memoir from a veteran of SS-Mountain Regiment 11 - Seven Days in January is a truly great book in total, including the first third of the book that I said seemed out of place. Black Edelweiss expands upon these passages about the Artic Circle combat and also deals with the battles of the Lower Vosges that Seven Days is mainly meant to convey. In this larger context Seven Days in January is a solid 4 star book -worth market value (granted you need to purchase two solid reads!)"},{"Title":"SEVEN DAYS IN JANUARY: WITH THE 6TH SS-MOUNTAIN DIVISION IN OPERATION NORDWIND","review":"U.S. accountings of the battle for Wingen-sur-Moder during the German Operation NORDWIND in January 1945 have been documented in the several histories of the U.S. 70th Infantry Division units. Now \\"Seven Days in January\\" uniquely provides the German side of that fight. It is authored by Wolf Zoepf, an officer in the 3d Battalion, SS-Mountain Infantry Regiment 12, 6th SS-Mountain Division NORD. The story begins with a brief overview on the formation of the division, its three years of fighting Soviet forces above the Arctic Circle on the Finnish-Soviet front, showing how it was well prepared for its subsequent struggle with U.S. forces, and its movement from Finland to the vicinity of Wingen-sur-Moder in Northeastern France for that struggle.The majority of Zoepf's book is dedicated to the details of the planning for Operation NORDWIND and a day-by-day (hour-by-hour, in many cases) account of the conduct of that operation at all levels down to the rifle squad. His research of U.S. and German archival data for this period not only provides accurate and finite details of the combat actions, but also allows the reader to compare what each side was doing at a given time.An important adjunct of great value to the reader is that following each of the significant battle accounts, the author has summed up that portion with a Battle Analysis of both sides that contains the key elements he believes significantly influenced the conduct of that aspect of the operation, and the impact of those key elements on the final outcome.The book is the result of many years of detailed research of official sources of U.S. and German operational data. Zoepf's text includes comments provided him by Trailblazers of the U. S. 70th Infantry Division's Task Force Herren and and the German soldiers of the 6th SS Mountain Division Nord who had engaged one another in the battles at Wingen-sur-Moder. The maps, sketches, and their explanatory notes are well done and helpful in following the actions.Wolf Zoepf died unexpectedly after his review and approval of the last chapter of the book. Editor and publisher Keith Bonn, who had worked with Zoepf on the preparation of book as the technical and developmental editor, carried the remaining work to completion. The book opens with an insightful foreword by Brigadier General Theodore Mataxis (Ret.) who was Executive Officer and then Commander of 2d Bn, 276th Infantry Regiment which participated in the Wingen-sur-Moder operation of early January 1945."},{"Title":"SEVEN DAYS IN JANUARY: WITH THE 6TH SS-MOUNTAIN DIVISION IN OPERATION NORDWIND","review":"\\"Seven Days\\" starts with a brief history of the 6th SS Mtn Div's battles in Northern Finland (with and against the Finns!), then segues into NORDWIND, the German counteroffensive into the Vosges on 1/1/45. It focuses on the fight for Wingen.This book is the ideal history of a battle because the author a) participated in it on the German side, b) conducted thorough research on available German and American documents, and c) spoke to survivors on both sides. As a result, you know exactly who attacked who, what each side thought, you know of all communication and intelligence successes and failures, and you have an appreciation for the battlefield bravery and humanity shown by each side.This book illustrates some larger lessons about the German and American fighting qualities, including German infiltration tactics, the performance of poorly trained German volksgrenadiers, American tactical habits, and the disadvantage of the US Task Forces thrown into the line as a stopgap before the complete divisions were available.If you like World War 2 history, this book is ideal."},{"Title":"SEVEN DAYS IN JANUARY: WITH THE 6TH SS-MOUNTAIN DIVISION IN OPERATION NORDWIND","review":"The author gives a great blow-by-blow account of the NORDWIND offensive. The book details the action of his 12 SS regiment and provides a great overview of the entire offensive from the German and American side. I remember years ago reading newspaper editorials castigating US soldiers for attending a reunion with SS soldiers who participated in NORDWIND. But this was not a &quot;typical&quot; SS unit. Pictures of the reunion in the book sparked this memory. After reading the book, one can understand why two foes could one day reunite.The book starts with an unnecessary synopsis of its' service in far northern Russia. The history added little to the book and is better recounted elsewhere (Ziemke). I would have greatly liked to see a history of the unit after NORDWIND. The author may have intended this, but died before publication.But the account of NORDWIND is superb; the story of the author's capture is remarkable, also. This is a well-researched book providing a low-level view of the battle. One shares in the author's arduous, but successful, coup de main that turned into a struggle for survival, and ultimately defeat."},{"Title":"SEVEN DAYS IN JANUARY: WITH THE 6TH SS-MOUNTAIN DIVISION IN OPERATION NORDWIND","review":"At the tender age of 22, the author was the senior staff officer and second in command of the 3d Battalion, SS-Mountain Infantry Regiment 12, 6th SS-Mountain Division NORD. This book is his story.It begins with an amazing account of how he was captured hiding in a foxhole with two American soldiers that he declared were his prisoners of war. One of the soldiers in the foxhole had shot at the author, hitting him from about 30 meters away. The author instinctively charged right at the foxhole. The surprised soldier got off one more round before the author jumped in the foxhole, hit the soldier on the head with his fist, and declared him to be his prisoner as he unbuckled his pistol. He then discovered that there was yet another soldier in the foxhole who had slept through all this. The author declared him to be his prisoner too. The author was eventually captured when a GI sergeant became upset that one of the men would not leave the foxhole and grabbed the soldier's blanket, uncovering the author as well.The author then recounts in a very absorbing way his introduction to life as a German soldier where he became a member of the division of German mountain troops that eventually (in 1943, when Waffen-SS Divisions were officially numbered, based on seniority) became the sixth Waffen-SS division, the 6th SS-Mountain Division NORD. In so doing, he also provides a fascinating history of the training, experience, and development of this division, which, after an inauspicious beginning, obtained a well-deserved reputation for being a skilled and respected fighting force. This division spent almost the entire war fighting in the rugged, mountainous terrain of Finland with the Finns against the Soviets until the Finns and Soviets achieved an rapprochement, part of which included that the Finns capture, disarm, and turn over to the Soviets any German soldiers left in Finland after a 10-day allowance for their withdrawal. (The German wihdrawal was designated Operation BIRKE (\\"Birch\\").)After the division's withdrawal from Finland, at the end of 1944, the Germans decided to utilize it (as well as other troops) in Operation NORDWIND (\\"Northwind\\"), an adjunct to Operation WACHT AM RHEIN (\\"Watch on the Rhein\\"), the offensive launched in Decermber 1944 through the Ardennes forest, better known in the West as the Battle of the Bulge.The vast majority of the book describes in great detail, not only day by day, but hour by hour, the 7 days of fighting by the author's battalion and other elements of the 6th SS Division (\\"Combat Group Wingen\\") in January 1945 in and around the mountain town of Wingen-sur-Moder, in the Low Vosges in Northeastern France, primarily against forces of the U.S. 70th Infantry Division.Drawing upon a wide array of sources from both sides of the battle, American and German, including numerous personal recollections by participants on both sides, the author not only describes what happened in an engaging writing style but objectively analyzes and criticizes the strategies and tactics of each side, giving credit where credit is due, during each stage of the fighting. The book is an invaluable addition to the history of this battle, mountain fighting, World War II, and warfare in general.The entire book is enhanced by the use of about 3 dozen well-drawn and clearly stated maps of the fighting in Finland, the withdrawal, and Operation NORDWIND, including the daily battles around Winger-sur-Moden. There are no photos to speak of (the cover photo is not that of the author)."},{"Title":"SEVEN DAYS IN JANUARY: WITH THE 6TH SS-MOUNTAIN DIVISION IN OPERATION NORDWIND","review":"The author was the adjutant of a German SS mountain infantry battalion that successfully infiltrated through the mountains and American lines before seizing its objective, a small village where most of these highly trained and well led soldiers were surrounded and killed in action while awaiting a relief force to link up with them that never came. The combat performance of this superb unit, and its strict adherence to the rules that govern modern warfare, so impressed their American opponents that both sides routinely met at annual reunions after the war. Parts of the book read like poetry, particularly the all too brief description of the German retreat across Finland and into Norway where the soldiers embarked on rusty transport ships that would transport these doomed soldiers to the shrinking perimeter of the Thousand Year Reich where they would be sacrificed on the fields of Mars during the last operational level German counteroffensive in the west."},{"Title":"SEVEN DAYS IN JANUARY: WITH THE 6TH SS-MOUNTAIN DIVISION IN OPERATION NORDWIND","review":"I fail to understand the glowing reviews this book has generally gotten, as I've attempted to read it several times and it succeeds quite well in putting me to sleep. It is filled with laboriously researched data regarding the 6th SS and their entire history, not just the Nordwind operation, but as one other reviewer stated, there is almost NO personal narrative from the author to be found in this book. This is not a memoir, it is a very bland and laborious dates, names, and places, account of the 6th SS and then finally, their participation in Nordwind.I was expecting this book to be about the author's personal experiences in Nordwind with the 6th SS, but, that's not what this book is at all - it is not a combat memoir or narrative of any sort. There are only a few pages dedicated to the author's personal experiences and they center on his capture by the Americans and are found right at the beginning of the book (perhaps eight pages). After that, the whole thing reads like stereo instructions with lots of data, lots of maps, and lots of facts and figures. It's all very impressively researched, but in my opinion, it makes for very dull reading."},{"Title":"SEVEN DAYS IN JANUARY: WITH THE 6TH SS-MOUNTAIN DIVISION IN OPERATION NORDWIND","review":"Essentially I found it hard to engage with this memoir. The author, 3rd Bn, 12 SS Mtn Inf Regt, gives a sound enough account of his units activities in Nordwind but it lacked detail on his personal experiences. Indeed, he does not seem to have actually been personally involved in much actual fighting himself, though when he does tell his own story, in relation to his capture for example it is fine - but there is not enough of this. Certainly the extent of his revelations do not compare to those generally found in the memoirs of Allied writers.His focus is on the units experiences but it gets a bit dry and again, not enough stories from his comrades about the actual fighting. Conversely, in his coverage of the Americans view of the fight, there is more in this regard. So as far as an overview of the battle in regards to battalion movements, orders, communication difficulties and so on the work is solid enough. These are obviously what Zoepf experienced in his role and he provides useful insight in this regard. But overall, if you are looking for a 'blood and guts' account, I don't think this is the text for you."},{"Title":"SEVEN DAYS IN JANUARY: WITH THE 6TH SS-MOUNTAIN DIVISION IN OPERATION NORDWIND","review":"Although the emphasis that this book gives to the \\"technical\\" aspects of the operation \\"Nordwind\\" and the fine accuracy of the terminology may cause some readers to avoid it, it is a very interesting and thought provoking analysis of the battles that the famous 6th SS Mountain Division fought in Alsace. The first 56 pages are devoted to that division's operations in Finland where, in late 1944, it was forced to retreat under attrocious conditions. Transferred to the Western Front, it participated in the operation \\"Nordwind\\" fighting excellently against the US 70th and 45h Infantry Division and causing many days of alarm and consternation to its opponents. Unfortunately for the 6th SS Mountain Division, the success it achieved outflanking the US positions and capturing Wingin-sur-Moder, proved to be just another \\"lost victory\\" since the other German divisions didn't advance in the same depth. The author was a junior officer in the Division \\"Nord\\" and he wrote this book with the help of many German and US first hand accounts, presenting a complete picture of the battle, from both sides of the hill. The book contains dozens of excellent three dimension maps, some two dimension maps and a few black and white photos. There is also an appendix with the German and US equivalent ranks. The book is higly recommended to the serious students of military history, since it is not only a battle story but a very critical and professional analysis of the operational and tactical factors that led the battle to its outcome."},{"Title":"SEVEN DAYS IN JANUARY: WITH THE 6TH SS-MOUNTAIN DIVISION IN OPERATION NORDWIND","review":"\\"Seven Days In January: With the 6th SS Mountain Division in Operation Nordwind\\", by Wolfe T. Zoepf, is an excellent read about the battle for Wingen-sur-Molders in January 1945 as part of Germany's Operation Nordwind, a companion offensive to the better known \\"Battle of the Bulge\\". Mr Zoepf was the second in command of one of the 6th SS Mountain Division's battalions involved during the battle, so he was intimately involved in the planning (such as it was) and fighting for Wingen-sur-Molders.Mr. Zoepf begins the book by detailing his capture by American soldiers and then gives a substantive overview and history of the 6th SS Mountain Division (MD) and it's three years of combat in Finland against Soviet forces. Although some reviewers here have questioned the relevancy of this part of the book, I found it important in understanding the nature and abilities of the 6th SS MD, and appreciated the detail it gave regarding combat in the Arctic, experiences which stood the division in good stead during Operation Nordwind. As the author describes, the unit retreated from Finland following the Finnish Armistice with the Soviet Union, was withdrawn from that theater, and thrown almost directly into combat as it arrived in its staging areas for the upcoming battle. The remainder of the book (the majority of it) describes Operation Nordwind from both sides perspective, but particularly the 6th SS MD's battle for and in Wingen-sur-Molders.Of special note are the plentiful and very useful maps the author provides (36 of them!) and his descriptions of the unit's organization and equipment. The book both describes the battle and offers a good analysis of why the battle went the way it. The writing is a bit on the dry side, and focuses more on the combat side of things, as opposed to personal stories and observations, but certainly readable and engaging. As an aside, a good companion read to this book is \\"Black Edelweiss\\" by Johann Voss, which was written by another member of the 6th SS MD, and is mainly a personal account of his combat service against the Soviets and US forces."},{"Title":"SEVEN DAYS IN JANUARY: WITH THE 6TH SS-MOUNTAIN DIVISION IN OPERATION NORDWIND","review":"Here is a breakdown of the book: 60% is detailed logistics of what unit was where at what time, 20% excuses and placing blame for not winning the war and the battle, 10% slighting and accusing the US Army (pointing out indignantly that American artillery hit an aid station or killed civilians, as if that never happened with German artillery,) and 10% suggesting that the Germans and the German Army are superior in every way to anything else that ever existed."},{"Title":"SEVEN DAYS IN JANUARY: WITH THE 6TH SS-MOUNTAIN DIVISION IN OPERATION NORDWIND","review":"Seven Days in January is primarily a look at the 6th SS Mountain Division's commitment to the last German offensive on the Western Front in World War II. Operation Nordwind (North Wind) is a forgotten battle, as most histories of the war dispense with the Battle of the Bulge by the end of 1944, and then skip to events on the Eastern Front, particularly the upcoming events in Hungary. Nordwind is lost in this time warp, but, as Zoepf shows, that didn't make the combat any less fierce. The attack, set in the Vosges mountains, pitted several Volksgrenadier divisions and most of the 6th SS Mountain Division against a thin line of American units, mostly from the 70th Infantry Division (although later on other units, particularly the 45th Infantry Division, played important roles).Zoepf begins his book by devoting a significant number of pages to the division's exploits in Finland against the Soviets. Given the title of the book, I was surprised to find that almost 20% of it is devoted to these actions. The information is interesting, though, and ultimately informs the reader about how the division would be able to perform against the Americans in the Vosges. Given the mountainous terrain, the snow, and the cold, it's no wonder that the Germans sought to employ the 6th SS Mtn Division, since they had a wealth of experience from their combat along the Arctic Circle.Significant portions of the book are devoted to the planning of Nordwind. Zoepf does an excellent job in assessing the situation, and analyzing the combat resources that the Germans committed and the resultant likelihood of success. He critiques the overall mission in the first place, arguing that the German military situation was such that any attack would be of dubious value. More specifically, he argues that unrealistic goals were given to units that did not have the resources to meet them. Volksgrenadier divisions, for example, were organized for defense, not for the attack; they lacked enough infantry units, and their organic units were not mobile (instead relying upon foot marches or horse-drawn wagons). Or take Zoepf's own division: much of it had not even reached Germany, and was still en-route from the long retreat out of Finland. He also faults the overall lack of intelligence regarding US positions and units. Finally, he criticizes the decision to hold the armor back, in order to wait for a breakthrough, when units on the front sorely needed the protection of tanks and assault guns.On the American side, Zoepf is critical of the US forces' almost complete lack of intelligence about the upcoming situation. Furthermore, a significant portion of the line was manned by recon units outfitted only with ineffective armored cars, jeeps, and not nearly enough infantry. Once again, it seems, the US defenders were caught off guard. Indeed, many US soldiers literally were caught asleep in their sleeping bags! Poor unit discipline, lack of intelligence information, and inadequate combat power meant that a huge gap was torn in the American front line almost right away. The key unit that utilized this hole was the 6th SS Mountain Division.The second and third battalions of the 12th Regiment (the author was part of the third battalion) infiltrated other US positions, and overran rear-area and HQ troops in the town of Wingen (the 6th SS division objective). The rest of the book is then devoted to the US efforts to eject the SS troops from the town, as well the efforts to restore the situation generally by repairing the breach in the line.Zoepf describes the combat with clear, concise detail, on a day by day or hour by hour basis. The actions of even very small units such as individual companies or platoons are very easy to follow. The author effortlessly switches between descriptions of small-unit combat in Wingen with larger-picture descriptions of combat elsewhere in the region between regiments belonging to other divisions on both sides. 36 (yes, 36) maps are included, which make following the action very easy. Many of the maps of Wingen are detailed enough to identify individual buildings, roads, and other features such as the cemetery and key railroad bridges. Zoepf also provides, at the end of each chapter, an assessment of the combat that took place. This is very interesting, and he pulls no punches in describing the failures and mistakes of both the Germans and the Americans.In a nutshell: Fascinating detail, clearly described battles, and exciting suspense. Seven Days in January won't take you seven days to read."},{"Title":"SEVEN DAYS IN JANUARY: WITH THE 6TH SS-MOUNTAIN DIVISION IN OPERATION NORDWIND","review":"I must politely disagree with Mannie below about this book. He notes a third of the book deals with the 6th's experiences in Finland. In fact it is less than 20%. Moreover, the Finland material is valuable for two reasons. First, there is very little writing on the German Army's experiences in Finland, and this firsthand account is fascinating. Second, understanding the strong arctic training of the 6th gives a valuable context for understanding their role and performance in NORDWIND.In fact, unlike the Ardennes Offensive, wherein badly mauled, hastily rejuvenated panzer divisions were committed into terrain completely unsuited for armor, in NORDWIND, a properly equipped, full-strength mountain infantry unit comprised of long-service veterans of years of fighting in arctic conditions was committed to a mission perfectly suited for it. This sure didn't happen very often in the 1944-1945 period! Yet despite this they were ultimately unsuccessful. This record of their history is, I would argue, valuable for understanding the performance of the men of the 6th in this battle. Besides, it is fgascinating reading! There is almost no other source for accounts of this battle, since SS veterans were reluctant to write memoirs.Let me also correct a misinterpretation which might arise from Mannie's comments, though he doesn't make this assertion himself. Contrary to myth and persistent misunderstanding, this was NOT part of the Ardennes Offensive, nor was it launched after the Ardennes Offensive was over. NORDWIND was intended to provide a synergistic complement to Army Group B's efforts in the Ardennes, by distracting the Americans' focus away from the Ardennes, and by physically and politically splitting the Franco-American allied efforts in Alsace. Zoepf is very clear about all of this, and provides an entire separate section about the intent and planning for NORDWIND. Soime mnight find this dull, but I found it absolutely illuminating.The introductory portions are imperative to understand the context of the offensive and its participants. Plus they have greast stories. Even the introduction is necessary because it shows a general from the American side confirming the most controversial assertions in this book, that SS soldiers and medical personnel treated US POWs with professional compassion. This was no group of thugs at Malmedy!For a campaign history, this is unusually fun to read, due to the writers's personnel involvement, his broad range of experience, the unexpected behavior of both American and German participants, and the awesome maps. I've seldom read a book with so many maps which are so clear, so informative, and so well-placed. Many look to me to be computer generated with actual topographic data (not approximations or artist's conceptions), with the military graphics very clear and easy to follow.So I found every part of Seven Days informative, interesting, and relevant to its theme of documenting the experiences of the 6th in NORDWIND. Anyone with any interest in the European Theater of Operations should find this book a nearly completely new story."},{"Title":"SEVEN DAYS IN JANUARY: WITH THE 6TH SS-MOUNTAIN DIVISION IN OPERATION NORDWIND","review":"Although the 6th SS-Mountain Division &quot;Nord&quot; may chiefly interest American readers because of its action during Op NORDWIND against the US Army in the Low Vosges, it mostly saw combat on the Soviet-Finnish front. As the book sums this up &quot;Nord&quot; was in combat against the Red Army for 1 214 days and against the US Army for 92 days. Thus it is only logical that the fighting in the Arctic and Subarctic is covered in a prelude (47 of the book's 304 pages).The book's author &quot;Nord&quot;-veteran Wolf T. Zoepf makes it crystal clear just how great an embarrasment his division's first action was. In the author's words: &quot;(...)a first-class debcle that stigmatized the entire division within the German Armed Forces for about a year&quot;.But then, the chaotic conduct of &quot;Nord&quot; in the summer or '41 was to be expected as the author provides numerous examples of how unprepared in the extreme his unit was for any type of action, let alone fighting in the roadless taiga. In Zoepf's words: &quot;The division's artillery had fired just once and never in coordination with the infantry. Similarly, infantry leaders had never worked in concert with artillery. The antitank gunners had never fired their weapons, nor had the antiaircraft gunners.&quot;It seems almost miraculous how &quot;Nord&quot; in spite of its disastrous baptism of fire could evolve into the superb fighting machine it became in 1943. But, as the author points out, the US &quot;Big Red One&quot; Ist Infantry Division went through a similarly sorry start in North Africa.Zoepf explains how the effectively dissolved &quot;Nord&quot; started anew (the personnel turnover was almost 100% in some units the fall of 1941) with the help of Finnish expertise. The book's description of how the division was reorganized and equipped will keep even the combat-focused readers interested as Zoepf is an intriguing teacher in most aspects of land warfare.The book is at its best in the main section dealing with Operation NORDWIND against US forces as the author has been able to benefit of the records and also veterans of the opposing side. One could wish that he had been able to do the same kind of research on the Soviet, now Russian, side but this would of course have demanded special language skills and was until very recently simply not feasible.This reader does not share the author's conviction regarding the truth behind the destruction of the Finnish city of Rovaniemi (I'd say the truth has not yet been established). I would also have liked to have learnt more about Zoepf himself from his writing but this does not bring down the total value of the book. Anyone interested of the Eastern Front, the final battles in the west or the Waffen-SS will be richly rewarded by reading this book. The superb maps and many insights into wilderness adaptation are of use in the training of today's and, I venture to say, even tomorrow's soldiers."},{"Title":"SEVEN DAYS IN JANUARY: WITH THE 6TH SS-MOUNTAIN DIVISION IN OPERATION NORDWIND","review":"Seven Days in January, by Wolfe T. Zoepf is a spectacular book written by the German point of view of the battle in the Lower Vosges during late 1944/early 1945. This is a battle few people know, or none the less hear about, but was important nonetheless.Tragically, Mr. Zoepf died shortly after the book was completed, but his story is excellent to say the least. As the book mostly covered the preparations and battle for Wingen-sur-Molders in January 1945, a small portion of the book is covered dealing with the evolution of the 6th SS Mountain Division &quot;NORD&quot; during the years of 1941-1944 where it was heavily engaged on the eastern front. However, the background info covers the transformation of NORD from a division heavily mauled in 1941, into a battle hardened formation, and one of the best in the German order of battle by 1944.The majority of the book covers the battle for Wingen-sur-Molders. Zoepf goes about telling his story in an excellent manner. He describes the tactics, shortcomings, strengths, and differences in command structure of both German and American forces during the battle.As each day progresses during the course of the book, he describes the preparations for each day's fighting followed by the actual story of the day's events. Once the day's fighting is complete, he delves into the intelligence flaws of each side (i.e. the Americans believing they were facing merely 50 german soldiers and the Germans losing their radio car and fighting with virtually no contact with the outside world to know the progress of the rest of the battle in the Lower Vosges) and the plans for the next day, etc.Another intersting point of this book is the respect both German and American soldiers pay their opponents while telling their story. There are numerous examples in the book where Germans and Americans have nothing but admiration for the spirit, courage, and determination of their opponents.Readers will also be intrigued by the various stories of the joint first aid station set up and staffed by soldiers from both sides (although the American doctors and medics were prisoners of war by this time, they still cared for all wounded equally) who cared for soldiers from both sides equally and fairly.Zoepf also tells the story of the declining quality of the German units by this point of the war and the drastic effect the loss of experienced officers and NCOs has on military units, well-equipped or not. He also points out the flaws in the American concept of placing Task Groups as &quot;plugs&quot; in their line, especially when an integral part of their formation (artillery in this case) was still back in the US training while the Task Force in the story had to rely on artillery from another US Division.The stories of soldiers from both sides during this battle is what tells the story so well. It is they, and their courage Mr. Zoepf pays tribute to in his book. The respect amongst veterans of the units who participated in the battle is so strong, the one time enemies are now friends and have celebrated together several times.&quot;Seven Days in January&quot; is an excellent read for anyone interested in learning more about the Battle for the LowerVosges, the 6th SS Mountain Divison &quot;NORD&quot;, or the US 70th Infantry Division &quot;Thunderbirds&quot;."},{"Title":"SEVEN DAYS IN JANUARY: WITH THE 6TH SS-MOUNTAIN DIVISION IN OPERATION NORDWIND","review":"Wolf T. Zoepf &quot;Seven Days in January&quot; tells a story of a quite forgottten battle fought during &quot;Nordwind&quot; offensive between elements of 7th SS Mountain Division &quot;Nord&quot;(namely 1st and 3rd battalions of 12 SS Mountain Reg.) and American forces (mostly of 274th Infantry Regiment). Capturing Wingen -sur-Moder a little town in Low Vosges was essential for the Germans if any hopes of success for operation &quot;Nordwind&quot; were to become reality. And this task was entrusted to 7th SS Division.The book starts with some fifty pages of introduction telling about the origins and campaigns fought by &quot;Nord&quot; in Finland during 1941-1944 and then it goes straight to the &quot;Nordwind&quot; operation. Story is told on a day to day and side to side basis which makes this book quite easy to follow. It not only gives the details of 1st and 3rd Battalions actions but shows greater picture as well. That allows the reader to understand the place and meaning of the course of events for both sides. Lots of maps help the reader to get clear picture of events and places where they occured to happen (that cannot be told about every book!). I only wish the author gave some info on the aftermatch and next actions of his unit.But this is one hell of a book and if you are the second world war student or a waffen SS student tis is a MUST!"},{"Title":"SEVEN DAYS IN JANUARY: WITH THE 6TH SS-MOUNTAIN DIVISION IN OPERATION NORDWIND","review":"This is a balanced and objective memoir by a member of the German forces engaged in a vicious battle. It does a superb job of telling the story from both sides in a manner that does justice to both, giving credit where it is due and making substantiated criticisms where justified. It also substantiates claims by other SS veterans that they (at least their unit) were disciplined soldiers who abided by the Geneva convention and did not engage in atrocities. What I especially appreciated was that Herr Zoepf did not engage in chest-thumping claims of his unit being the best and that no other soldiers could match the best German troops, a tendency that has appeared in a number of German memoirs. Herr Zoepf expresses pride and appreciation for his fellow soldiers (entirely justified - these mountain soldiers were really good) and also recognizes soldierly abilities in his enemies. He also reveals (perhaps unknowingly) what I believe is true about the American troops' fighting spirit. This is disclosed when he recounts the efforts of entirely green troops of the 70th Division in attacking highly-experienced, superior forces defending with better equipment from highly-protected positions. Those green 70th Division troops really showed courage and determination when they were driving the SS troops from their positions in Wingen. This is a fine memoir written by a man of obviously great integrity and ability."},{"Title":"SEVEN DAYS IN JANUARY: WITH THE 6TH SS-MOUNTAIN DIVISION IN OPERATION NORDWIND","review":"This is a great history of the 6th SS-Mountain Division.

Now \\"Seven Days in January\\" uniquely provides the German side of that fight. It is authored by Wolf Zoepf, an officer in the 3d Battalion, SS-Mountain Infantry Regiment 12, 6th SS-Mountain Division NORD. The story begins with a brief overview on the formation of the division, its three years of fighting Soviet forces above the Arctic Circle on the Finnish-Soviet front, showing how it was well prepared for its subsequent struggle with U.S. forces, and its movement from Finland to the vicinity of Wingen-sur-Moder in Northeastern France for that struggle.The majority of Zoepf's book is dedicated to the details of the planning for Operation NORDWIND and a day-by-day (hour-by-hour, in many cases) account of the conduct of that operation at all levels down to the rifle squad. His research of U.S. and German archival data for this period not only provides accurate and finite details of the combat actions, but also allows the reader to compare what each side was doing at a given time.An important adjunct of great value to the reader is that following each of the significant battle accounts, the author has summed up that portion with a Battle Analysis of both sides that contains the key elements he believes significantly influenced the conduct of that aspect of the operation, and the impact of those key elements on the final outcome.The book is the result of many years of detailed research of official sources of U.S. and German operational data. Zoepf's text includes comments provided him by Trailblazers of the U. S. 70th Infantry Division's Task Force Herren and and the German soldiers of the 6th SS Mountain Division Nord who had engaged one another in the battles at Wingen-sur-Moder. The maps, sketches, and their explanatory notes are well done and helpful in following the actions.Wolf Zoepf died unexpectedly after his review and approval of the last chapter of the book. Editor and publisher Keith Bonn, who had worked with Zoepf on the preparation of book as the technical and developmental editor, carried the remaining work to completion. The book opens with an insightful foreword by Brigadier General Theodore Mataxis (Ret.) who was Executive Officer and then Commander of 2d Bn, 276th Infantry Regiment which participated in the Wingen-sur-Moder operation of early January 1945."},{"Title":"SEVEN DAYS IN JANUARY: WITH THE 6TH SS-MOUNTAIN DIVISION IN OPERATION NORDWIND","review":"I agree with the previous reviews, i.e. this book is a great combination of personal first hand accounts and tactical and strategic narrative supplemented by plenty of maps (unfortunately not many photos). It is sad that Mr. Zoepf passed away before he knew how much readers liked his book."},{"Title":"SEVEN DAYS IN JANUARY: WITH THE 6TH SS-MOUNTAIN DIVISION IN OPERATION NORDWIND","review":"It would take a German to give credit where credit is due.Nordwind was a German offensive made at the same time as the more famous Ardennes offensive. It was of a slightly smaller scale, but no less fiercly fought and could potentially have had devastating consequences had it succeeeded.Wolf Zoepf was a veteran from the war with Soviet Union north of the Arctic cirlce and gives a clear and concise description of the development of the Sixth Waffen SS Mountain Division, of its tactics and organisation, and of its heroic part in the failed Nordwind offensive.The book not only describes in detail the course of the battle, but also - which is even more important - the strengths and weaknesses of the opposing military organisations.It is not enough to say that the US army had superior manpower and superior firepower - history is full of examples where the inferior side carries the day, take for example the early German and Japanese victories in the second world war, or the Macedonian victories against the Persians.The German strengths lay in superior tacical skill, initiative, off-road mobility, and tactical organisation (up to, say, regimental level). Usually, these factors would be enough to carry the day in any battle, but the US army had a superior organisation on the army level: not only did they have the manpower and the firepower, they could see to it that it got where it was needed! What played a role was also the superior US communications technology, and that they had one sole Commander who knew how to utilise his advantages and whose orders were obeyed. I get the impression that by this stage of the war the US army had developed a military organisation that was almost fool-proof; even mediocre army or divisional commanders could succeed by just following the rules. The German commander had to co-operate with other army commanders, including Himmler! and had cope with meddling superiors, including Hitler! He could not give orders to other units than the ones under his direct command, and then the communications were often so faulty that orders were not always received.This book gives the reader so much more than just a first-hand account of the battle (which is interesting enough), and it is a valuable addition to any second world war or military history collection.Let us not forget that the blood on the snow and the unmarked graves are no less real just becuase they are written on paper and happened over sixty years ago. This kind of madness continues, and shows no will to stop."},{"Title":"Grace","review":"No one has taken on the Biblical theme of God's infinite GRACE extended to mankind through the Person and work of Jesus Christ, as revealed in the Bible, like Chafer.

Dr. Chafer does a marvelous job of exposing the chracter of God and his Grace and how no one can merit eternal life apart from belief in Jesus Christ."},{"Title":"Grace","review":"This is the best book ever written on God's Grace.If you want to have a thorough understanding of God'sGrace, than this is a must read for you!"},{"Title":"Grace","review":"This book was a life-changing read for me. Chafer's exposition of grace displays probably the clearest exposition of a classic presentation of dispensationalism and its position on the difference between law and grace. It presents lines of discontinuity in the drastic way it is needed in today's church. Law is not Grace - Grace is not Law, to confuse the two is tragic. Beyond anything, Chafer makes sure we understand how foolish and dangerous it is to infuse and confuse law with grace and confuse the two. Luther clearly saw this great discontinuity in the bible between law/grace (more so than the Reformed churches), truly bringing freedom to the person dead in sin. This is not to imply that Luther was dispensational, clearly not so, its just that both sides see a clear contrast in the law/grace economies.I could comment on all the distinctives Chafer applies from this system of discontinuity such as the Sermon on the Mount, the Sabbath, the Christian Life, etc. but I'll leave that to your reading. What is clear is that Chafer sees a drastic, drastic difference in these economies, sometimes I think a little too discontinuous. This is not to say Dr. Chafer is wrong, just that he seems to emphasize the differences to the extent that it misses the continuity between the dispensations and the progress of history and God's revelation. I think this is a bit problematic even though I am a dispensationalist and love Dr. Chafer's works very deeply. This has already been revised in expression and corrected in dispensational teaching (see Ryrie's 'Dispensationalism', Renald Shower's 'There Really is a Difference') for quite some time, but it is still important to know that it has been corrected.I think its very important to understand this since Christians from other views (primarily Covenant teachings) have given solid, solid critiques of the 'classical' understandings of Dispensationalism (as taught by Scofield, Chafer, Brookes, A.C. Gaebelein, etc.) and Dispensationalists have listened (please see the great dissertation by Todd Mangum titled 'The Dispensational-Covenantal Rift, 1936-1944'). Poythress is a high suggestion, also Hoekema's 'The Bible and the Future', and Hans K. LaRondelle's 'The Israel of God in Prophecy'. Please steer clear of foolish and error filled critiques such as John Gerstner's book, 'Wrongly Dividing the Word of Truth' and many others. Though I am still a dispensationalist, these (former) works are important to help us to understand that both 'extremes' lead to an imbalanced perspective. When I say 'imbalanced' I mean that the Classic Disp. position tends to be almost dualistic in its thought of earthly/heavenly which is problematic and I do thank others for those kind of critiques. However, the other side (such a Covenant teachings, etc.) when very consistent upon emphasizing that everything is a spiritual shadow, type, etc. seems to err on the side of a metaphysical problem in the Christian faith. Clearly we don't want that either.Also, one last slight critique; Chafer holds to a view of Christian filling of the Spirit that is an either/or on/off teaching. I think the view errs slightly because you are not filled with the Spirit simply by confessed sin and repentance in the life of the believer. I believe the filling of the Spirit has to do more with a walking of obedience than an instantaneous experience of spiritual filling/spiritual life. Though this is minor, it has been critiqued by others and I feel they are correct in their critiques of Chafer on these points.However, with all that being said, Chafer's work should be read by every Christian because it is so clear and thorough on the teaching of grace as the thread through which the history/progress of revelation is seen. It truly brings the bible together for a Christian who has applied themselves to the study of the scriptures. It sheds so much light on the scriptural truths of justification, assurance, growth in grace (progressive sanctification), and our expectation of the return of Christ. Truly a monumental work by Dr. Chafer that is vital for the growth in grace of every Christian. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Grace","review":"Another great topic the believer needs to study.

Yet the apostle Paul asserts, in the New Testament, that we are saved \\"by grace through faith\\" and faith alone. Think about faith. Faith plus anything is not faith! We have only to accept, believe, and trust in the finished work of Jesus Christ, who paid the penalty for your sins and mine by His sacrificial death and, by His resurrection from the dead, gained for believers eternal life in the presence of God. We can't do anything to merit our salvation, despite the misinterpretations of a few passages of New Testament scripture that seem to add some human act or work to the single necessary and sufficient condition of faith alone. I agonized over such confused preaching for 20 years until I read Lewis Sperry Chafer's book GRACE, which finally put to rest all my concerns. Chafer makes it abundantly and fully clear, by his uncommonly thorough analysis and presentation of scripture, that New Testament grace and faith stand in complete and total opposition to Old Testament law and works. He also makes clear how the grace and faith principle not only assures our salvation, but also guides our Christian lives as we depend in faith on the leading of the Holy Spirit.

As one would expect from this well known author in the use of statistical methods for process improvement, his coverage of the &quot;how&quot; of Six Sigma (the technical part) is outstanding. It is hard to imagine how so thorough a discussion of such topics could be presented more clearly.However, the real strength of the book is that this technical material is preceded by the &quot;why&quot; of Six Sigma (the management part) -- explaining what it takes to get management to &quot;buy in&quot; to the concept of using science to run a business (apparently not an obvious concept). It has probably been the lack of sufficient attention to the importance of this area that has caused so many &quot;Total Quality&quot; initiatives to flounder. This book will correct that oversight.

This is not the book for you if you just want to produce one movie now, and (hopefully) another one in the near future. This is more a book that describes a business model for producing mainly relatively risk-free films -- in other words, films that are not being done entirely on spec, but actually have interested parties who can monetize the film.I would say it could be helpful to one-off producers in that it helps you understand the position savvy exec producers are in (who are, by the way, the ones you most likely want to deal with). This is helpful because if you can understand that, you can understand how to approach them.Again, if you are just looking to produce a one-off film (which I'd say is most people), this book will be of limited value, but if you are more money motivated and risk averse (or at least understand and appreciate the value of money in the process of developing and producing films for profit) you can definitely benefit from the advice contained herein.Extremely highly recommended, but only for the serious-minded feature film entrepreneur."},{"Title":"The Producer's Business Handbook (Book & CD-ROM)","review":"From the appendix the book is based on a lie.

The information in the book is logical and methodical and is a sensible approach to producing films, but I am certain he has never done so. He has a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, priority approach to financing and distribution which is seldom the way in which situations transpire in the world in which films are produced. His book is a text book world for students in a class room, as is his world best served &quot;giving&quot; his seminars, then in actually producing films.

I have never before seen a history covering the precise topic of this book which is the rivalry between Churchill and Neville Chamberlain during the decade which began with Churchill an ostracized outcast and Chamberlain a rising star and yet ended with Chamberlain a scorned failure and Churchill a triumphant war leader.Young British historian Graham Stewart has put together a massive and meticulous study of just how and why events played out as they did between the two men. American readers be warned, this book is extremely British in tone, use of idiom and most of all, in its intricate discussion of British Parliamentary politics in the thirties. Stewart certainly assumes his readers are aware of the British electoral and Parliamentary system and the way it works. I myself, an American reader, am not but this was not too much of a handicap as I was able to follow the story without too much difficulty.The first part of the book provides a good deal of background on British politics from the age of Churchill's father, Randolph and Chamberlain's father Joseph through the beginning of the twenties. Stewart describes the rise and fall of various parties, in particular the National Liberals of Lloyd George in the early twenties. While Chamberlain was not a player in national politics during the twenties (although his brother Austen was), Churchill was at the height of his influence, having left the Liberal party and slowly edging back towards the Conservatives. Stanley Baldwin would make him Chancellor of the Exchequer and Churchill became a full fledged Conservative once again in 1925. Further chapters describe the Conservative's loss to a Labour/Liberal coalition and Churchill's resignation from the shadow cabinet over the \\"India Bill\\". When he gets to the thirties, Stewart covers the Parliamentary maneuvering in incredible detail. Contrary to popular belief, Churchill, though out of favor with the party powers, maintained his supporters, known as Winstonians.Chamberlain was quite different than Churchill as Stewart demonstrates, unlike Churchill, his primary loyalty was to the party not to any specific principles. It was not for nothing that Churchill referred to him as \\"that clerk from Birmingham.\\" But this was the sort of man Baldwin was looking for. Churchill's first true breach with the party came over his demand that Britain re-arm in order to protect itself from the designs of Nazi Germany. Although his criticism of the Baldwin government was muted by his desire to regain office, Churchill consistently called for stronger defense preparation. After 1935, when it was clear he would never gain office under Baldwin, Churchill became a vocal and outspoken critic earning him the ire not only of the Conservatives but of the Labourites as well, who favored suicidal disarmament.Chamberlain became prime minister in 1937 upon Baldwin's retirement. With no background in foreign affairs, he was immediately confronted with foreign crises caused by the growing belligerence of Nazi Germany, the Spanish Civil War and the actions of Fascist Italy. Despite the book's subtitle, there really was no rivalry between Churchill and Chamberlain until the Munich crisis of 1938. At this point Churchill moved into open opposition with his own party by delivering one of the most eloquent addresses of his career, denouncing the Munich pact before the House of Commons. This is the best part of the book. Stewart is never unfair to either man and not at all a revisionist. Nevertheless, he never hesitates to point out the fantastic assumptions upon which Chamberlain based his policy of appeasement. A most interesting point is how little Churchill actively did to maneuver himself into power. Although an outspoken opponent of appeasement, Churchill did nothing either publicly or privately to create the conditions which led to his return to office and his eventual ascension to the prime minister's office. In fact, once he joined the government and the war cabinet upon the outbreak of war, he muted his criticisms of Chamberlain and became a loyal soldier. In the end, despite his best laid plans and hopes, Chamberlain died a sad and broken man, his policy of appeasement in ruins. Churchill ascended to the ultimate heights of greatness in which he is held today. The reader of this book will learn a great deal about Churchill about whom much has been written as well as a great deal about Chamberlain about whom less has been written. Once the story begins to focus on the rising menace of Naziism, it is always riveting and frequently fascinating. The book is dense, scholarly and yet eminently readable. I thoroughly enjoyed it and would recommend it to any serious reader of history."},{"Title":"Burying Caesar: The Churchill-Chamberlain Rivalry","review":"...I agree that the cost is a bit much but I believe that the reader will conclude as I have that it's well worth it.I would also concede that if you are not into British politics all of the talk about coalitions and cabinet reshuffles can be a little hard to follow. But Graham Stewart carries it off very well.This book is at bottom the story of an ancient political rivalry between two statesman that changed ultimately the course of history.Stewart traces it the way back to the fathers of the two men Randolph Churchill and Joseph Chamberlain who were at various times political allies and adversaries.What they both had in common was that neither made it to the top as Prime minister. Both died in the hope that their supreme ambitions would be realized in their sons. But the big question which Stewart effectively answers in this book is why was''nt Churchill instead of Chamberlain PM in the thirties? Churchill was smarter,He had a much wider experience in government.Had he been Prime Minister Could He not have promoted rearmament and other steps that might have headed off World WarII? Stewart shows us clearly why this did not happen. Why Churchill was seen in the thirties as a political has-ben and an adventurer who was totally out of touch with the times. While Chamberlain was seen in Lady Astor's memorable phrase as ''the coming man''.All of it makes Churchill's final dramatic acension to power at the crucial moment in the history of the world all the more dramatic and providential.Graham Stewart has written a superb book."},{"Title":"Burying Caesar: The Churchill-Chamberlain Rivalry","review":"In a democracy, the people have the leaders they deserve. This would seem a rather self-evident observation, but one which is often forgotten when the inadequacy of Britain's political leadership facing Hitler in the thirties is discussed. As a citizen of a country that was ultimately liberated from nazi oppression by British troops, I certainly have no wish to belittle the heroism of the British people during World War II, but you need to make a clear distinction between Churchill's Britain living out its finest hour between 1940 and 1945 and the Britain of Baldwin and Chamberlain, struck hard by the twin calamities of World War I and the great depression and seeking only peace and comfort at almost any cost. This is what Burying Ceasar brilliantly demonstrates.With the future of mankind hanging in the balance, the drama of Britain dealing with the menace of Nazi Germany boils down to a political and personal struggle between two elderly gentlemen, Chamberlain and Churchill, both striving to fulfill the ambitions of their fathers and families: Neville Chamberlain was both a son and a brother of great men, while Churchill, allthough the scion of a great family, was in reality the son of a demented political loser whom he nevertheless adored. No materialistic approach to history here - events are shaped by individuals, their qualities and flaws have decisive influence on the course of history. Burying Caesar portrays both men in an honest and objective way, neither vilifying Chamberlain nor glorifying Churchill and this is one of the great strenghts of the book.It has been stated that the book seeks to redeem the reputation of Neville Chamberlain, but I do not agree. Burying Caesar merely frees itself from the conventional wisdom that Chamberlain was a narrow-minded and untrustworthy coward, showing us instead a basically decent and well-meaning politician who unfortunately (not least for himself) advanced to a position that demanded greater talents than this rather mediocre personality had been provided with. Chamberlain had been a reasonably succesful chancellor of the exchequer during the worst years of the depression and had his career ended at that, he would have been remembered in a mostly positive light as a minor figure of British history rather than as one of the worst failures of world history. Still, faced with an electorate which (naturally) did not want another war and hampered by his own lack of international experience, Chamberlain no doubt tried his best to serve his country. That he was no match for Hitler is obvious but one might wonder if any other British PM could really have prevented World War II (given, for instance, the attitude of France...).Which brings us to Churchill. A vain, self-serving man of immense personal ambition, idiosyncratic in his view of the world yet ready to compromize if it might bring him back into the corridors of power. Not a man to be trusted, not a leader for times of great crisis. Yet history proved him right about the nazi menace and he turned out to be just the right leader for Britain when war came and the British people were ready once more to demonstrate heroism in the face of terrible adversity. Burying Caesar depicts Churchill with all his flaws, yet also shows us how he held on to his basic belief that Freedom and Justice would have to stand firm against Oppression and Crime and how that very staunchness made him into the leader now revered by all mankind - a fascinating portrait of the imperfect genius among men who were merely imperfect.Graham Stewart writes historical non-fiction in the great tradition of British scholars such as A.J.P. Taylor, Corelli Barnett, Martin Gilbert etc. More, please...."},{"Title":"Burying Caesar: The Churchill-Chamberlain Rivalry","review":"I know very little about British Governments of the 1920's and 30's. This book provides quite a run through the period, contrasting the career paths of Chamberlain and Churchill, the former on the up escalator, the latter down. That being said, Churchill is dealt with very sympathetically, and as we know ultimately becomes immortal.What comes across is Churchill's sheer self-belief, allied to a constant hunt for any opportunity to get back into cabinet through the 1930's. This self-belief ultimately was of service to the nation in his absolute refusal to negotiate with Hitler in the darkest days of 1940, when, unbelievably France had collapsed and the British Army had had most of its equipment captured. The power of Stewarts description of the debates in the House of Commons really enliven this book. Just read this\\" This is only the beginning of the reckoning. This is only the first sip, the first foretaste of a bitter cup which will be proffered to us year by year unless by a surprise recovery of moral health and martial vigour, we arise again and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time\\"This is Churchill after Hitler turned his back on the lenient strictures of the Munich agreement. It bellows through history, doesn't it?Or Duff Cooper's resignation speech following Munich\\"one great power should not be allowed, in disregard of treaty obligations, of laws of nations and the decrees of morality, to dominate by brute force the Continent of Europe. For that principle we fought against Napoleon Buonaparte, and against Louis XIV of France and Phillip II of Spain. For this principle we must ever be prepared to fight, for on the day when we are not prepared to fight for it we must forfeit our Empire, our liberties and our Independence\\"It's Shakespearian.That being said the book shows the pragmatic rise of Baldwin and Chamberlain through the 1920's and 30's, it is entirely possible to sympathize with the revulsion towards another European war and guilt about the terms of Versailles imposed on Germany which culminated in Chamberlain's abandoning of the Czech's as people \`far away of whom we know nothing'.Stewart advances the case that if England and France had been willing to go to war over Czechoslovakia in 1938, Germany would have had to fight in the South and West simultaneously and would not have had the Hitler-Stalin pact, therefore could not be sure of its Eastern Frontier and, ultimately, would have been in a much worse position than turned out to be the case in 1939/40. There is some interesting mention, not followed through, of the economic burden that rearmament placed on the German economy, and its chronic lack of natural resources - oil and iron ore specifically - in the early years of the war.The book casts interesting light on the events following the negotiation of Irish independence - my main knowledge of this was that it sparked the Irish Civil War which resulted in the deaths of two of the Irish negotiation team. The British negotiators did not fair well either - the Conservatives revolted, deposing the leaders who had been Treaty negotiators (Churchcill, Austen Chamberlain) putting Baldwin in charge.The book is queasy about Baldwin, he was such a poor Chancellor that his own Prime Minister (Bonar-Law) wrote anonymously to the Times to complain about him - this has the whiff of a tall-tale. He is portrayed as indolent, indecisive and overly-driven by public opinion. Yet it has an interesting twist on the Abdication Crisis, telling us that Baldwin rushed King Edward into an Abdication, because of personal animus. Perhaps.A significant portion of the book spent on the failed attempts to limit the march towards Indian independence - which is seen in the light of the \`mistakes' made with the Irish. Churchill's attitude to this is seen as futile, an example of his poor political judgement rightly causing his wilderness years. The book takes a different view, showing that the policy - effectively setting up an elected body, in which the various representatives would cancel each other's views out - was doomed from the start.Chamberlain comes across as a cold, decent and ultimately tragic figure. Son of a famous father (Joe);younger half-brother of Austen, of whom great things were expected, he was meticulous, dedicated, an excellent number two. He seems to have been politically astute, never taking a position which could lead to his downfall, through the thirties he was always formally supportive of Baldwin, yet positioned to succeed him should he fail. Yet when he succeeds to the premiership, he implements a policy very much in line with the British public's aversion to a European War, protects the Empire as much as possible and yet ends up on the wrong side of history.I found the book very enlightening on a period I knew very little about. The writing, while academic, is clear and even pacy at times. One minor fault I found was its references to contemporary events - the book was published in 1999, and references to John Major's difficulties in government, are, at this remove, a bit esoteric. With this small caveat I would recommend the book highly."},{"Title":"Burying Caesar: The Churchill-Chamberlain Rivalry","review":"Offers an interesting perspective on the background to the rivalry between Churchill and Chamberlain.

He died just as his younger half-brother, Neville became Prime Minister after a superb track record of social reform but inspired by his brother's work he found a very different Germany and dreams of peace became delusions"},{"Title":"Burying Caesar: The Churchill-Chamberlain Rivalry","review":"It is all well and good to make this big deal over Chamberlian'sconscience, honour etc something that history does not record that had much to do with stopping Chamberlian from breaking his word fairly fairly regularly. A leader has to take responsibilities for the decisions that he makes within the parameters that he works under. In Chamberlain's case, he totally misjudged Hitler and his regime. It is not like the Nazis made any secret of their aims. As this book points out many in his own party like Churchill were worried that his actions.Before the war and during the war, Chamberlain failed to produce the type of leadership required by his nation.To Chamberlain credit, as the book points out, once he realized that Hitler could not be trusted his appeasement policy came to an end. I wish that other world leaders would have this sort of moral strength to admit sometimes that what they did was wrong and try to correct it."},{"Title":"Burying Caesar: The Churchill-Chamberlain Rivalry","review":"Any book on this period that wants to be even and ballanced has to deal with the events going on else where but at the same time.Stalin and the USSR invaded Eastern 1/3 of Poland just as Hitler took the Western 1/3 of Poland yet this is almost NEVER mentioned.

A little group called FOCUS or the Anti-Nazi Council funded by the owner of a South African gold mine who was a Eastern European Jew and all of London's Fleet Street press were beating the drums of war against Hitler, lying about his intentions to take England, Hitler's only hatred was directed against the USSR, Communism and Communists in Western Europe. Stalin's genocide of the Kulaks was covered up by the NY Times and Walter Duranty. Stalin's shipping of Jews to Siberia is ignored by history too. Why, is the question that does not even get asked ! All too often, the terms of the Versailles Treaty are never mentioned as a cause of German hatred of the West and a determination to excape from depression.Clearly, Hitler should have been manipulated into going after the USSR and the Brits were insane to declare war over Poland, while Stalin was murdering 10,000 Polish officers in the Katyn forrest."},{"Title":"Escalating out-of-pocket health care costs: A growing burden for the elderly","review":"this is a small book but a powerful read about the 2/29th Battalion who were abandoned by their leaders in their hour of need."},{"Title":"Dog of the High Sierras","review":"Be forewarned- this book is not really about a collie.

The tranquility of the farm, Mem Pockets, her dog Daisy, and all the hens is suddenly shattered when a letter arrives with some distressing news --- taxes on the farm are overdue, and the farm will be sold if they are not paid promptly. But Mem Pockets does not have the money to pay them.The Scaldy hens all huddle together and discuss the dire situation. Wise Old Pegotty repeats and explains a rather vague poem that gives the hens hope but puts a huge burden on little Hanne, who must carry out several extremely difficult tasks. Only then might she be able to lay gold eggs that Mem Pockets could sell.Hanne gathers all her courage and quietly leaves home before Mem has a chance to notice her absence. The little hen is frightened and lonely. Already she misses the cozy henhouse and the companionship of her hen friends. She has not yet laid any eggs, and not only must she complete all the tasks mentioned in the ancient poem, she has to lay three golden eggs.Hanne must first travel to the ancient barrow where she has to eat three grains from the Old Ones' meat. Then she must travel a great distance to the Standing Stones and eat three grains from the Hidden Ones' meat. Finally, she must travel to the Great Green Sea and eat three grains from the Sea God's meat.Hanne has never even been off the farm, and the idea of traveling to unknown faraway places is both thrilling and frightening. The brave little hen does get some much-needed help along the way. A little mole named Pieter, Keeper of the Barrow, gives Hanne kindness and encouragement at the beginning of her quest. Then Hanne arrives at the Standing Stones after five days of tiring travel. The Stones come to life, and once again Hanne receives the help she needs. She travels on west for several days until she reaches the Great Green Sea and is saved from peril by a large sea turtle, Old Murdaugh.Now that Hanne has eaten all the required grains at each destination, she still has to find her way back home. She's tired, hungry, and not a little lonely. And the task of having to lay the golden eggs is still ahead of her once she reaches her much-loved friends and henhouse.The author, Olivier Dunrea, takes the reader on a magical journey with that shy little hen. The story itself is not a new one --- that of overcoming obstacles and putting the common good ahead of one's own comfort and security. However, it is lovingly told and the charming illustrations, also by the author, add a great deal to the enjoyment of this delightful children's book.--- Reviewed by Carole Turner"},{"Title":"Hanne's Quest","review":"My son and I came across this book and were captivated by the cover art. It was an unexpected surprise to see artwork in a book written for my son's readling level (he is in the 4th grade). We read the book together over the course of nine days (one chapter per night) and felt compelled to write our review:This book/story is THE best! (to quote my son). I never would have thought that one small, black hen would have kept us turning pages as we followed Hanne on her epic quest to save the farm. My son especially loved the scary, dark barrow scene. He has a fear of the dark and this little hen's bravery has boosted his own courage. The story does not shy away from \\"dark, scary scenes\\" and the ending was particularly gripping and tense. I never would have thought that a hen could make me pause and take stock in life as to what is important. Loyalty does count for a lot in life.Being the smallest (my son is small for his age) doesn't necessarily mean possessing less courage or believing less in yourself. This book is different from anything we have read. We really liked the beautiful illustrations. My son is an aspiring artist and pores over the artwork in this book every night. He doesn't miss a single detail.From the two of us all we can say is: What a GREAT read if you like quest adventures. We look forward to reading more of Dunrea's epic sagas. Please hurry up with the next one!"},{"Title":"Hanne's Quest","review":"This sounds a little odd to say, but I can't think of a better way of introducing this book than to say the following: From the creator of \\"Gossie\\", \\"Ollie\\" and \\"Gossie & Gertie\\" comes an epic quest novella... about a chicken. If that doesn't trip smoothly off the old tongue it's little wonder. Dunrea and his corresponding publisher Philomel (a division of the Penguin Young Readers Group) decided to do things a little differently with this small folksy book. It's a nice story with a steady heart and a practical soul. It also treads some overly familiar ground, however, so if you're looking for something with a storyline that doesn't sound like something you've heard many times before, consider searching elsewhere. It's a pleasant little story that is sure to endear itself with some. Just make certain that the person you purchase it for belongs to that selfsame \\"some\\".For years and years Mem Pockets has run her little farmhouse and chicken coop with a staid and loving hand. In that time she has made a habit of collecting eggs from her remarkable Scaldy hens to sell them at market. Nothing shakes her pleasant world until the arrival of a letter informing her that she owes quite a lot of back taxes. Mem is distraught, not having the money at hand and knowing that within thirty days she will be forced to leave the home she loves, to say nothing of the chickens. The hens, for their part, realize that something must be done. After a quick conference it is understood that a single hen must go on a quest of great peril. If she survives the barrow, the Standing Stones, and the Green Great Sea, she will have the ability to lay three golden eggs. Only a chicken of the purest heart born in the darkest phase of the moon can go, and that hen, believe it or not, is the youngest of the brood. She is a little black chicken by the name of Hanne, who carries with her a quiet strength. Now, in spite of her size and timid nature, Hanne will set off to save the farm and help Mem Pockets. Whatever the cost.Dunrea writes with a slow steady hand. Your average reader gets the feeling that he's working at his own pace and feels little need to hurry-scurry through the various plot element too quickly. It's reminiscent of the old \\"Wind In the Willows\\", but for a much younger set. There's also a nice low-key wisdom to the characters in this book. When a mole informs Hanne in the barrow that, \\"Things are never black as they may seem\\", the book leaves enough room for little ones to draw their own conclusions. Perhaps a little more confusing (as in, \\"What is the author trying to say?\\") is when that same mole later states that, \\"We cannot choose our Fate in this world\\". Make of that what you will.There are some lovely things in this book. Comfortable things. Though it is never given a country, the feel of the story is very British, albeit the Britain of small islands and villages. There's a pagan feel to the tale that makes it all very interesting too. Mem Pockets celebrates Midsummer's Eve and on the Winter Solstice, \\"the old woman sat up all night with the hens and told them about the Mystery of the Death of the Old Year\\". Good wins over evil, as would be expected, and in the end the bad guy is arrested for... um... being a bad guy, I guess. It's a little unclear. Ditto how the chickens reproduce without any roosters around.In the School Library Journal review of this book, the reviewer noted that, \\"Dunrea's hens and chickens are infused with charm; folk-art galleries would provide a better setting for his art than a chapter book\\". Certainly there are some strong similarities between this book and Bruce McMillan's, \\"The Problem With Chickens\\". I thought Dunrea did a lovely job with many full-color pictures in this book, making it so that it doesn't really fall readily into any one category. The pictures, lush evocative gouache, complement the story to a tee. I felt they worked with the story, as a readaloud. So no objections here. One on one readers might find them a bit young for their liking, I suppose.It's no coincidence that booksellers like Barnes and Nobles and Amazon.com have chosen to pair \\"Hannne's Quest\\" with Kate DiCamillo's simultaneous release, \\"The Miraculous Journey of Edward Tulane\\". Both books share a sense of nostalgia, \\"Tulane\\" for the supposed \\"classic\\" children's books of the past and \\"Hanne's Quest\\" for low-key folktales about doing what is right. Both books are also so steeped in this nostalgia that they fail to make a convincing case for why they themselves are original works of art and not mere copies of older titles. The ideal customers of \\"Hanne's Quest\\" are the grandmothers and aunts of kids who want to give their young relatives something that squeaks of timelessness. There is a possibility that \\"Hanne's Quest\\" will be deeply beloved of the youngsters who receive it, true. There is, however, an equal possibility that it is the kind of story that will never see the light of a second or third read. I believe the book is deserving of consideration, but I do not think it needs much more than that. Nicely written but not something that will stick in your mind very long after you, or the child you read it to, finishes with it."},{"Title":"Hanne's Quest","review":"My 5th grade class and I read this book together. Many of my students are familiar with Mr. Dunrea's picture books that feature the fair fowl (THE BROODY HEN, THE TROW-WIFE'S TREASURE) as well as his other books (BEAR NOEL is a particular seasonal favorite). My students were delighted to discover a book written for middle readers.The story is moving and beautifully written. Each chapter is accompanied by one full color illustration. It was a delight for my students to finally have a book at their reading level with stunning artwork to go with the story.Hanne has become one of their favorite \\"underdog\\" characters. Her courage, bravery, and loyalty to Mem Pockets created sessions of lively discussion. The tension and excitement and difficult tasks this small hen must succeed in performing kept their attention to the last page.The ending, of course, had us all in tears. This led to a discussion as to what sacrifices a 'hero' must make in order to achieve his or her goal. Hanne's character sets an example for us all not to lose sight of what we struggle to achieve, and why.Loyalty rules the roost!We are especially grateful to the publisher for giving middle readers not only a beautiful, moving, well told story, but beautiful artwork to savor as well.

David Bohm, as a superb physicist with a major textbook on quantum mechanics, is qualified for what he undertakes to do in this book. The book is devoted partly to a detailed exposition of &quot;mechanical philosophy&quot;. Bohm describes in detail the sources and implications of this philosophy as it appears in classical mechanics, statistical physics, and quantum mechanics. Bohm argues that mechanical philosophy is not a necessary consequence of the formalism or of the well-known success of these theories. It is one possible, albeit widespread, interpretation. According to Bohm, the mechanical philosophy is a result of assuming the validity of a scientific theory in all possible situations and contexts. Bohm shows how other more reasonable interpretations of specific theories can be developed. Bohm's own interpretation involves various levels, described by qualitatively distinct theories. These may be related but are not necessarily reducable to a basic level. In particular, Bohm discusses quantum mechanics from this point of view. This serves as an introduction to what Bohm elsewhere turned into a technical research programme. The book is pervaded by a sense of Bohm's deep and unified vision of the physical world."},{"Title":"Causality and chance in modern physics","review":"In this, David Bohm's first book looking at the conceptual foundations of modern physics he writes in a fast paced energetic way which, although quite analytical and interesting, lacks the warmth to be found in his later books.His aim is to investigate the concepts of cause and chance and their applicability in physics. Bohm considers the ideas of causality in terms of relationshipos between &quot;things&quot; both as one-to-many and many-to-one types, then considers how contingency, chance and probablity are present in natural law.Then, starting from the ideas of classical mechanistic physics and the changes which occurred over several hundred years in the way that the philosophy of mechanism both, took hold, 17th and 18th centuries, and significantly changed, 19th century he considers the longevity of this philosophy even after changes in it which would normally entertain a new outlook: classical particle mechanics-&gt;wave theory-&gt;fields. All of these new developments altered how the philosophy of mechanism was thought of but still maintained fundamental aspects such as: a quantitative law which could explain all natural phenomena. he goes on to explain the links between macroscopic and microscopic levels of law and how in each level a relatively independent state of affairs exists which regard to the laws, valid in each case.Further, with the development of quantum theory at the start of the 20th century, ideas of probablity, indeterminacy and discreteness became the new concepts in physics, once again significantly changing the outlook yet still maintaining the most important tenet of mechanism: a be all and end all explanation of reality ie a final explanation which knows no alteration.Bohm then goes on to demonstrate at least qualitatively what a different, alternative interpretation of quantum mechanics could look like, introducing his concepts of the sub-quantum level and the qualitative infinity of nature which is yet a unity. In the final chapter he looks at the way in which humans attempt to comprehend this qualitative infinity in terms of the abstraction of certain aspects from the whole and its consequences such as the multiplicity of these abstractions and their significance. He thereby avoids the seemingly obvious conclusion of Neumann regarding the non-existence of underlying laws or hidden variables. He considers question on the modes of being, becoming and how a &quot;thing&quot; can exist for long periods of time unchanged and yet in certain contexts always changing. He belittle's the Laplacian mechanistic &quot;God&quot; and what objective reality really means.It is Bohm's first attempt at these difficult issues (1957) long before chaos theory and its ability to lead to randomness even from strictly deterministic laws and the further developments he himself underwent in talks with Krishnamurti and the consequent construction of the idea of the holomovement. This book does not go as deep or is as fascinating as his later, richer ideas. But it does give an overview of what Bohm wished to change in physics and also society through his ideas such as dialogue.A good introduction to a deep thinker."},{"Title":"Causality and chance in modern physics","review":"I consider this book a gem.The forthright explanations of mechanistic systems, both deterministic and indeterministic, will help to awaken any student of physics as to the degree to which their world-view may not be as broad as they had imagined.The concerns raised about quantum mechanics are not trivial or extreme. And they are raised with deliberation and humility. Likewise, so are Bohm's suggested solutions.Finally, and most importantly I think, the argument for a world-view of physics that presumes - as the most scientifically (investigationally speaking) useful view to take - that the universe is comprised of an infinite number of levels of depth and complexity. Perhaps there are not an infinite number of levels of reality, but to presuppose there is opens the mind to want to investigate what they might be. Thus, supposing that QM defines and &quot;explains&quot; the 'bottom' of reality is first, not a logically strong position (just as Brownian motion formulas do not &quot;explain&quot; such motion as a fundamental aspect of nature) and secondly, such a view is scientifically inhibiting: supposing that QM *is* the bottom level of reality is rather silly in light of our historical knowledge of how humans have consistently misjudged the 'fundamental' aspects of nature in the past, and supposing we have reached it now via QM is a dubious claim. Further, even the issue of determinism vs. indeterminism may be a moot point: it may be at a lower level of reality, there is no such distinction - we may be seeing those two 'macroscopic' aspects of a more basic or inclusive feature of reality.If you want to be an original thinker in physics (or perhaps any science or philosophy), this book is a good starting point to help you realize how easily assumptions of the nature of reality slip past our awareness."},{"Title":"Causality and chance in modern physics","review":"Beginning with a forward penned by de Broglie himself and various touchstones in the history of science and philosophy (including Laplace's concept of a deterministic universe), Bohm lays out an outline of his view of science in general and physics in particular, culminating in his interpretation of quantum physics. I refer to this work as an outline because it does not go into the mathematical formulation of physics--neither of Maxwell's differential equations for Electro-magnetism (as an example of field equations) nor of the differential equations of Schrodinger and Dirac for quantum phenomena. Bohm chooses his words carefully, referring to the Heinsenberg \\"indeterminacy\\" rather than \\"uncertainty\\" principle, as he considers the apparent limitations imposed by Bohr's Copenhagen view of quantum mechanics to be likely provisional rather than final.Bohm discusses the challenge to Bohr's interpretation posed by the 1935 paper of Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen (EPR), in which they demonstrate the difficulty in ascribing quantum indeterminacy to the influence of the measuring apparatus (p.88). In reply, Bohr authored a paper which countered the EPR's criticism with the claim that the quantum entity (i.e. wave function) and measuring apparatus are indivisible (i.e. entangled) and therefore immune to EPR's reductionist analysis (p.89). Bohm also gives the references to these two papers: EPR Phys. Rev. 47, 777 (1935); Bohr Phys. Rev. 48, 696 (1935). He also discusses von Neumann's criticism of the EPR formulation in terms of hidden variables and the mathematical proof that von Neumann offers against the existence of such hidden variables (p.96).Bohm goes on to catalog other problems associated with Bohr's interpretation, including the difficulty in ascribing a path to a moving particle, as in the case of an incident electron interacting with a photographic film (p.90). Bohm also offers his own version of quantum theory, in which the quantum particle follows a somewhat erratic but nevertheless continuous path in response to quantum forces--but in such a way that the final result is in agreement with current quantum calculations derived from the Schrodinger equation (p.109-116).Although the observations made by Bohm in this book are certainly valuable, I don't believe that the reader is able to fully appreciate his ideas without reading his more complete works that are written at a level accessible to those pursuing (or at one time having pursued) graduate level courses in quantum physics. In particular, I wish to recommend to the reader with such a background Bohm's textbook on quantum mechanicsQuantum Theory (Dover Books on Physics)--while noting especially that this book put forward the modern interpretation of EPR's challenge to Bohr. For Bohm's novel personal interpretation of quantum theory--complete with quantum forces establishing the paths followed by quantum particles, the reader should read Bohm and Hiley'sThe Undivided Universe: An Ontological Interpretation of Quantum Theory."},{"Title":"Causality and chance in modern physics","review":"I think this is the best book about the fundamental assumptions of science I have ever read. David Bohm is one of the wisest and open-minded thinkers I've ever encountered. He believes that science should be based on the assumption of the \\"qualitative infinity of nature.\\" We shouldn't assume that anything is what it is absolutely. \\"Any given set of qualities and properties of matter and categories of laws expressed in terms of these qualities and properties is applicable only within limited contexts, over limited ranges of conditions and to limited degrees of approximation....\\" The continued existence of any entity or property depends on a balance of the processes tending to change it in different directions. \\"The broader the context or longer period of time, the more opportunity for that balance to be fundamentally altered.\\" This is consistent with what the process philosophers have told us: Being is just an abstraction from becoming.Scientific laws can apply only conditionally, not absolutely; they are always subject to revision. We should doubt that any description of \\"elementary particles\\" or statement of laws governing them could constitute a full and final description of reality. We should also doubt that we can know the universe's future: \\"the prediction of the 'heat death' of the universe will probably be invalidated by qualitatively new developments reflecting the inexhaustible and infinite character of the universal process of becoming.\\"Much of Bohm's book is a critique of the philosophy of mechanism, which he regards as an unjustified extrapolation from science's success in discovering certain conditional mechanistic relationships. Mechanism aims to reduce everything to interactions between basic entities with fixed qualities, like the parts of a machine. This overlooks another kind of relation, the \\"reciprocal relationship\\" between an entity and the broader context that makes it what it is. The earliest forms of mechanism were deterministic, assuming that the future could be calculated from the initial positions and velocities of entities and the forces acting upon them. Bohm does not confine his critique to deterministic mechanism, but extends it to the indeterministic mechanism of quantum mechanics. The conventional interpretation of QM attributes an absolute and final validity to the indeterminacy principle, so that only a statistical description of reality is permitted and no causal interpretation of phenomena is even pursued. Bohm regards causality and chance--necessary causes and chance contingencies--as two aspects of all processes. Any theory that embraces one to the exclusion of the other is inherently incomplete. \\"Neither causal laws nor laws of chance can ever be perfectly correct, because each inevitably leaves out some aspect of what is happening in broader contexts.\\" That's why Bohm has led the search for a \\"hidden variables\\" interpretation of QM. In the end, Bohm regards the mechanistic philosophy in all its forms as contrary to the spirit of scientific inquiry, since it tends to regard a limited truth as the whole truth. \\"The essential character of scientific research is that it moves towards the absolute by studying the relative, in its inexhaustible multiplicity and diversity.\\"In contrast to the mechanistic philosophy, Bohm proposes a more holistic and organic view. \\"The inter-relationships of the parts (or sub-wholes) within a system depend crucially on the state of the whole, in a way that is not expressible in terms of properties of the parts alone. Indeed, the parts are organized in ways that flow out of the whole. The usual mechanistic notion that the organization, and indeed, the entire behaviour, of the whole derives solely from the parts and their predetermined inter-relationships thus breaks down.\\"Recommended for readers interested in theoretical physics or the philosophy of science."},{"Title":"Causality and chance in modern physics","review":"Bohm in this book attacks to Standard Interpretation of Quantum Physics.

Although he claims that Heisenberg's claim is with no foundation, I believe he fails to prove that Nature can not be explained completely with limited number of laws and concepts.His argument against Heisenberg could be reversed and used against his own argument"},{"Title":"Snappy Little Halloween (Snappy Pop-Ups)","review":"This is an amazing pop up book for children with incredible detail.

They ranged from the absolutely destitute to the wage-earners.The causes of this situation were a rising population (and rising unemployment), illnesses (the plague), enclosures (people chased from common grounds for the rising of sheep), bad harvests and perhaps, the dissolution of the monasteries.Rebellion (a certain percentage of the destitute were demobilized soldiers) seemed to be the only way of bringing the grievances of the poor to the attention of the government.For their own security and out of fear for insurrections by the vagrant class (eventually manipulated by political opponents), the wealthy, who controlled the government, acted strongly and inhumanly. They imposed harsh laws, based on the assumption that employment was available for all who sought it. The able-bodied man who wanted to work was put in an impossible position: unable to find employment, yet forbidden by statute to beg, he had the alternative of breaking the law or facing death by slow starvation.As those brutal \`negative' laws didn't have much effect to maintain \`social order', they were replaced by the more \`positive' Elizabethan Poor Laws (which lasted 250 years until 1888), imposing forced private charity on the \`haves' in order keep the \`have-nots' from starvation, nothing more.The author brushes a far too rosy picture of the forced donations (\`merchants, nobility, yeoman displayed an intense interest in the relief of the poor'!). At the end, he is forced to admit that even this minimal national legislation was seldom implemented and that local relief schemes were inadequate. The authorities adopted only temporary solutions in order to prevent a state of complete anarchy. In the mean time, all municipal schemes went bankrupt, except one, in the city of Norwich.This small book sketches a brutal picture of the state of humanity in the 15th till the 17th century.It is a must read for all those interested in the history of mankind.I also highly recommend the works of E.J. Burford."},{"Title":"Elements of Operator Theory","review":"I enjoyed reading this book. As another reviewer said, the proofs are a little too detailed. However, for my purposes, a little hand-holding was just what I needed. I haven't read any other books on the subject, so I can't make a thorough comparison. However, I have been reading sections of Conway's \\"A Course In Functional Analysis\\". Here are some surface differences.1. Both books have a large number of typos and other errata. Both authors provide an errata page on the web. Conway's book is in it's third printing so as expected, it has fewer errata. In any case, most of the errata are typos that are easy to spot and fix on your own.2. The proofs in Kubrusly's book are far more detailed than Conway's. As a result, you can read it much faster, but you don't get as much out of it.3. Conway covers much more ground than Kubrusly. Some areas that I am interested in, Banach Algebras, the Riesz functional calculus, and unbounded operators are not covered at all in Kubrusly.I have this complaint about Professor Kubrusly's proofs. It is not always clear exactly what he is proving. If the theorem is of the 'if and only if' type, he will start his proof without telling you which half he is doing. In the proof of the Arzela-Ascoli theorem, he doesn't tell you what he is proving until two pages after he starts the proof. I suppose this is not such a big deal since eventually you do find out what he is proving.For someone like me who wants to go deeper into the field, this book is a good introduction, but requires you to read a second book. For someone who really only needs the material that is covered in the book, you will find it a painless introduction."},{"Title":"Elements of Operator Theory","review":"This is a must have Analisys book. Although the modest title, the book is the best introduction to functional analysis ever written. More than this, its an indispensable first book for everyone interested in operator theory. It is clear, concise and all the exercises are really solvable. You feel that the autor wants to teach you. It requires only a modest (really!) background in linear algebra and calculus. At the end, you will have learned all real analysis that so many autors (and teachers!) always have hidden from you. There are so many math disclosure in the book that I'm afraid Kubrusly being at risk of attack from any xiita math (especially the mediocre one). I agree with the last reviewer, the book is an immediate classic and Kubrusly has turned himself into a kind of Salman Rushdie for his daring in writing the Satanic Verses of the Mathematics."},{"Title":"Elements of Operator Theory","review":"This is a very self-contained book on fundamentals of functional analysis. The pace is very slow and the proofs too detailed at times. This is particularly so in Chapter 5 on Hilbert Spaces. The good thing about this book are the problems at the end of each chapter. They are mostly standard problems and a lot of 'hints' are provided (as opposed to most books in this field). I have a number of books on functional analysis but often I go back to Kubrusly's for some fundamental notion. One downside is the brief treatment on the spectral theorem for normal operators, but I guess the author's intention was too avoid using measure theoretic results, which most engineering students are not familiar with. A great pick for the engineer seeking a better understanding of higher mathematics."},{"Title":"Elements of Operator Theory","review":"This is truly an excellent introduction on the subject. The organization is tight and the book is largely self-contained. All the proofs are very well detailed and most of the exercises have hints, which helps a lot."},{"Title":"Elements of Operator Theory","review":"For those wanting to learn not only functional analisys but also the basic elements about math (set thoery, algebra, topology,...), I doubt that they can find anything better than this book.

It covers everything you need to know for step 1, while leaving out all you dont' need to know. The questions are probably the best micro vignette questions out there, and helps reinforce what you learned from the book.This book is much better than micro made ridiculously simple in terms of boards review. Its written in outline format so you can get through it much faster, and it includes an immunology section that has all you need to know for the immunology questions on the step.The only thing I don't like is the Rapid Review format. At times the outline format should be written in complete sentences (like the high-yield series) to avoid confusing statments/facts. For me, this seemed especially true in the immunology section, which can be confusing if you have a weak immuno background.Other than that, this is a great review book. The only review book for micro in my opinion."},{"Title":"Rapid Review Microbiology and Immunology","review":"I am a big fan of the Rapid Review series. The Pathology version by Goljan, as far as I'm concerned, is just as essential as First Aid when it comes to reviewing for class and Step 1. However, Microbiology and Immunology are what I would consider two of the most important topics covered on Step 1 along with pathology, pharmacology, and neuroscience. This book has some good review material in it, but is far from comprehensive. Many topics are discussed extremely briefly or omitted entirely. I could only recommend this book for someone who has Microbiology and Immunology down very well and just needs a super quick refresher. To be honest, First Aid does a better job of covering this material.*** This review is regarding the content of the book only. I do own this book, but I have not accessed the Student Consult online material. Although I have accessed it for the pathology book in this series. From that material I have deduced that it can't make that big of a difference; but I could very easily be wrong."},{"Title":"Rapid Review Microbiology and Immunology","review":"Perfect for medical microbio class. I used Micro Made easy for class, and after reading this book to review for the boards I would definately recommend it over Micro made easy. The organization is better, it's a shorter text, has an outline format, has excellent tables that while are not as detailed as the micro made easy book are a lot easier to read, and it has everything you need to know for class, which micro made easy does not.Immuno section is a bit brief but it has all the essentials. I would also recommend reading Immunobiology by Janeway and Medical Microbiology by Murray. Both texts are outstanding and really help you appreciate the subjects."},{"Title":"Rapid Review Microbiology and Immunology","review":"This is a must have for anyone preparing for the USMLE, or just for revision for self study.

I used this book to get through the first part the course. There aren't really that many pages dedicated to immunology, but those that are were really succinct.

Can't really comment on micro because I haven't had that course yet."},{"Title":"Rapid Review Microbiology and Immunology","review":"This book is a good review in bullet-point format, but it's missing crucial pictures of conditions such as impetigo, erysipelas, and common rashes found in infections such as measles and mumps.

I recommend Microbiology by Harvey to supplement or replace Microbiology and Immunology Rapid Review."},{"Title":"Rapid Review Microbiology and Immunology","review":"This book is very well organized, has great charts, and does a good job of parsing down to the most necessary material.

Amazon may display this review on the page of another version of this product, for which this review may not apply. After reading this review, please click on the link so that you can be assurred that the product this review applies to is the same one you thought it was for.--------------------------------------------------If you didn't already guess, this is a connect-the-dots book with the revealed pictures being of guys and girls in rather naughty adult situations (read: having sex). There are 30 puzzles total in the book. Each one has a pun title and caption (adding to the fun). Puzzle #25 contains the least amount of dots (230), while puzzle #8 contains the most (450).From what I understand, this book (and the others in the Naughty Dots series) was originally released in England many years before it was published in America. I've never seen the original version, but I hope the layout was better than this one. 29 of the puzzles are spread across two pages (puzzle #26 is the only one-page puzzle), which means that you'll be drawings lots of lines across the inner spine of the book. I don't need to tell you how annoying this is. Connect-the-dot puzzles should always be on one page, not two. To add insult to injury, a few puzzles have dots right on the inner spine which are impossible to connect (so you'll just have to draw your lines as close to them as you can).On the plus side, the puzzles are very detailed and contain a lot of dots. Often you won't know what the image is supposed to be until you've connected almost all of the dots. The puzzles do have partial photos to give you a hint as to what the revealed image will look like. In some puzzles, there are photos of nipples, with you connecting the dots to draw in the b-r-e-a-s-t-s around them. I liked this idea of using photos mixed into the puzzles, but I think that there should have been a section in the back of the book with the complete photographs of the puzzle images.Before I wrap this up, I should probably take a second to tell you that puzzle #3 contains two #208 dots. The second one is supposed to be #209. So be on the lookout for that.Overall, the puzzles were fun to do (aside from the two-page annoyance), and I enjoyed this book very much. I already bought another book in the Naughty Dots series - the follow-up \\"Really Really Naughty Dots\\"."},{"Title":"De Shootinest Gentman & Other Tales","review":"classic but so steeped in the racism and conventions of the early 20th century that I really had trouble enjoying the book. The maudlin sentimentality of the white and privileged writer thinking that there is something cheery about the light seeping between the logs of the the black tenents' cabins without any regard for the fact that that means that there is no protection from the weather, or his jocular descriptions of the constant verbal threats and abuse bestowed on bowing and scraping servants in a part of the country where lynchings were not uncommon just set my teeth on edge.

Mr. Buckingham was equal to these writers in his wonderful style.Mr. Buckingham in his stories is a treasure trove of information for historians to people who just like to curl up with a book and remember the scents of Grandpa's old Westernfield whose walnut is black with black powder loads, engine oil, dirt, blood and tobacco.I was fortunate enough to have Aunt Molly's recipes and just created a wonderful batch of Mr. Buckingham's goose sauce from the Beaverdam Club in the infamous meals served there.My favorite story is one of Mr. Buckingham hunting on the Mississippi River for geese.The shame is Mr. Robert Urich who bought rights to Mr. Buckingham's stories did not live to produce a movie about the gentleman.Yes Mr. Buckingham writes in a dialect at times, but it hardly detracts from a story and only adds to it as his stories are that warm encompassing memory which we all hear from the distant past.May all have the scented wetlands of Mr. Nash in his stories and feel that same warmth of seeing the light in the window as twilight nestles in of Aunt Molly making cracklin' bread, teal on toast, roast goose, sauce and country puddin' to where the conversation is always bright in how the birds decoyed today and we made that memorable shot we will treasure like Mr. Buckingham beyond this life.I really like Mr. Nash's writing.

Great stories of waterfowl and quail hunting in the Deep South at a time when some Civil War veterans were still alive. His love of the outdoors, duck hunting especially, and a different way of life back then come shining through. Some of the Southern vernacular is hard to push through but apparently realistic for that time period. Contains some politically incorrect words and situations but again, realistic for that time in America. Do not let this detract from the thrilling stories of bringing down ducks, shooting geese from pits and getting quail over talented dogs. It actually adds more flavor for the time in which it was written.

Dennis Bennett and his wife Rita were leaders in the charismatic renewal movement of the 60's and 70's. Dennis was an Episcopal priest who received the \\"Baptism\\" in the Holy Spirit and the gift of praying in tongues. His church in Seattle Wash became a spiritual hub for the movement. His book \\"Nine O'Clock in the Morning\\" describes his experience. That book also presents an exciting story of the power of the Holy Spirit in transforming lives. This book also provides inspiring stories and also more instructive teachings about the life of the Spirit and spiritual gifts. It is by no means all about spiritual gifts. Bennett spends considerable time discussing the theology of the Holy Spirit, receiving Him, living in Him, living in love, following the Scriptures and the Spirit. He also helpfully exposes roadblocks to life in the Spirit and walking with Him. I applaud the Bennetts for citing the fruit of the Spirit and especially love as necessary foundations to the life in the Spirit and for the effective Godly use of the gifts of the Spirit.I think readers today will especially appreciate Bennett's chapters on receiving the Spirit and the gift of praying in tongues. The Bennetts refer to the Baptism of the Holy Spirit as \\"pouring out of the Holy Spirit.\\" They explain that all Christians receive the Holy Spirit and that the baptism is another reception of the Spirit's power -- often producing the gift of praying in tongues. This is the traditional Pentecostal view of the Baptism of the Holy Spirit that is not accepted by all orthodox Christians. I personally believe in the baptism of the Holy Spirit; however, I would not define it as a one-time event but an experience that Christians ought to pursue on a regular basis of \\"being filled with the Spirit,\\" as the Apostle Paul exhorts. That is a nuance that readers may want to explore.The Bennetts write this about praying in tongues: \\"We are convinced, from the Scriptures and after praying for thousands of people to receive the baptism in the Holy Spirit over ten years, that there is no believer who cannot speak in tongues, if he or she is properly prepared, and really ready to trust the Lord.\\"I wish that all Christians would continue to read the Bennett's books and spark continual spiritual renewal and charismatic ministry.The above assertion differs with many other Christians' philosophy of the gifts; however, I completely agree with the Bennetts. This is why I think this book remains an important guide for Christians seeking to learn about the Holy Spirit and His gifts.The Bennetts teach about other gifts -- wisdom, knowledge, faith, miracles, healing, discerning of spirits, tongues and interpretation from 1 Corinthians 7-11. Other authors include other gifts. C. Peter Wagner includes 27 gifts in his books."},{"Title":"The Holy Spirit and You: A Guide to the Spirit Filled Life","review":"Dennis Bennett and Rita are two of the best writers in the world to help introduce new as well as older established Christians to the wonderful world of the Holy Spirit.

From this book has come millions of charismatics within mainline denominations such as Episcopal, Lutheran, Methodist, Roman Catholics, and many others.The book is written in a autobiography style with Bennett adding verses of Scripture here and there to help the reader see the teaching of the Baptism in the Holy Spirit with the evidence of speaking in tongues (Acts 2:4). In short, Father Bennett wants his reader to know that this is indeed an experience with the Spirit but he wants you to see that it is based on Scripture.While you might read this book and not agree with Father Bennett over the Spirit-Baptism, you can't help but to realize how hungry for Jesus we truly need to be and how God wants us to be on fire for Him (Romans 12:11-12; 1 Thess. 5:19)."},{"Title":"The Holy Spirit and You: A Guide to the Spirit Filled Life","review":"All the time in the media you hear \\"Buy this.

Suddenly my jaw dropped and I was able to speak in tongues!Not only that, but within several days another change, totally unexpected, could be seen. I had this new inner peace inside so that my formerly very bad temper was so removed from me that people who worked with me years later could hardly believe I ever had a temper! Victory over a nasty temper was by no means the only blessing that came forth, either.I have not read this book for over 10 years.

The authors tended to stray into other areas that had nothing to do with the chapters they were writing under. For example, the chapter on Discerning of Spirits took a massive detour into a step by step instructional on deliverance. I understand that discernment is needed in deliverance but I was looking for an in depth look at the gift and not a sidebar on deliverance that take over the rest of that chapter.The final chapters toward the end had a few interesting nuggets but I would not recommend this book to anyone, novice or advanced Christian.

They're not wisdom and knowledge. They are practical gifts that could remedy situations large and small: the first is a *message* from God to explain a given situation. The second prescribes what to do about it.Too often, we hear sermons on I Corinthians 12 that end with the Love chapter, 13. This book explains interesting points in 14, and more.Our lives are much richer when we let the Holy Spirit minister in fullness as He chooses in our lives. But if we don't know what He would like to do, we may close the door. Then we miss out on the fun, joy, excitement, and serious, practical ramifications of seeing the Lord really move in our lives.Using much Scripture and personal experience, Dennis Bennett shows that God is very practical and wonderful, if we'll let Him do what He wants to do."},{"Title":"The Holy Spirit and You: A Guide to the Spirit Filled Life","review":"This is the definitive work on the gifts and work of the Holy Spirit in the life of a Christian.

At first I liked the description of (life in) 19th century Vienna and the start of the career of young Sigmund Freud. But with each page the enormous amount of details (on streets, towns, persons, cases) started to suffocate the story untill I lost all interest in the passionate mind of Freud. Just because I don't like to quit a book somewhere in the middle (and still have hope that it might get better) I finshed it. Interestingly, in the acknowledgements Stone thanks his editor (his wife) for reducing the original amount of pages to the half and thereby making the book twice as readable. I wish she had given the book that treatment a second time, maybe then it would have been really readable....."},{"Title":"Passions of the Mind","review":"Irving Stone (1903-1989) was an American writer known for his biographical novels of famous historical personalities, such asLust for Life,The Agony and the Ecstasy: A Biographical Novel of Michelangelo,The Origin (Signet), etc.Josef Breuer tells the young Freud, \\"Sig, you have made a good case for the academic life but you wouldn't be happy there for long. You would lack freedom. You would have to conform. You would be allowed to be radical only along strictly conventional lines. You would have someone over you, directing you to shift your focus, hurry publication on something they approved, or destroy that which made them uncomfortable.\\" (Pg. 38)Later, Freud muses, \\"Breuer had exclaimed about the wife's strange behavior, 'These cases are always secrets of the alcove, the marriage bed.' The incident had happened three years before. Breuer had never mentioned it again. Yet here was Charcot saying the same thing and they were two of the most knowledgeable neurologists.\\" (Pg. 201-202) He subsequently concludes, \\"You know, Josef, it's becoming increasingly clear: hysterics suffer mainly from reminiscences.\\" (Pg. 310)He eventually concludes, \\"That's the purpose of dreams! To release from the unconscious mind what the individual is really wanting. Not the masks, not the disguises, not the hidden feelings or thwarted desires; but what the individual somewhere in the core of his brain wishes to have happen or have happened!... In dreams, he saw, nothing is forgotten, no matter how long ago it happened; the inventiveness of the dream, its cleverness in assuming altered forms, was a tremendous ploy of the imagination.\\" (Pg. 445)Of Alfred Adler, he recounts, \\"Adler had not wanted intimacy; but Adler's departure was at least half [Freud's] own fault. If he had been wise enough to move Adler into the heart of the Zurich group, and allowed him to play a key part in the formation and control of the International Psychoanalytic Society, that would have helped for a time. But in the end Alfred Adler would have had to go his own way, to be independent, to form a group of which he would be the head.\\" (Pg. 775)Of Jung's departure, he notes, \\"[Freud], above all others, grasped the power of Jung's mind and personality. As Jung continued to work and enunciate his psychology, the world would be split into separate and frequently warring camps. There was no way to minimize the severity of the blow... he knew there was only one way to fight back, to lessen the impact of Jung's defaulting. He must write a book on the history of psychoanalysis and its techniques, showing precisely where its truths lay. When he attacked Carl Jung, it must be on the basis of Jung's mysticism, his wanderings into the realms of saga and myth.\\" (Pg. 796-797)Near the end of his life, Freud muses, \\"He had changed man's way of thinking about himself. One was no longer obliged to be ignorant about the forces at play in human nature. Yet there were certain kinds of mentalities which he had failed to reach, those who still felt that investigation into the sexual nature of man was immoral and degrading. He wondered if these people could ever be reached.\\" (Pg. 869)Not a \\"scholarly\\" biography, Stone's account is nevertheless a very engaging portrayal of a key intellectual figure."},{"Title":"Passions of the Mind","review":"The book is written as an easy way to understand the subject matter.

This was years ago, but I have not forgotten how much I enjoyed it. When I finished it, it was with some sadness that I folded it pages together, and laid it down to rest. It was used when I got it. It is beat up and weary, but I loved it, and have a much different feeling, not only about Freud, but also about the students of medicine and the times about which it was written.

If that seems a lot to accomplish in just one short novel, it is. But, Procter-King manages to do it with a sense of humor and style that is all her own. You have to imagine that she enjoyed writing this book as much as you will undoubtedly enjoy reading it.One thing that you can count on when reading one of Procter-King's novels is that she has painstakingly researched her material. In that connection, this book, situated in Western Canada, in Vancouver and at Whistler Resort, accurately depicts its surroundings. Without giving anything away, when the heroine, Tina/Magee, goes careening down Whistler's mountain on a mountain bike, you get a sense of danger, wet weather, chilliness and fun, all wrapped up in one hilarious scene. In fact, each scene is jammed with this type of action and emotion.Another sure thing in her novels is that the characters will be multi-dimensional and surprising. In my opinion, the heroine Tina/Magee is \\"every girl.\\" For a smart, pretty and capable young woman, she does some pretty impulsive, maybe even silly, things in the name of love. But haven't we all? I was also very taken with Procter-King's ability to capture how a man trying to balance work and love might actually feel confused and bewildered. So often, the man seems to have it all together, while only the woman flounders. No, here the emotional toll is on both equally, adding much depth to the story.For anyone who has ever ridden the emotional roller coaster of love, replete with excitement, insecurity, self doubt, lustiness, yearning, holding back - the whole gamut of ups and downs - this book is a must. Take it to the beach with you, read on an airplane, take it to bed with you, just sit in your garden and enjoy the end of summer while appreciating all this novel has to offer. But, definitely read and enjoy it."},{"Title":"Head Over Heels","review":"I just loved this book: the characters, the plot, the voice! It's so refreshing to read a romance with humour.

He is going to lose the contract with Willoughby Bikes this weekend because his girlfriend, Tina Johnston, chooses this moment to dump him. Nathan, owner of Willoughby Bikes is a man who values honor and commitment, and Justin wants to portray a happy couple with Tina to gain the deal. Without Tina, Justin needs another woman to masquerade as her immediately. He is running out of time and Magee Sinclair enters into the picture. Magee is the account executive of Sinclair Advertising and wants to gain business with CycleMania. When Justin suggests his outrageous plan to Magee, she agrees to be \\"Tina\\". She wants to earn the new title, Account Director, by gaining the contract with CycleMania, rather than being the daughter of the boss. In order to ensure the success of the weekend, they have a practice date and make some cheat sheets. Everything turns out to be disastrous during the Willoughbys' visit but the worst thing is that the real Tina Johnston suddenly shows up at Justin's cabin.HEAD OVER HEELS is a romantic comedy, full of humor and laughter. Magee is the perfect girl for Justin. Although she is clumsy and lacks self-confidence, she has courage to take up the challenge in masquerading as Tina and to ride a mountain bike that she has no experience with. Justin is a businessman and not the marrying type until he spends the weekend with Magee. A few passionate kisses, a fake relationship and business deals creates this refreshing love story.

Unfortunately, Tina chose two days before the manufacturer's representatives arrived to announce that she didn't think their relationship was going to work - she wanted more from Justin than he seemed able to give, things like marriage and children. What was he going to do? He had planned on introducing Tina as his fianc&eacute;e to the reps of the bike manufacturing company, and take them on a couples mountain-biking weekend.Magee (pronounced Mah-gee) Sinclair of Sinclair Advertising was worried about a recent rash of blunders that had cost the agency several clients. Trying to regroup, she would do anything to make sure that the CycleMania account didn't suffer the same problems. So, when CycleMania owner Justin Kane asked her to help him land this distributorship by pretending to be his fianc&eacute;e the coming weekend, she didn't hesitate to agree. It was only after she committed herself that she found out that she'd have to impersonate Tina and pretend to know how to mountain bike. Of course, Justin didn't know that last part - she'd told him that she was an experienced biker when she was pursuing his account. Would she be able to pull off the impersonation?What a set-up for a comedy of errors! Everything that can go wrong in this scenario does go wrong, and the reader is well entertained by the comedic chaos. The plot is even and well-paced, with no slow spots. The protagonists are well written characters, and very realistic. Magee is a well-intentioned, slightly clumsy woman who really wants to succeed in her father's agency, while Justin is fixated on business (he has a life plan, you see). When the two come together, the resulting confusion blows their expectations out of the water, and makes them re-evaluate what they want out of life. The sex scenes are more sensual than graphic, but quite satisfying in context. I quite enjoyed this book, and found myself getting funny looks as I giggled over the mountain bike riding scene while standing at the bus stop. If you like your romance with humor, you'll love this one. -- Jean, Fallen Angel Reviews (courtesy of Fallen Angel Reviews)"},{"Title":"Waking Up in Heaven: A Contemporary Edition of Centuries of Meditation","review":"Traherne is one of the great religious visionaries, Christian or otherwise. He has developed a considerable reputation since his (re)discovery barely 100 years ago, and yet very little of his work appears in print. This beautifully produced volume helps redress the imbalance. While the need remains for a critical edition of Centuries of Meditation, David Buresh's update in contemporary English is a good study guide that helps organize and clarify Traherne's avalanche of inspired prose. (On a side note, it is hard to believe that Whitman wrote Leaves of Grass without any knowledge of Traherne -- I wonder whether he might not at least have come across some of his poetry. And this apparent influence extends beyond Whitman to several other writers, including Emerson, Thoreau and even Tolstoy.)"},{"Title":"Waking Up in Heaven: A Contemporary Edition of Centuries of Meditation","review":"Not often do you get to read a book that makes a classic better.

It's about time that this great storyteller is about to get his masterpieces printed in style. I just bought the first volume and I must admit it's been done with care: the book cover is intricate + the nice pictures, layout, design, and editing work ensures that the volume can only be marvelled with content. As a fan, I for one have been waiting for this event to happen and will ensure that I will collect all these editions from Night Shade Books. So, if you're a fan then this is a must buy.

Faux leather... i wasn't sure what that was and these volumes offered many short stories which i have not read so i decided to purchase the first 3 volumes as they coincidentally contain my favorite Hodgson works.The first two volumes i ordered from Amazon and the third from another seller at an inflated price. The books are not what i imagined faux leather to be or even similar to what my online searches described. They are basically regular board hard covers with vacuum formed plastic over the top very similar to the the diaries and note books students at my school were issued in the mid to late 90's.The silver \\"embossing\\" merely appears to be silver paint which i found rubs off alarmingly easy and there is a fine residue of this silver material over the books themselves and pages which migrated to my hands upon reading. This is, i found, most annoying as i enjoy reading in bed before i sleep and i had to get up to wash my hands after each reading. Because of the plastic covers and the silver paint i fear that after time on my shelf in close proximity the volumes will stick together.The binding is also glue (stitching would have been nice) and the paper of a lower quality which may brown over time.All in all i would have rather they made these volumes with acid free paper, stitched binding, cloth hard cover and a regular dust jacket. This i would even pay extra for due to the contents and assemblage of rare works contained within.Hopefully these volumes will be re-issued in the future meeting the above criteria.These books are worth the 20-30 dollars you will pay for new on Amazon simply because of the written material and collections of stories however they are not worth paying inflated prices (like i did for volume 3 on another sellers site) when they become out of stock."},{"Title":"Boats of the \\"Glen Carrig\\" and Other Nautical Adventures (The Collected Fiction of William Hope Hodgson, Vol. 1)","review":"I seldom review a book before reading it completely, but here I have to make an exception because I was bowled over by the appreance of this book as soon as I opened the Amazon box. This book is obviously a very loving treatment of Hodgson's works, the picture here doesn't do it justice. It is nicely bound and the cover is a deep blue textured faux leather, the drawings and lettering on front and spine, and the portrait of Hodgson on the back cover are deeply embossed in brilliant silver and quite stunning! WHY OH WHY someone had to slap a barcode sticker with strong adhesive on the back is beyond me, it took me 30 minutes of soap, window cleaner and knife to carefully remove it without marring the book. This book also contains wonderful line illustations at the beginning of several of the tales. Heads and tails above the quality of most books purchased nowadays.The stories themselves (I've only read a few so far in the Sargasso Sea section) are quite enjoyable. I'm a fan of Lovecraft, Blackwood, Machen, et al and also love a good sea story, so these are right up my alley. Well-written, interesting, and atmospheric while still having enough action to move things along.Highly recommended to anyone who enjoys stories in this genre and who wants a beautiful set of books on their shelves.

When I first discovered it, I thought it was a lost treasure and I have savored every book since that first one. I also enjoy her romance/mystery books as Barbara Michaels.I will be honest and say that when I first began reading the Amelia Peabody Mysteries some of the Egyptian discussions went a bit over my head. I found my Egyptian History to be sorely lacking, so when I discovered that Barbara Mertz/Elizabeth Peters wrote some non-fiction books about Egyptian History I was thrilled and I new it would be a good way to start learning a bit of information about one of my new favorite topics, Egypt.Temples, Tombs and Hieroglyphics is the first book she wrote and deals more with the Egyptian rulers and dynasties. Red Land, Black Land is the second one and deals more with the Egyptian people. It covers a wide variety of topics including rising children, pets, women's lives, clothing, jewelry, towns, houses, magic and religion, science and medicine, and painting and sculpture. It is extremely interesting and I found all of the topics engaging and concise. I believe that Barbara Mertz/Elizabeth Peters/Barbara Michaels has such a rare gift she could make the history of sandpaper interesting. I have read some reviews where people felt that she expressed some of her own opinions and views too freely, but I thought that she did a good job about making known what other popular opinions are in the field even if she doesn't necessarily agree with them. As I have begun purchasing more books about Egyptian History, I am very glad that I started with these books that have provided me with excellent background essential information that makes reading more detailed involved books much easier."},{"Title":"Red Land, Black Land - Daily Life In Ancient Egypt, Revised Edition","review":"When I'm planning some research or need to check a fact from another source, any book by Dr. Mertz is a good place to start. Her knowledge and ability to impart that knowledge is always welcome and a breath of fresh air in a subject that other authors tend to get detail heavy and enjoyment light.Dr. Mertz handles the subject with thoroughness and aplomb, making this an enjoyable read for those that just want a little background on the history of this vast area of research. Her humor shines through on every page and will bring the past back to life as only she can.Through this book and her other superb book,Temples, Tombs, and Hieroglyphs: A Popular History of Ancient Egyptyou can get the true feeling for this ancient culture and realize that no matter the time in history, people are people and it makes the long dead seem much more alive."},{"Title":"Red Land, Black Land - Daily Life In Ancient Egypt, Revised Edition","review":"Barbara Mertz is also the real name of writers Elizabeth Peters and Barbara Michaels. She has written 37 books in the popular Amelia Peabody series (Amelia is a Victorian Egyptologist and archaeologist) and 29 suspense books as Michaels. Mertz received her doctorate in Egyptology in 1952, and her first book published was Temples, Tombs, and Hieroglyphs: a Popular History of Egyptology. Her first novel was published in 1966. This is the second edition of Black Land, Red Land, originally published in 1978.This well-written and readable book is an excellent source of information on life in ancient Egypt. Mertz covers everything, including childhood, pets, women and queens, clothing, jewelry and cosmetics, towns and houses, education, magic, religion, science, medicine, mathematics, pyramid building, boats, mummification and tombs. All are fascinating, though my personal favorite is the chapter on painting and sculpture, and the Amarna period. The XVIII Dynasty has always fascinated me: the time of Queen Hatshepsut, Akhenaton, and Tutankhamon. It is difficult to imagine a kingdom and society that lasted for nearly 4,000 years; the U.S. is an infant in comparison. There is a chronology, map, notes, and a list of books for further reading. The line drawings and photographs enhance the text perfectly.Readers of the Amelia Peabody and Vicky Bliss mysteries, anyone longing to travel to see the ancient wonders of Egypt, or anyone with an interest in archaeology, will love this book.Armchair Interviews agrees."},{"Title":"Red Land, Black Land - Daily Life In Ancient Egypt, Revised Edition","review":"I wish that Dr. Mertz would write more non-fiction. Her Amelia Peabody mystery series, written under the nom de plume of Elizabeth Peters, is harmless entertainment. But her books on ancient Egypt are sharp, witty, well-researched and accessible. She brings to the sometimes dry subject matter a lively style and easy competence; it's like being taken on a tour of the ancient land of Egypt by an old and knowledgeable friend. She tells us about the everyday life of farmers, scribes, warriors, kings and commoners, with pithy comments on their art, furniture, clothing and diet. It is a comprehensive and interesting introduction to Egypt, the Egyptians, and Egyptology. Too many books aimed at laymen on this topic dwell overmuch on tombs and mummies and kings; Dr. Mertz' summation of the daily routines of quite ordinary Egyptians brings them vividly to life. The people of the Black Land (their name for Egypt) come alive as quite approachable human beings, whose lives, diets, and attitudes are much more familiar than the lives of, say, medieval European peasants. The Egyptians, by all accounts, loved life so much, and lived such pleasant lives, that their idea of the afterlife was merely a continuation of this one. From the smallest detail of a child's toy to the grand marvel of the Great Pyramid, their attention to every facet of daily life, their excellent faculty for observation, and their quick wits shine through in this story of their lives.

Like most books on the subject, it is basically a textbook that is written in a not-so-textbook style, which makes it easy reading. But, what drew my interest to this book in particular was the title and how it related to my book. The Red Lands refers to desert region, which was tended to be a bit more hostile, while the Black Lands referred to the more hospitable, fertile lands. One of the key points that I am glad the author brings out, which is rarely discussed, is that every since people have become fascinated with Kamit (Ancient Egypt). People from all over the globe have claimed to be a distant descendant of some Kamitic royalty. When in actuality, most of the people that descended from Kamit were probably farmers. As a result, she gives some insight into the ordinary life of the people, which was very helpful in my research."},{"Title":"Red Land, Black Land - Daily Life In Ancient Egypt, Revised Edition","review":"An excellent overview of daily life in Egypt by a veteran Egyptologist who, disappointingly, only wrote a few books on Egypt, and a ton of mysteries under a pseudonym, a major loss for Egypt lovers."},{"Title":"Red Land, Black Land - Daily Life In Ancient Egypt, Revised Edition","review":"A great non fiction book for lovers of the Amelda Emerson Series and lovers of Egypt. I highly recomend this book."},{"Title":"Red Land, Black Land - Daily Life In Ancient Egypt, Revised Edition","review":"Mertz's fascinating and witty history of ancient Egypt begins withTemples, Tombs, and Hieroglyphswhich focuses mainly on the larger scope of history. Here, she fills in the details of life of the Egyptians, from their jobs and art to their mummies and farming. People may be surprised how this supposedly mysterious Egyptians were much like anyone else in the ancient world. As Mertz explains in later chapters, while not dumb \\"primitives,\\" their life was much more primitive than our own. You wouldn't want to necessarily wake up there. These two books aren't just for Egyptophiles, because if you aren't interested in Egypt, you will be after reading these. Sure, Mertz focuses on what she likes (and says so up front) and sometimes dismisses things out of hand (such as Egyptian connections in the Bible). But overall, one of the best popular-level intros to ancient Egypt. Far better than all the fake-Egypt histories out there.

I had also purchased the mp3 version and prefer it over individual CDs."},{"Title":"Red Land, Black Land - Daily Life In Ancient Egypt, Revised Edition","review":"Like most reviewers, I want to compare this to Mertz' earlier work, 'Temples, Tombs and Hieroglyphs.' This overview of Egyptian social culture has the same great personal prose voice used in 'Temples.' It may even be more thoughtful--the subject matter of this work allows for less surface-scratching and more in-depth consideration of the topics concerned. However, this also offers Mertz the opportunity to go on a few tangents, none of which annoyed me. The point is: this book is not best for research reading. It is a great, informal introduction to ancient Egyptian culture, but it is best read for leisure."},{"Title":"Red Land, Black Land - Daily Life In Ancient Egypt, Revised Edition","review":"This book deals with a broad range of aspects of daily Egyptian life in Antiquity: housing, food, medicine, architecture, religion, etc.It constitutes an excellent complement to \`Tombs, Temples and Hieroglyphs' by the same author which covers history in an essentially classical fashion.In this case, the author's comments are generally interesting though sometimes a bit longish and too personal.In the audio book version, the narrator's maternal voice and intonations are very much in tune with the text. At times, you think of your grandmother reading you bedtime stories!Overall, this is a worthwhile book for anyone interested in ancient Egypt."},{"Title":"Red Land, Black Land - Daily Life In Ancient Egypt, Revised Edition","review":"This is a basic history of Egypt, of the life of the average people, written by B. Mertz PH.D, otherwise known as Elizabeth Peters, author of the Amelia Peabody series. It is referenced in many of the non-fiction books I have read or skimmed. Unfortunately, not too many photographs and they are black and white. The writing is clear, not dry and boring or text-bookish although it was originally a textbook I believe. It is readable, and fun to \\"dip into\\" for selections on various aspects of life, such as clothes over time, army life, etc."},{"Title":"Red Land, Black Land - Daily Life In Ancient Egypt, Revised Edition","review":"I loved this book, and can't wait to buy her other books.

This interesting work is divided topically into chapters on clothing, housing, food, art, war, mummification, etc. Though relatively few, the pictures are helpful, and the selection of color plates is well reproduced.

She is able to capture the very essence of the tremendous triad of being African-American, female, and southern. The richness of her writings leans the reader into envisioning that they are sharing in each experience. This book is thought provoking, ensightful, and a much needed analysis of life long love, forgiveness, infidelity, passion, and the search for the perfect union and soulmate. I was hooked on the book after reading the Introducton on page 13. My desire is that every one that I know has an opportunity to experience life through the eyes of Charlotte Russell Johnson.I have read each of Ms. Johnson's book. She is able to touch her readers in a very intimate way. Initially, I thought the book was about grief and then half way through the book it surprised me. Every reader can identify with being overwhelmed and pressured to make a life altering decisionI started reading this book in the beauty shop. I was so excited that I audibly exclaimed 'oh'. I wish Oprah would have a book this exciting on her show instead of some of her recent books. It was easy for me to see the main characters dilemna. I thing everyone has had to make a choice to trust and love or embrace loneliness. After reading the book, I was forced to ask myself some questions about my own romantic life."},{"Title":"Grace Under Fire: The Journey Never Ends","review":"Grace under Fire by Charlotte Russell Johnson will show you first hand how to make any homegoing a celebration of life. A funeral should be a time for a family to bond. Planning a funeral is very complicated. It involves a great deal of coordination and organization at a time when you are probably not feeling very organized. Surviving the death of a loved one is very difficult. You experience so many emotions including anger, death, sadness, remorse, and even relief if the loved one was suffering. Now add additional family problems to the equation and you will need to experience Grace from God while under Fire. Ms. Johnson does not demean the experience, but rather offers humor as a way of relieve the pain. Even the Bible says, \\"Laughter doeth good like a medicine Every funeral should be a celebration of life. This book changed my life and view of death."},{"Title":"Picturing Iran: Art, Society and Revolution","review":"Since there are so few books on modern Islamic art, this book is an amazing find!

Anyone interested in Iran or the Middle East will learn a lot from this book!"},{"Title":"Picturing Iran: Art, Society and Revolution","review":"It was quite informative, as modern Iranian art is somehow unknown, and is trying to find a character of its own. But also I have to disagree with the other comment , that Art in Iran is smehow quite different from the rest of the middle east, and it does not portrait the modern \\"Islamic Art\\" at all, and to understand Iranian art one has to consider so many other factors, such as the Persian art, and pre-Islamic art, and if you are interested in the art in middle east in GENERAL, then you should buy a book about art in middle east in General!"},{"Title":"Karate for Beginners","review":"Although this book is a translation, and it shows in some of the language, the illustrations are what makes this book worth the cover price. It breaks down katas and basic stances in a format that children can understand."},{"Title":"Sun Slower Sun Faster (Living History Library)","review":"This is a delightful read - particularly for the pre-teen set - about two children who travel back through different parts of history all set in and around the town of Bristol, England. The story is quite engaging (my 11 year old daughter LOVED it!) and is conceptually interesting as well. Each visit to the past brings the characters farther back in time and presents a piece of the puzzle they're putting together in their heads - a bit of the sense of perspective that history gives us, the struggles that are dealt with in every age, and the importance of faith and perserverance.I also enjoyed the little details present in the story - like how the children are called by their own names by \\"relatives\\" in each era, but their names and the names around them are believably related to the time-period. Costumes and manner of speech are attended to quite nicely as well. The story is set in the 1950s and the time travel sequences eventually take the characters all the way back to Roman Britain."},{"Title":"Sun Slower Sun Faster (Living History Library)","review":"A while back--say, a dozen or so generations ago--England was Europe's most fervently Catholic country; and it took many decades of bribing and bullying and grotesque torture before most of the English people finally slipped their moorings. There were a few holdouts, of course, old families that held onto the Faith and maintained a sense of history that most of their compatriots had forgotten. And that is the background premise to this tale. Through the convenient magic of time-travel, some children visit the England or Britain of ages ago, episodically, beginning with Bath Spa in the days of the Romans, and culminating with the great age of anti-Catholicism in the 1680s. For the orphan boy in the center of the tale, it is a journey of self-discovery. He finds out who he is by finding where his country came from.I am pleasantly surprised to find that this book is back in print. I was lent an old copy of the original English edition when I was little and spent years afterwards trying to locate a vintage copy. When I finally did, I found that I'd completely forgotten that Edward Ardizzone (a name I knew well) had done the illustrations."},{"Title":"Evil Secrets","review":"Warren James Bland started his career of violent crime in 1958 by gut-slashing a man at a gas station. By the time he kidnapped, sexually assaulted and killed 7 year-old Phoebe Ho in 1986, he had already been convicted of rape, child molestation, kidnapping, and torture, and had spent most of his adult life in prison. The disappearance of Phoebe in December of 1986 while on her way to school in South Pasadena, California, sparked a media frenzy and a massive search, which ended after a week with the discovery of her battered and torn body in a ditch in Riverside County. With no crime scene and no suspects, cops were forced to rely on cutting-edge scientific techniques and computer records of sex offender profiles to try to identify the killer. Book gives step-by-step details of how the police and scientists solved the crime, with lots of interesting insights and details concerning homicide investigation, and the impact such a terrible crime has on the community, as well as police investigators. Follows the death-penalty trial and conviction of Bland, with actual excerpts of transcripts and interviews with the prosecutor and defense attorneys. A quick read, well written. Good for true crime fans."},{"Title":"Evil Secrets","review":"Throughout this book, I noticed that the author, Kathy Braidhill, kept an emotional distance from the subjects of her book. At first, I thought perhaps she had a psychological problem. After finishing the book, I realized that she'd had to relive such horror that she probably had to take a step back.This is the hellacious story of a madman who posed as the nicest guy on earth. He was let out of prison five times, FIVE TIMES!, before he tortured, sexually tortured,starved, raped, sodomized and murdered little 7-year-old Phoebe Ho over the period of a week. One of the scariest parts of this book is that no one ever learned where he'd kept this child all of that time.Probably the most emotionally drenching part of this book is the sheer grief of Phoebe's parents. Here, Braidhill does an excellent job. I sobbed along with Mrs. Ho. How does she go on after this unspeakable evil was done to her favorite little one?Since I finished this book, I've kept a light on in my little one's room.This book is about a slasher, a rapist, a murderer, the devil incarnate, a sexual sadisst who could have been the guy next door. I suddenly realized what John Douglas has always warned...that murderers and rapists don't always LOOK like the monsters they are.A gripping book. After I was finished, I asked myself, who has this much evil inside of himself?

EL Guardi&aacute;n entre el Centeno, es una obra qe no se puede leer a la ligera, pues el gran contenido espiritual que guarda tras el gracioso, ir&oacute;nico y c&iacute;nico Holden Caulfield es m&aacute;s extenso de lo que muchos ha notado.

I think the world would be a better place. He is the most inspiring author I have ever read."},{"Title":"Shadow Strategies of an American Ninja Master","review":"Glenn Morris picks up where he left off in his first book, \\"Path Notes of an American Ninja Master\\" (1993). This is not an instructional book on ninjutsu per se (no pictures), although it is chok-full of Morris's further journey on the martial arts /ninpo path (Bujinkan style under Masaaki Hatsumi), anecdotes and interpretations of philosophy, both Asian, Occidental, and other. I found it similar in some ways to Robert Smith's book, \\"Martial Musings\\". Some of Glenn Morris's most interesting views he presents in Chapter 9, \\"Characteristics of Shugyosha Across Cultures\\" (page 169). Shugyosha he defines as a person who is searching for the truth...I have a feeling that this is what Morris is doing with his series of books.There is also the enjoyably opinionated Chapter 11, \\"Mud and Water, Purity and Power\\" where Morris allows his biases against other well known (sometimes questionable) martial artists of our time, to hang out in the wind. Among them Harunaka Hoshino (originally known as Chi Yuan) who created his own ninpo art from Japanese karate and kobudo during the ninja boom, Choi Hong-hi of Taekwon-Do whom he lambasts as having earned only shodan (1st black belt) before his return to Korea from Japan (now, now--nobody promoted Hatsumi sensei to 15th dan), and Genbukan Ninpo's Shoto Tanemora, once a student of Ninja Great Masaaki Hatsumi (and others) whom he dismisses as \\"...another cop...\\" with robotic movements (page 244). Some of the criticisms are fair, some are not...Morris doesn't bother to share his sources.I don't accept Glenn Morris's interpretations and claims concerning the many things supernatural/psychic which pepper his writings--but if I only read things I agreed with, I wouldn't be living! I am, I admit, a cautious skeptic. I find Morris to be overly generous in the way he doles out his faith, often optimistic in accepting theories and studies which have not been scientifically counducted or checked, although even he draws the line at things like Alien abductions (see Chapter 13, pages 312-316). On the other hand, his insights are honest, and personal. In sharing his beliefs, he hides nothing, holds back nothing. Reading between the (esoteric) lines without any adaptation or interpretation, I find much of the advice he offers on this volume to be homespun, and often sensible.Morris seems a cross between a scholar-warrior and a pseudo-intellectual hippy. This book is entertaining and fun to read. You don't have to share the man's opinions or beliefs to enjoy his adventures. If you enjoy martial arts autobiographies, or reading the personal thoughts of other people, this volume is just the thing."},{"Title":"Shadow Strategies of an American Ninja Master","review":"This book is a must for anyone trying to delve into the myseteries of the self. May be of particular interest to Jungian Psychologists out there due to the discussion of the Shadow and how it manifests in various aspects of the American culture.

You have to read Dr. Morris's work in a certain frame of mind because every paragraph is a jewel waiting to be discovered and embraced.Like others have said, it is not a \\"How-To\\" book on ninjutsu, but an essay on enlightenment and especially on the physical component of enlightenment. I can't count the times I have reread this book and every time found myself smiling at some new gem.In places it borders on ridiculous and you ask yourself, \\"How could he expect me to believe this?\\" But living in that world of possibilities for a moment is part of the joy.If you want to be a human being...and really, who doesn't?...come study Dr. Morris's map of how he got there.Don't forgetPath Notes of an American Ninja Masterfor which I cut and pasted this same darn review.HEY!!!

However, it was neither clear cut nor specific (likely presenting the same tone and lack of focus that has lead to his interpretation of ninjutsu splintering in the way that it has since his death). Although the information is insightful and witty, it is in no way practical, pulling many ninjutsu aspirants even further away from the essential basics that Masaaki Hatsumi has been trying to present to the public for the last 20 years or so (through his Bujinkan Budo Taijutsu). So, although it depicts a different interpretation of the shinobi way, it is in no manner something that should be presented to novices in the art, as it would completely distract them from the spirit and focus so important early in the practice."},{"Title":"Writing on the Body","review":"This is a wonderful collection of essays for anyone looking for an introduction to feminist theory, or simply for new ways to perceive and analyze the body.

Some of the ideas that seem common-sense knowledge were at one time innovations. He describes the researchers who came up with these insights and the processes involved.Particularly interesting is his discussion of the development of Gestalt psychology. The theory's founder, Max Wertheimer and his colleagues, labeled their school \\"Gestalt,\\" a German word that does not lend itself to direct English translation. Loosely, it means \\"form,\\" \\"figure,\\" \\"pattern,\\" or \\"configuration,\\" and has to do with holistically examining things in context. Not only is the whole greater than the sum of its parts, but changing relationships within a system alters the entire organism. Maintaining a system effectively includes relationship management.Of course, I don't agree with all of Sargent's writing, but he provides ideas worthy of our attention. Historically he fulfills his goal of showing what preceded the paradigms used today."},{"Title":"The Chronicles of Krystonia","review":"I first read this book when i was in junior high, it was well written and beautifully illustrated. It went along with a series of figurines, usually sold in the same shop. As i recall there were one or two more books in the series, but my memory eludes as to the titles. The book is a series of stories introducing the characters and places in the world of Krystonia. This would make a good children's book, especially for bedtime, none of the monsters are too terrible, having a rather, cute and cuddly pitch in the illustrations, and the evil people, are still rather funny."},{"Title":"The Chronicles of Krystonia","review":"This is a really cute book about another world - Krystonia. The \\"writer\\" of the book tells of his journeys in the land of Krystonia, and introduces you to several new species and characters. Unfortunately, the first half of the book is just that - discussing the different animals in Krystonia - and is very long, drawn out, and sometimes downright boring. The actual action in the book - a wizard's attempted takeover - doesn't begin to happen until the later half of the book. The first time I read the book I almost couldn't make it through because the first half was so boring. But by the end of the book I really enjoyed the theme. So if you're looking for a book that draws you in in the beginning, this is not the book for you. But of you're willing to work through the boring part, there is a great treat in store for you."},{"Title":"The Chronicles of Krystonia","review":"I absolutely loved this book. I did find, however, that it was extremely difficult to read as a child, and only appreciated it fully upon re-reading as an adult. Consequently, I do not recommend for children under 13 years of age. The character development is fantastic, and you are brought into a new world of people, animals, and adventure. I highly recommend for someone looking for something different but fun to read."},{"Title":"Golden Age of Zen","review":"First of all, this is a page-turner, from the Foreward by Thomas Merton, through the last page, which you hate to see arrive. It traces the early Chinese development of Ch'an, which relies on the guidance of an Enlightened Master, rather than the Japanese method of &quot;Zazen&quot;, or &quot;sitting quietly&quot; (meditation), as a means of obtaining Enlightenment. Most of what we in the west know about Zen has to do with meditation, but these early founders of Ch'an saw quiet contemplation as a waste of time. A student was brought to enlightment by many methods with these Patriarchs of Ch'an. I particularly enjoyed the chapter on Chao Chou, the originator of probably the most famous Koan of all, &quot;MU&quot;, the man was not only wise, but had a fine sense of humor too. Enlightment could also be gained via a loud shout, a door slammed on your foot, or a swift whack from your Master. You're going to have to read this to find out what the hell I'm talking about. This book will be part of your library forever, and I can guarantee it will be read many times. Also a fantastic book for those seeking the similarities of the mystical experience of all religions. BUY THIS BOOK"},{"Title":"Golden Age of Zen","review":"This book deals with the heyday of Zen Buddhism, Tang dynasty. The purpose of this book is introducing the Westerners to the Zen Buddhism. In other word, this is a Zen primer. Zen master Suzuki&iexcl;s &iexcl;An Introduction to Zen Buddhism&iexcl; is widely read for this purpose. But this book is somewhat different from Suzuki&iexcl;s. Just like Suzuki&iexcl;s book, this book follow the standard format of Zen primer. Listing koans (about the koan, see my review on Suzuki&iexcl;s book) chronically with the related anecdotes. But unlike Suzuki&iexcl;s, Wu takes the stance of interpreter not of storyteller. Storytelling is the classic way to introducing Zen Buddhism (for the reason, see my review on Suzuki&iexcl;s). But in that way, beginners can&iexcl;t grasp even the basic of Zen Buddhism. So Wu approaches somewhat differently. He begins with why Zen should take place in China, not in India. He points out the influence of Taoism. Taoism has, in fact, affinity to Buddhism and it&iexcl;s the mindset the Chinese understood foreign thought, Buddhism. So Wu argue that we can&iexcl;t figure out Zen without understanding basic principles of Taoism. Suzuki&iexcl;s book, for example, represents and explains the principles of Zen from the tradition of Buddhism. But unfortunately it seems not that good way to figure out Zen. Like other thoughts, Zen could be best understood against the historical backdrop. And it&iexcl;s the way this book employs and the beauty of this book: each principle of Zen is explained against Taoism and historical backdrop. Thought could be fully understood when the behind motives are grasped, I think. Yep, such works are not hard to see in Buddhology. But this book is written in the plain English to be steadfast to the intention of Zen primer."},{"Title":"Golden Age of Zen","review":"Wu provides a perspective of Zen which is as illuminating as Suzuki's. The additional commentary by Merton is also helpful as both he and Wu are Christians. Their Christian background provides a common jump-off point for many of us of Christian beginnings into the non-dogmatic world of Zen. At the same time our Christianity is deepened with the unmeasurable Buddha mind.Wu additionally provides a meaningful translation of the Tao te Ching."},{"Title":"Golden Age of Zen","review":"While initially excited by this book, within a few chapters I found it disappointing. First, while the books a whole is organized in a logical way, each chapter is a desultory journey over mounds of unrelated information--some that can be supported by scholarship and some that amounts to no more than folk tales. Second, this books suffers from the same problem a lot of books translated or written around the same time fall prey to: ecumenism. The introduction by Merton is a tip-off that more of the same is to come. Personally, I don't like translations or books on Zen that &quot;Westernize&quot; Chinese philosophy, and I think that Wu does this far too much. Thankfully, this trend seems to have reversed itself (see, e.g., Burton Watson's translations of the writings of Lin Chi)"},{"Title":"CLEP Human Growth and Development (College-Level Examination Program)","review":"Call me crazy, but I bought this book and two others on studying for CLEP before taking the test.

Kapuscinski doesn't pretend his reporting is the culmination of the coups he witnessed. He acknowledges the necessarily fragmented nature of his witnessing.2.) Kapuscinski is a talented writer (very talented, or perhaps very hard working if you're Malcolm Gladwell).3.) Kapuscinski is crazy. The man was sentenced to death four times. He witnessed and reported on 27 coups.4.) Kapuscinski refused to write the easy, obvious narrative. This is true in books like Imperium as well. The man was one of those Truth Seekers.5.) The subject is surreal but obviously real.6.) And who was I?A reporter.Why was I traveling?To look, to walk around, to ask, to listen, to sniff, to think, to write.Aha. Where was I going to stay?I didn't know."},{"Title":"The Soccer War","review":"This is very worthwhile reading for residents of North America or Europe to gain a better understanding of conflict and politics in other parts of the world, even if it dates back to the 1960s and 70s. Kapuscinski describes events and situations that most of us will never experience, fortunately. His style is direct, immediate, sometimes blunt, but especially effective in conveying what war is like on the ground. He was an \\"official\\" journalist for a Communist country. He had the privilege of traveling abroad, but everything he wrote for publication was censored. Presumably Kapuscinski's masters wanted him to paint a picture of brave Third World peoples fighting for freedom against capitalist exploitation. But there is little or nothing here that you could call Communist propaganda. Instead it is engaging reporting of historic events in conflict zones (Africa, Central America, Syria, Cyprus) by an intelligent, humane observer who has good insights."},{"Title":"The Soccer War","review":"I was encouraged to read this for El Salvador, but there was very littel useful info in there.If someone wants to read the diaryish notes of a combat reporter than maybe this would have been 3 stars, but that wasn't me."},{"Title":"The Soccer War","review":"In case you have never heard of Ryszard Kaspuscinski, don't feel bad, he is one of the greatest journalist of all time. Now with that said, this is a collection of his best works. The title comes from a war between Honduras and El Salvador over a soccer game. Ryszard is right in the middle of everything, from the murder of the prime minister of the Congo, Patrice Lumumba to the torture chambers in Latin America. His style of writing is the real selling point of this book. He is with a Polish news agency and writes freely while the Cold War is in full tilt. He puts the reader in the situation with him in the most deadly action. It is a style much like Hunter Thompson's. If you are looking to read real action adventure take this book as a great starter for the world of Kapuscinski."},{"Title":"The Soccer War","review":"or at least should not attempt to be. Kapuscinski's personal anecdotes are at once his strength and his weakness. Relating the mundane details of the residents of a hotel in Nigeria both makes the situation accessible, but trivializes the book at the same time.The main content is unassailable. The author's adventures and the misfortunes of the countries he reported on are fantastic. If the book had been kept a work of reportage, instead of trying to prove the author was a Great Writer, it would be unquestionably five stars."},{"Title":"The Soccer War","review":"This is my first Amazon review, and I think it's appropriate. Because this book, this glimpse into what life really is, this subtly gut-wrenching, overtly gritty, piercing, surgical probing into a tiny snippet into another man's battle with consciousness, is well, basically Hemingway being one-up'd, in a contemporary palatable way that constantly leaves you wanting more. I mean, people go traveling, sure. People visit exotic places and write about it. But this, this, this is a man with something going on, and who knows how to put it on paper, and who knows - or is probably just unconscious enough and doesn't know - so it's that much better. Enjoy."},{"Title":"The Soccer War","review":"Kapuscinski is a Polish reporter who worked extensively in war zones in Africa and South America, and most of this book is about his experiences in Africa in the 1960's. Towards the end of the book he also writes about the war between Honduras and El Salvador (the &quot;soccer war&quot; of the title) which was sparked by soccer internationals between the two countries.I first read this book quite a few years ago and I enjoyed it immensely at the time, and would have given it four stars then. Upon reading it a second time recently I found it less impressive, though still a good read. Kapuscinski evokes Africa well, and is very good at describing people, but I now felt that he was directing too much attention to his own experiences/emotions (and bravery?), instead of just describing situations. I also found the device whereby he keeps on referring to and writing about the book that he plans but never writes (if this does not make sense here, it also doesn't make much sense in the book itself) irritating and more than slightly pretentious, as if he wanted to make The Soccer Wars a more intelligent book than most written about war. This pretentiousness also shines forth in the very confusing last chapter of the book. But, having said this, The Soccer War, although not a masterpiece by any means, is still well worth reading, as it deals with a very interesting period in African history, a period that produced some fascinating political leaders."},{"Title":"The Soccer War","review":"I think other reviewers have covered how great this book is. I would like to respond to some of the critical reviews. One reviewer, in particular, claims that the book is an incoherent mess because there's no \\"coordinating thesis\\". This person asks for \\"clear eludication\\" (I would add SIC, but I believe the person actually thinks this is a word). Anyone asking for \\"eludication\\" is not worthy to judge Dan Brown novels much less Kapuscinski.Why does everything need a neat bow? The world is complex. Too complex, seemingly, for some. To read this book is to better understand our shared experience and, ultimately, your unique experience. I can't recommend it more highly."},{"Title":"The Soccer War","review":"As the only international correspondent for Poland, Ryszard Kapuscinski found himself in some truly fascinating, exciting and deadly situations. From running roadblocks in Nigeria to reporting from the front lines in Central America, Kapuscinski delivers some of the most exciting and insightful adventure/travel writing I have ever read"},{"Title":"The Soccer War","review":"The Soccer Wars is a timeless diary( timeless in the sense that it lacks chronology, not timeless in the sense of transcendance) that bounces from Eastern Europe to West Africa, the Great Lakes region, Central America and through the west back to Poland. Kapuschinski is usually a more thourough analyst and offers insights along the journey.He suggests many times that this is the book &quot;he never got 'round to writing&quot;. Unfortunately, the lack of flow, ideas and critical thought makes it a book he shouldn't have written."},{"Title":"The Soccer War","review":"It is a striking book. Mr. Kapuscinski is a great writer and the narrative is simply wonderful.It is a great account of the cold war, as fought in Africa and Latin America."},{"Title":"The Soccer War","review":"Sorry, but this book is a major disappointment. I have enjoyed a lot of Kapuscinski's writing, but this book really misses the mark. Some of Kapuscinski's trade mark incredibly perceptive observations shine out here and there, but what is the coordinating thesis??? What are the salient conclusions Kapuscinksi makes after viewing so much revolution? We never get any clear eludication of the above, the book reads like a diary and diaries are often incoherent messes. The book can be enjoyed on the level of a diary, but it would have been much much better had Kapuscinski put together a (few) coordinating thesis for the book, and allowed the book to flow in a way that supports his thesis. Also many of the topics that Kapuscinski touches really deserve their own entire books."},{"Title":"The Soccer War","review":"Not at all what I expected from a reporter writing for the Polish Press Agency during the Cold War days. Kapuscinski acheives heights of journalistic excellence time and again. I expected Soviet-style propaganda puff-pieces and was startled over and over again by Kapucsinski's humane, non-dogmatic views and independent streak.But more than that, he is a journalist with a poet's soul. His lyricism can be downright haunting...he has a rare gift when it comes to the printed word. It is a poinant, sensitive lyricism I've found only among Polish and other East-Central European (mostly non-Russian Slavic) writers. Don't know what it is, but it always enchants me......I mostly bought the book due to the author's own nationality and also for the section on Latin America, which was of primary interest to me, but since I was &quot;reading&quot; the book as an audiobook (therefore, listening to it)...I &quot;read&quot; it cover to cover. Although it covered wars in Africa and other parts of the world that are of minimal interest to me, he made these events come alive, made me sit up and take notice, actually care about these things, these people, these events.Kapucsinski's book makes an interesting contrast to PJ O'Rourke's _Holidays In Hell_, which I'll admit I did laugh at when listening, but O'Rourke's is a rather mean-spirited humor and unabashedly U.S. nationalistic/right-wing. Kapucsinski is much more humane."},{"Title":"The Soccer War","review":"This book is actually a series of essays and dispatches from various corners of the world, unlike some of Kapuscinski's previous work, which looked in length at specific countries (Iran, Ethiopia, etc.). The various sections ranged from marvelous to merely good. The first half of the book chronicles Kapuscinski's visits to Africa in the 1960's, and he provides us with some wonderful portraits of that continent's post-indenpendence dilemmas. The author really seems to capture the mixture of optimism, heroism, disillusionment, and despair that nearly every African country went through. There is a particularly colorful look at Ghana's Kwame Nkrumah, as well as chapters on the Congo's Lumumba, Algeria's Ben Balla, a brutal civil war in Nigeria, and one of the most curious military takeovers I have ever read about in Upper Volta (now Burkina Faso), which Kapuscinski came upon by accident. The author relates riveting near-death experiences in the Nigeria and Burundi chapters. The latter half of the book chronicle's visits to Latin America, the Middle East, Cyrus, and the Ethiopia-Somalia border during the 1970's. I found his description of the 1969 \\"Soccer War\\" between Honduras and El Salvador to be especially compelling. Kapuscinski's specialty is not in technical, academic analyses of war, economic underdevelopment, or tyranny. Nor is he necessarily a sensationalist, out to shock readers with gory details. Of course, many of his stories are quite sensational to those unaquainted with such things, but his presentation is subtle and thoughtful. He seeks to find traces of humanity in even the most barbarous situations. Another thing I really appreciate about Kapuscinski is that he seemingly talks to everyone, from urban intellectuals to impoverished peasants. The only reason I gave this book four stars rather than a perfect five is the fact that sometimes I would have appreciated a bit more technical analysis, or at least background information. This was especially lacking in his chapters on Cyprus and the Somili-Ethiopian war, where he perfectly captures the flavor of everyday life in the midst of crisis, but provides little insight into origins of the crisis itself. Also, Kapuscinski frequently launches into philosophical musings which can range from dazzlingly brilliant to downright ponderous. Nevertheless, even these detours into the abstract do not negatively affect the flow of the book, and they are minor criticisms when put into perspective. I highly recommend The Soccer War to anyone wishing to gain a better picture of some of the most intriguing events and places of our world."},{"Title":"The Soccer War","review":"In the world of journalism, no one compares to Kapuscinski. For the sheer range of his intelligence, perception, bravery, and compassion, he stands unique; and in this book he collects the essence of what both allowed him and drove him to achieve his remarkable career. I'm always wary of journalists who try to summarize cultures other than their own--reducing a country's worth of people and all their pain, suffering, history, and joy into a few pithy phrases. But Kapuscinski writes with a combination of humility and experience that allows him to surpass the cynical superiority to which foreign correspondents are so often heir. Nor does he ever stoop to describing his travels as a set of exotic adventures and near misses with death. Instead, his sense of history and culture always blends his own activities with the larger political picture in a way which illuminates both. The overriding theme of THE SOCCER WAR is journalism--what it can be and what it can never be. The book's final essay, in which Kapuscinski, crouched by a fire in Ghana, contemplates his readers at home and the friends he sits with, is as fine a summary of the inherent contradictions of the calling as has ever been written. In these final pages, Kapuscinski condemns, celebrates, and demonstrates both the necessity and the impossibility of this strangest of all modern professions in a way that should haunt both journalists and anyone who has ever read a newspaper."},{"Title":"The Soccer War","review":"It's almost impossible to process the news with the same perspective after reading this book...what was true in the 60s still rings true today. I picked up this book while simultaneously reading articles in Esquire and The New Yorker about people (Bill Gates, Bill Clinton...) trying to make a difference in Africa. While I was made hopeful by the observations in today's mainstream press, I grew increasingly frustrated when confronted with the dark reality that Kapuscinski exposes."},{"Title":"The Soccer War","review":"R.Kapuscinski has spend many years of his life travelling and trying to understand the reality and the way of thinking of the third world countries . The Soccer War is exactly about that , with it's biggest part reffering to Africa and it's final fifty-sixty pages dedicated to Central America .Kapuscinski succeeds his aims on many levels . He manages both to analyze the political situation on places like Nigeria and Ghana , to focus on the motivations and strategy of the people who hold power there and at the same time he richly describes the landscapes , the scarried faces and the towns and neighbourhoods he had seen . What he seems to try to explain is this : despite the fact that there are many gifted politicians in these nations willing to make a difference , the lack of diplomatic maturity needed , the poverty and the unalphabatised mases will always stand as an obstacle to their lands' progress .Finally i was very pleased to see for the first time in a foreign book a chapter about the merely occupied and still divided island of Cyprus , an overlooked national drama which hasn't received the attention it should have for over than thirty years now ."},{"Title":"The Soccer War","review":"A series of essays based on visits to Africa and Latin America that exposes Kapuscinski's almost pathological need to get as far behind the scenes of bloody revolution and savage civil war as possible.The absolute pinnacle of modern reportage. The world is deeply indebted to the author for gathering the searing stories that otherwise would have remained largely untold. Had Kapuscinski hailed from the USA or perhaps a more affluent European nation, rather than his native Poland, he would surely have won a Pulitzer by now."},{"Title":"The Soccer War","review":"As somebody who once lived in Honduras before the infamous soccer war of 1969, I long had Kapuscinski's book on my \\"must read\\" list. Though I bought it five years ago, I didn't get around to reading it till just now. I'm glad I did. THE SOCCER WAR is another sterling volume from this master of description.THE SOCCER WAR isn't a book about the absurd war between El Salvador and Honduras, triggered by World Cup qualification matches, but really caused by El Salvador's overpopulation and the subsequent overflow of Salvadorenos into much-emptier Honduras. The war may also be ascribed to the fact that neither country has been able to tame its landowning classes, who continue to this day to run rampant over the poor masses of people. In any case, this war, which happened decades ago, occupies only 30 pages of a 234 page book. The rest of the book contains vignettes from Ghana, Nigeria, Congo, Burundi, Algeria, Tanganyika, Syria, Cyprus, and Ethiopia. I think another title would have given readers a better idea of what the book is about. Anyway, I would not say this book is about particular societies or countries, rather it is about the human condition. Kapuscinski, if you have read any of his other (excellent) work, specializes in inserting himself into extreme situations----war, rebellion, conflict, and abnormal behavior. Where the strictures of daily life have fallen down, we find him reporting, usually at considerable risk to his person. He is nearly burned to death in Nigeria, nearly executed in Burundi, nearly lynched in the Congo, nearly blown up in Honduras. In every case, he manages to portray some participants as humane and decent, or as simple people caught up in events beyond their control. He never writes off groups of people as \`wild' or \`barbarous', but manages to \`read' them even as he faces almost certain death. The absurdity of all this violence, the violence that never ends on this planet, comes through loud and clear. Ryszard, you wrote your best, but nobody in charge listened. Readers of the book, however, will come away with a better understanding of human nature and its universal similarity on every continent, among every race and religion. From the stupidity, waste, and blood, we can learn. We just don't."},{"Title":"The Soccer War","review":"Kapuscinski is the master of international journalism. Often he prefaces his accounts by saying something to the affect of, \\"Everyone told me that trying to get into the Congo was suicide. I had to do it.\\" The result is a perspective that no one else is able to give, a sometimes brutal but eye-opening account of the effects of war.The best part of The Soccer War to me is Kapuscinski's ability not only to report on war, but to capture the humanity of the people involved. He is in this way an anthropologist as much a journalist. True, this book covers extensive topic matter: Ghana, Benin, Nigeria, Algeria, Congo, Burundi, Cyprus, etc, but Kapuscinki's voice is powerful enough to unify these seemingly disparate stories.If you are curious about world history, if you want a humanistic and first-hand view of events that have shaped our world today, this is your book. There were times when I was literally on the edge of my seat wondering if Kapuscinski would make it out alive. Of course, we know he did because he pubished a book about these experiences.Visit my blog: http://www.writingup.com/blog/namingame"},{"Title":"The Soccer War","review":"I just finished The Soccer War and thoroughly enjoyed it. Like 18th century novelists and Milan Kundera, Kapuscinski rambles where he pleases and you enjoy every minute of it. A reporter for the Polish press during the cold war, his essays cover Africa, Central and South America, and the Middle East during political upheaval and revolutions. His viewpoint and humor are, for me, very reminiscent of Kundera, had he roamed the third world countries. Don't miss this delightful book."},{"Title":"The Soccer War","review":"Those who are truly interested in what our world is all about and would like to get profound insights into other cultures don't waste their time on the pulp spewed daily by the popular media. Books and essays by Ryszard Kapuscinski constitute a needed antidote.A Polish reporter whose literary skills have been compared to those of G. Greene and E. Hemingway, Kapuscinski is the only writer I know who has consistently managed to capture the essence of the geo-political realities, misunderstood conflicts, and non-Western mentalities - in all of their complexity - so accurately, with such poetry, and in so few words. &quot;The Soccer War&quot; is a favorite of mine.

The titular piece refers to a brief war between Honduras and El Salvador, but the collection mostly deals with Africa, especially the Congo, Ghana, and Algeria. Some of the essays are, inevitably, not as strong as others; nevertheless, Kapuscinski, an internationally acclaimed journalist, communicates with immediacy and heart in an engaging, readable style. Speaking of his childhood in Poland during World War II, he writes, \\"In my country, the war did not pass anyone by; it went through every home, it smashed its rifle butt against every door, it burned dozens of cities and thousands of villages. The war wounded everyone, and those who survived cannot cure themselves of it. A person who has lived through a great war is different from someone who never lived through any war. They are two different human beings. They will never find a common language, because you cannot really describe the war, you cannot share it, you cannot tell someone: Here, take a little bit of my war.

The chapter called &quot;Children&quot; has a ton of data on how exactly to handle children and what kinds of things to avoid doing, and why. I have found this to be extremely helpful for me. I have six kids, so it is really important to me to be able to really handle my job as a parent well.So far, so good. Using this data has helped me to make good decisions in parenting, and I have been able to avoid so many of the pitfalls other parents fall into.It is by far the best information on child-rearing out there, and can be used by parents from all different cultures and points of view.The section on assists (actions taken to help people who are ill, upset, or have been injured) is likewise invaluable. My older kids have learned how to give assists to others, and they really know what to do now when someone has been hurt! Which, I don't need to tell any experienced parents out there), is a very common occurrence when you're surrounded by toddlers and preschoolers.If one of my children gets upset, I know what to do. If one has a nightmare and wakes up still upset and can't get over it right away, I know what to do. If a child gets ill, I of course take him or her to the doctor, but after that, I can take further steps to help him heal his body, and all that is fully described in this book.I think this book is a lifesaver for parents, and I highly, highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Scientology Handbook","review":"I have spent 12 years on a spiritual quest, and ran into this book while doing a search term. I had heard so many negative things about Scientology, that I ignored my findings for 3 years. 3 years later, and hundreds of abandoned books, again I search, and this book comes up. So I buy it. And now I kick myself for not acknowledging it when I first discovered it.I have read thousands of books, I read every day, I study every day, and this is by far the best practical guide to life I have ever encountered. I use the information daily. Whether it is dealing with my children, setting goals, performing nerve assists or touch assists on friends and family with pain, public relations, organization - I spent 4 days doing the practical applications in my home and in my office, and I felt lighter and free to think when the clutter was removed, marriage, and something I use with myself and taught my kids was the technology of study. The entire educational system should adopt this, and it is so easy you could do it in under a week. The cause of suppression - since reading this I have never had a cold or illness since. There is much more, and this book would make the best gift to a son or daughter heading off to college, or for any adult that is not flourishing.Until you discover an answer for yourself, the rest is heresay and gossip."},{"Title":"The Scientology Handbook","review":"I have been reading and researching the work of Dr Hubbard along with others for the past 20 odd years and have now and then come across individual booklets with regards to specific help to life offered by the CoS. Each of these little booklets runs about $5 or so, and are also available online in PDF format (or they used to be anyways). This book has all these booklets in it! Some topics that I have found useful are Ethics, Marriage, Communication, Study, Children and many others... Of course one of the best things is that the CoS offers free training courses for each of the modules in the book at www.volunteerministers.org, and heck - if you do them all you can be a certified volunteer minister (so much for the so called \\"Cult of Greed\\" I keep hearing about!).Buy this book, use it, read it, live it! You do not have to be a Scientologist for this to work any more that you need to be a physicist for gravity to work!

Well, for instance the Chapter entitled 'Ethics and The Conditions'. I didn't really understand it, but if you read the Chapter 'The Technology of Study' you find out why you didn't understand it, because you weren't looking up your words in a dictionary to understand what they mean...I know, it sounds obvious, but until someone spells it out, it really isn't obvious. The whole book is like that, it seems to 'have all the answers'. It's funny you never hear about things like this on Oprah, it seems like she'd be all over it...if only Dr. Phil would start giving out practical advice like this.I use this book a lot: There is a section on Tone Scales, which are the different tone levels people are in, cheerful, grief, apathy, etc. The book tells what you can expect of people in different tones, and how to handle them. There is...there seems to be something for everyone. You should get this book. There, I said it. I'm on record. Anyone who from this point on comes up to me and complains that I had all the answers to their problems, but I didn't share them and thus help them out is in error - as I said, this book has all the answers and I just told you to read it."},{"Title":"The Scientology Handbook","review":"I used this book for many different areas including my business.

A friend of mine showed this book to me. The first thing that jumped out at me was a section called &quot;Conditions of Existance&quot;. Basically, we are all in a certain condition,by using what was in this chapter I was able to improve my conditon, not only at work but in my marriage! I think most of us rarely think of what our condition is. We just know that we are happy or not happy. I found this book gave me a way to improve myself and my situation in life. I really feel more in control of my life as a result of reading and putting to use the information laid out in this book. It also has many other useful chapters.

Check out the section on &quot;studying&quot; for ways to understand and remember anything (math, history, etc.) the first time forever! I have a child, now in a gifted program in middle school, who uses such useful information to recall science and the like--it's astronomical what it's potential has been in our household. I do not belong to the &quot;church&quot;, do not pay dues, checked this out originally at the public library (as a single mom with two youngsters)--and the above chapter has just blown us away--I may not worship L. Ron like a God (and I really don't believe Scientologists do either frankly), but I know and feel deepest of appreciation and highest respect for those L. Ron inspired to donate that original book I used, and when I moved, I bought one because the success in my house is so incredibly high based on this one human being's contribution, that only the one true God could have inspired in him. The &quot;studying&quot; chapter is only a tiny part of the many many practical and easy activities in many areas in this book-it's straightforward, no tricks, no influences, just you and your life. Worth whatever it costs, an investment I made that's covered such a major portion of the upgrading of our lives here in this house--don't miss the opporunity!"},{"Title":"The Scientology Handbook","review":"First let me begin by stating that I have had exposure to Scientology. I simply hate reading reviews by people who do not have a real clue about what their subject is, or are biased by bad experiences and conclude that EVERYONE should know how terrible they were treated. Having been exposed to introductory services and courses at my local organization, I can tell you that this book covers much of what I experienced. The information is very easy to understand and there are many useful photos and illustrations. This book offers practical knowledge and many demonstrations of the auditing process (scientology counseling) and courses offered. It does what many other Scientology books have not done which is DEMONSTRATE principles in user friendly terminology. Before spending $ on any service at a scientology church, it would be a wise decision to have a clear idea of what is being performed and what to expect as an end result. This book will help both the scientologist! and non-scientologist better understand a very misunderstood topic."},{"Title":"The Scientology Handbook","review":"After I read the Scientology Handbook, I felt as if I could start a new life.

There's the electromagnetic spectrum , the &quot;rodomagnetic&quot; spectrum , and the psichic spectrum.Offcourse it's explained in a much more gripping way and is actually very interesting and well writen. I forgot to mention thet the robots claim to act for the best of humanity , and all the restrictions are for the better of the peaple confined.

The Humanoids deserves a wider audience, it compares favorably to 1984 and Brave New World and is entertaining and suspenseful to boot. It is truly great science fiction. It is depressing though, perhaps that accounts for its lack of popularity. The book is an important commentary on the nature of Freedom. Moreover, those who blieve in God but wonder why (s)he is not more overtly benevolent, would do well to read this book."},{"Title":"The Humanoids","review":"Awesome story! Never did I expect such a disturbing ending, while at the same time it is somewhat promising (in a deranged way). Looking forward to reading the sequel, The Humanoid Touch."},{"Title":"The Humanoids","review":"This book is composed of two stories. The first, called Folded Hands is nothing short of brilliant. Jack Williamson created a rather bizarre, almost tongue and cheek idea, that works well in this quick blast that had me laughing and feeling chilled all at the same time. Williamson didn't take himself too seriously but the short story had some terrific ideas. Unfortunately I cannot say the same for the novella. The second story, for me anyway, felt weighed down by far too much dramatic dialog and unrelenting techno babble that dragged the story down. The Humanoids idea -- that mankind must be protected from itself ,can't help but sound a bit silly in execution and in the second story, Williamson goes for the straight dramatic and it feels awkward. Granted there are some brilliant ideas but they don't play out because the author is too busy trying to explain this bizarre science that can defeat the humanoids. That in itself sounds like a parady but he plays it straight! When Asimov wrote robot stories he understood when not to take himself too seriously. On top of that, I found it a bit hard not to feel sorry for the Humanoids. They really are passionate and just completely naive about what they are doing and its consequences. I wish logic instead of mass destruction would have been formulated to deal with the issue. Oh well."},{"Title":"The Humanoids","review":"SPOILERS!! BE WARNEDThis book is so freaky and thats why its great. Its got a horror touch to it as those robots are pretty scary the way it does evil but acts like its doing perfectly righteous acts. One reviewer mentioned that the main character is not likable. I dont know what he's talking about because the main character is totally great, honorable, just, basically everything you want in a human being or a hero. The story is great because you can never guess whats going to happen next. It keeps changing. The ending at first seems pretty horrible, and I didnt realy like it but I think if it didnt end this way this book woudnt of made such an impact. Oh and this book is exactly like that one star trek episode from the original series called NOMAD where that machine tried to \\"steralize\\" everything one but killing it."},{"Title":"The Humanoids","review":"classic sci-fi book - must read !"},{"Title":"The Humanoids","review":"This book contains two classic SF works. The first is the novelette titled 'With Folded Hands...' published first in 1947 in 'Astounding Science Fiction'. The second story is the novel \\"The Humanoids\\", which was also published originally in 'Astounding Science Fiction' in 1948 (March - May) under the title '...And Searching Mind'. The two stories share the same nemesis, which are the robots known as The Humanoids.The Humanoids' purpose is \\"To Serve and Obey, And Guard Men from Harm\\", which is really just a rewording of the first two laws of robotics that Asimov and Campbell create for Asimov's robot stories that first started to appear in 1940. However, this does not make these stories redundant, as Williamson's Humanoids take their purpose to the extreme, and go so far as to prevent men from doing anything that could potentially cause harm, which includes such activities as driving, or even reading in some cases.In 'With Folded Hands...,' the hero is Mr. Underhill, who opposes the humanoids at first because they threaten his livelihood (he is an android salesman), but later because he can see the effect they have on people's lives. He works with the creator of the Humanoids, Mr. Sledge, who is desperately trying to put an end to his creation.In 'The Humanoids,' the hero is Dr. Clay Forester, who is made aware of the Humanoid menace by a group of humans with various special abilities such as teleportation, clairvoyance, telekinesis, and telepathy. They refer to these types of abilities as \\"psychophysics\\". As the story proceeds, the reader becomes less and less sure who is right and who is wrong in the conflict. The Humanoids, though still a presence, are not the main foe for Dr. Forester. Instead he focuses on Frank Ironsmith, a former colleague who is helping the Humanoids, involved with Forester's wife Ruth, and is given much more freedom than other humans by the Humanoids. Although the Humanoids use some horrible methods of forcing people to be happy (e.g. drugs, surgery), they are not nearly as controlling as they were in \`With Folded Hands....' One oddity between the two stories is that Williamson introduces a different creator of the Humanoids, whose name is Warren Mansfield.These two stories are definitely worth reading for anyone interested in Science Fiction. \`The Humanoids' rated 27th in 1952 for science fiction books, and tied for 18th in 1956 on the Astounding/Analog All-Time Polls. \`With Folded Hands...' tied for 32nd in 1999 on the Locus All-Time Poll of novelettes."},{"Title":"The Humanoids","review":"THE HUMANOIDS is one of the unquestionable classics of the science fiction genre, and arguably the most important novel ever written about robots. The core idea of ultra sleek robots who arrive on a planet &quot;to serve and protect&quot; the planets inhabitants to the most logical extreme of that directive was brilliant and extraordinarily innovative when the book was published in the late 1940s. As such, absolutely no one even remotely interested in science fiction can afford not to read this great novel.Unfortunately, aside from the core concept and several excellent characters, including the marvelously conceived humanoids themselves, I found a few elements in this story to be somewhat disagreeable. Others may not find them so, but I did, and they somewhat marred my enjoyment of the novel. First, the main character of the novel was, to me, was an unpleasant individual. Now, it is entirely correct that it is important to the novel's plot that he not be especially likable. Nonetheless, he was a somewhat unpleasant character, and spending time with him even on a fictional level was not as much fun as one might like. I also was unhappy with the way the romantic elements in the novel developed. They struck me as quite implausible. Finally, I very much did not like the ending of the novel. Unfortunately, I cannot here go into my reasons without giving away too much of the plot. Suffice it to say that I am not certain that I would want to live in the world that the novel apparently endorses in its ending.I will add that one character is one of my favorites in all of sci-fi, the wonderfully eccentric, amazing enigmatic Underhill. Williamson does a great job in Underhill of producing a character who is simultaneously marvelously innocent and suspiciously sinister at the same time. After I finished the book, his character remained far more vivid in my memory than any of the others."},{"Title":"The Humanoids","review":"Jack Williamson had the longest career of any writer in the history of Science Fiction; he published his first story in 1927 and his last novel in 2005. This novel is one of the highlights of his career, and a true classic of the genre.I have little to add to the numerous favorable reviews already posted of this book. But it is important to note what is, and what isn't, in this Kindle edition.Williamson dealt with the Humanoids in two works-- a 1947 novelette in Astounding called \\"With Folded Hands,\\" and a 1948 novel, originally serialized in Astounding under the title \\"And Searching Mind,\\" later published in book form as \\"The Humanoids.\\" Still later, the two works were published as one book, again under the title of \\"The Humanoids.\\"This Kindle e-book includes ONLY the 1948 novel; \\"With Folded Hands\\" is NOT here.The 1948 novel holds up very well on its own; you don't need the earlier novelette to undestand it. But if you want both pieces of the saga, you will have to go for the old-fashioned book form:The Humanoids: A Novel, because \\"With Folded Hands\\" does not seem to be currently available for the Kindle."},{"Title":"The Humanoids","review":"This not just a story about some humanoid robots taking over the world/universe, Jack tries to answer the question, \\"Has technology made the world a fundamentally better place to live?\\". In THE HUMANOIDS, once again a scientific discovery is misused by technology to develop a super-weapon, a bomb capable of turning all matter within a preset radius, directly into energy. So despite advances in technology, the world was preparing to repeat the age-old cycle of rise and ruin along with their enemies, only this time there is a difference: the humanoids offer to create a benevolent despotism and to \\"serve and obey and save men from harm\\", although not necessarily in that order. They are voted in but the Old School people find they don't like the thought of giving up all control and they wind up getting drugged in order to keep them safe and happy.THE HUMANOIDS is about one of those people, Dr Forester, trying to escape and avoid becoming a victim to the humanoids \\"smother you with kindness\\" strategy. Forester learns that the only way he can do that is through \\"psychophysical\\" or paranormal powers of the mind, something the humanoids do not have...yet. So Dr Forester learns the scientific basis behind teleportation, telurgy, and clairvoyance and attempts to use his new found powers to destroy the humanoids. Dr Forester fails for two reasons, (1) he does not have the mental poise or peace to commit such a crime because (2) psychophysical energy requires mental poise and peace in order to use it since it is the basic creative force of the universe and cannot be used to destroy other people. Once again, a new technology rises up and is misused to try and ruin the world, answering the question if technology can make the world a fundamentally better place and the answer is \\"Hell no!\\". The basic problem isn't with technology, but with humans. The dark side of humans is too much for them to overcome, even with the most advanced technology.The point that Jack Williamson is making then is that humans, by themselves, will never be able to stop themselves from ruining the world, and the only way humans will ever eliminate their dark side is to replace it with a better side -- and neither thing can ever take place without it being forced onto us by an outside party that has no dark side to begin with."},{"Title":"The Humanoids","review":"Williamson was a late arrival to the Golden Age, although he had written many pieces prior to this book of 1948. He still managed to complement it perfectly with this book. It is loaded with ideas, action and suspense. It is also written in a rather bland style, with wooden characters, as was typical of that time (with few exceptions). It's a tough task to try to evaluate it by today's standards, but at the time it must have seemed fresh with fantastic speculations mixed with some current science and ideas. It's a story about a grand struggle of man versus machine. The machine here is \\"humanoid\\", and the question contemplated is whether the humanoids are sinister, or if they are even capable of good or evil intentions. \\"Cybernetics\\" is a term used in the story, and that was a fresh term for sure when this was written. First used in a science context by the mathematician Norbert Wiener in 1947, it is explored here in terms of the humanoid and its crudely developed \\"intelligence\\" against the pitfalls of human intelligence.The book explores cybernetics as it tells the story of mechanical and biological control and communications between humans and humanoids. They struggle to exist together within the constraints of each being's ability to act, understand and communicate. Are the humanoids plotting control of the human race, or are they simply acting upon rigid but poorly designed instructions from their human designer? It's an interesting question that keeps the reader guessing about their true nature and intentions, if they have any. The human response provides the struggle and the suspense, as a few suspicious people desperately try to save humanity and what it is to be human, despite the promising temptations that the humanoids seem to offer. The themes here were often repeated in subsequent decades. Are machines potentially dangerous? Can they learn ambition? Or are they limited to the role of human tools, with imagined qualities reflecting their human creators? There are references in these reviews to the dark ending. It is unsettling from a human point of view. To the humanoids, a case is made that it may be just another day at the office. The office door, of course, contains only one name. That of the human CEO. This is a book of ideas, and it deserves the status of the Golden Age, with all its newly discovered flowering ideas in the untended science fiction garden. Weeds did of course grow, but not for awhile."},{"Title":"The Humanoids","review":"The late 1940s was a period of remarkable creativity for future sci-fi Grand Master Jack Williamson. July '47 saw the release of his much-acclaimed short story \\"With Folded Hands\\" in the pages of \\"Astounding Science-Fiction,\\" followed by the tale's two-part serialized sequel, \\"And Searching Mind,\\" in that influential magazine's March and April 1948 issues. \\"Darker Than You Think,\\" Williamson's great sci-fi/fantasy/horror hybrid, was released later in 1948, and 1949 saw the publication of \\"And Searching Mind\\" in hardcover form, and retitled \\"The Humanoids.\\" \\"With Folded Hands\\" had been a perfect(ly downbeat) short story that introduced us to the Humanoids, sleek black robots invented by a technician named Sledge on planet Wing IV. The robots' built-in Prime Directive (hmmm...why does that phrase seem so familiar?) is \\"To Serve and Obey, And Guard Men From Harm.\\" Unfortunately, this leaves mankind with very little to do, as the mechanicals prevent humans from participating in anything that might be potentially dangerous; in other words, just about everything! Sledge's efforts to wipe out the master brain on Wing IV that is controlling the billions of self-replicating mechanicals are, sadly, fruitless, which sets us up for the action in \\"The Humanoids.\\"Flash forward 90 years. (Actually, this novel takes place a good 6,000 years from our present day, the reader infers.) On an unnamed planet, a physicist named Forester, head of a secret government project that is constructing a prototype \\"rhodomagnetic\\" bomb, comes to realize that the newly arrived Humanoids on his world are a bane, not a boon, to mankind. This realization is strengthened when the robots give his wife the brain-wiping drug known as euphoride to keep her happy, and when his beloved pet project is dismantled by the Humanoids as being too dangerous for men to engage in. Forester joins a band of \\"paraphysical\\" misfits--gifted with the powers of clairvoyance, telekinesis, telepathy and teleportation--to fight the Humanoids and alter their Prime Directive by going to the distant world of Wing IV itself. Readers expecting a traditional humans vs. ray-zapping evil robots story (such as Williamson's 1939 novel \\"After World's End\\") may be surprised to learn that this engrossing tale is anything but. The robots here are not at all presented as evil; if anything, they are guilty of killing mankind's spirit with too much kindness, and their benevolence is ultimately a mixed blessing at best. In the book's ambivalently downbeat ending, a case is made for the Humanoids' positive aspects (by Sledge himself, here, for some reason, renamed Warren Mansfield) that is almost a convincing one. Depending on the reader's outlook, I suppose a society in which the individual is free to do nothing but laze, paint, think and play (no sports, though; too dangerous, say the Humanoids!) could be regarded as a paradise or a hell. \\"The Humanoids,\\" besides offering those convincing (?) sociological arguments, also gives us some impressive pseudoscience to explain the very nature of reality, extrasensory abilities and the binding forces that hold nature together. \\"Rhodomagnetism\\" is a made-up word that Williamson uses often to describe a source of energy based on a different triad of elements than electromagnetism, and before things are done, Forester comes up with a group of equations involving \\"platinomagnetism\\" that allows its possessor to gain various \\"paramechanical\\" abilities. This use of arcane scientific equations to cause changes in the power of the mind was very reminiscent, for this reader, of Henry Kuttner's classic short novel from 1946, \\"The Fairy Chessmen\\"; as in that earlier tale, \\"The Humanoids\\" grows increasingly \\"way out\\" as it progresses. It is a finely written, suspenseful, action-packed yarn that is at the same time chock-full of interesting scientific speculations. It has been called Williamson's \\"greatest science fiction novel,\\" and while I cannot claim to have read more than 1/10 of the author's nearly 80-year output (!), the greatness of the novel is hard to deny. I would never dream of revealing whether or not Forester & Co. are successful in their efforts against the Humanoids, but can report that the author did come out with a very belated sequel, \\"The Humanoid Touch,\\" in 1980. Say no more, right?"},{"Title":"The Humanoids","review":"Science fiction has always strived to reveal something about human nature, and this disturbing book achieves this goal like no other. It casts a new light upon what it is people really want, and what happiness really means; it makes one question some of one's deep values and beliefs. Quite some time after this book a sequel was published, &quot;The Humanoid Touch&quot;. It is just as disturbing, partially because having read the first novel, I think the point of view of the author, or perhaps better, the 'implied author' has changed. This in no way decreases the value of the books, which are a must for any sci-fi reader."},{"Title":"The Humanoids","review":"Jack Williamson was one of the guiding lights of science fiction during the \\"golden age\\". His writing is always excellent. That said, this has to be one of his greatest achievements ever. It's dark, hopeless and tragic, but still filled with the possible triumph of the human spirit. The main story, \\"With Folded Hands\\", though, is one of the most touching pieces of writing I've ever read. Please, I beg of you, read this book. It is one of the greats."},{"Title":"The Humanoids","review":"This book made me think. That's the first positive. It's also well-paced. That's the second positive. The ending took me by surprise and was totally acceptable. That's the third positive.But the fourth positive is really what made me love this book... Some may laugh at me for writing this, but this author seems to have described &quot;the force&quot; in scientific terms waaaayy back in the forties. In fact, it's a better explanation than even Lucas' &quot;Midichlorides&quot; or whatever they were in 'Episode I'. I have to think that George Lucas read this book before writing &quot;Star Wars&quot;.Anyway... The author seems to have created fictitious sciences that actually make sense. I'm not a scientist, so that's probably why it worked for me. I almost felt like the answer to the universe was in this book... even though 2 of the 3 sciences don't really exist.As for the ending, I though it was great. It was the only way the story would have made any sense. If the OPPOSITE of the ending had happened, the story would have been as pointless as most action movies. Contrary to another reviewer's dislike of the world at the end of the book, I thought it was actually a desirable place to be. I think that reviewer misunderstood what was goin on at the end.I had to force myself to put the book down. It was that good. really quick, to the point, nothing to bog the story down. Just the events that needed to be there.A very quick read. You have no reason not to try it."},{"Title":"The Humanoids","review":"Forty or so years after The Humanoids was written, one might be excused for proclaiming its author as prescient. We Earthlings welcome them at first, for they do all the grotty little jobs we don't like to do; they help with almost obsequious servitude; they are there to protect and to serve - their motto, indeed, 'To serve and protect, and keep men from harm' might be the motto of the modern, omnipresent and omnicompetent government. And, like that government, they take away one freedom after another, until...well, you must read the book to find out.

It's not about who is collectively right or wrong but the conviction, passion and integrity of the individual characters. I enjoy the historical accuracy and, of course, the romantic plot. Mandy is zealous about her beliefs as is eric toward the opposition which makes for a political, marital nightmare! I do like the characters here. Amanda is sassy and defensive. But we can forgive her since she has a wicked, abusive father who fills her with rejection and low self esteem. Her ideals may be flawed but at least she is passionate about them. I really sympathized with her dilemma (black mailed by her father for her cousins life) but was frustrated that she would not confide in her husband. Amanda does; however, mature greatly throughout the book. I loved Eric. He is dignified yet indignant, righteously, of course. It is sad that he can't trust his wife but you can't blame him, he struggles painfully between loyalty to his cause and loyalty to his wife. He manages to stay devoted to both. It is very climactic and has a couple of great twists in it."},{"Title":"Love Not a Rebel","review":"I love this book!!! I really enjoy historical romances and this one is set during the Revolutionary War. You can really feel for the characters as they are in conflict over their beliefs.This is my favorite book from Heather Graham and one of my all-time favorites. It is the last of the North American Woman trilogy so be sure to check out Sweet Savage Eden (number 1) and A Pirate's Pleasure (number 2). If you want to continue to follow the Cameron legacy, check out Graham's Civil War trilogy: One Wore Blue, And One Wore Gray, And One Rode West. Not to be confused with her Florida based Civil War series starring the MacKenzie family."},{"Title":"Love Not a Rebel","review":"They called her &quot;Highness&quot;. Ravishing Lady Amanda Sterling, forced to spy on Lord Eric Cameron by the lord governor of Virginia and her evil, ambitious father! She'd detested Eric Cameron on sight. He was a traitor to King and country. Yet she'd been sent to steal his heart, his soul, and his secret plans for the revolution. And now she was his wife, swept into marriage with a man who would sear her with the hellfire of his desire, and make her his prisoner of love. Lord Eric Cameron turned his back on his family's estates in England to embrace the patriot's cause. He did it quietly-before the fateful shots at Lexington and Concord rang out and his true allegiance became clear by cannon and by sword. But Eric also fought another war-with the glorious Amanda Sterling, the beauty he had married, knowing he could never trust her...but never let her go. Amanda, the woman he had vowed to conquer, the spy he would never surrender, even at the risk of his own life. Loved it. The whole North American Woman series was wonderful."},{"Title":"Love Not a Rebel","review":"This book has passion and depth. Both characters were sympathetic and well-fleshed out. I highly recommend this series over all. I was a little disappointed and angry when it seemed the main male character might be cheating on Amanda. Heather does this as a twist in many books, and while I know it makes for good plot devise (yes, I confess it does keep me turning pages), it makes for an overall weakening in the believability of their true love. It makes the female character seem a little weak and naive when she falls into bed with him, and leaves the reader saying, \\"Yeah, I don't believe you Heather, I'll just bet he didn't...\\" Still, I give this one four stars. I couldn't put it down. The history was well-presented, and the characters compelling and well-developed."},{"Title":"Love Not a Rebel","review":"I WAS SO HAPPY WHEN I COULD ADD THIS BOOK TO MY KINDLE COLLECTION. THE REVOLUTIONARY WAR COMES TO LIFE IN THESE PAGES AS WELL AS ERIC & AMANDA'S LOVE AFFAIR, CONFLICTED BECAUSE THEY ARE AT OPPOSITE SIDES OF THE WAR, BUT STILL IN LOVE"},{"Title":"Love Not a Rebel","review":"This is the 3rd in the North American Woman trilogy, which is a part of the Cameron Saga series (see list below)--and it is one you will really enjoy. I loved this trilogy and highly recommend it.The story begins in Boston in 1773 when Lord Eric Cameron, a Virginian with estates in England and a descendent of the Camerons whose stories are told in the first two books, meets and falls in love with the beautiful and tempestuous Lady Amanda Sterling who is only 17. Lady Amanda, a loyalist, is in love with dashing Lord Robert Tarryton but he wants a title and is willing to marry a duchess he does not love to get it. While Amanda is expecting a proposal from Lord Tarryton, she learns of his betrothal to the duchess and is heartbroken. Tarryton would take her as his mistress which shocks her and she spurns him for it. Meanwhile, Eric has spoken to her father about marrying her and her father has given his consent. To get away from her father who is brutally cruel to her, and to flee her only other prospect, Amanda consents to wed Eric. While she does not love him, she is inexplicably drawn to the handsome, virile man. But Eric is fast becoming an American patriot. He is a friend of George Washington and Patrick Henry, and he values liberty and is willing to risk all to keep it. (I love how Graham wove history into the story with real characters.) Amanda is forced by her father (who holds her cousin Damien hostage) to spy on her husband and the actions of the patriots. Eric suspects this and though he has fallen in love with her, he does not trust her and feeds her false information. They are passionate in their lovemaking and each loves the other but will say nothing for fear of giving the other power. George Washington believes Amanda may be \\"the Highness,\\" the spy who is hurting the rebel cause. Eric believes it, too.Swept up in the tides of history, we discover that love still matters, treachery can come from those closest to us, and truth is hard to find. If you love American history and the Revolutionary War period, and if you love truly great historical romance, you'll love this one. Heather Graham's action does not disappoint. I really loved the way she showed us how the \\"lords\\" of England became the ordinary--or rather, extraordinary--men of America with no titles but with great courage and a great legacy.Here's the Cameron Saga:The North American Women trilogy: Sweet Savage Eden, A Pirate's Pleasure and Love Not a RebelThe Camerons in Civil War trilogy: One Wore Blue, And One Wore Gray, And One Rode West"},{"Title":"Love Not a Rebel","review":"I thought it was really cool (and really very smart) to base a boddice ripper on and around the \\"Boston Tea Party\\" era. Mrs. Graham must have done some major research for this one. She included real life heros and gave real personalities to people like George Washington, Martha Washington, Ben Franklin and many many more. I'm not a history buff by any means so I can't say for certain if a lot or any of this was based on actual facts but from what I remember learning in school it seemed right on.I really enjoyed Lord Eric Cameron and Lady Amanda Sterling...it was from the beginning a love hate relationship. I will say though there were a ton of facts facts facts...and at some points you may find yourself skimming, but overall this was a wonderful love story and very educational too!I do have to point out the cover though...OMG it's so bad!Really...don't judge this book by the cover!"},{"Title":"Love Not a Rebel","review":"This book was wonderfully delightful. Heather Graham gives you an insight of the American Revolution through her characters. I definately recommend this book!"},{"Title":"PROTEINS & PROTEOMICS","review":"This is a outstanding book, covering all aspects of sample preparation and experimental techniques involved in protein and peptide analysis by gels, liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. Each chapter gives detailed protocols complete with tips, reagent lists, short tutorials (printed in blue colored information panels) and references. The protocols will work for you just as they are written and will give you a place to start in customizing and adapting them to your own circumstances (and you certainly will do that!). As with any fast moving field an updated second edition will be welcome around 2006, but by then, I'll be happy to replace my dog-eared copy for a fresh one (or maybe not, I don't really think a book as good as this will ever be obsolete). I recommend you buy the paperback edition, it will serve you well and save you some $$$."},{"Title":"Mars","review":"Even though this book is a bit dated, since it was written in 1987 before the recent Mars Pathfinder and Mars Global Surveyor missions were even dreamed of, it does contain a lot of interesting information and photographs about the Planet Mars and the Viking Project. If readers are looking for more recent material about the planet Mars, Seymour Simon, has written a new book in 2000 titled Destination Mars. It's basically an updated version of the current book. Finally, while this book is geared towards children, I feel that many adults will find the text and the photographs quite interesting."},{"Title":"Combat: Pacific Theater-World War II","review":"This book is loaded with stories told by men who fought in World War Two. The book includes accounts of events such as the sinking of the Bismarck, the battle of El Alamein in Africa, and accounts of the beachhead assault and the airborne drops of Normandy. Great read for World War Two buffs."},{"Title":"Hard Laughter","review":"I could not believe some of the negative reviews I read about this book. I normally never write reviews but I had to put in my two cents to counter the negativity. I do believe that this book is not for everyone, but for me, it resonates with such truth and clarity that it makes me smile every time I think of a passage. True, there is less in the way of plots than most books, but the plot that exists is very similar to real life, and the characters are like my own family. It is witty and well-timed, and gives those of us who sometimes question our sanity an answer: yes, there are others out there like you. The main character, Jen, copes with her father's illness in a very real and human way. All too often characters in books that are faced with a life altering situation such as a father's cancer face it in ways you can never imagine yourself doing: being full of grace, honorable, constantly patient. Jen faces it just the way I would: full of terror, trying to maintain a normal life in the meantime, and with as much humor as she can muster. It is a beautiful story, and I wish I could be friends with the characters. The verses are as comforting to me as a bible is to a devoutly religious person. It reminds me of the good things in life \\"love, laughter, sex, music and avocados\\", as one of the characters writes. The sweet, funny interactions between the family members remind me of my own family and give me the urge to call them. The anecdotes seem like something out of my own life, but told with a great deal more humor and perfect timing. I cannot recommend this book enough. It was moving and fun and I re-read it at least once every couple of months. Definitely the best of Anne Lamott's so far. I encourage everyone to read it!"},{"Title":"Hard Laughter","review":"I chose this Anne Lamott novel based on the fact it had the most favorable customer reviews here at Amazon of her novels. I am a big fan of &quot;Bird by Bird&quot; and had very high expectations. I was very annoyed by this book and wish I had not ignored the one unfavorable review. The characters all sounded like Lamott herself and many of the witticisms came off as just sounding as if she was trying to be clever. Pointless reading unless you just happen to be from a perfectly functional family that is dealing with cancer! I can deal with the lack of plot but a total lack of conflict, or one single compelling character is just plain boring."},{"Title":"Hard Laughter","review":"Having come upon and enjoyed thoroughly, BIRD BY BIRD by Anne Lamott, I was anxious to read another book by this author. My research started with and probably will end with HARD LAUGHTER. Judging by the other Amazon reviews of this book I am one of five who not only didn't like it but would have stopped reading it after the first chapter if I was not dedicated to finishing any book I begin. First of all, in my opinion, to support a novel without a story line, a book has to have exceptional prose and great characters.This book had neither. I thought if these people opened another beer, I'll scream. Moreover, Jennifer's relationships in addition to being pathetic were sophomoric, and the descriptions of sex, dreams, food, sex, family members told me more than I ever wanted to know about any of them. I suppose they were a loving family with deep alcoholic ties but unfortunately if there was humor, it was lost on me. What I missed most, in this book was the charm I found in in BIRD BY BIRD. For me, the laughter was indeed hard to come by. I'm writing this not to be cruel, but because I think if someone looks up the comments as I did, it might be good to read a dissenting opinion."},{"Title":"Hard Laughter","review":"I liked Anne's later books better than this one. Although I appreciate the depth of vulnerability she reveals, the lead character is a little too dark and twisty in this, which is kind of ironic given the title."},{"Title":"Hard Laughter","review":"This is the third Lamott book I have read, and I can't get enough. I laughed and cried and really related to her family even though my family members are non-drinkers. This book made me understand the struggle with drugs she was going through in &quot;Instructions.&quot; I think she is one of the funniest writers I know, and I can't wait to read the next Lamott book on my list."},{"Title":"Hard Laughter","review":"This reprint of Lamott's 1979 thinly disguised memoir (actually a novel in the first-person point of view) has little in the way of a traditional plot, and many characters barely have cameo appearances. As I read it, I kept thinking how her writing has grown up in the past 30-some years. If you've read her more recent works, you'll recognize the tennis references and the humor. However, do realize \\"Hard Laughter\\" is set in (and written in) the Marin County of the late 1970s, a vastly different place than it is today (some would argue); the signs of those times thread throughout this novel, which is both nostalgic and instructional. If you don't have the patience for this re-issued work, then stick with Lamott's later novels."},{"Title":"Hard Laughter","review":"Ok...so Lamott's approach might be a little \\"random\\" here, but I value her candid honesty. Most of us would never get that transparent and reflective about our most important relationships and how what happens in them shapes our lives - not only because of them, but in spite of them. I appreciate how this author lets us see, through her gifted prose, how she thinks and evolves from this very first write to her very latest. She was a disaster waiting to happen, but has much to teach us (further evidenced in her subsequent books) about a God who is there, is not silent, and works with us right where we really live. Her wacky poignant out-of-the-box humor filters for us the tough stuff of real life so we too might look at it more thoughtfully - or so that we might be able to look at it at all.\\""},{"Title":"Hard Laughter","review":"I'll admit, I'm a huge Anne Lamott fan, but this was the only book of hers that I hadn't read until now (I know, I'm about 20 years late). But I wasn't let down, even though it was her first published novel.I've had my share of family medical scares, including one of my own, and it was amazing at how dead-on Anne illustrates the emotions that people go through in times of crisis. My family is similar to the one in the book, in that we truly exercise the \\"laughter is the best medicine\\" mantra. But sometimes you just can't laugh at the face of a horrible disease like cancer ... and sometimes you have to just to survive. That's what this book is all about.Some people might read this and think, \\"What was the point?\\" I read it and thought, \\"Wow. Anne just gets human emotion and writes about it superbly.\\" This book is basically a commentary about life and death, why bad things happen to good people, etc., told through stories about the family in the book, and it's very autobiographical.It's not my favorite Lamott book, but it's definitely at the top of the list."},{"Title":"Hard Laughter","review":"I had missed reading this book by Lamott for some reason and when I saw it on the front cover of her new book ordered it to catch up. I am so glad I did as the insights are so fun and even though the material is heavy and my life is \\"heavy\\" right now...I find a smile on my face and some laugh outloud moments....I am so glad I ordered the book and dove right into it's story."},{"Title":"Hard Laughter","review":"This novel is blatantly autobiographical, there isn't much of a story, it sometimes reads like a series of sketches or short stories, there is no real ending, it is sometimes annoying, it is full of \\"funny\\" drugs and alcohol which is not terribly funny if you know Lamott had a serious alcohol problem, etc. And yet! Yet I enjoyed reading it for its liveliness, humour, good lines, etc. I wasn't even tempted not to finish it. But Bird by Bird is superb so I recommend any reader start with that."},{"Title":"Hard Laughter","review":"I had never read any of Anne Lamott's other books--and in &lt;head bowed&gt; complete ignorance I had never even heard of her. But I LOVED this book! She made Jen (the main character) so real and I wished Jen had lived next door to me---except her scream therapy wouldnt have been so fun...&lt;laughs&gt;. I couldnt believe what other peoples reviews were saying (about not liking Hard Laughter)--I guess to each his or her own. Well I can say *I* enjoyed it very much-finished it in two days and cant wait to get my hands on Anne's other books."},{"Title":"Hard Laughter","review":"Great light reading for late at night. Some good gems, examples; \\"I knew by 10 years old that life would be happier if only I were quite stupid and devoutly religious..\\" or, \\"Happy work is as gratifying as sex or hard laughter or love or good drugs.\\" Or about boys, \\"I wonder if they will grow up to be adult males who are led by their penises and wallets, or if, at thirty, they will visit sad friends.\\" And, \\"Your looks start to go about the time you start growing up, about the time things are starting to gel..\\""},{"Title":"Hard Laughter","review":"This novel closely resembles her own growing up years. I enjoyed it but not as much as her non-fiction books, all of which I have read at least once. She has great insight and can make the deep end of the pool hilarious with her self deprecating humor and her own brand of spirituality."},{"Title":"Hard Laughter","review":"I definitely do not like this book near as much as Traveling Mercies that she wrote at a later date (when her son was a child). I loved that book and laughed and cried throughout. This book is just a little on the boring side, for me anyway. I don't like to give up on books but I have so many other great books sitting on my shelf waiting to be read and time is passing by! I lost my father to cancer 12 years ago. I don't think anything new under the sun is being revealed here as to familys' reactions to loved ones getting cancer. I think we all go through a whole range of emotions when a loved one gets sick and I just don't find this book that new or revealing of anything new in that regard. I do get a little tired of all the references to the drugs and drinking too - I graduated high school in 1973 and I'm aware that that was the culture back in the 70's but it gets a bit old - not everyone back then was a druggie or drunk. All of this being said, I think Anne Lamotte is a very good writer and I loved loved loved Traveling Mercies. Hard Laughter just didn't do it for me."},{"Title":"Hard Laughter","review":"I am a FAN of Anne LeMott-- so I guess that makes me a little biased about her work; but she is one of the best writers that I have ever read! This book was about her and her family dealing with her father's brain tumor. She skillfully delivers the thoughts, feelings, and reactions from each of her family members."},{"Title":"Hard Laughter","review":"The book is a hoot and a hollar. It's good reading, better writing. Her characters, from Megan to Kathleen, Randy to Wallace to Michael, literally rise from the page. Some lines are definite winners: &quot;you can shave my head, but leave the bunny alone,&quot; and her comments on friendships and families never miss the mark. My only other observation is that her mind musings tend to grow wordy and a bit tedious, as if this were more of an experimental book."},{"Title":"Hard Laughter","review":"This book is heart-breaking and hilarious at the same time. I gave copies to all of my friends, and underlined whole paragraphs at a time. I remain convinced that no other writer can capture the lunacies of our lives the way Anne Lamott can. She says all the things I mean to say, but can't articulate."},{"Title":"Hard Laughter","review":"Maybe it's too much to expect that every Annie Lamott book be great - but this one's a real disappointment. Annie tries to handle the impossible: the life-threatening illness of a beloved father who'd never had any medical problems prior to diagnosis within an addictive family - but the storyline wanders, the characters get fuzzy and in the end we're left with treacly soap-opera garbage that doesn't ring true. Her other books have MUCH more to offer, fortunately."},{"Title":"Hard Laughter","review":"lamott has once again translated potential tragedy into a spiritual experoence that defies the mere flesh. there is so much to love about this book; my favorite line is where someone is criticizing the teenage lamott for being thin and her father says, &quot;yes. like a gazelle.&quot; it's hard not to connect with a book that magically transforms cancer into an abundance of wry love and growth, wihtout exploiting the maudlin aspects of disease into a kind of psychobabble pulp-- no, she adroitly and honestly represents familial love and reality during crisis in a way that touches all who have watched a loved one, or parent, suffer the cruel and senseless blows of a degenerative disease. As always I find her styling and characters superb in their authenticity; she once again demonstrates an unerring voice for dialogue and transmits emotion into a funny, moving account. this is a wonderful book and a great gift to her father. it's difficult to believe this was her first novel, and the rave reviews she received for this brave effort are well deserved....if you liked any of her previous books, I guarantee this will not be a disappointment, but rather a joyous discovery......"},{"Title":"Hard Laughter","review":"The first 2 pages of the story were missing and a clump of more pages fell out when I first opened the book. Does not use recyclable packaging."},{"Title":"Hard Laughter","review":"Reading one of Anne Lamott's novels is like taking a refreshing cool bath on the hottest day of the year; it quenches the soul. Additionally, her wonderfully gritty voice resonates from the pages. The story of a family's struggle to keep the happiness going through the most poignant and disarming moments of their lives is insightful, touching and memorable. Hilarious and poignant as ever, Lamott again illustrates how her characters make everything difficult seem worth undertaking. All in all, a wonderful and illuminating read..."},{"Title":"Hard Laughter","review":"I stumbled onto Anne Lamott while grocery shopping. Marginally coping with a new baby and a three year old I picked up &quot;Operating Instructions-A Journal of My Son's First Year&quot; and threw it into my cart. It quickly became my book of &quot;daily affirmations&quot; for the less than perfect parent. With hopeful anticipation I searched for more of her writing and found &quot;Hard Laughter&quot;. I wasn't disappointed. The characters came alive and I realized the author was writing about her own family. These were the same voices I had grown to like so much in her journal. Once again her imperfect, humorous, messy, love-filled life lifted my spirits. I laughed even as I read of her father's diagnosis and treatment of brain cancer. The only disappointment was that it ended too soon and I had to leave the characters I felt I knew so well. I can't wait for more Lamott"},{"Title":"Hard Laughter","review":"Laughter can be forced or cheap or light - and then there are the moments when the laughter is best, usually because there is some equal pressure not to laugh, some pain that is so close it hurts to laugh, but you must anyway. Anne Lamott wrote, what is for me, an exquisite book about an unspeakable time in life - when a parent becomes gravely ill.I believe in these characters - precisely because they aren't predictable or tidy. They have big gaps in their development, like most people do. They fall apart and put themselves back together in unexpected, astonishing ways. Each one survives in spite of and because of their love of one another.It is a book of unusual relationships during the days of an extraordinary time. Lamott introduces each character and their actions with a generous spirit. The reader by turns loves, understands, is appalled by, then forgives and loves again each of them.I hated to leave them when the book was over. I wanted to have a beer with them, to take a walk on the beach with them, to laugh with them long and hard at how much life hurts sometimes - and how grand it is to be alive.I recommend this book to anyone who knows the pain and joy of loving extraordinary people. If you want a large-hearted soul to spend time with, read Anne Lamott's &quot;Hard Laughter&quot; - you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Hard Laughter","review":"How could anyone not love this book (and the author)?!? Never have I read such a brutally honest account of ones life. Anne Lamott's writing is so refreshly sincere. All believers in Christ should rally around Ms. Lamott and encourage her to continue to bare her naked soul to the rest of the world. I read reviews that said she was irreverent, which if you read with a closed mind you may find this to be so, but I found her to be a REAL person, who realizes she is simply saved by God's grace and by nothing she's done on her on. I would encourage everyone to read this book, with and open mind and heart, and check your judgemental mind at the door. Keep it up Anne!"},{"Title":"Hard Laughter","review":"This book handles some difficult territory as only Anne Lamott could. She can be brutally honest and hilarious all at the same time. That she could bring that quality to the nightmarish experience of watching a loved one battle cancer -- something all too many of us know about firsthand -- sets this book apart. One of the previous reviewers found this book &quot;distasteful.&quot; Well, there is nothing tasteful about cancer and the way it shatters one's way of life. I know of no other book that touches on the confusion and the anguish and the humanity of that experience like this one does. This is very worthwhile reading."},{"Title":"Hard Laughter","review":"With a father recently diagnosed with a brain tumor, a significant other who is hardly significant, and a neurotic dream consultant for a best friend, it seems hard to believe that Jennifer, the main character of Anne Lamott's book, could find anything to laugh about. And yet, as the title suggests, she not only finds some hard laughter in the situation, but also realizes that laughter is, in fact, one of the things that makes life worth the struggle. Whether or not you're of a mind to appreciate Lamott's neurotic humor, that realization--the preciousness and beauty of laughter in the face of the darkest times--alone makes this book worth reading. True to the terrible mundacity of tragic life events, Lamott's book subtly and deftly captures the experience of a family's brush with a potentially devastating situation--the waiting, the disappointment, the embarassment--the laughter in hard times and the good hard laughter in spite of those times that carries you through."},{"Title":"Hard Laughter","review":"In this funny and inspiring story Anne Lamott shows us the importance of good friends, close family, and hard laughter. Through the characters' struggles with relationships, careers, and death, we discover the true strength of the human heart: the ability to find beauty in, and endure through, rough times. An important lesson in life and love, highlighted by laugh-out-loud funny lines, make this book memorable and worth experiencing."},{"Title":"Hard Laughter","review":"How anyone could find this book distasteful is a mystery; it's a poignant elegy for the author's father, so I suppose there are some who would object to that. of course they would also object to rescuing a bag of kittens from a lake, probably. I for one adored HARD LAUGHTER, its deft handling of the subject of cancer, written at a time when cancer was not discussed in such terms, was still the boogy man under the hospital bed. so many interesting moments, so many warm passages of love and devotion. this book made me feel. this is all I ask."},{"Title":"Hard Laughter","review":"I came to this book after reading Lamott's wonderful non-fiction book Bird by Bird. &quot;Hard Laughter&quot; is one of the best books I've read in the last twelve months. Full of warm honesty, wisdom and humour, Lamott's portrayal of family made me laugh, but more importantly, it made me remember what it was like growing up. Lamott's characters breath - I loved discovering them and by the novels end, I wanted to meet them in the real world. I look forward to reading Lamott for the rest of my life."},{"Title":"Hard Laughter","review":"I read &quot;Hard Laughter&quot; eagerly because I loved &quot;Operating Instructions&quot; so much. I was a bit disappointed. I didn't find it quite as funny, and I love Anne Lamott mostly for her humor (I've also heard her a couple of times on the radio and she was hysterical).It was interesting, however, to go back and thumb through &quot;Operating Instructions,&quot; which she wrote much later, after having been through rehab, a religious epiphany, the death of her father and the birth of her son. I think that her writing has benefitted greatly from her life experiences. It was also a bit difficult reading &quot;Hard Laughter,&quot; with all of the drugs and alcohol, and knowing (from having read &quot;Operating Instructions&quot;) that she had a serious problem. It brings a sadness to the book that was not intended (i.e. not the sadness about her father's illness).All in all though, a mediocre Anne Lamott is a first-rate anyone else!"},{"Title":"Hard Laughter","review":"This story should be poignant, as it deals with the death of a loved one. Unfortunately, it is just annoying. I didn't chuckle once while reading it. The writing was lackluster and reminded me of \\"Joe Jones,\\" another of Lamott's early novels. Truly forgettable. Skip this turkey."},{"Title":"Hard Laughter","review":"I heard the author interviewed on NPR and thought I would try a couple of her books. She talks my style, but her writing is way to crude for me. I have standards, morals, and intelligence way above the characters and don't prefer to read books with gutter language. Never read past the first chapter, threw it in the trash."},{"Title":"Hard Laughter","review":"I have read 3 of Anne Lamott's books and was profoundly discouraged with this writing. Although I wanted so much to get to know the characters and enter in to their life, I couldn't get past their lack of nobility and/or dignity with the way they chose to live. And for a grown woman to have such a close relationship with a young girl in this novel? Totally inappropriate, especially in these fragile times.I work with college students and I want them to be inspired, championed, held accountable and victorious over the imperfection that life throws their way. I hated seeing life through the lens of this book; I don't know anyone like the characters in Hard Laughter in the 17 years I have worked in academia, and I hope I never do. It is one thing to write with raw authenticity that propels the reader to live with dignity, and something entirely different to read human mistake after human mistake after human mistake and never change the course of their trajectory. Very sad indeed."},{"Title":"Dead Cold","review":"Who is Mikki ? A charming talk show host who loves to charm the women also his a very handsome Greek.

The usual suspects were mentioned: Joyce, Svevo, Saba, Jan Morris.But Garrett was omitted. And I think the omission was an injustice--one of many that have been done Garrett--because his short novel \\"Which Ones Are the Enemy?\\" recounts the adventures of a young American soldier who is part of the forces occupying the limestone plateau above Trieste and along the \\"Jug\\" border. Garrett always tells a good story, but in this book he also recreates a largely forgotten occupation.Whatever, a fine novel, a fine evocation of Trieste and of youth. The other stories, some of them also set in Italy, are also excellent.

So something is lost in translation, or rather given over to the translator. In this instance the work of Dmitri is acceptable due to his reverential treatment of what his father could have meant, and to his meticulous study of each word's possible synonyms in both Russian and English."},{"Title":"The Enchanter","review":"Nabokov's Lolita spawns from this short book, and it is fascinating to see the thought process behind the masterpiece. The book is translated to English from Russian, so some of the story may be lost. The Enchanter is a bit disappointing after finishing Lolita. Lolita is full of word play, imagery, allusion, and poetic prose, so finding the Enchanter to be merely a story with not much artistry in the language is almost sad! The storyline consists of little complexity, and the work is void of the characterization that draws the reader into Lolita. The narrator has none of the charisma that the brilliant Humbert Humbert possesses, and comes across simply as a villain. Nabokov's concept of the nymphet that left the term \\"Lolita\\" forever in the English vocabulary does not appear either. The young girl's character isn't developed at all; instead the reader gets nothing more than physical descriptions. Nabokov didn't intend the Enchanter for publication at all, it is merely a sketch of an idea he later developed for everyone's eyes. This book is worth reading, but without any expectations that Lolita may cause the reader to have. Perhaps it is better to read the Enchanter before reading Lolita."},{"Title":"The Enchanter","review":"The Enchanter is clearly an exploratory piece of writing - it has a certain juvenile, rough feel that makes the reader certain that it is the beginning of an inquiry rather than the end. It would probably be most interesting to readers of 'Lolita' and 'Laughter in the Dark'."},{"Title":"The Enchanter","review":"If you didn't know, Lolita wasn't Nabokov's first and only book with an age-discrepant theme. The Enchanter was published in 1986, but the Russian manuscript was written in 1939 while the Nabokovs lived in Paris. It took so long to be translated and published, because Nabokov thought the manuscript had been destroyed until he found it while gathering material to be given to the Library of Congress. In the novella, the 40-year-old protagonist did everything within his power to be intimate with a 12-year-old nymphet he fell in love with after he saw her skating in the park.Even some of Nabokov's published poetry contained an ephebopilia theme. In \\"Lilith\\", which can be found in his Selected Poems (2012) he wrote:Shielding her face and to the sparking sun\\\\showing a russet armpit, in a doorway\\\\there stood a naked little girl.\\\\She had a water lily in her curls\\\\and was as graceful as a woman. Tenderly\\\\her nipples bloomed, and I recalled\\\\the springtime of my lifer on earth,\\\\when through the alders on the river brink\\\\so very closely I could watch the miller's youngest daughter as she stepped\\\\out of the water, and she was all golden,\\\\with a wet fleece between her legsKatie"},{"Title":"The Enchanter","review":"In many respects it is very similar to Nabokov's most famous novel 'Lolita', yet, in many respects it lacks all the wit and charm and appeal that makes Lolita so likeable. Its a bit more simple with the main character on the same path: to watch little girl's play. The voyeurism is a bit more offensive because of the faceless characters that are drawn, not mention the more distant point of view the reader is to take. Because it is a short story, The Enchanter is not out of the way, and worth a read for Nabokov lovers, but not for lovers of reading."},{"Title":"The Enchanter","review":"Nabakov is one of my literary icons. I view him as one of the masters of 20th century prose. That's why I wish I hadn't read this book. It is indeed a precursor to Lotlita, told from the point of view of a character much like Humbert Humbert, who has a distinct penchant for young, waifish girls. However, whereas Lolita is full of great wit, disarming wordplay and inventiveness, this novella borders on the prosaically pornographic. Most of the narrative is taken up with the lurid musings and imaginative follies of the old rake. As is the case in Lolita, he takes up with the mother to get closer to the daughter. And in this story too, the mother is conveniently removed from the picture, leaving our hero to bask in solitude with his young ward. Again, as in his great novel, Nabakov's narrator comes to a bad end. His nymphette wakes up while he is forcing himself on her and starts screaming bloody murder. The neighbors call the police and he's carted off to jail. Anyone who is familiar with Lolita is aware of the obscenity charges filed against it and of the difficulties surounding its initial US publication. However, Lolita, Like Joyce's Ulysses, is not obscene in any sense. It towers above its subject matter because it is great satirical literature, full of humor and grand spirit. This little book, on the other hand, becomes bogged down in its subject matter and comes very close to being pornographic. There is good reason it wasn't published until recently. It throws a new and perhaps unwarrentedly lurid light on its author's masterpiece. Nabakov's son issues a king of apologia for the work in a postscript. I read this book because I've tried to read all of Nabakov's works, both fiction and non-fiction. I would have to place this one at the bottom of the list. My reverence for a great author was diminished slightly by my exposure to this text. I'm surprised his estate did decide to publish it."},{"Title":"The Enchanter","review":"Like many posthumous works, this first attempt by Nabokov to portray nymphet-love is more interesting to understand the author than as a reading in itself.Here, the approach is blunter and in a way more shocking - unmitigated by the intellectual rigmaroles that veil the sexual content in &quot;Lolita&quot;. The book's plot, with its desperate escape, is a simplified version of the fantastic voyage of Humbert and Dolores. And &quot;The Enchanter&quot; also lacks the mild, educated satire of Middle America which has been a suitable alibi for many readers of the later book.In a way, &quot;The Enchanter&quot; is like a notebook sketch for &quot;Lolita&quot;. It has its basic elements of a story, but none of its richness of colour."},{"Title":"The Enchanter","review":"That insight, about introspection itself constituting the story, is made by Dmitri Nabokov in an essay appended to The Enchanter. As many have noted in so many words, \\"The Enchanter\\" lacks Humbert Humbert's appeal. Still, Nabokov permits us to see in the enchanter, perhaps more succintly than in Lolita, the introspective anxiety of an outwardly ordinary man driven mad by his single-minded obsession with an eternally adolescent female, at least eternal younth \\"was the carnal postulate.\\" He can neither ignore her as as an object of his desire, nor bring himself to rationalize adequately her hold on him. Indeed, he can empathize with her disgust as he envisions himself through her eyes, a \\"monstrosity, some ghastly disease.\\" The book's opening sentence, a question, signals the ordeal that is about to unfold, \\"How can I come to terms with myself?\\" And, the answer is that he cannot; he cannot gain the distance he needs from his moral framework. He is both sinner and judge; without control,insane and yet damned as a morally responsible soul."},{"Title":"The Enchanter","review":"After nearly completing my first year in Law School, I decided that I needed a break from case reading. Thankfully, Nabokov was there to provide a welcome respite from the tedium of my case books.The Enchanter is a short book, almost not worthy of publication independently, nevertheless it provided me with a brief repose of a perfect magnitude. In this short novella the protagonist is a proto-Humbert who is embryonic in almost every respect. We do not know his name, his history, profession, origin or the raison d'etre for his fatal obsession. For this reason the reader will find it harder to humanize the attrocious acts that he engages in. Similarly, the object of the unnamed protagonist's desire is no Lolita; rather then present us with the beguiling temptress, or the iconic nymphet of Nabokov's latter novel, we are left with a somewhat fungible, inchoate and forgettable young girl. The story follows a somewhat predictable path towards the eventual destruction (is it what he was seeking?) of the protagonist.There are a few reasons why this novella is worth four stars. First, the brief size of the novella allows the busy or casual reader a little taste of Nabokoviana without the conmesurate investment in time by the reader. Secondly, all of our favorate Nabokov traits are present to some extent in the text. The word play, the beautiful imagery, and the defectless prose-poem quality of his writing are given expression in the pages. Finally, the climax and denoument of the novella executed prefectly. Each scene inevitably leads to the next and appears to offer only one conclusion. The end of our anti-hero is satisfiyingly conveighed.In conclusion, the serious reader can (almost) never go wrong with Nabokov and The Enchanter does not disappoint. If you have a spare hour and desire some beautiful writing pick up this short volume."},{"Title":"The Enchanter","review":"Interesting book. Yes, this a precursor to Lolita but only in glimpses. The nameless girl did not have the edge of the later Lolita; the man did not have the dark comedic personality of Humbert Humbert. Also the writing style, for me, was somewhat indulgent, obtuse unlike the accessible prose of the novel. This story stayed with Nabokov for years, later \\"growing claws.\\" The incubation period was worth it. Another observation: a sleeping young girl appears to be fodder for many, i.e. Nabokov, Garcia Marquez."},{"Title":"The Enchanter","review":"Definitivamente, si un autor decide no publicar una obra en vida, sus herederos (por m&aacute;s dinero que quieran o necesiten, por m&aacute;s avaros que puedan ser) deber&iacute;an abstenerse de hacerlo.

Every sentence quivers with meaning, conveying a sinuous artistry that only the brevity of the piece seem to spoil and mar. Then again it may be the brevity of the piece that its perfection can't do without."},{"Title":"The Enchanter","review":"\\"The Enchanter\\" is an incredible example of what Nabokov can do in less than 100 pages. The book is a portrait of a pedophile, in his own words. Despite the fact that it is a translation, the genius of the original text is carefully preserved by his son, Dmitri's rendition into English. The prose is practically verse. The use of language is pure genius. And the device of using the deviant mind as the story teller is again, just another example of Nabokov's incredible creative ability.As noted in the afterword by Dmitri, the title of the book most usually translates to \\"The Magician\\" but apparently, Nabokov indicated that his intended English translation should be \\"The Enchanter.\\" Perhaps this is because the pedophile is enchanted with the concept of having a prepubescent girl to bring along through all the various sexualities that ran within his warped persona.Additionally, the story rolls along as an incredible pace. The last 10 pages being probably the most \`enchanting' of all, as the story comes to a crashing crescendo of an ending. Like most of the writings of Nabokov, the book is an example of a brilliant novelist at his very best. Do not fail to read the afterword by Dmitri Nabokov, the translator and son of the author, especially where he disavows any direct relationship to \\"Lolita.\\" It is recommended to those with a wide vocabulary and a not overly judgmental mind."},{"Title":"The Enchanter","review":"...but is it my own lack of a philosophically absolute morality, or Nabokov's ambiguity, that makes The Enchanter such an uncomfortable book to read? I will confess, to establish my critical credibility, that I have transgressed the Mosaic commandments about my neighbor's wife and, yes, also his maidservant. I didn't get to throw the first stone at Bill Clinton or wife-betraying John McCain for their sleazy behavior. But some behaviors do disgust me, outrage me, enflame me with vengeful wrath. Sexual violence toward children is so creepy that I'd throw away my objections to capital punishment for it. The Enchanter is a novella about the obsession of a middle-aged man with barely pubescent girls, in which the protagonist schemes slyly for months to gain access to such a girl, in the role of her widowd step-father, in order to seduce her and shape her to his fantasies. In the end, his hateful self-control fails and he tries to rape her. She screams, the \\"world\\" intervenes, and the hopeful pederast throws himself before a truck in the dark.There, I've told the story, spoiled the denouement, haven't I? But as always with Nabokov, it's the language that matters anyway, the wily tricks the master plays with our sympathies and susceptibilities, the bitter taste in the mouth this story leaves in the form of the realization that any of us might be as depraved and loathsome to ourselves as the nameless protagonist of The Enchanter. That's one possible reading, anyway, and the one offered by Nabokov's son Dimitri, who translated the novella from Russian to English. Is it my reading? Only provisionally, at best. The vividness of the sexual details and of the sadistic finale seem altogether too artful, so that I fear \\"somebody out there\\" will be enjoying them a bit too freely. (There I go, throwing the stone after all.) It's one thing to formulate an acceptable answer to the question of 'what Nabokov meant by such a tale.' It's another to be troubled by the question of 'why Nabokov chose to write such a tale.'Notice that I've made no mention of a connection between this novella, written in Europe, and a much more famous novel written later in America. Let's leave it that way, with the understanding that many of the same perplexities will arise."},{"Title":"The Enchanter","review":"In a sense, &quot;The Enchanter&quot; was not meant to be published. Author Vladimir Nabokov unearthed the extremely brief novel in his papers, 20 years after he dashed it off (and thought it was gone forever). It's &quot;Lolita&quot; before there was &quot;Lolita&quot;... but not quite as interesting.The main character is a middle-aged, respectable, well-off man, living alone and lonely. He also has a distinct &quot;liking&quot; for teenage girls who are just hitting adolescence, but doesn't dare to try anything. One in particular catches his notice, a coltish girl on roller skates who talks to him at times and gains his affection and lust.He proposes to the girl's widowed mother, who is terminally ill and pretty crabby; he has no interest in his &quot;monstrous bride&quot; but it's the only way he can get to the girl. The wife's condition gets worse over the following months, and she dies. And the man choreographs his own downfall as he plots to seduce his new stepdaughter...The mind of a pedophile is a disgusting thing, and Nabokov makes no excuses for it. &quot;The Enchanter&quot; is a pretty straightforward story in comparison, without a lot of twists or surprises. It's far from a bad book, but it's not a terribly good one either. It's fairly ordinary, especially when compared to modern classic &quot;Lolita.&quot;The high point of &quot;The Enchanter&quot; is the rambling thoughts of the lead character as the book opens. Then it dips down and proceeds more or less steadily. Nabokov's lush language and complex symbolism aren't really very present here. His writing is blander and more straightforward, with a lack of polish.The characters are given no names -- they're just the man, the girl, the wife. And the only characters we really get insight into are the lead character and the teenage girl. He's a lech, a creepy pedophile, with nothing good about him. Though he's the center of the novel it's impossible to feel any understanding for him, only a sort of disgusted pity. And Nabokov evoked that with a flair. And the girl is a sort of vibrant athlete that can be seen at any school.&quot;The Enchanter&quot; is a sort of pale shadow of &quot;Lolita,&quot; a straightforward story about a pedophile and how his obsessions bring him down. Worth checking out, but far from the best."},{"Title":"The Enchanter","review":"No one can write about &quot;The Enchanter&quot; without mentioning the fact that it is the precursor to &quot;Lolita&quot;. Keeping in mind that this was a sketch for &quot;Lolita&quot;, it isn't that bad. Who can say that they've written something brilliant without thought on the first try? Also, keep in mind that it was translated from Russian into English (not by Nabokov), so Nabokov's usual beauty in writing may be badly put into English. If you are interested in reading &quot;The Enchanter&quot;, be it for the fact that you want to see where it meets with &quot;Lolita&quot;."},{"Title":"The Enchanter","review":"The Enchanter is a novella Nabokov wrote years before Lolita so it can be taken as a precursor to his famous novel. In it, an unnamed man becomes infatuated with a 12 year old girl and dreams of being with her. To make that dream a reality he ingratiates himself to the mother, doing favors, visiting when she is ill, etc. He finds out just how sick she is and that the father is dead and that the girl is actually living with a friend. He pushes his plan farther by marrying the mother but is frustrated to find the girl won't be living with them because the mother in her frail state can't deal with her. His fantasies are temporarily thwarted but its not long before the mother passes away and he takes sole custody of the girl. He decides they will go on a trip for several months because he feels this will give him a chance to be alone with the girl and begin his grooming of her. It doesn't work out as on the first night they're alone together, as she sleeps, he gets too close to her and when she wakes up, she begins to scream. He runs from the hotel, his dreams shattered.It is a strange book to read because of the subject matter. The descriptions are not graphic by today's standards although the final passages in the hotel room as she's sleeping were more than a little uncomfortable to read. This is the first Nabokov book I've read. I found him to be a gifted writer who sometimes puts things so beautifully it takes your breath away, but at other times I felt like he went overboard and pummeled you with words, using 20 when 5 would have sufficed. Because this is a novella there's not a lot of depth to the characters. While you delve into the main character's behavior and fantasies, you don't find out why he is the way he is. The Enchanter was a quick and interesting read, probably accomplishing what Nabokov's son wanted when he published it, which was to encourage you to read Lolita."},{"Title":"Applying Educational Research: A Practical Guide","review":"This is a difficult-to-understand textbook about educational research.

Head professionally lays out an argument seeking the truth behind Justinian II's cruel reputation. I highly recommend her book to anybody who has ever read Turteltaub's (Turtledove's) &quot;Justinian.&quot;Head gives an excellent description of the problem with the primary sources modern historians have on Justinian II's lifetime. Her book goes a long way toward showing Justinian II's constructive side, whereas most other recent authors have concentrated exclusively on branding the emperor as a bloodthirsty pyschopath. Although she tries to portray Justinian more constructively, Head is clear that she is not exonerating Justinian of his mistakes. She simply seeks to point out the historical Justinian II and to explain his life."},{"Title":"Justinian II of Byzantium","review":"Forty years on much of Constance Head's work here is quite dated. However, it remains the only historical biography of the reign of the Byzantine emperor Justinian II. Head's goal in this book beyond providing a narrative is to rescue Justinian from the tyranny of the source material. The two main sources in Greek for his life, the later chroniclersTheophanesand Nikephoros are virulently hostile to Justinian. Head's goal is to present in the format of popular history an argument that Justinian, despite his faults, was in fact a competent and determined statesman. Although much of this book is simply a narrative of Justinian's life, the core of it is based on why Theophanes and Nikephoros have this particular attitude. She does an admirable job given the material available to her at the time of writing. The tale told is lively and interesting. It is easy to read, and the short chapters mean you can glance at the book for only a few moments and yet still finish a chapter. The physical book itself is quite interesting. When I removed the dustcover, I found that Justinian's monogram was embossed on the front cover which was a nice touch. Despite being a popular history, the publisher allowed the use of footnotes, something that too many books for strictly academic audiences these days still do not have. The problem with the book is its age. While one can pick it up for a decent read on Justinian's life and his empire, much of Head's scholarship is extremely dated. Even if she was citing material from the late 1960s it would be considered dated today, but many of her references at this point are now a century old. So long as this book is just enjoyed for its narrative and careful use of the sources, it is a perfectly good book. Readers should be aware, however, that it is not a good place to find out what scholars think of the 'Farmer's Law' in Byzantium today, though."},{"Title":"Justinian II of Byzantium","review":"This book is a biography on the Byzantine emperor Justinian II, a man so ignored that his more famous predecessor is usually referred to without the I after his name as if there was no second one. The second Justinian was a rather unpleasant, vengeful person who was very intent on getting his own way. This book is the only biography available on him. Since his reign is rather poorly documented the book is rather a short one, with only 156 pages of text. What little there is is very good however. Justinian's times come through very clearly. The book has a pretty basic chronological narrative with only a few chapters in the middle being split up into sections such as Buildings and Coins. It's a pretty interesting narrative too. Justinian went through wars and betrayals and ended up deposed and mutilated and exiled far away from Constantinople. The truly impressive part is that he came back and recovered his throne despite his condition. This all makes for an interesting story and was told fictitiously in Harry Turtledove'sJustinian, written at least partly in response to this book (he doesn't believe in even partially rehabilitating Justinian).

One of the authors, Jack J. Phillips, has extensive experience and a large published body of knowledge in the domains of HR, ROI and scorecard development. This book has his touch, and covers the essentials of a mature project organization, what to measure and how to measure it.The approach is as follows:1. Measure:* reaction and satisfaction* skill and knowledge churn during the project* implementation and progress metrics throughout the project2. From the metrics capture:* business impact data* ROI3. Identify both tangible and intangible benefits and apply them to an aggregate 'true cost'.The book also shows how to translate business metrics to dollar values, build a business case, and communicate status, based on the scorecard, to clients and stakeholders. This is essential for anyone who is setting up or managing a program management office or who wants to improve internal project managment processes. It also provides one of the best methods for communicating status to clients and upper management."},{"Title":"The Project Management Scorecard: Measuring the Success of Project Management Solutions (Improving Human Performance)","review":"Having read and then reviewed three books co-authored by Robert S. Kaplan and David P. Norton (The Balanced Scorecard, The Strategy-Focused Organization, and Strategy Maps) as well as Paul R. Niven's Balanced Scorecard Step-by-Step, all of which I highly regard, I was especially interested in reading this book which the authors explain how to measure the success of project management solutions.In the Preface, they assert that, currently, \\"there is no book that offers a comprehensive, practical presentation on a project management scorecard, using a process that meets the demands of [project managers, clients and senior managers who must approve project budgets, and evaluation researchers who develop, explore, and analyze new processes and techniques]. Most models and representations of the scorecard process ignore, or provide very little insight into, the two key elements essential to developing the scorecard: isolating the effects of project management solutions and converting data to monetary values.\\" Others (notably Kaplan, Norton, and Niven) are far better qualified than I am to verify or dispute that claim. Of greater interest to me is how well organized and written this book is, and, how helpful I believe it will be, at least to project managers as well as to those who must approve project budgets. My Five Star rating speaks for itself.Phillips, Bothell, and Snead present their material within four Parts: Setting the Stage (e.g. \\"Project Management Issues and Challenges), The Seven Measures (e.g. \\"How to Capture Business Impact Data\\"), Key Issues with the Measures (e.g. \\"How to Convert Business Measures to Monetary Values\\"), and Challenges (e.g. \\"Overcoming Resistance and Barriers to the Project Management Scorecard\\"). They conclude with an Appendix in which they suggest how to establish an effective project management culture. In it, they identify 16 \\"Best Practices\\" and include a brief case study example for each.What I especially appreciate about this volume is the fact that the authors devote the bulk of their attention to explaining how to implement effectively the various concepts, strategies, and tactics they present. They are also to be commended for concluding each of the 16 chapters with a \\"Final Thoughts\\" section. This facilitates a convenient review when a reader wishes to review key points. In fact, I strongly recommend to project managers that they complete such a review at least every 90 days but, preferably, every 30 days throughout their project's duration.As the authors correctly point out, \\"One of the greatest challenges is deciding which costs should be included in the project solution cost calculation. For some projects, certain costs are hidden and never included in the cost calculation. Our preference is a conservative one: Account for all costs, both direct and indirect.\\"There are several major cost categories:Initial analysis and assessmentDevelopment of solutionsAcquisition of solutionsImplementation and applicationMaintenance and monitoringAdministrative support and overheadEvaluation and reportingFor most projects, the authors recommend this sequence by which to convert data to monetary values:1. First, define a unit of measure2. Determine the monetary value of each unit3. Calculate the change in performance data4. Determine the annual rate (and amount) of change5. Calculate the annual value of the improvement\\"Costs are important and should be fully loaded in the ROI calculation. From a practical standpoint, some costs may be optional based on an organization's guidelines and philosophy. However, because of the scrutiny involved in the ROI calculations, it is recommended that all costs be included, even if this goes beyond the requirements of the policy.\\"In this volume, Phillips, Bothell, and Snead offer a wealth of information and counsel which can help achieve the ultimate success of almost any project in almost any organization. That success can then inform and guide efforts to create throughout the same organization a \\"project management culture.\\""},{"Title":"The Project Management Scorecard: Measuring the Success of Project Management Solutions (Improving Human Performance)","review":"This book has a mundane title but could be titled \\"Everything you ever wanted to know about project success and then some\\". The Project Management Scorecard focuses on how to evaluate and measure the success of project management solutions. Given that failed projects are far more common than successful projects, executives are investing more time and money in developing project managers. This book recognizes the challenges in measuring the return on project management investment and provides clarity and techniques on how to overcome this obstacle.The book is very thorough in its examination of the problems, process, and solutions to measuring project management success. First the authors break down the problem into its component parts, then they take a look at the project management process steps, and finally they present multiple approaches on how to create an effective scorecard and to use it to achieve desired results. The book includes not only straight-forward steps to follow, but also questionnaires and forms that can be easily used. Success stories and case studies are also included to illustrate major points.Some of the topics include the following:o Project management issues and challengeso Changing corporate cultureso Measuring reaction and satisfactiono How to calculate and interpret and ROIo Capturing business impact datao Measuring skill and knowledge changes during the projecto Monitoring the true costs of the projecto Converting business measure to monetary valueso Forecasting ROIThis book provides a straight-forward approach to setting up and measuring project success.

FLASH GORDON: THE ICE MONSTER is a 1968 black & white paperback reprinting the first two Flash Gordon stories (the first is untitled - but we'll call it \\"The Ice Monster\\" - and \\"The Mole Machine\\") from the 1966 King Comics FLASH GORDON comic book (issue #1), as well as \\"The Death Trap of Mongo\\" story from issue #2. Don't get this confused with what Dan Barry was doing in the daily newspaper strip around the same time. FLASH GORDON: THE ICE MONSTER collects two of Al Williamson's six stories from the comic book. \\"The Death Trap of Mongo\\" is drawn by someone else.It's nice of the first story to try to set a timeline. So, catching up: It took years of bloody fighting but finally Ming the Merciless's stranglehold on the planet Mongo was broken, thanks mostly to Flash Gordon of Yale University. Flash, his girlfriend Dale Arden, and that kooky brilliant scientist, Dr, Hans Zarkov finally returned to Earth, laden with rich tech lore gleaned from Mongo.But, it turns out, these revolutionary advancements necessitate an immense supply of radium, this mineral being only readily available on Mongo. So off go Flash, Dale, and Dr. Zarkov on a rocketship back to Mongo, where they crash land yet again, this time on the continent of Tropica. Months of derring-do later, and finally the trio turn their attention back to their mission of procuring radium... which is when this story begins.The quest for radium leads Flash to Frigia, a nation ruled by Queen Fria and site of the radium mines. And how surprised are you that Flash is immediately catapulted into peril? While on a hunting expedition, an act of sabotage traps him and Queen Fria with a gigantic ice creature, this part of a conspiracy to wrest power from the Frigian monarchy. A newly discovered chemical, supposed to retard aging, plays a role in the sinister scheme.\\"The Mole Machine\\" is interesting in that it takes place entirely on Earth - or, rather, in Earth. Dr. Zarkov invites Flash to explore the inner Earth with him via his new invention which can bore thru solid rock. They eventually find their way to Krenkelium, a beleaguered underground kingdom where visitors are not permitted to leave. And, of course, there's a beautiful princess.The third story is \\"The Death Trap of Mongo\\" and features the return of Ming the Merciless (you just can't keep a good despot down). Back on Earth, no sooner does Dr. Zarkov test out his long range tracking device on Dale than she is kidnapped via a Mongo matter transmitter. While Dale's abduction was thru means of instantaneous teleportation, by comparison, it takes Flash and Zarkov almost six days of interplanetary travel to get to Mongo, but then it's on! Upon arrival to Mingo City, Flash and Zarkov learn that their old friend King Barin as well as the ruling council have all vanished, leaving the city in panic and susceptible to mass riots. Can this be related to Dale's snatching? Well, yes.\\"The Death Trap of Mongo\\" was featured in issue #2 of King Comics' FLASH GORDON, and it's a typically neat Flash Gordon story, except that Al Williamson didn't draw the thing. The art is decent enough, but it's not up to Williamson's high standards. Fact is, I'm not even sure who drew it, only that it's definitely not Al Williamson.FLASH GORDON was the newspaper strip which inspired artist Al Williamson to make a career in the comics profession. It's a shame that Williamson only had smidgens of occasions to work on Flash Gordon, because when he got the chance to work on Flash, he consistently turned in stellar stuff. There was that really good 1994 Flash Gordon miniseries he illustrated and co-plotted for Marvel, which never did get promoted enough. But the one that's really fondly remembered is his run of six stories (with interior art) for King Comics' FLASH GORDON back in 1966.Williamson did decades of work as an inker, which doesn't at all do justice to how good of an illustrator he is. The stories reprinted here are in black and white, which sucks. On the other hand, the lack of color allows you to focus more on Williamson's craftsmanship, the elegance of his lines, the dynamism of the composition, the lavishly detailed panels. Really good stuff. Back in 1966, Marvel was doing revolutionary things with comic book storytelling, creating characters who were more gritty and realistic. But Williamson made it a point to return to that Golden Age of romanticized swashbuckling interplanetary adventures. And while I absolutely loved what Lee, Kirby, and Ditko did in the House of Ideas, Williamson definitely staked his claim for nostalgia buffs.Like I said, I'm never really sure how to rate stuff like this paperback. On one hand, these stories are hard to find and so having reprint books like this one comes in handy, and it's easy to read. But it's not in color and the panels are arranged differently than the original comic book version, so it's not a faithful reprinting. If you can at all afford it, all of Williamson's Flash Gordon interior art for King Comics - and, of course, \\"The Death Trap of Mongo\\" won't be included, since he didn't draw it - are found in all their glossy glory inAl Williamson's Flash Gordon: A Lifelong Vision of the Heroic. But sadly still in black & white.One thing, though. It's a bit surprising that the book cover here showcases the cover for issue #2 of King Comics' FLASH GORDON - which is done by Gil Kane. I'm fairly certain that Al Williamson, in his stint with King Comics, also handled his share of cover duties. But I guess none of his featured an \\"ice monster.\\""},{"Title":"Finders and Keepers: Helping New Teachers Survive and Thrive in Our Schools (The Jossey-Bass Education Series)","review":"Every administrator, supervisor, education college professor should own this book.

From its origins in Enlightenment thinking, it has challenged longstanding beliefs about women and male-female relationships. Matthews' book offers a study of the emergence of the women's movement in mid-nineteenth century America, charting both its broader intellectual origins and the context of contemporary reform movements.Both strands are integral to understanding how feminism developed as it did. Matthews starts by describing traditional views of women, views that were under assault by Enlightenment ideas about equality and natural rights. The first gains were made in education, where the assumptions of women's mental inferiority to men came under increasing assault. Yet from the first there were disagreements within the incipient movement, as education advocates such as Catherine Beecher balked at the more radical ideas of Frances Wright and others.One of the great strengths of the book is in Matthews's explanation of the ties between the women's movement and the swelling reform movements of the 1830s and 1840s. Many women joined the crusade for moral reform, gaining experience that would later be applied to campaigns for women's rights. No effort proved to be more important, though, than the campaign against slavery. Here women joined a campaign demanding liberty for a population legally defined as second-class people, just as women were at that time. Though Matthews eschews the idea of a direct evolution, she does acknowledge the influence, as well as the fact that many of the early male supporters cam from the ranks of the abolitionists.Yet the Civil War represented a turning point for the movement. Many feminists felt it necessary to subordinate their activities to the cause of abolition, while others (such as Susan B. Anthony) were determined to press ahead. But the greater division came with the end of the war. Many feminists saw the postwar measures to grant African Americans the right to vote as the perfect opportunity to extend the franchise to women as well. Yet many abolitionists preferred the viable goal of enfranchising African American men to the more radical one of universal suffrage, which threatened to complicate the issue. In response, leaders such as Elizabeth Cady Stanton increasingly adopted elitist language that alienated many within the abolitionist movement, ending their support for women's suffrage.This elitist tone foreshadowed the changing social complexion of the women's movement during the 1870s. Increasingly, upper-middle-class women were joining the ranks of feminists, at the same time that many in the movement began to argue for the moral superiority of women to men. Yet sexuality threatened to shatter the feminist movement in the 1870s, as debates shifted to questions of \\"free love\\" and controlling childbearing. Matthews concludes with the presentation of the Declaration of Rights for Woman at the Centennial Exhibition in Philadelphia, a \\"fitting closure\\" in the reaffirmation of the natural and equal rights of women.Matthews' book is a great starting point for understanding the early years of American feminist movement. More than just an introductory survey, it contains valuable insights into the broader philosophy behind the movement's goals. She is especially good at analyzing the motivations of its participants on issues ranging from restructuring laws governing property ownership within marriage to broader redefinitions of love and the role of women in society. The result is a work that demonstrates the broad strides that feminism made in the first half-century of the women's rights movement - as well as how far they had yet to go."},{"Title":"Man was not born to cry","review":"Among the various Infinite Way books available, this volumeis probably the best entry point for the layman to thesubject of mysticism and the mystical life.

Marshall, is a nonfiction work about combat during the Korean War. The title page bears the subtitle \\"The American Fighting Man in Action--Korea, Spring, 1953.\\" The book's copyright page notes that a William Morrow edition was published in 1956. In the preface, author Marshall recounts that he went to Korea in 1953 to work as a war correspondent, but at Army request he took on the job of investigating and analyzing infantry tactics. He describes how he held question-and-answer sessions with groups of soldiers who had been in combat. This interesting glimpse behind the making of the book adds to the text as a whole.Marshall describes many intense, horrific, bloody scenes of combat. He vividly portrays the agonizing suffering endured by these combat troops. He covers many significant topics, among them the following: Chinese military tactics; how U.S. and Korean troops worked together; communication on the battlefield; leadership and organization; the impact of terrain on battle; and types of weapons used. I found one of the book's most interesting sections to be an account of the Ethiopian troops who fought in the war--Marshall praises these African soldiers greatly.The book features maps and drawings by H. Garver Miller. Marshall includes a number of illuminating quotes from the fighting troops. He vividly describes how confusing the battlefield can become--the phrase \\"the fog of war\\" came to my mind over and over again as I read this book. Another phrase that this book brings to my mind is simply: \\"War is hell.\\" This gripping, graphic work really makes me appreciate the remarkable challenge faced by troops in the Korean War, and the valor with which so many faced that challenge."},{"Title":"Pork Chop Hill","review":"The thing that gets me about this book is that it appears that many of the problems Marshall points out from his on-the-spot interviews with Korean war troopers are EXACTLY the ones that had such a devastating impact on our Vietnam war soldiers. Individual trooper rotation among our forces while the enemy left veterans in place to familiarize themselves with the terrain. Casual attitudes to construction of U.S. fortifications and over-reliance of artillery support while the enemy maximized concealment and exploited it for movement and deployment. Reliance on unreliable native allies. Lack of communication about objectives. Insufficient manning of positions by understrength units. etc, etc... They say the military is always prepared for the LAST war, but typically the U.S. has always been prepared for the NEXT one."},{"Title":"Pork Chop Hill","review":"Marshall's spellbinding version of the battle of Pork Chop Hill remains one of the most comprehensive books about military strategy and ground combat ever written. War veterans and military strategists would love this book.April 1953, while peace talks continue in Panmunjom, Korea, only 70 miles away the battle of Pork Chop Hill raged. Marshall's book analyzes of one of the last battles of the War to be fought--Pork Chop Hill. Someone not familiar with what stage of the war this battle occurs may be lost by its significance. Marshall's story is about the senseless loss of lives in a battle that had no real military significance. It is recounted from the perspective of surviving soldiers through interviews immediately following the fighting.Marshall, as a war correspondent and military operations analysis officer, is directed by the military to interview the front line men, on the battlefield, in order to make recommendations to military command of anyone deserving medals. In doing so, Marshall conveys the excruciating effort put forth by American soldiers against crafty Red Chinese, who were familiar with hillside, secret underground tunnels and well-camouflaged holes to aid in the hand-to-hand combat. Most American soldiers, recently rotated to the platoon, had not acquainted themselves with the terrain and even became lost during the night advance. At a disadvantage and exhausted, some soldiers hid in the bunkers, not even firing their rifles at the enemy.Marshall states in his book \\"Compared to Gettysburg or the Ardennes, Pork Chop Hill was hardly more than a skirmish. But within the force that engaged, losses were unusually heavy.\\"Marshall uses this analogy to emphasize the excessive casualties for a relatively minor battle. Marshall relates how American press rushed to cover the battle at Freedom Village (that was occurring simultaneously), which left the heroism and sacrifices at Pork Chop Hill unreported. Marshall states: \\"The neglect\\" from the press was worse because a few weeks earlier the 7th Infantry had been lambasted for the loss of Old Baldy and the staging Operation Smack. They had been described as weary, slipshod, demoralized troops, and, while the Pork Chop Hill fight was on, this caustic criticism from home was repeated over Red Chinese loudspeakers to the American fighters.\\" Psychological propaganda, a common tactic used by the Red Chinese, blasted belittling statements about the American's over loudspeakers positioned directly on the battlefield.Marshall prints the derogatory language used by soldiers in referring to the Red Chinese as \\"Chinks\\". However, quotes from the soldier's themselves are devoid of vulgarities, lessening the emotional effect, but necessary for a book written in the early 50's to be published. This book is a factual, chronological progression of the battle, containing great detail about military tactics, and an almost matter-of-fact account of injuries and deaths.I do not prefer this type of book because as the reader I was not able to make any emotional attachment to any single character. It seemed as though this book lacked any real plot and was written strictly to retell this struggle of power between the United Nations and the Red Chinese.The Korean War was once considered a \\"police action,\\" but to the thousand of brave soldiers, who lost their lives and survived, it was a war."},{"Title":"Pork Chop Hill","review":"Marshall's First hand account of Pork Chop Hill remains one of our most gripping account of this snapshot of the Korean War. The first hand stories from the front line grunts and officers offer an amazing look into who made up our front line.Marshall starts this account of Pork Chop Hill's defense, loss, and the fight to regain it at a run. Two other battles on the same front line are told to set the stage of the command climate and the events building to the battle for Pork Chop. While these two accounts (one a repulse of the Chinese and one a loss of an outpost) set the tactical stage for the Battle of Pork Chop Hill, a reader unfamiliar with the Korean war and what stage of the war this battle occurs in will be lost by his original account.As Marshall tells the story of what happened on Pork Chop he gives a vivid description of what occured from the perspective of the survivors from each platoon. The flavor of battle is retold well thru his account. What is conveyed most is that there really is no way a person can understand the exhaustion and effort put forth by the men involved.A couple of interesting anachronisms show up in his near fifty year old telling. His careful censorship of the language use by the soldiers is unfortunate. Granted, if he used the language that soldiers really used, he couldn't get his book published in the fifties. However, the attempt at artfully dancing around what the soldiers really said is a little annoying. So on one hand the censorship was required to get the book out in the day it was written, while on the other it lessens the blunt accuracy of the account. In a similar vein, the other oddity I found was how easily the derogitory language towards the Chinese flowed. There was even this one passage where an obviously Chinese American soldiers was refering to the enemy as &quot;Chinks.&quot; Again a reflection of the times"},{"Title":"Pork Chop Hill","review":"This is a wonderful account of the events that occurred at Pork Chop Hill in April 1953 in Korea.The historian Marshall has chronicled the actions of many officers and men who were involved in that battle,that for all its significance, went virtually unreported by the UN press who were covering prisoner exchangein Panmunjom."},{"Title":"Pork Chop Hill","review":"I'm giving three stars because I'm a stingy bastard who wanted to like this true account of god-awful combat in Korea more than I did. Partly I'm influenced by Marshall's diminished reputation as a first-hand investigator. For details, read some of the reviews of the book that made him famous, \\"Men Against Fire.\\" In short, Col. David Hackworth and others have cast serious doubt on how much \\"interviewing\\" of GIs he really did in World War II.But there's no doubt that \\"Pork Chop Hill\\" is the real deal. Of course, nobody can reconstruct, with near-perfect accuracy and in exactly the right order, even the most important things that 145 American riflemen did and said in a battle that left the 12 survivors exhausted and barely able to walk (I'm thinking of the chapter \\"All of King's Men,\\" which provided the framework for the excellent 1959 movie). Marshall, however, gives an absolutely believable account of U.N. operations on and near the hill in April, 1953. Nobody has ever impugned the validity of this book.A bigger reason for only three stars is that by today's standards, \\"Pork Chop Hill\\" is a little dry and in places a little hard to follow. The maps are not quite as helpful as they should be. And the people are mainly names. Marshall doesn't glorify battle, but he doesn't make it come fully alive either. I'm also disappointed that he barely mentions the irony of two sides fighting almost to the last man for a position everybody agrees has no military value whatsoever.If you want to see how combat writing has changed in the past half century, compare \\"Pork Chop Hill\\" with Sebastian Junger's recent, dumbly-titled \\"War,\\" about an Army unit in Afghanistan. Now that's a five-star book! And the biggest difference is the immediacy and style.Three stars isn't bad, by the way."},{"Title":"Pork Chop Hill","review":"Alright, I'm a bit biased. My father is mentioned in this book. The author isn't really a book writer he's a journalist and the style is very much in that genre.

Firstly I wanted to read the book because my grandfather fought in one of the battles' right next to pork chop hill and he said it would be a great book to read because it really gave a good account of it. I also wanted to choose a military novel because as a future officer of the Army I wanted to see a first had account of military strategy, which is what it gave me.As I read the preface, I found that SLA Marshall was a brigadier general at the time and he was a military operations analysis officer. And that this book was recounted from the perspective of surviving soldiers through interviews immediately following the fighting. This intrigued me more to read it because I knew I was getting a first hand account of what happened at Pork Chop Hill.I feel this is a must read as future officers, because it is an extremely comprehensive book on military strategy and combat."},{"Title":"Pork Chop Hill","review":"This book ahowed me what happened at this battle and how terrible it really was"},{"Title":"Writing on the Body: Female Embodiment and Feminist Theory","review":"This is a wonderful collection of essays for anyone looking for an introduction to feminist theory, or simply for new ways to perceive and analyze the body.

Robert Zubrin's book follows a group of very different characters as they execute a difficult mission to Mars, and he does not skip out on either the technical details or on the character conflicts. And that's to be expected-- not only is he a writer, Robert Zubrin is also a top-rate space engineer-- he literally wrote the book on how to go to Mars. This book is great if, like me, you think that science fiction needs both science _and_ interesting characters.Of the novels about Mars trips, I still think that Geoffrey A. Landis' book MARS CROSSING is my favorite, but FIRST LANDING runs a close second."},{"Title":"First Landing","review":"\\"First Landing\\" is a quick reading no-brakes story (I devoured the 262 pages in a couple of sittings) about humankind's first landing on Mars that packs a shocker of an ending to boot. \\"First Landing\\" is the tale of a team of five Americans (three men and two women) that make the long the and perilous journey to Mars only to find themselves stranded by the vagaries of public opinion and a few nasty surprises. As a result they are forced to rely on themselves if they are to survive.Wasting very little time with exposition Robert Zubrin (president of the Mars Society) jumps right into this story and never slows down until the end. His detailing is quite effective if somewhat limited. Despite the speed with which the story unfolds his characterization is sufficient for me to have rapidly made an emotional connection with main actors.In an interesting addendum the books epilogue is Zubrin's contention that the type of mission he details in \\"First Land\\" is what he sees as a blue print for real manned mission to Mars by 2011. In that limited space he makes a convincing case for a more ambitious Mars program than the one currently being undertaken.On the down side, I wished there were a bit more to this book. I would have liked to have spent more time getting to know these characters. Further, the swiftness with which things unfold leaves a few holes in the motivations of certain key actors that a longer novel could have addressed.However, if you are fan of Mars fiction you will find \\"First Landing\\" a fun and fast read. It's not as detailed or plot heavy as Kim Stanley Robinson's \\"Red Mars\\", \\"Green Mars\\" and \\"Blue Mars\\" trilogy. But it definitely put a smile on my face when I finished"},{"Title":"First Landing","review":"I was pretty excited to get started reading this book after reading the reviews. I am very interested in exploration of Mars, and this book seemed to be a perfect fit for me. Unfortunately I can not say I enjoyed this first attempt at fiction by Mr. Zubrin. The plot is predictable, and shallow. The characters could have been pulled from any number of previous tombs on exploration. At one point there is even a shameless plug for one of Zubrin's non-fiction works.I found this effort to be really lacking in conviction and creatvity, a least two more complete edits were warranted, unfortunately it is the reader who suffers reading through this dribble.About the only positive point I can note is that the suffereing is short-lived, as &quot;First Landing&quot; is quite short, and requires very little in the way of concentration, as the reader is aware of what lurks around every next corner."},{"Title":"First Landing","review":"In Zubrin's near-future novel, humanity touches down on the Red Planet with five eager explorers. Despite each individual's drive to explore this virgin terrain, internal conflict among the crew quickly leads to spats that could end up endangering the entire mission. Added to this, rapidly diminishing support at home from both the political administration in charge and the public at large, and you have a tale that at-times seems extremely plausible and at other times, a very unlikely romp through humanity's near-future.Let me start out by saying I am vociferous proponent of a manned mission to Mars. And, indeed, I have read Zubrin's The Case for Mars and believe it to be our best and most realistic opportunity to get to Mars in the near-future using technology that we are already familiar with. All this being the case, First Landing simply left much to be desired. I found it extremely unlikely that any crew that we ultimately send to Mars, having undoubtedly been vetted for years in advance, would get along as poorly as Zubrin's fictional team. Also, once on the surface of Mars, Zubrin's crew seemed at a loss for the details on how to explore the planet. Again, any team that actually winds up on the surface of Mars, while I'm sure would have some operational leeway in their plans, would surely have their entire time on the surface accounted for ad nauseam. These are not minor details in a story about the human exploration Mars, especially when written by an author who has spent the last two decades trying to actually get people to the surface of the Red Planet.While I believe the above deficits affected the story to a significant degree, First Landing definitely had its bright spots. Zubrin does an exceedingly good job of getting across a sense of wonder and amazement about the characters actually being on the surface of the planet. And, while I do not want to give away the ending, Zubrin ended his tale, for all characters involved, in a most appropriate way.So, while this is most definitely not the creme de la creme of Martian tales, Zubrin's effort is noble (despite clearly not being an expert science fiction writer), and if it gets just one more person interested in the Red Planet, if it gets just one more person curious about what may await us on Mars, then this novel will most definitely have been worth the effort Zubrin put into it."},{"Title":"First Landing","review":"I'm a terribly slow reader, but simply could NOT stop reading this book. The character development of the Mars &quot;crew&quot; is just astounding, so much so that I found myself crying in some situations and ready to stand up and cheer in others!

Well, I dont want to give anything away!Zubrin is a firm believer that of all the tools we need to do a successful venture to Mars, human resourcefulness and determination are the most invaluable. If morale survives, so does possibility.The author is not afraid to tackle some real tough situations. What do you do if someone cant return to Earth, or refuses to? What do you do if the public back home doesnt want you to return? And what if the Administration doesnt have the moral guts to lead the public, but finds it more politically expedient to follow?Most people seem to expect the Mars Program to follow the script of Apollo: a series of stand alone missions, each of them &Ograve;send them and get them back alive.&Oacute; We all know where that led. Sooner or later, after a &Ograve;return to Earth,&Oacute; there are no more outbound missions. This kind of script may suit NASA and the government and Congress, but it does not suit the goal of the Mars Society to open up Mars to settlers. Zubrin, as does Jeff Landis in his brilliant Mars Crossing, scripts an unplanned end-run. In the end the situation must be forced and can only spring from the unpredictable autonomy of the spirit of the individuals who actually get to go.First Landing is a good yarn and we highly recommend you get your own &Ograve;cant put it down&Oacute; copy.

The author is an advocate of a particular Mars exploration plan. He also has a distinctly right wing political bent. As a result, First Landing becomes a polemic instead of a story.

That provides the plot and yet another opportunity for Zubrin to explain his proposal. While this is interesting to space aficionados, it does not do much for the story.[...]Of course the actual trip to Mars is only a framework for the human drama. This aspect of the story reveals the authors poor skills as a novelist. The cookie cutter characters play out a predictable story aimed at demonstrating conservative values. This gives the characters several chances to recite right wing homilies.

Nasa selects Jerry Falwell, Susan Sontag, Alan Dershowitz, a Texan Geologist from the oil industry, and David Hackworth as commander. Thought NASA (or anyone else) would put more thought into crew selection? Me too.This book follows a trend in similar literature that focuses way too much on personal friction between crew members as the most serious problem in a mission like this. It achieves distinction only in how far the author will go in his stereotyping. From a religious fundamentalist continuously quoting the bible to fellow crew members to a Texan literally yelling Yee-Hah!, to a stiff necked military commander that...doesn't take charge?The shame of it is that the author is an acclaimed astronautical engineer that could have made this a very interesting examination of the latest theories in engineering a voyage such as this."},{"Title":"First Landing","review":"First, two caveats: Robert Zubrin is the president of the Mars Society, and I'm the president of a chapter of the Mars Society; and he asked me to post this review after I told him how much I loved the book. So be warned, I was biased before I picked up the book. With that said, I loved this novel, and I found it by far the best of the recent Mars novels that I've read - Zubrin's fiction debut created more lifelike characters and a more compelling plot than &quot;Martian Race&quot; by veteran novelist Gregory Benford, and there's no comparison at all to the hopelessly contrived and woodenly peopled &quot;Red Mars, Green Mars, Blue Mars&quot; trilogy from the Ralph Nader of science fiction, Kim Stanley Robinson. It's also, needless to say, immensely superior to any recent movie about Mars - Hollywood should redeem itself from last year's two fiascos (\\"Mission to Mars\\" and \\"Red Planet\\") by making a movie out of this book. \\"First Landing\\" serves largely as an illustration of Zubrin's mission designs that he perfected as an engineer at Lockheed Martin and then as CEO of Pioneer Astronautics - both of the virtues of the designs and the danger of interfering with them. Anyone who wants to learn more about the technical side of these efforts would get a huge kick out of Zubrin's non-fiction, \\"The Case for Mars\\" and \\"Entering Space,\\" which outline some of the cleverest, most compelling space engineering since the giant leap for mankind in 1969. But this novel goes far beyond mere technical brilliance, upon which much hard science fiction rests. Several genuine, compelling characters are painted with an economy of dialogue and details, and feel more sympathetic and more real than is common in hard science fiction, while not detracting from the fast pace and adventure into the unknown that are the primary goal of the book. Although, one of the five crew members, the geologist, is portrayed so marginally qualified as either an astronaut or a decent person that he feels one-dimensional. For some reason, he's also so similar to real-life astronaut James Reilly, who for several years until 2000 was NASA's only Ph.D. geologist astronaut, it makes me wonder if this is a criticism of NASA's lack of preparation in training qualified geologists to be ready for Mars. The story isn't without a few other flaws. A couple of jarring turns in the story go far beyond mere plot twists and compromise our suspension of disbelief - look out for a murderous rage to appear only to evaporate, and later on, for an even more unexpected decision by two crew members. Perhaps even more disturbing to someone familiar with Zubrin's ideas, was the presence of a historian with no science or engineering training as a fifth crew member, when \\"The Case for Mars\\" is emphatic that on the first mission, even such vital positions as doctor, pilot, and commander should be filled as part-time jobs of qualified full-time scientists and engineers. I'm not sure if Zubrin intended that as a mission flaw imposed by the misguided NASA, as with the Venus flyby trajectory, or if seeing the value of Sam Burbank at the Flashline Mars Arctic Research Station has convinced him that communicating the mission to the public is that much more important than he had previously thought. Whatever the case, the experience on Mars feels very real in this book, as do the dangers the crew face and the heroism with which they respond. It's a quick, classic, gripping adventure in a fascinating new world, one we may be exploring for real in the near future. Overall I loved the book - if you read only one sci fi novel this year, let it be \\"First Landing.\\""},{"Title":"First Landing","review":"Bob Zubrin is a brilliant and original thinker and a lucid, thought-provoking writer when it comes to technical matters. But if he wanted to delve into fiction, he should have partnered with someone like James Hogan or Alan Steele. Based on the mostly raving reviews that this book garnered in Amazon, I rushed out to buy it, expecting to relish Zubrin's talents as a novelist. I was disappointed. The characters are cliches, the dialog is wooden, and the plot is mediocre and lacks inventiveness. Praise for this novel can only be the result of two things: Either Zubrin's well-deserved respect and admiration for his technical vision has undeservedly spilled over into his fiction (the \\"halo effect\\"), or standards for hard sci-fi have fallen even lower than I had feared. Or maybe both.Is there a Federal Law that requires all fictitious accounts of space voyages to have a crew that consists of: 1. One arrogant, cocky, smirking, (but competent) right-stuff ex-military fighter-jockey, 2. One drop-dead gorgeous, brilliant, independent-minded, no-nonsense female scientist who is sensual and yet confident and her own woman, 3. One philosopher poet (preferably with goatee and liberal politics) riddled with qualms and self-doubt, and 4. One competent nice guy (or maybe two because one will surely sacrifice himself to save the crew, to the wailing anguish of his lover). And is there another law that says all conflicts between astronauts must be ego-based? What a dusty old stereotype. There are so many other sources of rich, provocative character conflict. For those who seek a well crafted hard sci-fi novel with memorable, original characters, try The Moon is a Harsh Mistress. Many of the ideas may seem unoriginal, but that's only because they've been copied so many times since RH wrote this yarn over 40 years ago.What do I like to see in hard sci-fi, particularly space exploration? Give me a new world, with new rules and a new lingo, crafted with disciplined imagination. Look, I don't know what type of words or phrases astronauts of the future will use, but they will NOT sound like Apollo or shuttle crews. Gone will be \\"Houston\\" and \\"mission control\\" and \\"roger that, commander\\". Invent new, believable, interesting lingo, words, methods and chatter that flesh out the world of the story. That's what makes sci-fi so much fun and sets it apart from more mundane genres. At least, that's the way it once was. Harsh Mistress paints a fascinating social system based in part on the moon's high ratio of men to women. It's believable, adds more depth and substance to the story, and best of all, it transports the reader into another world that does not exist. RH could have populated his moon with a bunch of cardboard Air Force cadets mouthing military cliches at each other - that would have been the easy thing to do. Instead, he gave us something different - something worthy of the title hard sci-fi.So, you say that First Landing is no worse than a lot of the other stuff gracing the sci-fi shelves at your local Borders Bookshop. Exactly my point. Readers have been steadily lowering their standards over the past 25 to 30 years. Publishers know that if they splash the right pics on the cover and the right keywords in the blurb (aliens, another dimension, captain, mission, after the eco-catastrophe, etc) the public will buy the stuff up, no matter how low quality and derivative the story. With a few exceptions, the state of the genre is pretty dismal and getting worse.Dr Zubrin, I eagerly await your next non-fiction work."},{"Title":"First Landing","review":"After a year in space, the five-person team on board the Beagle are getting ready to land on Mars. The landing, like everything else that follows, does not go smoothly but it does get the astronauts there in one piece. Within the first few weeks there, they have found a gemstone that is harder than a diamond and microorganisms that prove there is life on the red planet.The astronauts are elated by their discovery of life on Mars but on Earth, hysteria sets in, fanned by a popular writer and a televangelist. They fear that the astronauts will bring back some pandemic disease to earth. A fuel line leakage leaves them stranded on Mars and the president, who is up for reelection, is not pushing a rescue mission. This means that the five stranded Americans will have to find a way to get themselves off planet or die when their air and food runs out.Robert Zubrin has written a science fiction that measures up to the works of Author C Clarke and Robert Heinlein. The politics that are involved in a space mission are astounding to behold and the interactions of the five stranded people who have been cooped up together for three years ring true (ever share a house with another generation?). FIRST LANDING is a work of hope, written by a visionary who sees the possibilities in the not too distant future.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"First Landing","review":"It is vision, a discussion of why we should go to Mars, just as much as a novel.

Some day, our heirs will have been on Mars for a while. I wonder what they'll think of this book then."},{"Title":"First Landing","review":"Zubrin's story reaffirms optimism in the dreams and ideals of the Space Age, presenting Mars as the New Frontier that will keep our civilization alive and growing. One reviewer did not like Zubrin's characters, calling them cliches. I disagree. The characters Zubrin used are the right characters that should be in a story like this. I especially appreciate Zubrin's respectful and insightful handling of the clash of worldviews between the liberal agnoticism of the Radcliff-educated Rebecca (the biologist and physician), and the fundamentalist Christian coal-miner's daughter Gwen (the military-trained engineer). Zubrin dared to address the area of moral values, and showed their importance to human motivation. He allowed his characters to change and grow as they came to appreciate one another's differing views. The controlling, manipulative Rebecca came to regret and repent of the way she tried to &quot;trample upon Gwen&quot; and her conscientious convictions, and came to realize that Gwen's refusal to submit to an abortion was absolutely consistent with Rebecca's own love and adoration for life. Few writers in any genre dare to address this subject so boldly and profoundly. WARNING: The following reveals some features of the end of the story, and may be considered &quot;plot spoilers&quot; by some. But I was gleefully delighted with the triumph of all five of the the crew members presented in the epilogue. Rebecca got her Nobel Prize (more than one), the rule-bending, authority-defying leader of the crew, Colonel Townsend, wound up becoming President of the United States, and conservative Gwen got to be the founder of a true colony, along with the steadfast and level-headed Kevin. When they got married, Gwen's amazed thoughts, &quot;I'm getting married in the sky! It's a marriage made in Heaven!&quot; were wonderful. Even the super-Texan, Luke, got to have his own &quot;spread&quot; back in Texas, and made a fortune importing Martian gemstones (which also helped secure the financial success of the colony on Mars). The story contains such delicious moments as when Gwen is about to deliver her baby, and Rebecca orders all men &quot;except the father&quot; to leave the room, and Luke who got Gwen pregnant, and Kevin who had married Gwen after she became pregnant, both stand there looking at each other for a moment, and the women simply &quot;watched curiously&quot; to &quot;see who stays.&quot;"},{"Title":"First Landing","review":"From the first page, Bob Zubrin's latest book pulled me in and wouldn't let me go, and I see I'm not the only one!

Any NASA/world mission to Mars in the next few decades will probably borrow heavily from Zubrin's ideas. None of this guarantees that his fiction will be excellent, but Zubrin lands this novel and brings it back to Earth despite a few glitches. The technical details of the story are excellent. The twists in the plot make this landing on Mars different enough from other Mars books to keep the reader's attention. Most of the problems with the book reside with his characters. Unfortunately, the book is populated with astronauts, ground crew, and politicians that are too cartoonish for my taste. The conflict between Luke Johnson and Dr. Sherman might happen on Earth, but they probably wouldn't get to take it to Mars. And the conflict between Gwen and Dr. Sherman should have been left out entirely; Zubrin could have had his ending without it. Ranting aside, I enjoyed reading the book and would give it 4.4 stars if I could."},{"Title":"First Landing","review":"This is the first fiction book by Bob Zubrin, author of the highly acclaimed book &quot;The Case for Mars&quot;. As with writers such as Isaac Asimov and Sir Arthur Clarke, Zubrin displays a huge talent for writing BOTH science AND science fiction, and First Landing is a great showcase for this talent! I would argue that Bob Zubrin is also one of the greatest visionaries of our time, someone whose work should NOT be missed.First Landing tells the story of the first human landing on Mars. It's an intriguing tale, made all the more plausible and realistic by the fact that Zubin is one of the leading scientists working on plans to explore -- and settle -- the Red Planet.After Hollywood trash such as &quot;Red Planet&quot;, First Landing is a breath of fresh air! If only they had (or perhaps they will or should!) turn First Landing into a movie. It would be fabulous.If you have any interest whatsoever in Mars or in human space exploration -- or even if you are just looking for a book that will portray a thought-provoking glimpse of the future, I can definitely recommend First Landing.(I also highly recommend Bob Zubrin's other books, &quot;The Case for Mars&quot; and &quot;Entering Space&quot;.

About the only short-coming is that the novel is too short. I literally could not put it down.The most compelling reason to read this novel is to glimpse Zubrin's unbounded vision of humanity's limitless future, also expressed in the non-fiction 'The Case for Mars' and 'Entering Space'. Man's destiny is the stars, and we don't have to wait 100 or 1000 years as naysayers would lead us to believe (like those who would have kept our ancestors living in caves).
