The brothers are polar opposites. Walter pines for a sedate life as a farmer, with wife and children; Hewey is a fiddle-footed cowboy content to work at six bits--75 cents--a day on the Pecos River ranch owned by the penny-pinching C.C. Tarpley. Hewey, who \\"usually accepted the vagaries of life without getting his underwear in a twist\\", is fun-loving and whiskey-drinking. He spends every penny he earns and regularly gets into trouble with his boss--and occasionally with the law--often dragging innocent Walter along. When Walter falls in love with a boarding house girl and begins dreaming of a farmer's life, Hewey jumps at the chance to rescue him from this fate worse than death. He convinces Walter to join him on a mission for Tarpley, driving 600 head of cattle from beyond San Antonio to the Double-C ranch on the Pecos. The journey is both memorable and dangerous: a murderous outlaw is searching for Hewey; and another ruthless character is determined to sabotage the cattle drive. When the drovers reach the Pecos they find Boss Tarpley in the midst of a vicious range feud with Eli Jessup, a neighboring cowman. Hewey and his brother Walter have to get the herd safely across Jessup's land-but how? The events of Six Bits a Day precede those of Kelton's bestselling The Good Old Boys (1978, transformed into the memorable 1995 movie starring Tommy Lee Jones and Sissy Spacek), and The Smiling Country (Forge, 1998).

Their contributions reflect not only widely divergent political orientations and value systems, but also three distinct domains of inquiry into human motivation and behavior -- social scientific, psychodynamic (or psychoanalytical), and clinical practice. Each of these three domains is privy to important evidence and insights that need to transcend epistemological and methodological boundaries if understanding of the subject is to improve dramatically. In keeping with this notion, the editors asked the authors to go beyond a summary of findings, and lend additional distinction to the book by applying the \\"binoculars\\" of their particular perspective and offering suggestions as to the implications of their findings. One of the goals of the conference that resulted in this book was consensus building in the area of media and family. From examining the findings and insights of a diverse group of scholars, it seems that consensus building in several areas is a distinct possibility. Addressing the concerns of educators about the influence of the mass media of communication -- entertainment programs in particular -- on children and the welfare of the nuclear family, this volume projects directions for superior programming, especially for educational television. The influence of sex and violence on children and adults is given much attention, and the development of moral judgment and sexual expectations, among other things, is explored. The critical analysis of media effects includes examination of positive contributions of the media, such as the search for missing children and exemplary educational programs.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=0XT_AQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Man a machine (The classics of psychiatry and behavioral sciences library)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=yDyrtwEACAAJ&dq=Man+a+machine+(The+classics+of+psychiatry+and+behavioral+sciences+library)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"November Ever After","description":"The legacy of the Marshall players who perished transcends wins and losses. Their tragic deaths squashed the likelihood of a bloody race riot on campus. The evening of November 14, 1970 was damp and chilly with a steady drizzle and dense fog. Students at Marshall University had no idea that the night s horrific events would change their lives forever. On this night, a plane crash wiped out most of the school s football team. Unless you were there, you could never fully comprehend the gravity of grief that engulfed Huntington, West Virginia, in the days following the worst aviation disaster in the history of American sports. I know. I was there. I ll never forget. It could have been me on that plane. I played football at MU for two seasons. A year before the tragedy, I left the team for personal reasons. When the school began the daunting task of resurrecting its football program in the spring of  71, it was a no-brainer decision for me to rejoin the team and become part of the rebuilding process. Media projects devoted to the plane crash provide well-deserved notoriety. Still, there are glaring omissions. Now, for the first time, former Marshall defensive back Craig T.

Between the years 1950 and 1959, at Menninger and later at the National Institute of Mental Health (as first chief of family studies), he worked clinically with over 500 schizophrenic families. This extensive experience was a time of fruition for his thinking as he began to conceptualize human behavior as emerging from within the context of a family system. Later, at Georgetown University Medical School, Bowen worked to extend the application of his ideas to the neurotic family system. Initially he saw his work as an amplification and modification of Freudian theory, but later viewed it as an evolutionary step toward understanding human beings as functioning within their primary networkDtheir family. One of the most renowned theorist and therapist in the field of family work, this book encompasses the breadth and depth of Bowen's contributions. It presents the evolution of Bowen's Family Theory from his earliest essays on schizophrenic families and their treatment, through the development of his concepts of triangulation, intergenerational conflict and societal regression, and culminating in his brilliant exploration of the differentiation of one's self in one's family of origin.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=4g7PdF6oW6EC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Science of Star Wars: An Astrophysicist's Independent Examination of Space Travel, Aliens, Planets, and Robots as Portrayed in the Star Wars Films and Books","description":"Could the science fiction of Star Wars be the actual science of tomorrow? -How close are we to creating robots that look and act like R2-D2 and C-3PO? -Can we access a \\"force\\" with our minds to move objects and communicate telepathically with each other? -How might spaceships like the Millennium Falcon make the exhilarating jump into hyperspace? -What kind of environment could spawn a Wookiee? -Could a single blast from the Death Star destroy an entire planet? -Could light sabers possibly be built, and if so, how would they work? -Do Star Wars aliens look like \\"real\\" aliens might? -What would living on a desert planet like Tatooine be like? -Why does Darth Vader require an artificial respirator?

Using data on Britain, France, Germany, the USA and the world economy between 1850 and 1973 he refutes the existence of long (Kondratieff) waves in the course of economic development. Instead he presents persuasive evidence for a growth pattern characterised by shock-induced, long-term variations in growth at the level of the world economy. The findings show that national patterns of growth did not necessarily coincide with those of the world economy, but followed episodic long swing fluctuations of twenty to thirty years before the Second World War and trend-accelerated growth in the post-war period. The author provides new historical perspectives on the pre-1913 era, the inter-war years and the post-war boom.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-D_R3R9bfpUC&dq=Phases+of+Economic+Growth,+1850-1973:+Kondratieff+Waves+and+Kuznets+Swings&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Prophetic Sisterhood: Liberal Women Ministers of the Frontier, 1880-1930","description":"An account of Unitarian and Universalist clergywomen on the western frontier in the nineteenth century, this work documents the struggles of a courageous group of nineteenth-century women to find a place in the liberal denominations of American religion.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=yadX3yQrf2kC&dq=Prophetic+Sisterhood:+Liberal+Women+Ministers+of+the+Frontier,+1880-1930&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Anarchist Thinkers and Thought: An Annotated Bibliography (Bibliographies and Indexes in Law and Political Science)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Nashville Insight Fleximap (Fleximaps)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Man-Made Monsters","description":"Life exists all around us, in forms that we can readily and easily identify.

Thus began a singular adventure into various altered states of consciousness, along with a dive deep into both the latest brain science and the thriving underground community of psychedelic therapists. Pollan sifts the historical record to separate the truth about these mysterious drugs from the myths that have surrounded them since the 1960s, when a handful of psychedelic evangelists inadvertently catalyzed a powerful backlash against what was then a promising field of research. A unique and elegant blend of science, memoir, travel writing, history, and medicine, How to Change Your Mind is a triumph of participatory journalism. By turns dazzling and edifying, it is the gripping account of a journey to an exciting and unexpected new frontier in our understanding of the mind, the self, and our place in the world. The true subject of Pollan's \\"mental travelogue\\" is not just psychedelic drugs but also the eternal puzzle of human consciousness and how, in a world that offers us both suffering and joy, we can do our best to be fully present and find meaning in our lives.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3vk5DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Understanding African Philosophy: A Cross-cultural Approach to Classical and Contemporary Issues (Philosophy and the Human Situation)","description":"First published in 2002.

We justifiably fear the hacker, the virus writer and the cyber terrorist. But the disgruntled employee, the thief, the vandal, the corporate foe, and yes, the terrorist can easily cripple an organization by doing physical damage to IT assets. In many cases such damage can be far more difficult to recover from than a hack attack or malicious code incident. It does little good to have great computer security if wiring closets are easily accessible or individuals can readily walk into an office and sit down at a computer and gain access to systems and applications. Even though the skill level required to hack systems and write viruses is becoming widespread, the skill required to wield an ax, hammer, or fire hose and do thousands of dollars in damage is even more common. Although many books cover computer security from one perspective or another, they do not thoroughly address physical security. This book shows organizations how to design and implement physical security plans. It provides practical, easy-to-understand and readily usable advice to help organizations to improve physical security for IT, network, and telecommunications assets. * Expert advice on identifying physical security needs * Guidance on how to design and implement security plans to prevent the physical destruction of, or tampering with computers, network equipment, and telecommunications systems * Explanation of the processes for establishing a physical IT security function * Step-by-step instructions on how to accomplish physical security objectives * Illustrations of the major elements of a physical IT security plan * Specific guidance on how to develop and document physical security methods and procedures","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-X1HHb-3yEoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Isaiah 56-66: A New Translation with Introduction and Commentary (Anchor Yale Bible Commentaries)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=QkovswEACAAJ&dq=Isaiah+56-66:+A+New+Translation+with+Introduction+and+Commentary+(Anchor+Yale+Bible+Commentaries)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Robert Bechtle: A Retrospective","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zSVQAQAAIAAJ&dq=Robert+Bechtle:+A+Retrospective&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Building Powerful Platforms with Windows CE","description":"\\"Building Powerful Platforms with Windows CE\\" is a comprehensive, practical guide on the use of the Microsoft Windows CE Platform Builder.

Augustine of Hippo (354 430), theologian, priest, and bishop, is one of the most important figures in the development of Western Christianity. He is known as much for his long interior struggle that ended with conversion and baptism at age thirty-two as for his influential teachings on human will, original sin and the theology of just war. Cherished as a model for the pursuit of a life of spiritual grace and criticized for his theory of predestination, Augustine is recognized as a living expression of the passion to understand and communicate the deeper meanings of human experience. With fresh translations drawn from Augustine's voluminous writings and probing facing-page commentary, Augustinian scholar Joseph T. Kelley, PhD, provides insight into the mind and heart of this foundational Christian figure. Kelley illustrates how Augustine s keen intellect, rhetorical skill and passionate faith reshaped the theological language and dogmatic debates of early Christianity. He explores the stormy religious arguments and political upheavals of the fifth century, Augustine s controversial teachings on predestination, sexuality and marriage, and the deep undercurrents of Augustine s spiritual quest that still inspire Christians today.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=FnnvO743FlwC&dq=Confessions+(Writings+of+Saint+Augustine)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Going co-op: The complete guide to buying and owning your own apartment","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=AGJiPwAACAAJ&dq=Going+co-op:+The+complete+guide+to+buying+and+owning+your+own+apartment&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Our new land","description":"In 1607, three English ships sail up the James River in Virginia and establish the first permanent English colony.

A complex consortium of international agencies backed by Western governments have been transforming a devastated, ethnically partitioned, post-war territory into a multiethnic, democratic and economically viable state. Despite an enormous investment of personnel and resources, six years later BiHs post-Yugoslav future remains tenuous. Did the engineering project work? In an era when countries from Somalia to Afghanistan are confronting questions of state legitimacy amidst international intervention, Bosnia after Dayton is a fascinating study in the dilemmas of the post-Cold War international order. How effective are international peace-building interventions in fractured states? Is the preservation of a multinational state desirable--or even possible--where the majority of citizens only reluctantly acknowledge its legitimacy? Drawing on the authors extensive field experience, this book takes a hard look at the issues that Bosnia continues to face. Juxtaposing big-picture analysis with an intimate knowledge of the region, Bose situates the international community's extensive program of state-building and democratization in BiH since the Dayton Peace Agreement in \`he context of Bosnia's and the former Yugoslavia's complex historical legacy of coexistence and conflict. Bose tells the gripping story of the divided city of Mostar, and analyzes the institutional structure and process of Dayton Bosnia. He dissects the making of the Dayton peace accords through American-led coercive diplomacy, and provides a constructive critique of international peace-building. A fascinating study of democratization in a divided society, this book promises to be a landmark in the literatures on former Yugoslavia, and international intervention.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=O2nGNMKGYJsC&dq=Bosnia+after+Dayton:+Nationalist+Partition+and+International+Intervention&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Giant Raft: The Cryptogram","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=cqzMmgEACAAJ&dq=Giant+Raft:+The+Cryptogram&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Magnificent Century","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=AYovvgAACAAJ&dq=The+Magnificent+Century&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Living Trees of the World","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=x8D9XwAACAAJ&dq=Living+Trees+of+the+World&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lonely Planet Alaska (5th ed)","description":"Lonely Planet Italy is your passport to the most relevant, up-to-date advice on what to see and skip, and what hidden discoveries await you.

Since the ninth century B.C.E., they had been an integral force in determining the fate of the Middle East, establishing themselves as a major power in the seventh century C.E. and with the rise of the caliphate expanding the borders of the Arab world far beyond the Middle East into North Africa and Spain, and even into France. Since that time, Arab history has been intimately connected with European history. Medieval European arts and sciences would have been unthinkable without the brilliant culture of the Arab empire. Only in the modern era has this relationship been marked by a growing European hegemony, which continues to encumber relations between the West and the Arab world to the present day. In this volume, Heinz Halm offers a compact and comprehensible overview of the history and culture of the Arabs from the first references in the inscriptions of Assyrian kings to the most recent developments of contemporary Arab nations.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=dNDTwAEACAAJ&dq=The+Arabs%3B:+A+short+history&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Inequality, Power and Development: The Task of Political Sociology","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=j1Z5QgAACAAJ&dq=Inequality,+Power+and+Development:+The+Task+of+Political+Sociology&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tatty Ratty","description":"Tatty Ratty, Molly s favourite toy, is lost again.

Comiskey (The Mcfarland Historical Baseball Library, 2)","description":"This biography of Charles  Commy  Comiskey is one of the earliest and most important and, up to now, one of the hardest for baseball researchers to get their hands on in the baseball canon. Comiskey spent half a century in the big leagues as a successful player-manager and owner, his clubs winning nine pennants along the way. But the dark cloud that hangs over him is the 1919 Black Sox scandal, in which he is inextricably tangled, fair or not. Comiskey s tight-fistedness is often cited as a principal cause of the 1919 World Series scandal. Commy suspected that the fix was on after the White Sox lost the first two games, and even implored his old friend, American League president Ban Johnson, to suspend the Series, but the tide of history could not be dammed. Historians of the game will find much valuable insight here on the rise of baseball in the Windy City, Comiskey s playing career (as an innovative first baseman), his long stint as St. Louis Browns player-manager (which included four straight pennants from 1885 to 1888), his helping Johnson form the American League, and his keeping the White Sox a family-owned franchise for nearly 60 years. Surprisingly, this is the only biography of Comiskey ever published. Fortunately, Axelson allows  The Old Roman  to speak for himself briefly in the last seven pages of the book. Here Comiskey comes across as humble and earnest, concluding his message with,  What I have tried to do [in baseball] has been my level best.

Nowhere else could the histories of the guillotine and Guinness stout sit so comfortably alongside the KGB and the Keystone Kops. Brewer's is a catalogue of curiosities and absurdities that, over almost 150 years in print, has acquired near-mythical status. Edited by Susie Dent, this new edition includes a brand new Collection of Curious Words and many new and updated entries. Its pages brim with esoteric and entertaining oddities - everything from curious customs to the world of newspapers and political alliances of yesteryear - all seen through the distinctive Brewer lens. This twentieth edition of Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable encapsulates all the charm and wit that characterise its predecessors and maintains the standards of scholarship and eclecticism that have long been its hallmark. Whether you're a committed Brewerphile or a newcomer to its pages of fascinating entries, this edition will draw you in and keep you glued to its rich mix of eccentric nuggets. As Susie Dent explains in the foreword, Brewer's \\"is unlike any other reference book that exists, anywhere.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Z5jItAEACAAJ&dq=Brewer%27s+Dictionary+of+Phrase+and+Fable&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Honest money","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=D87uCaLUUooC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"lillie of watts","description":"Lillie's first year at Pelham Junior High in Watts is exciting but she faces a difficult decision when the African Culture Club tries to get Malcolm X's birthday declared a holiday.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=7LIEAQAAIAAJ&dq=lillie+of+watts&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Here and Now: Living in the Spirit","description":"Now in paperback, one of America's most popular spiritual writers speaks of finding joy in the midst of the pressures of life, even during times of grief and suffering.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=s5DvIAAACAAJ&dq=Here+and+Now:+Living+in+the+Spirit&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tightrope to Tomorrow: Pensions, Productivity, and Public Education","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=wks_AAAACAAJ&dq=Tightrope+to+Tomorrow:+Pensions,+Productivity,+and+Public+Education&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ages in Chaos","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=005vvgEACAAJ&dq=Ages+in+Chaos&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Husband For A Year (To Have And To Hold) (Romance, 3665)","description":"Husband By Necessity by Lucy Gordon released on Jun 22, 2001 is available now for purchase.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=iHz3GfqSiGEC&dq=Husband+For+A+Year+(To+Have+And+To+Hold)+(Romance,+3665)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Futurehype: The Tyranny of Prophecy","description":"A critique of the ways in which society attempts to solve its problems by attempting to predict the future and thus control it argues that by submitting to private and politicized future agendas, we relinquish control of society and lives","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=JzQqAAAAYAAJ&dq=Futurehype:+The+Tyranny+of+Prophecy&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Essential Exercises for Breast Cancer Survivors","description":"A fitness guide for breast cancer survivors outlines exercises that can help women stay strong and healthy from diagnosis through treatment and recovery.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=4oM7-Uf7R0QC&dq=Essential+Exercises+for+Breast+Cancer+Survivors&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Aardvark Who Wasn't Sure","description":"Pim is a baby aardvark - or at least he thinks he is.

Why was Oswald's file tampered with before the assassination of John Kennedy? And why were significant documents from it removed afterward? Finally, we have answers to these questions, answers not from theories, but from the primary sources themselves. John Newman has interviewed dozens of high-placed officials who have never before spoken candidly on these sensitive issues. He has thoroughly examined the vast body of new material forced into release by the JFK Records Act of 1992. Oswald and the CIA is a devastating report based on indisputable evidence. Written by a historian who spent more than twenty years with the U.S. intelligence community, it is an insider's account of the secret record. Bit by bit, document by document, the reader watches Oswald's file build as it was observed through the eyes of the intelligence officers who actually handled those files. The Oswald paper trail inside the CIA is a gripping journey through the darkest corners of the Agency's Clandestine Services.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0RsXCbfld04C&dq=Oswald+and+the+CIA&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The land of the Bible: A historical geography","description":"Since its first publication in this country, Yohanan Aharoni's informative, fact-filled work has been a prime source in its field.

The spirit of the book is romantic, engaged, and theoretical rather than historical or scientific. Underhill has little use for theoretical explanations and the traditional religious experience, formal classifications or analysis. She dismisses William James' pioneering study, The Varieties of Religious Experience (1902), and his \\"four marks of the mystic state\\" (ineffability, noetic quality, transcience, and passivity). Excerpt: \\"All men, at one time or another, have fallen in love with the veiled Isis whom they call Truth. With most, this has been a passing passion: they have early seen its hopelessness and turned to more practical things. But others remain all their lives the devout lovers of reality: though the manner of their love, the vision which they make to themselves of the beloved object varies enormously.

Beyond all their usual personal and family demands, they must take on the special responsibility of caring for family memers or others with long-term health problems. All the stresses that come with the territory can be overwhelming and make a caregiver feel hopeless at times. With 366 days' worth of wisdom and affirmations, Daily Comforts addresses one caregiving issue per day. An index of topics allows caregivers to find the readings most pertinent to their immediate concerns. Written in the first person, each page of Daily Comforts acts as a caregiver's monologue--as if what is on the page is coming directly from his or her mind. Few meditation books offer this approach. The idea is for the reader to transition from \\"venting\\" to thinking about the issue from a different perspective, to finding a solution. Daily Comforts works like a support system in a pocket by helping both family and professional caregivers cope with isolation, guilt, exhaustion, and frustration. Each reading concludes with an inspiring, practical affirmation designed to help caregivers better care for themselves.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=JegEHCZuyfIC&dq=Daily+Comforts+for+Caregivers&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Definitive Harry Potter Guide Book Series: Bk. 1: The Philosopher's Stone","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=17LiAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Definitive+Harry+Potter+Guide+Book+Series:+Bk.+1:+The+Philosopher%27s+Stone&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Diary of Ephraim Shelby Dodd: Member of Company D, Terry's Texas Rangers, December 4, 1862-January 1, 1864","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=zxM7AQAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Be your own boss: A new direction in dental hygiene","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Lw1qAAAAMAAJ&dq=Be+your+own+boss:+A+new+direction+in+dental+hygiene&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Criminal Investigation","description":"This book is the ideal entry point to learning about criminal investigation and forensics, including both the theoretical and practical aspects of the ways society copes with, and the way law enforcement investigates, crime today.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BJNxgmHeJ0AC&dq=The+Complete+Idiot%27s+Guide+to+Criminal+Investigation&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Managing the Flow of Technology: Technology Transfer and the Dissemination of Technological Information Within the R&D; Organization","description":"As automation and competitiveness between companies and countries grows, the need for the speedy research and delivery of information is becoming greater than ever before. Defining technology transfer as  the process of getting technical knowledge, ideas, services, inventions, and products from their origin to wherever they can be put to practical use , this book, first published in 1991, explores the role of the information specialist in the technology transfer process. It brings together discussions from information mediaries associated with federal information centres, academic research institutions, and a large metropolitan public library. Agencies and organizations at the federal, state, and local level that are involved in and responsible for technology transfer programs are described in a who's who section of the volume, and the system for the distribution of information at NASA is covered in detail, this being considered by some to be the birthplace of the technology transfer concept. The various regional NASA Industrial Application Centers are also identified, and the numerous print and online services available are noted as well. Other topics covered include the use of technology transfer in agricultural programs to improve U.S. competitiveness in the global marketplace and how the large public library can promote technology transfer by acting as important centres for information transfer and research.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=X_vADwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Biblical Hebrew: An Introductory Textbook, Revised edition","description":"In an easy-to-use workbook format, students learn tools for understanding the structure of Hebrew phonology and morphology, nouns, pronouns, adjectives, verbs, and syntax, and gain a reading knowledge of the Hebrew Bible that will last beyond seminary.

Hans Urs von Balthasar. He became her spiritual director and confessor until her death in 1967 during which time Adrienne was favored with many gifts of authentic mystical prayer. Balthasar considered one of the central characteristics of Adrienne's prayer to be her transparency to the inspirations she received from God, along with a deep personal communion with the saints. Over a period of many years, Adrienne would see the saints (and other devout people) at prayer, and she would dictate what she saw to Fr.von Balthasar - while she was in a state of mystical prayer. Through a unique charism, she was able to put herself in the place of various individuals to see and describe their prayer, their whole attitude before God. Not all of her subjects are saints in the strict sense of the word, but all struggled, with varying degrees of success, to place their lives at the disposal of their Creator. This book presents these unique mystical insights into the prayer lives of many saints taken from Adrienne's direct visions of them in prayer. Among the long list of saints in this book are St. John the Apostle, St. Augustine, St. Francis, St. Thomas Aquinas, St. Ignatius of Loyola, St. Teresa of Avila, St. John of the Cross, St. John Bosco, St. Bernadette, St. Dominic, St. Edith Stein and many, many more. In this powerful spiritual work, the reader is able to participate in the devotional and spiritual life of the Church throughout the centuries by learning how numerous saints and devout people prayed, thus reflecting on the timelessness and beauty of the prayer of the Church.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=FPgoDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sketches of Jewish social life in the days of Christ","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=hfkCAAAAQAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Geography of Witchcraft","description":"In this work the author gives detailed evidence for the ascent of Witchcraft set out in his previous volume of The History Witchcraft and Demonology.

Though he never published any of his English poems during his lifetime, George Herbert has been celebrated for centuries as one of the greatest religious poets in the language. In this richly perceptive biography, author and theologian John Drury integrates Herbert s poems fully into his life, enriching our understanding of both the poet s mind and his work. As Drury writes in his preface, Herbert lived  a quiet life with a crisis in the middle of it.  Beginning with his early academic success, Drury chronicles the life of a man who abandons the path to a career at court and chooses to devote himself to the restoration of a church in Huntingdonshire and lives out his life as a country parson. Because Herbert s work was only published posthumously, it has always been difficult to know when or in what context he wrote his poems. But Drury skillfully places readings of the poems into his narrative, allowing us to appreciate not only Herbert s frame of mind while writing, but also the society that produced it. He reveals the occasions of sorrow, happiness, regret, and hope that Herbert captured in his poetry and that led T. S. Eliot to write,  What we can confidently believe is that every poem . . . is true to the poet s experience.   It is hard to imagine a better book for anyone, general reader or seventeenth-century aficionado or teacher or student, newly embarking on Herbert.

Welcome to a world made dangerous by the sea and by those who wish to profit from it. Where a young girl must find her place and her family while trying to survive in a world built for men. As the daughter of the most powerful trader in the Narrows, the sea is the only home seventeen-year-old Fable has ever known. It s been four years since the night she watched her mother drown during an unforgiving storm. The next day her father abandoned her on a legendary island filled with thieves and little food. To survive she must keep to herself, learn to trust no one and rely on the unique skills her mother taught her. The only thing that keeps her going is the goal of getting off the island, finding her father and demanding her rightful place beside him and his crew. To do so Fable enlists the help of a young trader named West to get her off the island and across the Narrows to her father.

During his years at Kidderminster, he attempted to draw contending parties together by an experiment in Christian unity afterwards famous as the Worcestershire Association from which similar movements arose in other English counties. This volume preserves the documents in connection with this movement. It is therefore a historical study. Yet it has a wider purpose. Baxter s Reformed Pastor is a classical writing on the Christian ministry. IT belongs not only to the seventeenth century, but to every generation. In our present time, when in the ministry of all the churches there is a deep searching of heart amidst these difficult days, this book presents both a challenge and an appeal from the pen of this Puritan divine, who styled himself  catholic Christian.

The early 1950s were a boom time for British aviation. The lessons of six years of war had been learned, and much of the research into jet engines, radar, and aerodynamics had begun to reach fruition. In Britain, jet engine technology led the world while wartime developments into swept-wing design in Germany and their transonic research program were used to give western design teams a quantum leap in aircraft technology. The English Electric Lightning emerged at this time. This supersonic fighter aircraft of the Cold War era is perhaps best remembered for its amazing takeoff performance, its exceptional rate of climb, and its immense speed.

He explains precisely why some people turn out to be more resilient than others, the complicated effects of marriage and divorce, negative personality changes, and how to live a more fulfilling, satisfying and rewarding life in the later years. He shows why a person's background has less to do with their eventual happiness than the specific lifestyle choices they make. And he offers step-by-step advice about how each of us can change our lifestyles and age successfully.

In the first half of Kate Zambreno s astoundingly original collection Screen Tests, the narrator regales us with incisive and witty swatches from a life lived inside a brilliant mind, meditating on aging and vanity, fame and failure, writing and writers, along with portraits of everyone from Susan Sontag to Amal Clooney, Maurice Blanchot to Louise Brooks. The series of essays that follow, on figures central to Zambreno s thinking, including Kathy Acker, David Wojnarowicz, and Barbara Loden, are manifestoes about art, that ingeniously intersect and chime with the stories that came before them. \\"If Thomas Bernhard's and Fleur Jaeggy's work had a charming, slightly misanthropic baby with Diane Arbus as nanny it would be Screen Tests. Kate Zambreno turns her precise and meditative pen toward a series of short fictions that are anything but small. The result is a very funny, utterly original look at cultural figures and tropes and what it means to be a human looking at humans.  Amber Sparks  In Screen Tests, a voice who both is and is not the author picks up a thread and follows it wherever it leads, leaping from one thread to another without quite letting go, creating a delicate and ephemeral and wonderful portrait of how a particular mind functions. Call them stories (after Lydia Davis), reports (after Gerald Murnane), or screen tests (inventing a new genre altogether like Antoine Volodine). These are marvelously fugitive pieces, carefully composed while giving the impression of being effortless, with a quite lovely Calvino-esque lightness, that are a joy to try to keep up with.

With 13 kids--seven by birth, six by airport (adopted)--it sometimes felt that way to family members, too. There were those vacations when the entire family jammed into one motel room. There were the excuses: Kari told me she wanted her hair cut that short. Dominic told me the cement was dry. Tony said that Grandma said there wasn't any poison ivy in that area. And, from a child playing with matches in the basement: I didn't know the newspapers would catch fire so quickly and spread to the paint cans. There were the challenges of adopting special needs children and the heartbreak of watching some of those children fail to adapt. Through it all, by the grace of God, much prayer and lots of common sense, the family became an oasis of stability and love.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BlEsAAAACAAJ&dq=Outnumbered!:+Raising+13+Kids+with+Humor+and+Prayer&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Billboard Book of Top 40 R and B and Hip-Hop Hits","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Death in Lacquer Red (A Hilda Johansson Mystery, No. 1)","description":"In 1900 South Bend, Indiana, Swedish maid Hilda Johansson investigates the murder of a missionary woman just back from China.

Its mission was to promote rural development by funding local agribusiness enterprises to create new permanent jobs and new economic activity. In Mission Possible, Ross, president of LAAD from 1972 to 1998, gives a richly detailed insider's account of the company's first three decades.Originally capitalized with a little over $2 million, and beginning with the small economies of Central America, it gradually expanded into the Caribbean islands and South America and now is a factor in 25 countries. To date, LAAD has provided over $300 million to 700 projects, generating tens of thousands of new jobs and new annual exports of $500 million. Always profitable, it has paid a dividend for twenty years. Its capitalization has grown to over $30 million by reinvesting most of its earnings in Latin America. Since LAAD was committed exclusively to Latin America, it had to contend with an often unsettled political environment; it could not simply stand on the sidelines and wait for conditions to improve. Indeed in a broader sense LAAD's mission was to help improve those conditions.Mission Possible describes a small but significant chapter in a broader context of how the world's rich countries have tried to raise living standards among their poorer neighbors. Students of economic development and international business management will learn much from the story of how this unique experiment grew into a dynamic enterprise.\\"[Ross] offers innumerable studies [in Mission Possible] of investment projects that stimulated the commercial production of agricultural produce in the region. He recounts the frustrating negotiations with uncomprehending central bankers and the difficulties of developing marketing and other infrastructural networks that are so important for assuring the success of any business, and is pleased with what he identifies as the two most significant changes that profoundly affected agriculture: the decline in the role of the state in Latin America and in protectionism in the industrialized world. ... He stresses the fundamental roles that innovative entrepreneurs can play, taking advantage of opportunities created by organizations like LAAD, and using market information to reduce uncertainty.\\" -David Barkin, Latin American Research ReviewRobert L. Ross, a Harvard-educated development economist, has worked for forty years in Latin America. He taught economics at the Latin American Economic and Social Planning Institute in Santiago, Chile and worked on the first development plans in Haiti and Paraguay. He was president of the Latin American Agribusiness Development Corporation from 1972 until his retirement in 1998.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=dSFWDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Magic of Believing","description":"Have you ever known someone who expects the best of every situation and always seems to get it?

It is assumed that the reader has a background of advanced calculus, including an introduction to differential equations, complex variables and matrix algebra. A prior exposure to theory of elasticity would be advantageous. Chapters 1-3 deal with sound propagation of plane waves in solids and fluids, and the topics of acoustic impedance and reflection coefficient are given a large emphasis. The topic of flow resistivity is presented in Chapter 2. Chapter 4 deals with sound propagation in porous materials having cylindrical pores. The topics of effective density, and of tortuosity, are presented. The thermal exchanges between the frame and the fluid, and the behaviour of the bulk modulus of the fluid, are described in this simple context. Chapter 5 is concerned with sound propagation in other porous materials, and the recent notions of characteristic dimensions, which describe thermal exchanges and the viscous forces at high frequencies, are introduced. In Chapter 6, the case of porous media having an elastic frame is considered in the context of Biot theory, where new topics described in Chapter 5 have been included.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=kqQICQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Beside Every Good Man: Loving Myself While Standing by Him","description":"The wife of Bishop T.D.

The author has taken unusual care to motivate concepts and to simplify proofs. For example, the book presents - without having defined determinants - a clean proof that every linear operator on a finite-dimensional complex vector space has an eigenvalue. The book starts by discussing vector spaces, linear independence, span, basics, and dimension. Students are introduced to inner-product spaces in the first half of the book and shortly thereafter to the finite- dimensional spectral theorem. A variety of interesting exercises in each chapter helps students understand and manipulate the objects of linear algebra. This second edition features new chapters on diagonal matrices, on linear functionals and adjoints, and on the spectral theorem; some sections, such as those on self-adjoint and normal operators, have been entirely rewritten; and hundreds of minor improvements have been made throughout the text.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ovIYVIlithQC&dq=Linear+Algebra+Done+Right&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"New Orleans Jazz and Second Line Drumming w/CD (Dci Video Transcription Series)","description":"This book is based on performances and transcriptions from the DCI music videos Herlin Riley: Ragtime & beyond, and Johnny Vidacovich: Street beats modern applications.

Edited and written by leading authors in the field, American Independent Cinema: indie, indiewood and beyond offers an examination of the field through four sections that range in focus from broad definitions to close focus on particular manifestations of independence. A wide variety of examples are included but within a framework that offers insights into how these are related to one another. More specifically this collection offers: an account of recent developments as well as reviewing, reassessing and revising a number of central positions, approaches and arguments relating to various parts of the independent and/or indie sector. Individual case studies that range from the distinctive qualities of the work of established 'quality' filmmakers such as Wes Anderson, Steven Soderbergh and Rebecca Miller to studies of horror genre production at the more 'disreputable' end of the independent spectrum. Examples of the limits of independence available in some cases within Hollywood, including studies of the work of Stanley Kubrick and Hal Ashby. Case studies of under-researched areas in the margins of American independent cinema, including the Disney nature films and Christian evangelical filmmaking.

A brilliant writer, first-time mother, and respected biologist, Sandra Steingraber tells the month-by-month story of her own pregnancy, weaving in the new knowledge of embryology, the intricate development of organs, the emerging architecture of the brain, and the transformation of the mother s body to nourish and protect the new life. At the same time, she shows all the hazards that we are now allowing to threaten each precious stage of development, including the breast-feeding relationship between mothers and their newborns. In the eyes of an ecologist, the mother s body is the first environment, the mediator between the toxins in our food, water, and air and her unborn child. Never before has the metamorphosis of a few cells into a baby seemed so astonishingly vivid, and never before has the threat of environmental pollution to conception, pregnancy, and even to the safety of breast milk been revealed with such clarity and urgency. In Having Faith, poetry and science combine in a passionate call to action.  A cross between the quirkily thorough detail of Natalie Angier s science-writing and the passionate environmental advocacy of Rachel Carson. . . . A positively riveting narrative.

It appeared that after decades of feminism, the  women's network  still wasn't able to prevent women being caught off-guard by life. There remained subjects women just didn't talk about, or felt they couldn't talk about. Holes existed in the fabric of women's discourse, and they needed examining. They asked thirty-four women to write about moments in life that had taken them by surprise or experiences that received too little discussion, and then they compiled these pieces into a book. It became an instant number one bestseller, a book clubs' favourite and a runaway success. Dropped Threads, says Anderson, \\"tapped into a powerful need to share personal stories about life's defining moments of surprise and silence.\\" Readers recognized themselves in these honest and intimate stories; there was something universal in these deeply personal accounts. Other stories and suggestions poured in. Dropped Threads would clearly be an ongoing project. Like the first volume, Dropped Threads 2 features stories by well-known novelists and journalists such as Jane Urquhart, Susan Swan and Shelagh Rogers, but also many excellent new writers including teachers, mothers, a civil servant, a therapist. This triumphant follow-up received a starred first review in Quill and Quire magazine, which called it  compassionate and unflinching.  The book deals with such difficult topics as loss, depression, disease, widowhood, violence, and coming to terms with death. Several stories address some of the darker sides of motherhood: - A mother describes how, while sleep-deprived and in a miserable marriage, she is shocked to find infanticide crossing her mind. - Another woman recounts a memory of her alcoholic mother demanding the children prove their loyalty in a terrifying way. - A woman desperate for children refers to the bleak truth as: \\"Another Christmas of feeling barren.\\" Narrating the fertility treatment she undergoes, the hopes dashed, she is amusing in retrospect and yet brutally honest. While they deal with loss and trauma, the pieces show the path to some kind of acceptance, showing the authors  determination to learn from pain and pass on the wisdom gained. The volume also covers the rewards of learning to be a parent, choosing to remain single, or fitting in as a lesbian parent. It explores how women feel when something is missing in a friendship, how they experience discrimination, relationship challenges, and other emotions less easily defined but just as close to the bone: - Alison Wearing in  My Life as a Shadow  subtly describes allowing her personality to be subsumed by her boyfriend's. - Pamela Mala Sinha tells how, after suffering a brutal attack, she felt self-hatred and a longing for retribution. - Dana McNairn talks of her uncomfortable marriage to a man from a different social background: \\"I wanted to fit in with this strange, wondrous family who never raised their voices, never swore and never threw things at one another.\\" Humour, a confiding tone, and beautiful writing elevate and enliven even the darkest stories. Details bring scenes vividly to life, so we feel we are in the room with Barbara Defago when the doctor tells her she has breast cancer, coolly dividing her life into a 'before and after.' Lucid, reflective and poignant, Dropped Threads 2 is for anyone interested in women's true stories.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Y6ERQPMpbUIC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Genetics For Dummies (For Dummies (Math & Science))","description":"A plain-English guide to genetics Want to know more about genetics?

Different as they are from each other, McCullough s subjects have in common a rare vitality and sense of purpose. These are brave companions: to each other, to David McCullough, and to the reader, for with rare storytelling ability McCullough brings us into the times they knew and their very uncommon lives.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-0i43lUIrPcC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Warrior Poet: A Biography of Audre Lorde","description":"Culled from the private writings of the black lesbian feminist poet, this chronicle of her uncompromising life covers Lorde's childhood in Harlem, her groundbreaking career as a poet, her advocacy for various causes, and her final ten years in St. Croix battling breast cancer. 15,000 first printing.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=GV9rAS05c0QC&dq=Warrior+Poet:+A+Biography+of+Audre+Lorde&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The River Devil","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=GcQxtAEACAAJ&dq=The+River+Devil&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Buffett: The Making of an American Capitalist","description":"Since its hardcover publication in August of 1995, Buffett has appeared on the Wall Street Journal, New York Times, San Francisco Chronicle, Los Angeles Times, Seattle Times, Newsday and Business Week bestseller lists.

Maybe one that involves the loss of a loved one, an unwanted transition, a difficult diagnosis, or a dream that fell through. At one time or another, we all deal with disappointments and feelings that life is unfair or that we are being punished. In Renewed, a four-week study of the Book of Ruth, women glean wisdom from Naomi s perspective, a woman who lived a story she didn t choose or like.

With insight from her own journey of living with a story that is not easy, Heather M. Dixon teaches women to flourish even as they live hard stories through a willingness to trust that God can transform them and trade their heartache for hope. They will learn to rely on God s movement in the details of their story, even when it can t be seen, gain confidence to act in the part of their stories that they can change, and watch expectantly for God to redeem the parts they can t.

The Wood for the Trees is the joyful, lyrical portrait of what he found there. With one chapter for each month, we move through the seasons: tree felling in January, moth hunting in June, finding golden mushrooms in September. Fortey, along with the occasional expert friend, investigates the forest top to bottom, discovering a new species and explaining the myriad connections that tie us to nature and nature to itself. His textured, evocative prose and gentle humor illuminate the epic story of a small forest. But he doesn't stop at mere observation. The Wood for the Trees uses the forest as a springboard back through time, full of rich and unexpected tales of the people, plants, and animals that once called the land home. With Fortey's help, we come to see a universe in miniature.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=27G7CwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Recording Industry Sourcebook 2001","description":"Long regarded as the #1 truly reliable directory for the ever changing music industry, this twelfth edition of the Recording Industry Sourcebook is the largest and most informative version yet!

Author Andrew C. Delos a professor emeritus who has used a penname so the work will standon its own merits has delved deep into the Bible and uncovered long-ignored factswhich call into question many of the longest held doctrines and cherished traditions ofChristianity. Was Jesus dead when he was taken from the cross? Did St. Peter ever reallygo to Rome? And was Jesus truly born in Bethlehem or was his place of birth somewhereelse entirely? Those are just some of the provocative questions that Delos explores in thisintriguing and thought-provoking work. Fluent in Greek, Delos combed original texts, comparing them to the King James Version of the Holy Bible, and factored in recent discoveries and commentaries. What emerges is a work of rare insight and intellect as Delos slowly uncovers the real story of the lives and times of Jesus and Paul, every facet presented in fascinating detail. Provocative andprofound, Myths We Live By asks us to question everything we think we mayknow and then provides us with a truer and more illuminating story instead. The trueChristian message of peace and love remains the same (and it's clear that Delos has nodesire to discredit them) but his brilliant historical examination and re-evaluation of thefacts brings forth a richer, and truer, portrait of both Jesus and Paul, one that both biblicalscholars and discerning readers should appreciate.' - Ellen Tanner Marsh, New York Times best-selling author","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=W4bPPQAACAAJ&dq=Myths+We+Live+By+:+From+the+times+of+Jesus+and+Paul&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pooh: His Art Gallery, 8 Watercolor Prints for Framing","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=wbIPAQAAMAAJ&dq=Pooh:+His+Art+Gallery,+8+Watercolor+Prints+for+Framing&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Petrified Wood: The World of Fossilized Wood, Cones, Ferns, and Cycads","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=usMDAAAACAAJ&dq=Petrified+Wood:+The+World+of+Fossilized+Wood,+Cones,+Ferns,+and+Cycads&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Linguistics, 2nd Edition: An Introduction to Language and Communication","description":"This accessible textbook is the only introduction to linguistics in which each chapter is written by an expert who teaches courses on that topic, ensuring balanced and uniformly excellent coverage of the full range of modern linguistics.

With this book, you can help a child cope with such family illnesses. Jonathan feels guilty and afraid. Hurt because his grandfather couldn't spend more time with him, the boy lashed out at Grandpa with mean words. That night, Jonathan learned that the grandfather had suddenly become very sick. Jonathan and his mom then traveled to the city to wait for news about the grandfather's emergency surgery. So begins Jonathan's journey into the \\"no-kid's land\\" of the hospital. Where a child can't yell, play or run. Where the television is always on but often without sound. And worried adults seem not to notice their kids, except to say \\"everything in OK.\\" But children can tell otherwise. Jonathan can only guess what is really happening with Grandpa and why. Did his angry words make Grandpa sick? Will he ever get the chance to say \\"I'm sorry\\" or \\"I love you, Grandpa\\" again? Jonathan's neighbor, a nurse, finds the boy lost in a hospital hallway. With her help, Jonathan finds the way back to his mom and a better understanding of illness, surgery and what he can except while Grandpa is healing.

Even incest is now discussed freely in popular media, but the suicide of a loved one is still an act most people are unable to talk about--or even admit to their closest family or friends. This is just one of the many painful and paralyzing truths author Carla Fine discovered when her husband, a successful young physician, took his own life in December 1989. And being unable to speak openly and honestly about the cause of her pain made it all the more difficult for her to survive. With No Time to Say Goodbye, she brings suicide survival from the darkness into light, speaking frankly about the overwhelming feelings of confusion, guilt, shame, anger, and loneliness that are shared by all survivors. Fine draws on her own experience and on conversations with many other survivors--as well as on the knowledge of counselors and mental health professionals. She offers a strong helping hand and invaluable guidance to the vast numbers of family and friends who are left behind by the more than thirty thousand people who commit suicide each year, struggling to make sense of an act that seems to them senseless, and to pick up the pieces of their own shattered lives. And, perhaps most important, for the first time in any book, she allows survivors to see that they are not alone in their feelings of grief and despair.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=FKCB_tEqCXMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Nelson NB edn: Love and Fame (Yale Nota Bene)","description":"Offers a unified theory of Western culture, identifying major patterns that have endured over the centuries","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8Fx2yBkLIqoC&dq=Nelson+NB+edn:+Love+and+Fame+(Yale+Nota+Bene)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Selected Poems and Two Plays of William Butler Yeats","description":"A collection of works previously published in other collections.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=cn5bAAAAMAAJ&dq=Selected+Poems+and+Two+Plays+of+William+Butler+Yeats&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cop to Call Girl","description":"The author recounts her career with the LAPD, the corruption that caused her disillusionment, and her exploits as a glamorous call girl","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=k2RhvKih2Z0C&dq=Cop+to+Call+Girl&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"PRIVATE ALTARS.

These meditations not only detail and explain the images on the cross itself, but they explain the powerful message of the cross transformation: \\"It speaks to us still, beckoning us to repair our lives, our relationships, our failings in honor of Him who gave his life there on the cross in order for us to become more in the fullness of his presence, to be instruments of peace.

There is no other religious ritual more fascinating, or more disturbing, than exorcism. This is particularly true in America today, where the ancient rite has a surprisingly strong hold on our imagination, and on our popular entertainment industry. We ve all heard of exorcism, seen the movies and read the books, but few of us have ever experienced it firsthand. Conducted by exorcists officially appointed by Catholic archdioceses and by maverick priests sidestepping Church sanctions, by evangelical ministers and Episcopal charismatics, exorcism is alive and well in the new millennium. Oprah, Diane Sawyer, and Barbara Walters have featured exorcists on their shows. The New York Times, Los Angeles Times, Time, and other publications have charted the proliferation of exorcisms across the United States. Last year, the Archdiocese of Chicago appointed its first full-time exorcist in its 160-year history; in New York, four priests have officially investigated about forty cases of suspected possession every year since 1995. American Exorcism is an inside look at this burgeoning phenomenon, written with objectivity, insight, and just the right touch of irony. Michael W. Cuneo attended more than fifty exorcisms and interviewed many of the participantsboth the exorcists who performed the rituals and the people from all walks of life who believed they were possessed by the devil. He brings vividly to life the ceremonies themselves, conjuring up memories of Linda Blair s astonishing performance in the 1973 movie The Exorcist and other bizarre (and sometimes stomach-churning) images. Cuneo dissects, as well, the arguments of such well-known exorcism advocates as Malachi Martin, author of the controversial Hostage to the Devil, self-help guru M. Scott Peck, and self-professed demonologists Ed and Lorraine Warren of Amityville Horror fame. As he explores this netherworld of American life, Cuneo reflects on the meaning of exorcism in the twenty-first century and on the relationship between religious ritual and popular culture. Touching on such provocative topics as the  satanic panics  of the 1980s, repressed memory, and ritual abuse, American Exorcism is a remarkably revealing, consistently entertaining work of cultural commentary.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=8v7tnck6J-oC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Industrial Dynamics","description":"Management and management science;Industrial dynamics; An industrial system; The managerial use of industrial dynamics; Dynamic models of industrial and economic activity; Models; Principles for formulating dynamic system models; Structure of a dynamic system model; System of equations; Symbols for flow diagrams; Representing delays; Policies and decisions; Aggregation of variables; Exogenous variables; Judging model validity; Model of the production-distribution system; Advertising in the system model; A customer-producer-employment case study; Dynamic characteristics of a customer-producer-employment system; Broader applications of dynamic models; Industrial dynamics and management education; Industrial dynamics in business.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=XghPAAAAMAAJ&dq=Industrial+Dynamics&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Demons of the Night: Tales of the Fantastic, Madness, and the Supernatural from Nineteenth-Century France","description":"An anthology of thrillers and chillers from 19th Century France.

By virtue of the originality of his views Machiavelli is now regarded as one of the most controversial, enduring, and realistic political thinkers of all time. Machiavelli undertakes an empirical analysis of political activity, evaluating the quality of a leader on the effectiveness of his actions rather than on his adherence to idealistic moral standards. By dispensing with ethical considerations derived from classical philosophy and Christian theology, The Prince initiated a pragmatic mode of political discourse that is entirely independent of traditional moral authority. By the close of the sixteenth century, Machiavelli's ideas had crystallized into the doctrine of raison d'etat, according to which a ruler is permitted to act independently of ordinary moral codes whenever the interests of the state are at stake. Victor Anthony Rudowski's The Prince: A Historical Critique provides one of the most extensive historical analyses of the content and composition of this great work yet published. Demonstrating that contemporary opinion of Machiavelli has usually rested on interpretation of the final third of The Prince, Rudowski provides a more balanced assessment by fully examining the historical arguments presented in the earlier sections of that great work and those put forth in the Discourses on Livy. This study also devotes an entire chapter to the issue of Machiavelli's cyclical view of history and places his ideas in the context of his hopes for the unification of Italy under one secular leader. With thisbalanced historical perspective, Rudowski's analysis provides contemporary readers with a true appreciation of The Prince's originality and its lasting importance.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=7eOAQgAACAAJ&dq=The+Prince:+A+Historical+Critique+(Twayne%27s+Masterwork+Studies)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Touch of Magic (Signet Regency Romance)","description":"A classic story from one of Signet Regency Romance s brightest stars Award-Winning Author Amanda McCabe.

It is not surprising to find that it has become so once again, because of all the planets in the solar system (apart from Earth), Mars has always been regarded as the most likely to serve as the abode of life. Now that there are hints that the planet may have held liquid water (a prerequisite for life, in contrast to the frozen water of the ice caps) much more recently than anyone had supposed, excitement over Mars exploration has never been higher.In this engaging, eloquent account of our love affair with the Red Planet, William Sheehan and Stephen James O'Meara review the history of human fascination with our neighbor in the solar system, and look at the prospects for manned spaceflight to Mars in this new century. The authors portray the history of Mars investigations through the eyes of the dreamers and achievers that have made the planet such an integral part of the human psyche. They reveal the discoverers' hardships, their strength in the face of criticisms, and the glories of their successes.What Everest and the moon were to the 20th century, Mars will be to the 21st. Mars is our Everest, a new frontier that will continue to spur the greatest flights of imagination and the most astounding technical feats. Projects are already underway to make these dreams a reality. This book will prepare you and fill you with enthusiasm for the adventure ahead.William Sheehan (Willmar, MN) is author of The Planet Mars and the co-author of In Search of Planet Vulcan.

But what possible reason could a warrior have for accepting such restraints? Why should those whose profession can force them into hellish kill-or-be-killed conditions care about such lofty concepts as honor, courage, nobility, duty, and sacrifice? And why should it matter so much to the warriors themselves that they be something more than mere murderers? The Code of the Warrior tackles these timely issues and takes the reader on a tour of warrior cultures and their values, from the ancient Greeks and Romans to the \\"barbaric\\" Vikings and Celts, from legendary chivalric knights to Native American tribesmen, from Chinese warrior monks pursuing enlightenment to Japanese samurai practicing death. Drawing these rich traditions up to the present, the author quests for a code for the warriors of today, as they do battle in asymmetric conflicts against unconventional forces and the scourge of global terrorism","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=4K7uAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Code+of+the+Warrior:+Exploring+Warrior+Values+Past+and+Present&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The American heritage history of World War I,","description":"A comprehensive and riveting account of the six-year global conflict that transformed world politics and shaped the course of modern history includes hundreds of haunting images from renowned war photographers.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=qASnQwAACAAJ&dq=The+American+heritage+history+of+World+War+I,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Eye to Eye","description":"Profiles a series of animals with unusual eyes and explains how such animals use their uniquely evolved eyes to gain essential information about the biological world.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=pvUUAgAAQBAJ&dq=Eye+to+Eye&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Complete Guide to Second Homes for Vacations, Retirement, and Investment","description":"The Complete Guide to Second Homes for Vacations, Retirement, and Investment Choosing the perfect location Finding the right home Forecasting investment potential How to save thousands on financing Here's the knowledge you need to find, buy, and get the most fun and profit from your second home If you've been thinking about buying a second home for getaways, vacations, investment, or retirement, now is the time to do it.

He finds it in the form of the weekly newspaper Cosy Moments, a completely bland and inoffensive publication at which, through charm and sheer force of personality, Psmith appoints himself an unpaid subeditor, fires the entire contributing staff, and embarks on a crusade against the slumlords, gangs, and boxing managers of his holiday destination. Psmith, Journalist is the third of Wodehouse s Psmith novels, and is a marked departure from the author s usual settings and themes. It presents a very strong social justice theme with direct, harsh condemnation of exploitation, corruption, racism, and inequality in early-twentieth century America, and its themes continue to resonate with readers a century later.

Throughout her life Moore arranged and rearranged, visited and revisited, a large majority of her existing poetry, always adding new work interspersed among revised poems. This makes sorting out the complex textual history that she left behind a pressing task if we mean to represent her work as a poet in a way that gives us a complete picture. New Collected Poems offers an answer to the question of how to represent the work of a poet so skillful and singular, giving a portrait of the range of her voice and of the modernist culture she helped create. William Carlos Williams, remarking on the impeccable precision of Moore s poems, praised  the aesthetic pleasure engendered when pure craftsmanship joins hard surfaces skillfully.  It is only in New Collected Poems that we can understand her later achievements, see how she refashioned her earlier work, and get a more complete understanding of her consummate craftsmanship, innovation, and attention to detail. Presented and collected by Heather Cass White, the foremost scholar of Moore s work, this new collection at last allows readers to experience the untamed force of these dazzling poems as the author first envisioned them.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Cc6YDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Merriam-Webster's Visual Dictionary","description":"More than 20,000 words in the English language are grouped into similar categories--such as astronomy, house, human being, plants and society--and explained using detailed, labeled illustrations.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=587CngEACAAJ&dq=Merriam-Webster%27s+Visual+Dictionary&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Meister Eckhart, from Whom God Hid Nothing: Sermons, Writings, and Sayings","description":"This introduction to the writing and preaching of the greatest medieval European mystic contains selections from his sermons, treatises, and sayings, as well as Table Talk, the records of his informal advice to his spiritual children.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=h1tszkAj43QC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Piloting at Night","description":"An emotionally charged debut novel of a family on the brink--an autistic child, his determined mother, and her distant father--who learn that when your world changes, you find out who you really are. . . .

But at home, he was a controlling and overbearing presence in her life, raining emotional and verbal abuse upon the entire family. It's no surprise, then, that as an adult, Piper has poured all of her energy into creating a warm and loving home for her own family, while catering to her son Fred's ever-growing idiosyncrasies. Then Lance has a heart attack, leaving him with a brain injury--and dependent upon Piper for his care--just before tests confirm Piper's suspicions that Fred is on the autism spectrum. A powerful and extraordinary novel, Flying at Night gives voice to Fred, trying to find his place in a world that doesn't quite understand him; to Lance, who's lost what made him the man he was, for better and worse; and to Piper, who, while desperately trying to navigate the shifting landscape around her, watches as her son and father start to connect--in the most miraculous ways. . . .","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=6ussDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Kaizen Teian 1: Developing Systems for Continuous Improvement Through Employee Suggestions","description":"Kaizen teian-- the Japanese-style proposal system for continuous improvement -- is the most direct and effective method for channeling employees' creative energies and hands-on insight.

These questions are fundamental to quantifying the productivity of the education sector. The studies in Productivity in Higher Education use rich and novel administrative data, modern econometric methods, and careful institutional analysis to explore productivity issues. The authors examine the returns to undergraduate education, differences in costs by major, the productivity of for-profit schools, the productivity of various types of faculty and of outcomes, the effects of online education on the higher education market, and the ways in which the productivity of different institutions responds to market forces. The analyses recognize five key challenges to assessing productivity in higher education: the potential for multiple student outcomes in terms of skills, earnings, invention, and employment; the fact that colleges and universities are  multiproduct  firms that conduct varied activities across many domains; the fact that students select which school to attend based in part on their aptitude; the difficulty of attributing outcomes to individual institutions when students attend more than one; and the possibility that some of the benefits of higher education may arise from the system as a whole rather than from a single institution.

Horowitz (American studies, Smith College) looks at Friedan's life from her childhood in Peoria, Illinois through her wartime years at Smith College and Berkeley, to her decade-long career as a writer for two radical labor journals, the Federated Press and the United Electrical Workers' UE News. He argues that this history, combined with the fact that Friedan continued to work on behalf of many social causes after her marriage, contradicts Friedan's claim that her commitment to women's rights grew solely out of her experience as an alienated suburban housewife.

Based on the Didsbury Lectures delivered by Clements at British Isles Nazarene College in October 1989, 'Wisdom in Theology' first looks at the wisdom tradition in terms of its ancient Near Eastern background, it distinctiveness in Israelite life, and its historical development. Clements then discusses major wisdom themes under various headings: (1) wisdom and the world, (2) wisdom and health, (3) wisdom and politics, (4) wisdom and the household, and (5) wisdom and the divine realm. In explicating the unique role of the wisdom tradition, particularly in post-exilic Israel, Clements shows how wisdom, as opposed to the torah and prophecy, provided the Jews of the dispersion with the basis for a new, noncultic, universalistic worldview. Clements's scholarly discussion demonstrates to modern readers how much is yet to be learned regarding the inheritance of wisdom from the ancient world.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=L6RLAwAAQBAJ&dq=Wisdom+in+Theology+(Didsbury+Lectures)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Jacques Brel L'oeuvre Integrale (French Edition)","description":"En France, tout finit par des chansons' is the well-known phrase which sums up the importance of chanson for the French. A song tradition that goes back to the Middle Ages and troubadours of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, chanson is part of the texture of everyday life in France - a part of the national identity and a barometer of popular taste. In this first study of chanson in English, Peter Hawkins examines the background to the genre and the difficulties in defining what is and what is not chanson. The focus then moves to the development of the singer-songwriter of chanson from 1880 to the present day. This period saw the emergence of national icons from Aristide Bruant at the end of the nineteenth century through to internationally recognized musicians such as Jacques Brel and Serge Gainsbourg. Each of these figures used chanson to express the particular moral dilemmas, tragic situations and moments of euphoria particular to themselves and their times. The book provides bibliographies, discographies and details of video recordings for each of the singer-songwriters that it discusses. It is both an essential reference guide to the genre and a useful case history of the adaptation of an ancient form to the demands of the modern mass media.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=zW9QDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tranquebar","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=x7JFAAAAIAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Rancher, The Baby & The Nanny (Stallion Pass)","description":"A RANCHER IN NEED Rodeo rider Wyatt Sawyer was used to handling bucking broncos, not babies!

The two victims were an elderly couple, John and Wilhelmina Geyser, who lived on a farm on the edge of the mesa. Within minutes of discovering the crime, neighbors subdued and tied up the alleged killer, Jos? Gabriel, a sixty-year-old itinerant Native American handyman from El Rosario, California, who worked for the couple. Since Gabriel was apprehended at the scene, most presumed his guilt. The local press, prosecutors, witnesses, and jurors called him by the epithet ?Indian Joe.? ? The sensational murder trial of Gabriel highlights the legal injustices committed against Native Americans in the nineteenth century. During this time, California Native Americans could not vote or serve on juries, so from the outset Gabriel was unlikely to receive a fair trial. No motive for murder was established, and the evidence against Gabriel was inconclusive. Nonetheless, the case went forward. Drawing on court testimony and newspaper accounts, Clare V. McKanna Jr. traces the murder trial: the handling of the case by the prosecution, the defense, the jury, and the judge; an examination of the crime scene; and the imaging of ?Indian Joe.? Through his considerable research, McKanna sheds light on a dark time in the American legal system.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ug0sK_0SE9wC&dq=The+Trial+of+%22Indian+Joe%22:+Race+and+Justice+in+the+Nineteenth-Century+West+(Law+in+the+American+West)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Nice Girls Don't Get the Corner Office: 101 Unconscious Mistakes Women Make That Sabotage Their Careers","description":"If you work nonstop without a break...worry about offending others and back down too easily...explain too much when asked for information....or \\"poll\\" your friends and colleagues before making a decision, chances are you have been bypassed for promotions and ignored when you expressed your ideas.

While Pike Logan and Jennifer Cahill prepare to join their team on a counter-terrorist mission in the triple frontier the lawless tri-border region where Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay meet they are targeted in Charleston, South Carolina. A vicious explosion kills a friend, and the perpetrators have set it up to look like an accident. While the authorities believe this was not foul play, Pike knows the attack was meant for him.

His men are the closest thing to family that Pike has, which means he will do anything, even ignore direct orders to stand down, to find them. Pike and Jennifer head to Brazil to investigate their disappearance and run headlong into a crew of Russian assassins. Within days they are entangled in a byzantine scheme involving Brazilian politics and a cut-throat battle for control of offshore oil fields. Forged in combat, the Russians are the equal of anything the Taskforce has encountered before, but they make a mistake in attacking Pike s team, because Pike has a couple of elite Israeli assassins of his own.

The predictive powers of thermodynamics are so great that those aspiring to model earthquake and the Earth's interior will certainly wish to be able to use the theory. Thermodynamics is our only method of understanding and predicting the behavior of many environmental, atmospheric, and geological processes. The need for Earth scientists to develop a functional knowledge of thermodynamic concepts and methodology is therefore urgent. Sources of an entropy increase the dissipative and self-organizing systems driving the evolution and dynamics of the Universe and Earth through irreversible processes. The non-linear interactions lead to the formation of fractal structures. From the structural phase transformations the important interior boundaries emerge. Non-linear interactions between the defects in solids lead the authors to develop the physics of continua with a dense distribution of defects. Disclinations and dislocations interact during a slow evolution as well as during rapid dynamic events, like earthquakes. Splitting the dynamic processes into the 2D fault done and 3D surrounding space brings a new tool for describing the slip nucleation and propagation along the earthquake faults. Seismic efficiency, rupture velocity, and complexity of seismic source zone are considered from different points of view, fracture band earthquake model is developed on the basis of thermodynamics of line defects, like dislocations. Earthquake thermodynamics offers us a microscopic model of earthquake sources. Physics of defects helps the authors decscribe and explain a number of precursory phenomena caused by the buildup of stresses. Anomalies in electric polarization and electromagnetic radiation prior to earthquakes are considered from this point of view. Through the thermodynamic approach, the authors arrive at the fascinating question of posssibility of earthquake prediction. In general, the Earth is considered here as a multicomponent system. Transport phenomena as well as wave propagation and shock waves are considered in this system subjected also to chemical and phase transformations.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=z0x5Z4EjP6QC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Hutton Settlement: A Home for One Man's Family","description":"The Hutton Settlement in Spokane, Washington, is a remarkable embodiment of philanthropy, altruism, and stewardship.

This dual memoir gives an intensely human dimension to that struggle, with Hermann narrating all that happened to him from the day he was abducted from the Warsaw airport to his release five years later, and Kate relating her unrelenting efforts to find her husband. Thousands of potential victims of Hitler?s dragnet were rescued in 1939 and during World War II through separate efforts of the Field brothers. Arrested in Czechoslovakia in 1949, Noel was taken to Hungary and used as an example of American perfidy in show trials. Hermann went to Poland primarily to find out what had happened to his brother. After Hermann?s abduction, he was taken to the cellar of a secret Polish prison, where he was held for five years. He gives us a detailed account of his battle to survive, alternating despair and horror with mordant humor. Meanwhile, his family had no idea whether he was still alive and if so, where. This moving story, based on detailed notes made by the authors during and shortly after the events described, presents an inside-outside counterpoint, as Hermann?s chapters on his inward journey in his cellar world alternate with Kate?s efforts in London to find him by scrutinizing accounts of political events in Eastern Europe for clues and penetrating the diplomatic corridors of power in the West for help. Hermann had been arrested by a Polish security agent who later defected and became one of the West?s most important informants on Soviet operations in Eastern Europe. The search for the Field brothers was complicated by their history of leftist connections, for this tense period in the Cold War was also the era of McCarthyism in the United States. The book ends with an Epilogue that analyzes the events of fifty years ago in the light of what we know today, as the result of newly available archival material.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=YBIyiXMu0uUC&dq=Trapped+in+the+Cold+War:+The+Ordeal+of+an+American+Family&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Wild Bill Hickok, Gunfighter: an Account of Hickok's Gunfights","description":" James Butler Hickok, generally called  Wild Bill,  epitomized the archetypal gunfighter, that half-man, half-myth that became the heir to the mystique of the duelist when that method of resolving differences waned. . . .

Hickok s gunfights were unusual in that most of them were  fair  fights, not just killings resulting from rage, jealousy over a woman, or drunkenness. And, the majority of his encounters were in his role as lawman or as an individual upholding the law. --from Wild Bill Hickok, Gunfighter Wild Bill Hickok (18371876) was a Civil War spy and scout, Indian fighter, gambler, and peace officer.

Rosa, the world s foremost authority on Hickok, provides an informative examination of Hickok s many gunfights. Rosa describes the types of guns used by Hickok and illustrates his use of the plains  style of  quick draw,  as well as examining other elements of the Hickok legend. He even reconsiders the infamous  dead man s hand  allegedly held by Hickok when he was shot to death at age thirty-nine while playing poker. Numerous photographs and drawings accompany Rosa s down-to-earth text.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=z9et1whM2lIC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Teeth & Spies","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Black Hills ghost towns","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BM_vpwAACAAJ&dq=Black+Hills+ghost+towns&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sailing small boats","description":"For the first time ever, a comparative survey of 95 percent of the fiberglass pocketcruising sailboats ever built Author Steve Henkel has researched hundreds of cruising sailboats less than 26 feet long--pocket cruisers--to create this definitive gallery and handbook of the small cruising sailboats built in the last 45 years.

Given the importance of forests in battling climate change and the fact that old-growth forests are shrinking at a rate of 0.5% per year, these new results have come not a moment too soon. This book is the first ever to focus on the ecosystem functioning of old-growth forests. It is an exhaustive compendium of information that contains original work conducted by the authors. In addition, it is truly global in scope as it studies boreal forests in Canada, temperate old-growth forests in Europe and the Americas, and global tropical forests.

Kennedy (American Presidency Series)","description":"The young president who brought vigor and glamour to the White House while he confronted cold war crises abroad and calls for social change at home John Fitzgerald Kennedy was a new kind of president. He redefined how Americans came to see the nation's chief executive. He was forty-three when he was inaugurated in 1961 the youngest man ever elected to the office and he personified what he called the \\"New Frontier\\" as the United States entered the 1960s. But as Alan Brinkley shows in this incisive and lively assessment, the reality of Kennedy's achievements was much more complex than the legend. His brief presidency encountered significant failures among them the Bay of Pigs fiasco, which cast its shadow on nearly every national-security decision that followed. But Kennedy also had successes, among them the Cuban Missile Crisis and his belated but powerful stand against segregation. Kennedy seemed to live on a knife's edge, moving from one crisis to another Cuba, Laos, Berlin, Vietnam, Mississippi, Georgia, and Alabama. His controversial public life mirrored his hidden private life. He took risks that would seem reckless and even foolhardy when they emerged from secrecy years later. Kennedy's life, and his violent and sudden death, reshaped our view of the presidency. Brinkley gives us a full picture of the man, his times, and his enduring legacy.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Tin3SY0pxpgC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"South Lake Tahoe Climbing","description":"This book covers South Lake Tahoe's top crags from the smooth, Yosemite-like cracks at Sugarloaf, the steep knobs at Phantom Spires, and the giant dikes at Lover's Leap.

The mind in question belongs to Zeno Cosini, a neurotic Italian businessman who is writing his confessions at the behest of his psychiatrist. Here are Zeno s interminable attempts to quit smoking, his courtship of the beautiful yet unresponsive Ada, his unexpectedand unexpectedly happymarriage to Ada s homely sister Augusta, and his affair with a shrill-voiced aspiring singer. Relating these misadventures with wry wit and a perspicacity at once unblinking and compassionate, Zeno s Conscience is a miracle of psychological realism.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=enreBgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Instant Enterprise JavaBeans","description":"Build fully functional Java-based components with this ultimate collection of expert techniques and ready-to-use code.

Original and provocative in its reflections, Keynes and the Neoclassical Synthesis not only offers a fresh interpretation of Keynes but makes an important contribution to debates within post-Keynesian economics.

Small-town Appalachia doesn't have a lot going for it, but it's where Brian is from, where his family is, and where he's chosen to return to die. Set in 1986, a year after Rock Hudson's death brought the news of AIDS into living rooms and kitchens across America, Lambda Literary award-winning author Carter Sickels's second novel shines light on an overlooked part of the epidemic, those men who returned to the rural communities and families who'd rejected them. Six short years after Brian Jackson moved to New York City in search of freedom and acceptance, AIDS has claimed his lover, his friends, and his future. With nothing left in New York but memories of death, Brian decides to write his mother a letter asking to come back to the place, and family, he was once so desperate to escape. The Prettiest Star is told in a chorus of voices: Brian's mother Sharon; his fourteen-year-old sister, Jess, as she grapples with her brother's mysterious return; and the video diaries Brian makes to document his final summer. This is an urgent story about the politics and fragility of the body, of sex and shame. Above all, Carter Sickels's stunning novel explores the bounds of family and redemption. It is written at the far reaches of love and understanding, centering on the moments where those two forces stretch toward each other and sometimes touch.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5MvyzQEACAAJ&dq=The+Prettiest+Star&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Four Arrows Squadron: A Novel of the Great War","description":"Four Arrows Squadron did not exist, but American pursuit aviation on the western front in 1918 did.

The present policies of donor agencies and of governments themselves favour the self help approach and encourage the poor to seek their own housing solutions. But in spite of the rigorous attempts of developing countries the problem of the provision of low-income housing remains unsolved. Considering, the high population growth rate in Pakistan, the problem is likely to remain very severe in the forseeable future.

Donald Trump's campaign chairman went to jail. So did his personal lawyer. His long-time political consigliere was convicted of serious federal crimes, and his national security advisor pled guilty to others. Several Russian spies were indicted in absentia. Career intelligence agents and military officers were alarmed enough by the president's actions that they alerted senior government officials and ignited the impeachment process. Yet despite all this, a years-long inquiry led by special counsel Robert Mueller, and the third impeachment of a president in American history, Donald Trump survived to run for re-election. Why? Jeffrey Toobin's highly entertaining definitive account of the Mueller investigation and the impeachment of the president takes readers behind the scenes of the epic legal and political struggle to call Trump to account for his misdeeds. With his superb storytelling and analytic skills Toobin recounts all the mind-boggling twists and turns in the case--Trump's son met with a Russian operative promising Kremlin support! Trump paid a porn star $130,000 to hush up an affair! Rudy Giuliani and a pair of shady Ukrainian-American businessmen got the Justice Department to look at Russian-created conspiracy theories! Toobin shows how Trump's canny lawyers used Mueller's famous integrity against him, and how Trump's bullying and bluster cowed Republican legislators into ignoring the clear evidence of the impeachment hearings. Based on dozens of interviews with prosecutors in Mueller's office, Trump's legal team, Congressional investigators, White House staffers, and several of the key players, including some who are now in prison, True Crimes and Misdemeanors is a revelatory narrative that makes sense of the seemingly endless chaos of the Trump years.

It convincingly argues that if the war had continued after 1856, the First World War would have taken place 60 years earlier, but that fighting ultimately ceased because diplomacy never lost its control over the use of war as an instrument in power politics. With 19 images, 13 maps and additional tables as well as a brand new chapters on 'the medical services', this expanded and fully-updated 2nd edition explores * The origins and diplomacy of the Crimean War * The war aims and general attitudes of the belligerent powers (Russia, France, and Britain), non-belligerent German powers (Austria and Prussia) and a selected number of neutral powers, including the United States * The characteristics and capabilities of the armies involved * The nature of the fighting itself The Crimean War: 1853-1856 examines the conflict in both its Europe-wide and global contexts, moving beyond the five great European powers to consider the role and importance of smaller states and theatres of war that have otherwise been under-served. To this end, it looks at fighting on the Danube front, the Black Sea, the Baltic Sea, the Caucasian battlefield, as well as the White Sea and the Pacific, with final chapters devoted to the Paris peace congress of 1856, the end of the war and its legacy.

Rejecting the dry insider's air of knowing punditry, Leo's conversational style and acerbic wit engage the reader with his insightful and humorous views of what is going on in education, law, advertising, television, the news media, language, and the various liberation movements that are shaping-and sometimes convulsing-the country.The unifying thread of Incorrect Thoughts is the emergence of Political Correctness and its diffusion throughout American social and cultural life. Most of the media have viewed the rise of PC as a collection of unimportant oddball anecdotes, but Leo perceives it as a coherent social movement sweeping through colleges and schools, the courts, the media, the feminist movement, and the art world. Its goals are traditional goals of the left-equality, inclusion, liberation, racial justice-but, as Leo notes, the tactics employed are often less than noble and the contempt for tradition, standards, and Western culture has grown each year.The new orthodoxy has developed a taste for censorship and coercion. Speech codes and anti-harassment policies are used as weapons to silence and intimidate opponents. Speakers have been shouted down and whole editions of college newspapers stolen to keep students from reading the arguments of conservatives and moderates. Readers will find here judicious and often devastating appraisals of self-esteem and therapeutic trends in education, of efforts to revamp history along multicultural lines, and of the extremities and absurdities of identity politics among other of the latest fashions in radical chic.Drawing from ideas first presented in his U.S. News and World Report columns Leo charts the political fever of a contentious and disordered period in American society. At the same time his pointed humor, long-term perspective, and strong moral edge ensures his continuing importance to the debates of our time. This book will interest those who share Leo's concerns as well as those who appreciate models for incisive political commentary.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WxLmtAEACAAJ&dq=Incorrect+Thoughts:+Notes+on+Our+Wayward+Culture&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Fire Inside: Firefighters Talk About Their Lives","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Vox Diccionario De Sinonimos Y Antonimos","description":"Un diccionario para mejorar el dominio de la lengua y expresarse con precisi n al hablar y escribir. 13 600 entradas 55 000 sin nimos y ant nimos 3 200 citas y comentarios Un diccionario para mejorar el dominio de la lengua Una obra manejable por su formato y puesta en p gina Un repertorio esencial del vocabulario de la lengua espa?ola utilizada en Am rica y Espa?a Adaptado a la norma ortogr fica de la RAE","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=KdeZtgAACAAJ&dq=Vox+Diccionario+De+Sinonimos+Y+Antonimos&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Blue-Eyed Salaryman","description":"Why on earth would anyone give up a life on the open road for the regimen of a vast Japanese conglomerate?

The  Law of Attraction,  or the new buzzword,  The Secret,  points to the universal principle that  like attracts like  and if we hold to the principle that our thoughts are creative, then the wise application of the Law of Attraction would be to think about what you want (the positive) and not about what you don t want (the negative). That s one way a person can consciously work with this law. However, the mainstay of what we attract corresponds to what we hold to be true, and how we truly feel about ourselves. So changing our thoughts, thinking about the positive (and not the negative), is a surface approach which has some positive effect but it does not get to the root of the issue which the concepts we hold about ourselves, our place in the world, and our relationship to Universal Spirit.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=TtQuEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Beyond the Lemonade Stand","description":"The winner of the television show The Apprentice offers ideas for twenty kids' businesses, the pros and cons of each, and tips on business plans and getting started.

In England and America, the tension between conflict and community was resolved in a manner consistent with political stability. In France, the tension produced an instability that has surfaced periodically throughout subsequent French history. Why this is so is the subject of a work that treats the making of the modern political world in an unusually systematic way. In France, England, and America, the relationship of the state to society under the prerevolutionary regime limited revolutionary options. Sa'adah focuses on how this relationship created a politics of exclusion in France, while allowing a politics of transaction in England and America. Originally published in 1990.

An old man and a six-year-old prodigy have a rendezvous to play chess at a forlorn railroad station. Randomly riding trains, a woman keeps company with a strange assembly of men. An unemployed historian falls in love with an enigmatic astrologer, and the two live out their tragedy in the streets of Havana as homeless vagrants. A father and son take an aimless stroll after lunch to see the whores along the Malecon, Havana's seaside promenade. A young man, one of the last Cuban students to go to the Soviet Union on a foreign-study program, returns to Havana, where he explores his identity-looking at childhood photos with his grandfather, spending time with old friends, and obsessively seeking news of a woman he had known and loved in Russia. In a style both lucid and translucent, Ponte shapes intricate stories of self-discovery and metaphysical revelation in spare and allusive prose. About the Authors Antonio Jose Ponte was born in 1964 in Matanzas, Cuba, and studied at the University of Havana. He worked for some years as an engineer, and then as a screenwriter. In addition to writing short stories and fiction, Ponte has published prize-winning collections of poetry and essays. His work has been published in France, Germany, and Spain. This is his first book to be published in the United States. Cola Franzen is the translator of over twenty books, including Poems of Arab Andalusia, Dreams of the Abandoned Seducer by Alicia Borinsky, and Horses in the Air by Jorge Guillen (recipient of the Academy of American Poets Harold Morton Landon Translation Award 2000). Review \\"In his first book to be published in the U.S., Ponte gives readers a short collection of six elliptical stories from inside the Cuban revolutionary experience, closer in spirit to the fiction of Eastern European dissidents than to that of Caribbean fabulists, unlike exiled writers who see the island as either a mythical homeland or a political cause.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Gl4kUnTckUQC&dq=In+the+Cold+of+the+Malecon+and+Other+Stories&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A House Divided: Slavery and Emancipation in Delaware, 1638-1865 (Carter G. Woodson Institute Series)","description":"Delaware stood outside the primary streams of New World emancipation. Despite slavery's virtual demise in that state during the antebellum years and Delaware's staunch Unionism during the Civil War itself, the state failed to ratify the Thirteenth Amendment, which prohibits slavery, until 1901. Patience Essah takes the reader of A House Divided through the introduction, evolution, demise, and final abolition of slavery in Delaware. In unraveling the enigma of how and why tiny Delaware abstained from the abolition mandated in northern states after the American Revolution, resisted the movement toward abolition in border states during the Civil War, and stubbornly opposed ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment, she offers fresh insight into the history of slavery, race, and racialism in America. The citizens of Delaware voluntarily freed over 90 percent of their slaves, yet they declined Lincoln's 1862 offer of compensation for emancipation, and the legislature persistently foiled all attempts to mandate emancipation. Those arguing against emancipation expressed fears that it inadvertently would alter the delicate balance of political power in the state. What Essah has found at the base of the Delaware paradox is a political discourse stalemated by instrumental appeals to racialism. In showing the persistence of slavery in Delaware, she raises questions about postslavery race relations. Her analysis is vital to an understanding of the African-American experience.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=n3ZLDt5yes8C&dq=A+House+Divided:+Slavery+and+Emancipation+in+Delaware,+1638-1865+(Carter+G.+Woodson+Institute+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Applied Behaviour Analysis and Autism","description":"Autism was once thought of as a rare condition, until the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention s Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring Network released the statistic that about 1 in every 150 eight-year-old children in various areas across the United States is afflicted by an autism spectrum disorder, or ASD. This news led to a dramatic expansion of research into autism spectrum disorders and to the emergence of applied behavior analysis (ABA) as the preferred method of treatment, even among prescribing practitioners. Applied Behavioral Analysis for Children with Autism Spectrum Disorders ably synthesizes research data and trends with best-practice interventions into a comprehensive, state-of-the-art resource. Within its chapters, leading experts review current ABA literature in depth; identify interventions most relevant to children across the autism spectrum; and discuss potential developments in these core areas: Assessment methods, from functional assessment to single case research designs. Treatment methods, including reinforcement, replacement behaviors, and other effective strategies. The role of the differential diagnosis in ABA treatment planning. Specific deficit areas: communication, social skills, stereotypies/rituals. Target behaviors, such as self-injury, aggression, adaptive and self-help problems. ASD-related training concerns, including maintenance and transition issues, and parent training programs.

Roosevelt transform an American nation in crisis. They were the junior officers of the New Deal. Thomas G. Corcoran, Benjamin V. Cohen, William O. Douglas, Abe Fortas, and James Rowe helped FDR build the modern Democratic Party into a progressive coalition whose command over power and ideas during the next three decades seemed politically invincible. This is the first book about this group of Rooseveltians and their linkage to Lyndon Johnson's Great Society and the Vietnam War debacle. Michael Janeway grew up inside this world. His father, Eliot Janeway, business editor of Time and a star writer for Fortune and Life magazines, was part of this circle, strategizing and practicing politics as well as reporting on these men. Drawing on his intimate knowledge of events and previously unavailable private letters and other documents, Janeway crafts a riveting account of the exercise of power during the New Deal and its aftermath. He shows how these men were at the nexus of reform impulses at the electoral level with reform thinking in the social sciences and the law and explains how this potent fusion helped build the contemporary American state. Since that time efforts to reinvent government by \\"brains trust\\" have largely failed in the U.S. In the last quarter of the twentieth century American politics ceased to function as a blend of broad coalition building and reform agenda setting, rooted in a consensus of belief in the efficacy of modern government. Can a progressive coalition of ideas and power come together again? The Fall of the House of Roosevelt makes such a prospect both alluring and daunting.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=IIG8uQAACAAJ&dq=Tao+Te+Ching+(Chinese+Classics+(Hong+Kong).)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Embarassment of Mangoes","description":"Under the Tuscan Sun meets the wide-open sea . . .

Who hasn t fantasized about chucking the job, saying goodbye to the rat race, and escaping to some exotic destination in search of sun, sand, and a different way of life? Canadians Ann Vanderhoof and her husband, Steve did just that. In the mid 1990s, they were driven, forty-something professionals who were desperate for a break from their deadline-dominated, career-defined lives. So they quit their jobs, rented out their house, moved onto a 42-foot sailboat called Receta ( recipe,  in Spanish), and set sail for the Caribbean on a two-year voyage of culinary and cultural discovery. In lavish detail that will have you packing your swimsuit and dashing for the airport, Vanderhoof describes the sun-drenched landscapes, enchanting characters and mouthwatering tastes that season their new lifestyle. Come along for the ride and be seduced by Caribbean rhythms as she and Steve sip rum with their island neighbors, hike lush rain forests, pull their supper out of the sea, and adapt to life on  island time.  Exchanging business clothes for bare feet, they drop anchor in 16 countries -- 47 individual islands -- where they explore secluded beaches and shop lively local markets. Along the way, Ann records the delectable dishes they encounter -- from cracked conch in the Bahamas to curried lobster in Grenada, from Dominican papaya salsa to classic West Indian rum punch -- and incorporates these enticing recipes into the text so that readers can participate in the adventure.

Just like with so many other computer technologies, it took Microsoft to make speech software easy to program, and even easier for PC users to use speech to control their Windows software applications. With Windows Visual Basic ActiveX Voice Control Automation Services, Speech API (SAPI) and Speech Suite Software Development Kit (SDK), complex computer speech synthesis, and even speech recognition, has become more accessible to all programmers for use in their multi-media business, education and recreational applications. This book offers the reader a detailed exploration of Windows Speech Automation Services via Visual Basic ActiveX Voice Controls available in MS Speech API Versions 4.0 to 5.1, as well as third-party SAPI vendor SDKs such as IBM ViaVoice and Dragon NatSpeak. It provides a thorough introduction to Windows Speech Recognition Programming for beginning as well as advanced programmers.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=O6sLKOZvqPcC&dq=Windows+Speech+Recognition+Programming:+With+Visual+Basic+and+ActiveX+Voice+Controls&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Probability: A Complete Solution Guide to Any Textbook (Problem Solvers)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=x95Yzh4sRvgC&dq=Probability:+A+Complete+Solution+Guide+to+Any+Textbook+(Problem+Solvers)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mathematics for Elementary Teachers : A Conceptual Approach","description":"The tenth edition of Mathematics for Elementary Teachers: A Conceptual Approach continues the innovative time-tested approach of the previous editions: an emphasis on learning via specific, realistic examples and the extensive use of visual aids, hands-on activities, problem-solving strategies and active classroom participation.

The story depicts their struggles as they come to grips with a new, often hostile environment. Later, the family prominently figures in two of the most tragic, yet stirring incidents in Mexican-American history. The first involves the all-Hispanic rifle company that as part of the Texas Volunteer Division lost its colors at the Battle of the Rapido River in Italy during the Second World War, when 156 badly-mangled Hispanic soldiers were ordered to cross the Rapido River against a known German force of more than 3000 men. Only 23 U.S. soldiers came back, and of those, ten would later die. Yet before the war was over, that unit would win more medals for bravery than almost any other rifle company in all of American history. The second incident came in the early 1950's, when some 300 Mexican-Americans, African-Americans and Filipino migrants went on strike in the harvest fields of South Texas. Though the movement was washed away by the winds of history, within the seeds of that defeat were the victories that came a generation later in the San Joaquin Valley of central California. It is in California that a new generation of Salazars at last succeed in fulfilling the dream of enriching their lives in a soul-satisfying way.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=gf4TmQEACAAJ&dq=The+Dark+Side+of+the+Dream&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Distracted Preacher And Other Tales","description":"From the master of Victorian tragedy, the surprisingly comic adventures of a man caught between romance and religion.

The fourteen papers in this collection examine this phenomenon from different approaches, genres, and media. They cover the period from biblical times through today. Among the exiles highlighted are the Babylonian Exile (sixth century BCE), the exile after the destruction of the Jerusalem Temple (70 CE), and the years after the Crusaders (tenth century CE). Events of return include the aftermath of the Babylonian Exile (fifth century BCE), the centuries after the Temple s destruction (first and second CE), and the years of the establishment of the modern State of Israel (1948 CE). In each instance authors pay close attention to the historical settings, the literature created by Jews and others, and the theological explanations offered (typically, this was seen as divine punishment or reward for Israel s behavior). The entire volume is written authoritatively and accessibly.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=yw2yDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Crossing Over to Canaan: The Journey of New Teachers in Diverse Classrooms","description":"\\"Gloria Ladson-Billings provides a perceptive and interestingaccount of what is needed to prepare novice teachers to besuccessful with all students in our multicultural society.

A Year in the Life of a Shinto Shrine describes the ritual cycle at Suwa Shrine, Nagasaki?s major Shinto shrine. Conversations with priests, other shrine personnel, and people attending shrine functions supplement John K. Nelson?s observations of over fifty shrine rituals and festivals. He elicits their views on the meaning and personal relevance of the religious events and the place of Shinto and Suwa Shrine in Japanese society, culture, and politics. Nelson focuses on the very human side of an ancient institution and provides a detailed look at beliefs and practices that, although grounded in natural cycles, are nonetheless meaningful in late-twentieth-century Japanese society. Nelson explains the history of Suwa Shrine, basic Shinto concepts, and the Shinto worldview, including a discussion of the Kami, supernatural forces that pervade the universe. He explores the meaning of ritual in Japanese culture and society and examines the symbols, gestures, dances, and meanings of a typical shrine ceremony. He then describes the cycle of activities at the shrine during a calendar year: the seasonal rituals and festivals and the petitionary, propitiary, and rite-of-passage ceremonies performed for individuals and specific groups. Among them are the Dolls? Day festival, in which young women participate in a procession and worship service wearing Heian period costumes; the autumn Okunchi festival, which attracts participants from all over Japan and even brings emigrants home for a visit; the ritual invoking the blessing of the Kami for young children; and the ritual sanctifying the earth before a building is constructed. The author also describes the many roles women play in Shinto and includes an interview with a female priest. Shinto has always been attentive to the protection of communities from unpredictable human and divine forces and has imbued its ritual practices with techniques and strategies to aid human life. By observing the Nagasaki shrine?s traditions and rituals, the people who make it work, and their interactions with the community at large, the author shows that cosmologies from the past are still very much a part of the cultural codes utilized by the nation and its people to meet the challenges of today.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2ijECgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"An Open Book: Coming of Age in the Heartland","description":"The memoirs of a Pulitzer Prize-winning literary journalist and critic discusses his childhood and education in small-town Ohio, his colorful family and friends, and his voracious appetite for reading.

As this ground-breaking book emphasizes, it requires important changes in the attitudes of recruiters. Successful recruiting requires recruiters who understand the psychology of the job candidates, why people take jobs with organizations and what makes the difficult hire possible. Most important of all, the recruiter must believe that he or she can make the seemingly impossible become a reality and, over time, change the very nature of the organization by hiring high quality employees. Based upon many years of research, training, and consulting work with companies, The Difficult Hire reveals seven critical principles, which constitute a set of attitudes or philosophy, for effectively recruiting, screening, and hiring: you are the most important factor in filling the job; you must stay in control; put the company and the job on a pedestal; perceptions are everything and you can change perceptions; control the negatives; fulfill the individual's needs; and set and keep your standards high.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jfYEAAAACAAJ&dq=The+Difficult+Hire:+Seven+Recruitment+and+Selection+Principles+for+Hard+to+Fill+Positions+(Career+Savvy)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Yes, No, Maybe: Chronobiotic Nutrition","description":"The book, Yes, No, Maybe Chronobiotic Nutrition, has identified the hidden key of chronobiotics, which was previously unrecognized and which accelerates healing and good health.

WHERE IS EVERYBODY?: Fifty Solutions to the Fermi Paradox and the Problem of Extraterrestrial Life","description":"Given the fact that there are perhaps 400 billion stars in our Galaxy alone, and perhaps 400 billion galaxies in the Universe, it stands to reason that somewhere out there, in the 14-billion-year-old cosmos, there is or once was a civilization at least as advanced as our own. The sheer enormity of the numbers almost demands that we accept the truth of this hypothesis. Why, then, have we encountered no evidence, no messages, no artifacts of these extraterrestrials? In this second, significantly revised and expanded edition of his widely popular book, Webb discusses in detail the (for now!) 75 most cogent and intriguing solutions to Fermi's famous paradox: If the numbers strongly point to the existence of extraterrestrial civilizations, why have we found no evidence of them? Reviews from the first edition: \\"Amidst the plethora of books that treat the possibility of extraterrestrial intelligence, this one by Webb ... is outstanding. ... Each solution is presented in a very logical, interesting, thorough manner with accompanying explanations and notes that the intelligent layperson can understand. Webb digs into the issues ... by considering a very broad set of in-depth solutions that he addresses through an interesting and challenging mode of presentation that stretches the mind. ... An excellent book for anyone who has ever asked  Are we alone? .\\" (W. E. Howard III, Choice, March, 2003) \\"Fifty ideas are presented ... that reveal a clearly reasoned examination of what is known as  The Fermi Paradox . ... For anyone who enjoys a good detective story, or using their thinking faculties and stretching the imagination to the limits ...  Where is everybody  will be enormously informative and entertaining. ... Read this book, and whatever your views are about life elsewhere in the Universe, your appreciation for how special life is here on Earth will be enhanced!

Set in a dangerous near future world, The Book of M tells the captivating story of a group of ordinary people caught in an extraordinary catastrophe who risk everything to save the ones they love. It is a sweeping debut that illuminates the power that memories have not only on the heart, but on the world itself. One afternoon at an outdoor market in India, a man s shadow disappears an occurrence science cannot explain. He is only the first. The phenomenon spreads like a plague, and while those afflicted gain a strange new power, it comes at a horrible price: the loss of all their memories. Ory and his wife Max have escaped the Forgetting so far by hiding in an abandoned hotel deep in the woods. Their new life feels almost normal, until one day Max s shadow disappears too. Knowing that the more she forgets, the more dangerous she will become to Ory, Max runs away. But Ory refuses to give up the time they have left together. Desperate to find Max before her memory disappears completely, he follows her trail across a perilous, unrecognizable world, braving the threat of roaming bandits, the call to a new war being waged on the ruins of the capital, and the rise of a sinister cult that worships the shadowless. As they journey, each searches for answers: for Ory, about love, about survival, about hope; and for Max, about a new force growing in the south that may hold the cure. Like The Passage and Station Eleven, this haunting, thought-provoking, and beautiful novel explores fundamental questions of memory, connection, and what it means to be human in a world turned upside down.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=EYEzDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Creek","description":"Caleb Devlin is a legend on Mockingbird Lane, the boy who terrorized an entire town before he got sent away.

Its architecture has had either to suggest the fantasy worlds which lie within or to reflect and magnify the vibrancy, the vision and the aspirations of the metropolis. The newness of the building type, the lack of precedent and the classlessness of the audience made the cinema the perfect vehicle for modern architecture. In this book Edwin Heathcote oulines the development of the cinema as a modern building type and traces the history and fashions which have prevailed in the most populist of architectures, from the fairground booth to the megaplex. The bulk of the book is taken up by a selective international survey of modern cinema design, from the blatantly commercial through the self-consciously kitsch to the avant-garde. It is the first book of recent years to set about defining the state of contemporary cinema, and acts as a guide to one of the fastest changing and most genuinely popular and responsive buiding types.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=dC1UAAAAMAAJ&dq=Cinema+Builders+(Builders)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dr. Jack's Leadership Lessons Learned From a Lifetime in Basketball","description":"What can one of the most successful coaches in the history of professional basketball tell CEOs, executives, entrepreneurs, and managers about leadership?

Anthropologist Graeber presents a stunning reversal of this conventional wisdom. For more than 5000 years, humans have used elaborate credit systems to buy and sell goods. Since the beginning of the agrarian empires, humans have been divided into debtors and creditors. Through time, virtual credit money was replaced by gold and the system as a whole went into decline. This fascinating history is told for the first time.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=yIMxuAAACAAJ&dq=Bernard+the+Angry+Rooster+(RS)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Devil's wind,","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BagyAAAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Chopin: The man and his music","description":"This classic in music biography and criticism reflects the intimate knowledge of Chopin's music acquired by the author while studying to become a concert pianist.

Lieutenant Ralph Trewin, D.S.C., arrives at Singapore as second-in-command of the shallow-draught gunboat, H.M.S. Porcupine. To Trewin, still shocked from wounds received during the evacuation of Crete, the gunboat and her five elderly consorts seem to symbolise the ignorance and blind optimism he finds in Singapore. And the captain of the Porcupine is as unwilling as the rest to take heed of Trewin's alarm, for to him the gunboat represents his last chance. The following month, the Japanese invade Malaya. In three months, Singapore, the impregnable fortress, knows the humiliation of surrender. Through the misery and despair of this bloody campaign, Trewin and his captain are forced to draw on each other's beliefs and weaknesses, and together they weld the little gunboat into a symbol of bravery and pride.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=1wtlAgAAQBAJ&dq=The+Pride+and+the+Anguish&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Flower Fairies of the Wayside","description":"Poems depict the activities and colors of the fairies of a variety of wildflowers.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=7L68NQAACAAJ&dq=Flower+Fairies+of+the+Wayside&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Beyond Survival, Building on the Hard Times--a POW's Inspiring Story","description":"<p> When life loses its meaning, when suddenly the world is turned upside down, when there's nothing left that resembles life as we've known it, where do we find the strength and sustenance to go on? </p> <p> For naval aviator Jerry Coffee and others who were held as prisoners of war in North Vietnam, there was only one choice: to go within. </p> <p> <em>Beyond Survival</em> is a journey into the invincible human spirit that unites heart and mind in a compelling and unforgettable experience. Drawing from his seven years as a POW, Captain Coffee provides timeless lessons that apply to the physical, emotional, and ethical challenges of everyday life. Proving that leadership and creativity are possible in difficult and uncertain circumstances, Captain Coffee offers a message we can draw on in any trying situation. His story demonstrates that conviction must come from within, and in telling that story he touches the place inside of us where growth begins. </p> <p> <em>Beyond Survival</em> is a positive statement about love and commitment in the midst of war and division. It contrasts the cold reality of war, degradation, and torture with the warmth of human connections, inner serenity, and kinship with all of life. It poignantly illustrates that to be stripped of everything that is familiar and by which we identify ourselves leaves us with only what unites us - our human identity. It conveys truths about relationships at every level - with ourselves, with others, with our country, and with our God. </p> <p> Without inflaming the wounds inflicted by America's involvement in Vietnam, <em>Beyond Survival </em>explores an issue at the heart of every free society: the willingness of ordinary individuals to maintain a passion for freedom so compelling that adversity strengthens rather than weakens personal resolve in the worst of circumstances. Through Gerald Coffee's story you will discover the universal principles of survival and triumph that empower anyone to overcome adversity. </p>","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=6udgDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"What's Wrong with Sociology?","description":"Since the 1950s sociology has experienced a decline in prestige when compared with the other social sciences. In some highly publicized cases some universities have retrenched their sociology departments, others are contemplating either retrenchment or downsizing of their departments. Although there are some practitioners of the discipline who believe that it has never been in better shape, many sociologists have come to believe that there are very serious problems both in the cognitive and social organization of the discipline. This book contains sixteen essays by sociologists who believe that their discipline faces very serious problems which must be overcome if the discipline is to survive and prosper. The contributors were selected to represent diverse views and thus there is substantial disagreement among them over what the problems are that sociology faces and how they may be remedied. In this highly provocative book readers is likely to find some essays they agree with and others they disagree with; but all the essays present important problems faced by the discipline which must be addressed.Although the authors of the sixteen essays do not agree on what is wrong with the discipline, there are some themes which appear frequently. In his introduction Cole summarizes and comments on these themes. His introduction centers on the question of whether sociology is entirely socially constructed. Is what we believe to be true about society constrained by empirical evidence or is it a result of our ideology, power, authority, and other social processes? One theme which appears in many of the essays is that sociology has become too ideological and as a result has lost credibility among university administrators, politicians and the general public. Many of the essays also stress the view that there are very low levels of consensus in sociology and that it is hard to see evidence of progress. Others criticize the discipline for not dealing with the really important social issues and see much of the work published as being parochial and trivial. Questions are also raised about why the use of causal models has failed to generate solutions to most of the problems the discipline addresses. Some authors believe that the discipline adheres to an overly rational model of human behavior and has failed to keep up with some of the advances introduced by post-modernist theories.This highly readable set of essays should be of interest to all those are concerned about the current state of sociology. They will also be useful in introducing graduate students to some of the most important issues currently being debated in the field.Stephen Cole is currently professor of sociology at the State University of New York at Stony Brook and professor of sociology at the University of Queensland, Australia. He is the author of Making Science: Between Nature and Society, and with Jonathan R.

And then Jamie gets the call he's always dreaded: Teddy, the father who never accepted him, has died. It's time for the prodigal son to come home to the subdivisions and strip malls of suburban New Jersey to face the emotionally barren family he left behind years ago. Caught between the guilt he wants to shake and the grief he can't express, Jamie takes solace in a box of memorabilia he finds in the attic, marked \\"1960,\\" the year his father spent in San Francisco but kept secret. Jamie is especially drawn to a moody, enigmatic photo of the stunning Dean Foster, his dad's closest friend, who headed west then mysteriously disappeared. Determined to unlock the mystery of his father, Jamie seeks out the artists and poets, the free spirits and wild men mentioned in Teddy's letters to Dean. It's a journey that takes him deep into the subcultures of San Francisco, from the bohemian heyday of the Beat Generation through the Internet mania of his contemporary world, even as it unleashes something primal, hungry, and slightly dangerous in Jamie.

However, the ways in which these powers define security have differed among them, leading in some instances to miscommunication, conflict, and even war. In Without Warning , accomplished scholar Mikhail Alexseev compares the intelligence priorities of principal decision makers in such various parts of the world as the Mongol Empire and Sung China (1206-1220), Great Britain and France (1783-1800), and the USA and the Soviet Union (1975-1991). In his analysis Alexseev reveals that while the leading powers see security primarily in military and economic terms, their challengers focus primarily on political vulnerabilities. As a result, Alexseev asserts, the world powers have consistently failed to detect or deter aggressive challenges. A sharp, deciphering look at the interactions among the major global players, Without Warning makes a crucial contribution to the study of international relations.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=sVjIwAEACAAJ&dq=Without+Warning:+Threat+Assessment,+Intelligence,+and+Global+Struggle&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Privacy Preserving Data Mining","description":"Advances in hardware technology have increased the capability to store and record personal data.

So did Jodie Foster in Taxi Driver, Jane Fonda in Klute, Anna Karina in Vivre sa vie, Greta Garbo in Anna Christie, and Charlize Theron, who won an Academy Award for Monster. This engaging and generously illustrated study explores the depiction of female prostitute characters and prostitution in world cinema, from the silent era to the present-day industry. From the woman with control over her own destiny to the woman who cannot get away from her pimp, Russell Campbell shows the diverse representations of prostitutes in film. Marked Women classifies fifteen recurrent character types and three common narratives, many of them with their roots in male fantasy. The  Happy Hooker,  for example, is the liberated woman whose only goal is to give as much pleasure as she receives, while the  Avenger,  a nightmare of the male imagination, represents the threat of women taking retribution for all the oppression they have suffered at the hands of men. The  Love Story,  a common narrative, represents the prostitute as both heroine and anti-heroine, while  Condemned to Death  allows men to manifest, in imagination only, their hostility toward women by killing off the troubled prostitute in an act of cathartic violence. The figure of the woman whose body is available at a price has fascinated and intrigued filmmakers and filmgoers since the very beginning of cinema, but the manner of representation has also been highly conflicted and fiercely contested. Campbell explores the cinematic prostitute as a figure shaped by both reactionary thought and feminist challenges to the norm, demonstrating how the film industry itself is split by fascinating contradictions.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=DQhKTEj9ZzYC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Second Sister: Hometown U.S.A.

Yet today only four companies make vaccines, and there is a growing crisis in vaccine availability. Why has this happened? This remarkable book recounts for the first time a devastating episode in 1955 at Cutter Laboratories in Berkeley, California, thathas led many pharmaceutical companies to abandon vaccine manufacture. Drawing on interviews with public health officials, pharmaceutical company executives, attorneys, Cutter employees, and victims of the vaccine, as well as on previously unavailable archives, Dr. Paul Offit offers a full account of the Cutter disaster. He describes the nation's relief when the polio vaccine was developed by Jonas Salk in 1955, the production of the vaccine at industrial facilities such as the one operated by Cutter, and the tragedy that occurred when 200,000 people were inadvertently injected with live virulent polio virus: 70,000 became ill, 200 were permanently paralyzed, and 10 died. Dr. Offit also explores how, as a consequence of the tragedy, one jury's verdict set in motion events that eventually suppressed the production of vaccines already licensed and deterred the development of new vaccines that hold the promise of preventing other fatal diseases.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=JumHQwdeAd0C&dq=The+Cutter+Incident:+How+America%27s+First+Polio+Vaccine+Led+to+the+Growing+Vaccine+Crisis&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Surf Patrol : Kiss of Death and Other Stories","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zKMwOAAACAAJ&dq=Surf+Patrol+:+Kiss+of+Death+and+Other+Stories&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The history of Italy","description":"Discusses the political and economic aspects of each period as well as the social and cultural milieu, and includes a timeline, brief biographical notes on key players, and a bibliographic essay.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=stSxECsf0F4C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Winning the Talent Wars","description":"\\"Bruce Tulgan is the new Tom Peters.\\"--Howard Jenkins, chairman and CEO, Publix Super Markets, Inc.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=tDKTHsaOJSoC&dq=Winning+the+Talent+Wars&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Beatles Gear, Revised Edition","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The New Man","description":"In the book of Ephesians, the church is revealed as the assembly, the household, the Body of Christ, and the new man.

Henry IV, Part 2 is the only Shakespeare play that is a  sequel,  in the modern sense, to an earlier play of his. Like most sequels, it repeats many elements from the previous work, Henry IV, Part 1. This play again puts on stage Henry IV s son, Prince Hal, who continues to conceal his potential greatness by consorting with tavern dwellers, including the witty Sir John Falstaff. As in Part 1, Prince Hal and Falstaff seek to best each other in conversation, while Falstaff tries to ingratiate himself with Hal and Hal disdains him. Part 2 adds some fresh characters, the rural justices Shallow and Silence and Shallow s household. Political rebellion, while important to the plot, does not loom as large as in Part 1. There are no glorious champions; combat is replaced by deception, cunning, and treachery. This edition includes: -Freshly edited text based on the best early printed version of the play -Full explanatory notes conveniently placed on pages facing the text of the play -Scene-by-scene plot summaries -A key to the play s famous lines and phrases -An introduction to reading Shakespeare s language -An essay by a leading Shakespeare scholar providing a modern perspective on the play -Fresh images from the Folger Shakespeare Library s vast holdings of rare books -An annotated guide to further reading Essay by A.

She paints a vivid picture of her childhood, in the early 1900s in Narayangunj, a village in undivided Bengal, where her father worked with the Brahmaputra Steam Navigation Company and her early forays into writing. She movingly recounts the pain of being forced to return to England to complete her education, and the horrors of being bullied by teachers and older girls in a convent; but also her joy at finding a mentor who encouraged her writing. After her return to India in 1925, life continued to be tumultuous she faced social censure for allowing Anglo-Indian children in her dance school in Calcutta; and her marriage with a stockbroker, Laurence Foster, was an unhappy one. The unexpected success of Rumer s first novel, Black Narcissus, left Laurence insecure and he deserted her and their two daughters. Rumer s courage and resilience shine through as she writes about her decision to pay off her husband s debts and to move to Kashmir with her daughters; there they lived in a houseboat till Rumer bought an abandoned house, and began making a living by selling vegetables and medicinal herbs from her garden. But just as they were getting used to life in Kashmir despite hostility from the locals, a catastrophe forced them to return to London. Bursting with vibrant imagery and a love for life, A Time to Dance, No Time to Weep is an unforgettable account of the unconventional life of a celebrated writer and also of India under British rule. --","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=r2pgzgEACAAJ&dq=TIME+TO+WEEP&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Illustrated motor cars of the world","description":"Color drawings and brief specifications of automobiles produced all over the world from 1770 through 1967, in a chronological arrangement.

This group of uniquely talented, award-winning writers is centered in Newburyport, Massachusetts, but includes members from the Boston area and from as far away as New York and Maine. Twenty-seven poets are represented in this volume of the anthology, including Rhina P. Espaillat, A.M. Juster, and Deborah Warren. Here, find masterful poems in form and free verse, on an eclectic range of subjects spanning the domestic to the global, celebrations to mourning, the whimsical to the heartbreaking. It is especially a showcase of the formal prowess of these accomplished poets. The dazzling array of given and nonce forms, including blank verse, triolet, abecedarian, sonnet, villanelle, sestina, and more will inspire with many examples of craftsmanship heightening emotional engagement and insight. PRAISE FOR THE POWOW RIVER POETS ANTHOLOGY II: Dedicated to the late Powow River Poet, David Berman, The Powow River Poets Anthology II continues in the splendid tradition of the group s previous tome, published in 2006. Twenty-seven poets touch on themes ranging from the simple joys of friendship, nature, and art, to the complex issues of faith and doubt, love and loss. Guffaw-inducing humor and biting wit abound, as well as solemn reflections on suicide, domestic violence, social injustice, betrayal, illness, aging, and death. In Rhina P. Espaillat s beautiful villanelle,  Guidelines,  included in this collection, the poet wisely urges us to find something to love, perhaps  a line of verse . . . that feels like the world s heart since time began.  Beyond question, the poems in The Powow River Poets Anthology II echo the world s heart.  Catherine Chandler, author of Pointing Home It might be far-fetched to suggest that the Muses have sprinkled a generous share of their gifts into the waters of the Powow River . . . [near] the historic town of Newburyport . . . where the Powow River Poets established their home base three decades ago but how else to explain the lyric fluency, robust talent, and refreshing wit that consistently distinguish this group?  Leslie Monsour (from the introduction), author of The House Sitter The Powow River Poets are a group known for their concern with the craftsmanship of verse, and for the formal dexterity and precision of their poems qualities profusely exemplified in this new collection. As might be expected, there are tricky forms in abundance here sonnets, villanelles, triolets, a sestina but what is so memorable about so many of the poems is their continual precision of observation and depth of nuanced feeling. To paraphrase Pope, come for the flow of reason, stay for the feast of soul. This is a really delightfully various and moving collection, one to browse happily in and return to often.  Dick Davis, author of Faces of Love: Hafez and the Poets of Shiraz ABOUT THE AUTHOR: The Powow River Poets are a gathering of widely published, awardwinning New England poets, centered in Newburyport, Massachusetts, but including members from the Boston area and from as far away as New York and Maine.

Recruiters seek out potential agents who can keep a secret yet pull classified information out of others; who love their country but are willing to leave it behind for dangerous places; who live double lives, but can be trusted with some of the nation's most highly sensitive tasks. Michele Rigby Assad was one of those people. As a CIA agent and a counterterrorism expert, Michele soon found that working undercover was an all-encompassing job. The threats were real; the assignments perilous. Michele spent over a decade in the agency--a woman leading some of the most highly skilled operatives on the planet, secretly serving in some of the most treacherous areas of the Middle East, and at risk as a target for ISIS. But deep inside, Michele wondered: Could she really do this job? Had she misunderstood what she thought was God's calling on her life? Did she have what it would take to survive? The answer came when Michele faced her ultimate mission, one with others' lives on the line--and it turned out to have been the plan for her all along. In Breaking Cover, Michele has at last been cleared to drop cover and tell her story: one of life-or-death stakes; of defeating incredible odds; and most of all, of discovering a faith greater than all her fears.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=iptwEAAAQBAJ&dq=Breaking+Cover&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dr. Atkins' Quick & Easy New Diet Cookbook : Companion to Dr. Atkins' New Diet Revolution","description":"In this revised companion book to \\"Dr. Atkins' New Diet Revolution,\\" readers will find newly updated recipes that will let them eat the most up-to-date Atkins way.

In seeking answers to these questions, Durkheim wrote a work that has fascinated, challenged and informed its readers for over a hundred years.

(Philosophy and Medicine)","description":"Physician-Assisted Suicide: What are the Issues? offers a detailed discussion of recent supreme court rulings that have had an impact on the contemporary debate in the United States and elsewhere over physician-assisted suicide. Two rulings by the U.S. Supreme Court have altered the contemporary debate on physician-assisted suicide: Washington v. Glucksberg (1997) and Vacco v. Quill (1997). In these cases, the Supreme Court ruled that state laws could prohibit assisted suicide and, therefore, physician-assisted suicide. These rulings mark the apex of over two decades of unprecedented litigation regarding end-of-life care and signal the beginning of a new clinical, ethical, and legal debate over the extent of an individual's rights to control the timing, manner, and means of his/her death. The debate over suicide and assisting suicide is ancient and contentious and intertwined with questions about the permissibility of voluntary active euthanasia or mercy killing. Responses to these issues can be divided into those who defend physician-assisted suicide and many of these other activities and those who object. But those who object may do so on principled grounds in that they regard these activities as wrong in all cases, or non-principled, in that they believe there are more prudent, less disruptive or more efficient policies. The authors in this book sort out these responses and look at the assumptions underlying them. Several of these authors give startling new interpretations that a culture gap, deeper and wider than that in the abortion debate, exists.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=4o1HBAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Firebreak","description":"\\"New Liberty City, 2134. Two corporations have replaced the US, splitting the country's remaining forty-five states (five have been submerged under the ocean) between them: Stellaxis Innovations and Greenleaf. There are nine supercities within the continental US, and New Liberty City is the only amalgamated city split between the two megacorps, and thus at a perpetual state of civil war as the feeds broadcast the atrocities committed by each side. Here, Mallory streams Stellaxis's wargame SecOps on BestLife, spending more time jacked in than in the world just to eke out a hardscrabble living from tips. When a chance encounter with one of the game's rare super-soldiers leads to a side job for Mal--looking to link an actual missing girl to one of the SecOps characters. Mal's sudden burst in online fame rivals her deepening fear of what she is uncovering about BestLife's developer, and puts her in the kind of danger she's only experienced through her avatar.\\"--","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ScsnEAAAQBAJ&dq=Firebreak&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The West Highland Railway (History of the Railways of the Scottish Highlands) (v. 1)","description":"One of a series of books telling the story of the railways of the Scottish Highlands, this book deals specifically with the West Highland Railway.

When they are busy, they feel guilty for not playing with their kids or having a quiet time of prayer and Bible study. When they try to rest, they feel guilty because there's so much left to do. It's an endless cycle of overwork and exhaustion. Yet inside every woman's heart is a longing for true rest. It's there because God designed us that way--but it seems out of reach. Enough is enough. Our lives probably aren't going to get less busy, especially if we're in a demanding season of life, but we can do busy better. In this burden-lifting book, Glynnis Whitwer helps women examine their hearts and their schedules in order to seek a healthy and holy balance between--and enjoyment of--both work and rest. She shows readers how to prioritize their goals and their time, how to be present in the moment as Jesus was, and how to find the freedom of true soul rest. Most importantly, she shows women that their worth is found not in their accomplishments but in the love of the One who made them for work and for rest.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=OM7lDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"French (Hugo Advanced Courses)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Work is my play,","description":"\\"Do you have a sane work-play balance?

Thirteen wise, funny, and startlingly perceptive stories about the vagaries of marriage, the uncertainties of family, and the revelations of female life, Female Trouble looks at the relationships not just between men and women but also between parents and children, brothers and sisters. Probing the subjects of love, fidelity, desire, dependence, and solitude, Nelson explores the broad notion of family from myriad angles, but always with surprising insight and her trademark offbeat humor. The title story features a thirty-year-old man carrying on intimate relationships with three different women -- one institutionalized, one pregnant, one purely maternal -- but unable to commit to any of them. \\"Incognito\\" depicts a divorced woman whose turbulent teen years are suddenly brought back to her when she returns to her hometown with her own teenage daughter. In \\"The Unified Front,\\" a husband reckons with his wife's decision to steal a baby while at a famous theme park, and in \\"Stitches,\\" a disturbing late-night phone call forces a mother to confront her college-age daughter's sexuality and her own adulterous past. Set in the vividly rendered Southwest and Midwest, these moving stories are dark and honest portraits of people in moral quandaries, gray areas, unclear circumstances -- stories that reveal us to ourselves with disturbing clarity. As always, Nelson astounds with the clean, terse power of her language, and she deftly uses humor to expose the soft underbellies of her tough-talking, unblinking characters. These are stories that will linger in the reader's mind long after they are read.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=HDjPmj13jVMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Quicksilver Moon","description":"Quicksilver Moon coven has an enemy in Brother Mudge -- and a formidable ally in vampire Isolde Bell.

The apostle John saw a vision of four horses (white, red, black, and pale) galloping across the world in the end times, leaving unbelievable destruction in their wake. The chilling imagery of that vision has gripped believers for over two thousand years. The purpose of the book is to take an in-depth look at these four mysterious horsemen and show how their approach seems to be developing before our eyes, signaling the advent of that terrible seven years known as the Great Tribulation.

Schuyler Mathews, an erudite naturalist and birder, theorized that birds sing first for love of music, and second for love of the lady. To expand on his theory, he actually scored the songs of birds in the wild. His charming text and bird-by-bird annotations were compiled into a guide called Field Book of Wild Birds and Their Music. This extraordinary work has now been lavishly illustrated and adapted for a new audience. Each bird is meticulously rendered by artist Judy Pelikan in full-color illustrations that feature not only the birds, but also their nests, eggs, and feathers. And every song is represented by its written musical score, which Mathews expertly explains in a way that both musicians and non-musicians can enjoy. As Mathews points out, the music of wild birds is everywhere--in poems, children's nursery songs, as well as in the works of the great composers: the Black-billed Cuckoo's call appears near the close of Beethoven's Pastoral Symphony; the Nashville Warbler's song is found in the opening bars of Rossini's Carovale, and the Meadowlark's song is remarkably like the first two bars of Alfredo's song in La Traviata. He reveals how a bird's character is reflected in its song: the Baltimore Oriole is a sharp-billed, sharp-witted character, and his remarks are as incisive and crisp as the toots of a steam whistle. And he reminds us of the words of our great poets--Wordsworth, Emerson, Sir Walter Scott--and their descriptions of the very same birds and their music. This classic, useful, and completely original guide will put a song into the heart of novice and experienced birder alike.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xCr50CCRhGsC&dq=The+Wild+Birds%27+Song&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Honourable Estates: English and Their Country Houses","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=sNAcAAAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Codependent No More - How To Stop Controlling Others And Start Caring For Yourself","description":"The healing touchstone of millions, this modern classic by one of America's best-loved and most inspirational authors holds the key to understanding codependency and to unlocking its stultifying hold on your life.

Though, as she admits, her status as an adult and an observer may have affected what happened around her, Thorne presents a fascinating account of how children divide themselves--and how others divide them--along gender lines. Breaking students into teams for contests and the eternal game of \\"cooties\\" (a contamination attributed more often to girls than boys) reveal much about the microcosm that these students inhabit, and an extensive look at the tomboy, both in literature and in life, compares her ambiguity (sometimes an insult, sometimes a compliment) to the negative attitudes often elicited by gender-crossing in the other direction. Thorne argues convincingly against the theories of scholars like Deborah Tannen and Carol Gilligan that boys and girls have different \\"cultures,\\" and she attempts to discourage \\"gender antagonism.\\" A final section offers concrete steps for teachers to take in forming the attitudes--about gender and other topics--of coming generations.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=7TQNAN20JmUC&dq=Gender+Play:+Girls+and+Boys+in+School&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Legends of Steam","description":"Presents a pictorial history of steam locomotives from around the world.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=sA__rl_vuvcC&dq=Legends+of+Steam&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Paris: City of Light and Fascination","description":"Fotografie panoramiche e scorci di intima bellezza, ritratti vissuti, momenti di vita quotidiana in una metropoli; e ancora paesaggi sconfinati, e mille toni cromatici, dal verde dei prati all azzurro del mare, all arancio delle sabbie infuocate.

As we follow its hero Chichikov, a dismissed civil servant turned confidence man, about the Russian countryside in pursuit of his shady enterprise, there unfolds before us a gallery of characters worthy in comic range of Chaucer, Rabelais, Fielding, and Sterne. With its rich and ebullient language, ironic twists, and startling juxtapositions, Dead Souls stands as one of the most unusual and poetic masterpieces of the nineteenth century. This new translation by Christopher English includes the surviving chapters and fragments of Part Two, and is complemented by an introductory essay by the pre-eminent Gogol scholar, Robert Maguire.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0eNqAtwLNSQC&dq=Dead+Souls:+A+Poem+(Oxford+World%27s+Classics)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Intimate Stranger: Meetings with the Devil in Nineteenth-Century Russian Literature","description":"The Intimate Stranger provides the first detailed investigation of a distinctive literary phenomenon: a fascination with demons and devils in nineteenth-century Russian literature. Nearly all of the major authors of the period - Pushkin, Gogol, Lermontov, Dostoevsky, and Tolstoy - used images of devils to explore issues of human temptation, sin, and guilt in a troubled world. Asking fundamental questions - where does evil come from? when does it appear in characters' lives? - these writers created a remarkable array of demonic figures, ranging from grotesque demons to handsome nihilists. This book discusses the various literary, religious, and folkloric factors that influenced the representation of the demonic, and it investigates the profound, soul-shattering effects that a personal encounter with the demonic may have on an individual's life.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=N4kaAQAAIAAJ&dq=The+Intimate+Stranger:+Meetings+with+the+Devil+in+Nineteenth-Century+Russian+Literature&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Social Studies in Elementary Education","description":"The author wrote this new edition of the most popular elementary social studies methods text on the market with the following three goals in mind: to present the most powerful social studies content and pedagogy for children in elementary school, to offer the material in simple and accessible ways, and to write in a first person active voice.

The first survivor of school bullying to look back on those experiences as an adult, Jodee brings you up to speed on her life and work since the book's initial release with a new chapter, all-new Letter to My Readers, and Reader's Guide. She also offers the latest information on digital and cyberbullying, the Adult Survivor of Peer Abuse, her in-school antibullying program, INJJA (It's NOT Just Joking Around!), and provides discussion questions for schools. While other children were daydreaming about dances, first kisses, and college, Jodee Blanco was trying to figure out how to go from homeroom to study hall without being taunted or spit upon as she walked through the halls. This powerful, unforgettable memoir chronicles how one child was shunned-and even physically abused-by her classmates from elementary school through high school.

Life-size Disney characters and cowboy movie heroes romp across the walls of his nursery. Out in the carriage house, his great-grandfather's ornate, moldering carriage takes him on imaginary adventures. But Julius's father is dead, and his beautiful young mother passes through her children's lives like an ephemeral shooting star. Despite the soft shelter of family and money, hard realities overshadow Julius's expanding world, just as the rugged Andes loom over his home in Lima. This lyrical, richly textured novel, first published in 1970 as Un mundo para Julius, opens new territory in Latin American literature with its focus on the social elite of Peru. A member of that elite, Bryce Echenique incisively charts the decline of an influential, centuries-old aristocratic family who becomes nouveaux riches with the invasion of foreign capital in the 1950s. A World for Julius, his first novel, marks the first appearance in English of this important Peruvian writer, whose Latin American postmodern fiction has won critical acclaim throughout the Spanish-speaking world.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=OoxdAAAAMAAJ&dq=A+World+for+Julius:+A+Novel+(Texas+Pan+American+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"My Son Fred- Living With Autism: How Could You Manage?

With brilliant logic she argues that our hominid ancestors began to evolve in response to an aquatic environment. Millions of years ago something happened that caused our ancestors to walk on two legs, to lose their fur, to develop larger brains and learn how to speak. Elaine Morgan discovers what this event was by studying the many incongruous flaws in the physiological make-up of humans. The human body is liable to suffer from obesity, lower back pain and acne. In support of her aquatic ape hypothesis she points out the flaws in our physiological make-up: the difficulties of erect bipedalism, our hairlessness and fat-layers, our preference for face to face sex and the way we breathe. Are these flaws a record of the history of the species, the 'scars' of evolution that are clues to earlier stages of evolution? Morgan establishes the origins of the evolutionary path that separated humans from other animals and questions the theories currently accepted by science. Did our ancestors adapt to an aquatic environment that subsequently dried out? Elaine Morgan has made the Aquatic Ape Hypothesis a plausible alternative to conventional theories of evolution and in The Scars of Evolution she brings a real understanding of who humans are and where they came from.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ByuGDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Dynasty of Western Outlaws","description":"Examines the tradition of lawlessness in the American West from the time of Quantrill's Raiders to Pretty Boy Floyd","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zr0iff2kAWsC&dq=A+Dynasty+of+Western+Outlaws&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Make It Simpler Paper Piecing: Easy As 1-2-3 a Pinless Fold and Sew Technique","description":"Prepare to be amazed as Anita Grossman Solomon introduces new ideas that will revolutionize paper piecing!

Now the CIA says it possesses nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons, as well as long-range missiles capable of delivering them to America s West Coast. But, as Bruce Cumings demonstrates in this provocative, lively read, the story of the U.S.-Korea conflict is more complex than our leaders or our news media would have us believe. Drawing on his extensive knowledge of Korea, and on declassified government reports, Cumings traces that story, from the brutal Korean War to the present crisis. Harboring no illusions regarding the totalitarian Kim Jong Il regime, Cumings nonetheless insists on a more nuanced approach. The result is both a counter-narrative to the official U.S. and North Korean versions and a fascinating portrayal of North Korea, a country that suffers through foreign invasions, natural disasters, and its own internal contradictions, yet somehow continues to survive.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=pe86S4iCz34C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Broccoli tapes","description":"During a stay of several months in Hawaii with her family, Sara reports her experiences by tape back to her sixthgrade class in Boston, detailing her \\"adoption\\" of a wild cat, a friendship with a troubled Hawaiian boy, and the death of a beloved grandmother.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=PlThAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Broccoli+tapes&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Panama","description":"Panama City began as three 640-acre homesteads in the late 1800s and was incorporated in 1909.

Modern communication techniques enable us to transmit and reconstitute images without needing to know a specific verbal sequence language such as the Morse code or Hungarian. International traffic signs use international image symbols which are not specific to any particular verbal language. An image language differs from a verbal one in that the latter uses a linear string of symbols, whereas the former is multi dimensional. Architectural renderings commonly show projections onto three mutual ly perpendicular planes, or consist of cross sections at different altitudes capa ble of being stacked and representing different floor plans. Such renderings make it difficult to imagine buildings comprising ramps and other features which disguise the separation between floors, and consequently limit the cre ative process of the architect. Analogously, we tend to analyze natural struc tures as if nature had used similar stacked renderings, rather than, for instance, a system of packed spheres, with the result that we fail to perceive the system of organization determining the form of such structures. Perception is a complex process. Our senses record; they are analogous to audio or video devices. We cannot, however, claim that such devices perceive.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=pzT2BwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Creative Oil Painting: A Step-By-Step Guide and Showcase Techniques from 15 Master Painters","description":"Bridging the fields of conservation, art history, and museum curating, this volume contains the principal papers from an international symposium titled \\"Historical Painting Techniques, Materials, and Studio Practice\\" at the University of Leiden in Amsterdam, Netherlands, from June 26 to 29, 1995.

From the East End of London to the Eastern seaboard of the United States, from Spitalfields to Scottish castles, from Bletchley Park to Buchenwald, and from the Vatican to Palestine, Natalie Livingstone follows the extraordinary lives of the Rothschild women from the dawn of the nineteenth century to the early years of the twenty-first. As Jews in a Christian society and women in a deeply patriarchal family, they were outsiders. Excluded from the family bank, they forged their own distinct dynasty of daughters and nieces, mothers and aunts. They became influential hostesses and talented diplomats, choreographing electoral campaigns, advising prime ministers, advocating for social reform, and trading on the stock exchange. Misfits and conformists, conservatives and idealists, performers and introverts, they mixed with everyone from Queen Victoria to Chaim Weizmann, Rossini to Isaiah Berlin, and the Duke of Wellington to Alec Guinness, as well as with amphetamine-dealers, suffragists and avant-garde artists. Rothschild women helped bring down ghetto walls in early nineteenth-century Frankfurt, inspired some of the most remarkable cultural movements of the Victorian period, and in the mid-twentieth century burst into America, where they patronized Thelonious Monk and drag-raced through Manhattan with Miles Davis. Absorbing and compulsive, The Women of Rothschild gives voice to the complicated, privileged, and gifted women whose vision and tenacity shaped history.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=uphCEAAAQBAJ&dq=Sleeping+Beauty%27s+Billionaire+(Dynasties:+The+Barones)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dominic Deegan: Crystal Clear (Dominic Deegan Series, 1)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=k-mTPQAACAAJ&dq=Dominic+Deegan:+Crystal+Clear+(Dominic+Deegan+Series,+1)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Beat Generation","description":"The ultimate literary guide to San Francisco, packed with fabulous photos and scintillating anecdotes.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=TvLu3q4SEgoC&dq=The+Beat+Generation&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Traditional Indian Curry in a Hurry","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=cM7FAAAACAAJ&dq=Traditional+Indian+Curry+in+a+Hurry&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Island of Saints : A Story of the One Principle That Frees the Human Spirit","description":"Andrews illuminates timeless spiritual truth in in this story of a World War II seaman and the bitter war widow who saves his life.

The approach is unique, not comparative but relational, in unraveling the legacy of racism in the Netherlands and the (former) colonies. Authors contribute to identifying the complex ways in which racism operates in and beyond the national borders, shaped by European and global influences, and intersecting with other systems of domination. Contrary to common sense beliefs it appears that old-fashioned biological notions of  race  never disappeared. At the same time the Netherlands echoes, if not leads, a wider European trend, where offensive statements about Muslims are an everyday phenomenon. Dutch Racism challenges readers to question what happens when the moral rejection of racism looses ground. The volume captures the layered nature of Dutch racism through a plurality of registers, methods, and disciplinary approaches: from sociology and history to literary analysis, art history and psychoanalysis, all different elements competing for relevance, truth value, and explanatory power. This range of voices and visions offers illuminating insights in the two closely related questions that organize this book: what factors contribute to the complexity of Dutch racism? And why is the concept of racism so intensely contested? The volume will speak to audiences across the humanities and social sciences and can be used as textbook in undergraduate as well as graduate courses.

Kitch examines the years from 1895 to 1930 as a time when the first wave of feminism intersected with the rise of new technologies and media for the reproduction and dissemination of visual images. Access to suffrage, higher education, the professions, and contraception broadened women's opportunities, but the images found on magazine covers emphasized the role of women as consumers: suffrage was reduced to spending, sexuality to sexiness, and a collective women's movement to individual choices of personal style. In the 1920s, Kitch argues, the political prominence of the New Woman dissipated, but her visual image pervaded print media. With seventy-five photographs of cover art by the era's most popular illustrators, The Girl on the Magazine Cover shows how these images created a visual vocabulary for understanding femininity and masculinity, as well as class status. Through this iconic process, magazines helped set cultural norms for women, for men, and for what it meant to be an American, Kitch contends.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=jg2X0mxwOxoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Prairie Days","description":"A delicate, stunning account of life on the prairie from Newbery medalist Patricia MacLachlan.

Unaware that she had an eating disorder and in denial that she had any problems with food, Amy continued to suffer from anorexia into her twenties. Her condition escalated after her first child was born, remaining with her through her second pregnancy and into mid-life. The true story of this young woman, Inside Amy is the first book about anorexia nervosa written by a middle-aged mother of two children. It recounts the previously unspoken thoughts and feelings of a woman who endured years of distress, and her transformation into a  normal  person who finally came to terms with the hidden disorder that haunted her through motherhood.

Drawing on qualitative studies conducted between 1998 and 2001, the authors of Communities of Care provide important information on historic and current trends in assisted living systems serving African Americans. Focusing on six facilities that have become models of long-term care for African Americans, the authors shed light on the daily lives of the people who live, work, and visit these \\"communities of care.\\"With detailed profiles of the facilities, interviews, and case histories of care recipients, the authors explore both the institutional and personal characteristics of the facilities and the issues central to their residents. This definitive work brings to the forefront critical questions about how race, gender, and culture affect the quality of, access to, and cost of care. These questions have broad implications for the policy, administration, and operation of assisted living.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=vq27AAAAIAAJ&dq=Communities+of+Care:+Assisted+Living+for+African+American+Elders&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Constructive Assessment in Mathematics: Practical Steps for Classroom Teachers (Key Resources in Professional Development)","description":"Education is a hot topic. From the stage of presidential debates to tonight's dinner table, it is an issue that most Americans are deeply concerned about. While there are many strategies for improving the educational process, we need a way to find out what works and what doesn't work as well. Educational assessment seeks to determine just how well students are learning and is an integral part of our quest for improved education. The nation is pinning greater expectations on educational assessment than ever before. We look to these assessment tools when documenting whether students and institutions are truly meeting education goals. But we must stop and ask a crucial question: What kind of assessment is most effective? At a time when traditional testing is subject to increasing criticism, research suggests that new, exciting approaches to assessment may be on the horizon. Advances in the sciences of how people learn and how to measure such learning offer the hope of developing new kinds of assessments-assessments that help students succeed in school by making as clear as possible the nature of their accomplishments and the progress of their learning. Knowing What Students Know essentially explains how expanding knowledge in the scientific fields of human learning and educational measurement can form the foundations of an improved approach to assessment. These advances suggest ways that the targets of assessment-what students know and how well they know it-as well as the methods used to make inferences about student learning can be made more valid and instructionally useful. Principles for designing and using these new kinds of assessments are presented, and examples are used to illustrate the principles. Implications for policy, practice, and research are also explored. With the promise of a productive research-based approach to assessment of student learning, Knowing What Students Know will be important to education administrators, assessment designers, teachers and teacher educators, and education advocates.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=t5mcAgAAQBAJ&dq=Constructive+Assessment+in+Mathematics:+Practical+Steps+for+Classroom+Teachers+(Key+Resources+in+Professional+Development)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"King Soloman's Mines","description":"Three men trek to the remote African interior in search of a lost friend - and reach, at the end of a perilous journey, an unknown land cut off from the world, where terrible dangers threaten anyone who ventures near the spectacular diamond mines of King Solomon...","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=h4YFDD-ycRgC&dq=King+Soloman%27s+Mines&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mastering Windows 2000 Professional","description":"The Only Windows 2000 Professional Resource You Need From the expert that brought you Mastering Windows NT Workstation, Mark Minasi's Mastering Windows 2000 Professional, 2nd Edition gives you all the conceptual and practical information you need to get the most out of Microsoft's latest operating system.

Invented before the introduction of evolutionary theory, Linnaeus's system of classifying organisms is based on outdated theoretical assumptions, and is thought to be unable to provide accurate biological classifications. Marc Ereshefsky argues that biologists should abandon the Linnaean system and adopt an alternative that is more in line with evolutionary theory. He traces the evolution of the Linnaean hierarchy from its introduction to the present. He illustrates how the continued use of this system hampers our ability to classify the organic world, and then goes on to make specific recommendations for a post-Linnaean method of classification. Accessible to a wide range of readers by providing introductory chapters to the philosophy of classification and the taxonomy of biology, the book will interest both scholars and students of biology and the philosophy of science.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=AtTsXQ05ZeQC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Nonsense novels","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=bItMCinEMxsC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Winnie-the-Pooh's Little Book about Friends (Winnie-the-Pooh's Little Books)","description":"Few friendships are as true and lasting as those that exist in A.A.

Their bodies are normally a silvery color with small black flecks sprinkled along their top and sides. They are very popular fish to be kept in home aquariums due to their attractive coloration, high growth rate, birth size, reproduction and brood number. The molly is a hardy and highly adaptable species that can thrive in multiple different tank conditions. Mollies are very similar in appearance to their livebearer cousins, the platy and the swordtail, however mollies tend to be slightly more energetic, more prone to aggression and larger in size.

Second, it ties the scientifically grounded, yet intuitively appealing, VaR measure to earlier, more idiosyncratic measures of market risk that are used in specific market environs (e.g., duration in fixed income). Finally, it encompasses all of the accepted approaches to calculating a VaR measure and presents them in a clearly explained fashion with supporting illustrations and completely worked-out examples.\\" -from the Foreword by John F.

Ted Steinberg, author of Gotham Unbound Heartbeats in the Muck traces the incredible arc of New York Harbor s environmental history. Once a pristine estuary bristling with oysters and striped bass and visited by sharks, porpoises, and seals, the harbor has been marked by centuries of rampant industrialization and degradation of its natural environment. Garbage dumping, oil spills, sewage sludge, pesticides, heavy metals, poisonous PCBs, landfills, and dredging greatly diminished life in the harbor, in some places to nil. Now, forty years after the Clean Water Act began to resurrect New York Harbor, John Waldman delivers a new edition of his New York Society Library Award-winning book. Heartbeats in the Muck is a lively, accessible narrative of the animals, water quality, and habitats of the harbor. It includes captivating personal accounts of the author s explorations of its farthest and most noteworthy reaches, treating readers to an intimate environmental tour of a shad camp near the George Washington Bridge, the Arthur Kill (home of the resurgent heron colonies), the Hackensack Meadowlands, the darkness under a giant Manhattan pier, and the famously polluted Gowanus Canal. A new epilogue details some of the remarkable changes that have come upon New York Harbor in recent years.  Full of humor and a picaresque joy in the almost absurd persistence of Gotham s underwater ecosystems, Heartbeats should be read by every urbanite who dreams of a better relationship with nature.

Yet, it is fascinating to see how the search for some simple universal laws down through the ages has increased our understanding of nature.

New Thought fulfills the contemporary hunger for a spirituality that promotes both the practice of the presence of God and health, wealth, and happiness here and now. This book is for everyone who wants to go deeper than most popular writing on spirituality and self-improvement, much of which is indebted to New Thought. New Thought still is evolving; it may yet be the point at which religion, philosophy, and science come together as the most effective combination to move the world to greater peace, plenty, health, and harmony.

The spiritual path is ultimately a waltz of opposites. It is as serious as a sermon and as wacky as a sitcom. The way is simpler and more direct than some would have you believe-- and also more arduous and more baffling than is often depicted. At each turn in the road we run into a cul-de-sac of paradox, where one guideline or precept is contradicted by another. The concise chapters in Roadsigns: Navigating Your Path to Spiritual Happiness are organized around four big paradoxes that can trip up any seeker: You You're On Your Own/Can't Do It Alone; Lose Yourself/Improve Yourself; Embrace the World/Escape the World; You're Already There/There's a Long Way to Go. Finding your way through these and other paradoxes can cause discouragement and confusion, but they can also bring delight, wisdom, and growth. Philip Goldberg, Ph.D., an Interfaith Minister, confronts these divine dilemmas with profound insight and engaging humor. Based on more than 30 years of experience and research, the travel tips in Roadsigns will help you keep your balance on the razor's edge of the spiritual path, whether you travel independently or within an established tradition. Goldberg is a spiritual warrior, wise about the way but light in his method. The road signs he posts-- Use All Available Lanes; Take the High Road; Don't Hurry, Be Happy; and 23 more-- offer a playful, mystical map through the deeper parts of the spiritual journey. They provide not only comfort, inspiration, and good practical sense, but also a challenge. For there are no one-size-fits-all answers on the spiritual path; we each have to clear our own way. Roadsigns will lead you to the best kind of guidance there is: that which springs from your own awareness and insight.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Ue6srBQrWjEC&dq=Roadsigns:+Navigating+Your+Path+to+Spiritual+Happiness&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Guillaume de Machaut: A Guide to Research (Routledge Music Bibliographies)","description":"First published in 1996.

By exploring an extreme human experience, childhood sexual abuse, the present study allows an insight into a hidden, silenced, and destructive aspect of human relations. It is the first of its kind to make comprehensible both the general path from violation to sickness, and the particular logic of assault embodiment. Due to its theoretical and methodological framework, the present study provides evidence that the embodiment of sexual violation experience is informed by situated logic and rationality. These, however, do not correspond to scientific logic and rationality. The universe of socio-culturally constituted meaning and that of scientifically constructed knowledge are shown to be incompatible. Subjectively informed violation embodiment is likely to be misinterpreted and consequently maltreated within the objectively grounded framework of current biomedical praxis. Consequently, victims of silenced sexual violence are revictimized by medicine.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=GzT0CAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Beyond the Barrier","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=SoUoAAAACAAJ&dq=Beyond+the+Barrier&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The difference God makes: Finding your identity in Christ","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=lOxRict3_DQC&dq=The+difference+God+makes:+Finding+your+identity+in+Christ&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Essential Christianity (A Handbook of Basic Christian Doctrine)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=naM8AAAAYAAJ&dq=Essential+Christianity+(A+Handbook+of+Basic+Christian+Doctrine)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Laughing boy (A Pocket book)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=27i-ngEACAAJ&dq=Laughing+boy+(A+Pocket+book)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Symantec Visual Cafe Sourcebook","description":"Teaches programmers how to use Visual Cafe to create Java applets and applications","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=O8lXAAAAYAAJ&dq=Symantec+Visual+Cafe+Sourcebook&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Turn My World Upside Down: Jo's Story (The Marconi Sisters)","description":"Josefina 'Jo' Marconi's world just shifted out of orbit.

You might think the problem is your brain. It seems to have a mind of its own, a mind that doesn't always want to take in the dry, technical stuff you're forced to study. The fact is your brain craves novelty. It's constantly searching, scanning, waiting for something unusual to happen. After all, that's the way it was built to help you stay alive. It takes all the routine, ordinary, dull stuff and filters it to the background so it won't interfere with your brain's real work--recording things that matter. How does your brain know what matters? It's like the creators of the Head First approach say, suppose you're out for a hike and a tiger jumps in front of you, what happens in your brain? Neurons fire. Emotions crank up. Chemicals surge. That's how your brain knows. And that's how your brain will learn Java. Head First Java combines puzzles, strong visuals, mysteries, and soul-searching interviews with famous Java objects to engage you in many different ways. It's fast, it's fun, and it's effective. And, despite its playful appearance, Head First Java is serious stuff: a complete introduction to object-oriented programming and Java. You'll learn everything from the fundamentals to advanced topics, including threads, network sockets, and distributed programming with RMI. And the new. second edition focuses on Java 5.0, the latest version of the Java language and development platform. Because Java 5.0 is a major update to the platform, with deep, code-level changes, even more careful study and implementation is required. So learning the Head First way is more important than ever. If you've read a Head First book, you know what to expect--a visually rich format designed for the way your brain works. If you haven't, you're in for a treat. You'll see why people say it's unlike any other Java book you've ever read. By exploiting how your brain works, Head First Java compresses the time it takes to learn and retain--complex information. Its unique approach not only shows you what you need to know about Java syntax, it teaches you to think like a Java programmer. If you want to be bored, buy some other book. But if you want to understand Java, this book's for you.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=KXQrAQAAQBAJ&dq=Not+Just+Java+(2nd+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mystical Theology and Social Dissent: The Life and Works of Judah Loew of Prague (Littman Library of Jewish Civilization)","description":"Judah Loew, better known as the Maharal of Prague, was a pivotal personality in late medieval European Judaism.

Pulitzer Prizewinning author Jon Meacham helps us understand the present moment in American politics and life by looking back at critical times in our history when hope overcame division and fear. ONE OF OPRAH S  BOOKS THAT HELP ME THROUGH  ? NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY NPR ? The Christian Science Monitor ? Southern Living Our current climate of partisan fury is not new, and in The Soul of America Meacham shows us how what Abraham Lincoln called the  better angels of our nature  have repeatedly won the day. Painting surprising portraits of Lincoln and other presidents, including Ulysses S. Grant, Theodore Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Harry S. Truman, Dwight Eisenhower, and Lyndon B. Johnson, and illuminating the courage of such influential citizen activists as Martin Luther King, Jr., early suffragettes Alice Paul and Carrie Chapman Catt, civil rights pioneers Rosa Parks and John Lewis, First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt, and Army-McCarthy hearings lawyer Joseph N. Welch, Meacham brings vividly to life turning points in American history. He writes about the Civil War, Reconstruction, and the birth of the Lost Cause; the backlash against immigrants in the First World War and the resurgence of the Ku Klux Klan in the 1920s; the fight for women s rights; the demagoguery of Huey Long and Father Coughlin and the isolationist work of America First in the years before World War II; the anti-Communist witch-hunts led by Senator Joseph McCarthy; and Lyndon Johnson s crusade against Jim Crow. Each of these dramatic hours in our national life have been shaped by the contest to lead the country to look forward rather than back, to assert hope over fear a struggle that continues even now. While the American story has not always or even often been heroic, we have been sustained by a belief in progress even in the gloomiest of times. In this inspiring book, Meacham reassures us,  The good news is that we have come through such darkness before  as, time and again, Lincoln s better angels have found a way to prevail. Praise for The Soul of America  Brilliant, fascinating, timely . . . With compelling narratives of past eras of strife and disenchantment, Meacham offers wisdom for our own time.

This book investigates the key factors underlying this paradox. The authors show that the legacy of past residential segregation as well as the more recent phenomenon of urban sprawl both work against inner city blacks. Many remain concentrated near traditional black neighborhoods south of the city center and face prohibitive commuting distances now that jobs have migrated to outlying northern suburbs. The book also presents some promising signs. Few whites still hold overt negative stereotypes of blacks, and both whites and blacks would prefer to live in more integrated neighborhoods. The emergence of a dynamic, black middle class and the success of many black-owned businesses in the area also give the authors reason to hope that racial inequality will not remain entrenched in a city where so much else has changed.

From the genes we inherit and the environment into which we are born, to the lottery ticket we buy at the local store, much of life is a gamble. In business, education, travel, health, and marriage, we take chances in the hope of obtaining something better. Chance colors our lives with uncertainty, and so it is important to examine it and try to understand about how it operates in a number of different circumstances. Such understanding becomes simpler if we take some time to learn a little about probability, since probability is the natural language of uncertainty. This second edition of Chance Rules again recounts the story of chance through history and the various ways it impacts on our lives. Here you can read about the earliest gamblers who thought that the fall of the dice was controlled by the gods, as well as the modern geneticist and quantum theory researcher trying to integrate aspects of probability into their chosen speciality. Example included in the first addition such as the infamous Monty Hall problem, tossing coins, coincidences, horse racing, birthdays and babies remain, often with an expanded discussion, in this edition. Additional material in the second edition includes, a probabilistic explanation of why things were better when you were younger, consideration of whether you can use probability to prove the existence of God, how long you may have to wait to win the lottery, some court room dramas, predicting the future, and how evolution scores over creationism. Chance Rules lets you learn about probability without complex mathematics.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=hl2ODAEACAAJ&dq=Chance+Rules:+An+Informal+Guide+to+Probability,+Risk+and+Statistics&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Swine Production in the South","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5BA9AAAAYAAJ&dq=Swine+Production+in+the+South&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Early Development of the Hermeneutic of Karl Barth (NABPR dissertation series)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=cd8yzwEACAAJ&dq=The+Early+Development+of+the+Hermeneutic+of+Karl+Barth+(NABPR+dissertation+series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Summer of the Sea Serpent (Magic Tree House, No. 31)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3Wn0IIoZA4EC&dq=Summer+of+the+Sea+Serpent+(Magic+Tree+House,+No.+31)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Easy to kill","description":"On her way to Scotland Yard to report several murders in her village, an elderly woman encounters retired policeman Luke Fitzwilliam.

As any practitioner will tell you, the future isn't a contract chiseled in concrete, but rather a wish scribbled in beach sand just before high tide. Tarot isn't used to predict one's future; rather it helps guide you in smaller yet more meaningful ways. For example, instead of telling you exactly where your life will be ten years from now, the cards can help you get where you want to be ten years from now, simply through pointing out the helpful and hindering forces, mindsets, and habits with which you currently surround yourself. The symbols and stories behind each card in a deck force introspection and contemplation upon you, making you examine the reality of your current situation and what changes need to be made. They push you to relate situations and deeper circumstances from your life along mentally drawn parallels within the cards.

Tan actual hoy como cuando se public  por primera vez en 1938, ?este libro es ideal para los admiradores de Dr. Seuss y para dar comienzo a un di logo sobre el acoso!

A Spanish edition of an early classic by Dr. Seuss book--perfect for discussions about bullying! Featuring all-new color-enhanced illustrations, this story about a young peasant and his unjust treatment at the hands of King Derwin is one of Dr. Seuss's earliest and lesser known works. It's nevertheless totally Seussian and addresses subjects the good doctor was passionate about throughout his life: the abuse of power (as in Yertle the Turtle and Horton Hears a Who!); rivalry (as in The Sneetches); and of course, zany good humor (as in The Cat in the Hat and the 43 other books he wrote and illustrated)! As timeless today as when it was first published in 1938, it's a perfect choice for Dr. Seuss fans and for sparking discussions about bullying!

The material is massive and scattered; thus, few students or teachers have accessibility to other than small segments or singular tales or material they find buried in archives. Stith Thompson has divided his book into four sections which permit both the novice and the teacher to examine oral tradition and its manifestation in folklore. The introductory section discusses the nature and forms of the folktale. A comprehensive second part traces the folktale geographically from Ireland to India, giving culturally diverse examples of the forms presented in the first part. The examples are followed by the analysis of several themes in such tales from North American Indian cultures. The concluding section treats theories of the folktale, the collection and classification of folk narrative, and then analyzes the living folklore process. This work will appeal to students of the sociology of literature, professors of comparative literature, and general readers interested in folklore.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WKN44RtM_loC&dq=The+folktale,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Phantom of the Opera - piano vocal Selections","description":"(Easy Piano Vocal Selections). 15 easy piano selections, including: Alone at the Drive-In Movie * Beauty School Dropout * Born to Hand Jive * Greased Lightnin' * Look at Me, I'm Sandra Dee * Summer Nights * We Go Together * and more.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=SspXLwEACAAJ&dq=The+Phantom+of+the+Opera+-+piano+vocal+Selections&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rip Van Winkle & The Legend of Sleepy Hollow (2 books in 1)","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=svuXxq3SfpsC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"My ten years' imprisonment (The seaside library, pocket ed)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=EdZwngEACAAJ&dq=My+ten+years%27+imprisonment+(The+seaside+library,+pocket+ed)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Bait","description":"Describes how to stay free from offense and escape the mentality of a religious victim, claiming that the feeling of victimization is one of the tools of Satan, and by overcoming offense, readers will strengthen their relationship with God.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=HfefAQAAQBAJ&dq=The+Bait&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Self Mastery and Fate with the Cycles of Life (Rosicrucian Library, Volume 7)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Wrwkb_tkNbEC&dq=Self+Mastery+and+Fate+with+the+Cycles+of+Life+(Rosicrucian+Library,+Volume+7)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Don't Get Me Started","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=arw8c_U7ZuIC&dq=Don%27t+Get+Me+Started&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Gold Slipper","description":"Samuel D. Fohr holds that the Grimms' tales are not just childish 'fairy tales', but are filled with spiritual symbolism, and as such have value for adults as well as children. Snow White, for example, is a story of creation and spiritual growth, and its message parallels Hindu and Judaic creation myths. Hansel and Gretel and Cinderella both portray the journey back to God. Fohr also looks at recurring themes in the stories, and answers such questions as: Why are giants always evil and dwarves always good? What is the symbolic significance of the hungry wolf who appears in many stories? Exactly what are genies, and why are they always trapped in bottles? A delightful but serious examination of cherished stories, this book reveals new meaning in familiar tales. Also included is an extensive bibliography and an Appendix on the authenticity of the Grimms' tales. The author is a professor of philosophy at the University of Pittsburgh at Bradford. He received his Ph.D. in Philosophy from the University of Michigan and has taught courses in both Western and Eastern Philosophy. He is the author of Adam and Eve: The Spiritual Symbolism of Genesis and Exodus, and editor of more than a dozen volumes of The Collected Works of Rene Guenon. To say that Fohr retrieves fairy tales from the nursery on the one hand, and retrieves them from mere entertainment for adults on the other, is only the start of the matter. Like Freud, Jung, and Levy-Strauss, he recognizes the wisdom folktales embody, but he goes beyond those students of myth in arguing that the authors knew what they were doing: they crafted their tales consciously. This is a courageous and cogent book that goes a long way toward revalidating a literary genre that modernity has irresponsibly trivialized. - Huston Smith, author of The World's Religions, etc.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=4a7ZcR-_4T8C&dq=The+Gold+Slipper&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"French Discourse Analysis: The Method of Post-Structuralism","description":"For the first time in English, Glyn Williams draws together current debates in linguistics and social theory, and provides the first study in English of the principles and theories of French discourse analysis.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=OiNIAwAAQBAJ&dq=French+Discourse+Analysis:+The+Method+of+Post-Structuralism&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pushkin Meets the Bundle","description":"Pushkin the dog, once the apple of his owners' eyes, tries to cope with the arrival of a new baby to the house.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ZooBAAAACAAJ&dq=Pushkin+Meets+the+Bundle&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The soul's sincere desire","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=PbZFAAAAIAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ophie Out of Oz","description":"Fourth-grader Ophelia Peeler has always felt that she was just like Dorothy in Oz, skipping down the yellow brick road, until a move to Oregon, away from her best friend, sends her on a different path.

Attacks on the media had been a hallmark of Trump s presidential campaign, but this charge marked a dramatic turning point: language like this ventured into dangerous territory. Twentieth-century dictators notably, Stalin, Hitler, and Mao had all denounced their critics, especially the press, as  enemies of the people.  Their goal was to delegitimize the work of the press as  fake news  and create confusion in the public mind about what s real and what isn t; what can be trusted and what can t be. That, it seems, is also Trump s goal. In Enemy of the People, Marvin Kalb, an award-winning American journalist with more than six decades of experience both as a journalist and media observer, writes with passion about why we should fear for the future of American democracy because of the unrelenting attacks by the Trump administration on the press. As his new book shows, the press has been a bulwark in the defense of democracy. Kalb writes about Edward R. Murrow s courageous reporting on Senator Joseph McCarthy s  red scare  theatrics in the early 1950s, which led to McCarthy s demise. He reminds us of Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein s reporting in the early 1970s that led to President Richard Nixon s resignation. Today, because of revolutionary changes in journalism, no Murrow is ready at the battlements. Journalism has been severely weakened. Yet, without a virile, strong press, democracy is in peril. Kalb s book is a frightening indictment of President Trump s efforts to delegitimize the American press and put the future of our democracy in question.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=qd9PDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Marching Through Georgia","description":"Explores the possibilities of alternative history by changing the participants and the stakes in World War II","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=GYhrAAAACAAJ&dq=Marching+Through+Georgia&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ancestry Reference Library 2000 (ARL)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=96B-AAAACAAJ&dq=Ancestry+Reference+Library+2000+(ARL)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Economy Today (Ninth Edition)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=rSZszgEACAAJ&dq=The+Economy+Today+(Ninth+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"10,000 French Words: Essential Vocabulary for all Students of French (Oxford Minireference)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Something Hidden Behind the Ranges: A Himalayan Quest","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Grover Cleveland - A Study in Courage","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=RWlEAQAAIAAJ&dq=Grover+Cleveland+-+A+Study+in+Courage&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Joy of Chemistry: The Amazing Science of Familiar Things","description":"This book is the course packet for NSC 105, \\"The Chemistry of Everything,\\" at Bluffton University.

It is bound up with hatred, jealousy, boastfulness and disregard of all the rules' George Orwell 'The public have an insatiable curiosity to know everything except what is worth knowing' Oscar Wilde Will Fotheringham scoured the globe for this tsunami of trivia drawn from every sport known to humankind, and a few more besides. Subjects include how to conduct a bullfight, Hollywood's badminton range in the 1930s the holes of St. Andrew's golf course, why the Olympic flag has five rings, and much more. Fotheringham's Sporting Trivia contains more fun facts than anyone should be allowed to know. For example, did you know that the origins of loveo ( no scoreo) in tennis is thought to have come from the French word l'oeufo meaning eggo which is the same shape as the oval zero? And where does the Nike swoosho logo come from? Well, it was devised by University of Oregon student Carolyn Davidsons in 1964. She was originally paid U.S$35 for the logo by company founder Phil Knight.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Cs-6AAAACAAJ&dq=Fotheringham%27s+Sporting+Trivia:+The+Greatest+Sports+Trivia+Book+Ever&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Getting It Printed Edition","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"AutoCAD 2000: 3D Modeling,: A Visual Approach","description":"Learning to use the 3D side of AutoCAD has never been easier.

It has been taught to students for more than two millennia as a mode of logical thought. This book tells the story of how the axiomatic method has progressed from Euclid's time to ours, as a way of understanding what mathematics is, how we read and evaluate mathematical arguments, and why mathematics has achieved the level of certainty it has. It is designed primarily for advanced undergraduates who plan to teach secondary school geometry, but it should also provide something of interest to anyone who wishes to understand geometry and the axiomatic method better. It introduces a modern, rigorous, axiomatic treatment of Euclidean and (to a lesser extent) non-Euclidean geometries, offering students ample opportunities to practice reading and writing proofs while at the same time developing most of the concrete geometric relationships that secondary teachers will need to know in the classroom. -- P.

They also fear that their broken relationships will never heal. For everyone who has wished for a fresh beginning, here is good news. This gentle, affirming book emphasises how much God wants his wandering children to return to him. Award-winning author and pastor Erwin Lutzer provides solutions to common questions about how to reconnect with God and with those we are estranged from. Thanks to God s grace, it is never too late to do what s right. In this powerful, practical book, bestselling author Erwin Lutzer shows you how to clear your conscience and reestablish broken relationships. Worthy or not, you can know real, lasting peace - and the assurance that God still has a plan for your life. Story Behind the Book The idea for this book came to me when speaking at Promise Keepers. There were many men who came to faith in Christ, but then failed in their walk the next week or the next month. So they assumed that this new life was not for them; they thought that God was so angry with their failure, they might just as well live on the fringes of the Christian faith, rather than making it the core of their lives. This is a message of grace, not only in establishing our relationship with God, but in reconciling with those we have wronged, or who have wronged us.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=6zNdDLKkZ30C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Emerald Tablets of Thoth The Atlantean","description":"The Spiritual, Occult and Historical significance of the \\"Emerald Tablets\\" is almost beyond belief of modern man. Written around 36,000 B.C. by Thoth, an Atlantean priest-king, this manuscript dates far back beyond reach of any Egyptian writings ever found. The author, Thoth, a Master-Teacher of the early Egyptians, put this treatise to writing in his native Atlantean language and Dr. Doreal, by use of his expertise as an Occultist and Master of time and space, was given the directive to retrieve these Tablets and translate them into English for the edification of modern man. The powerful and rhythmic verse of Thoth is wonderfully retained in Doreal's translation. Contained within the pages of Thoth's masterpiece of Spiritual and Occult Wisdom is the synthesis of the Ancient Wisdom Teachings, the guideline for initiates of all ages, revealing the Knowledge and Wisdom hitherto held secret, but now in this New Age, revealed to all Seekers on the Path of Light. Dr. M. Doreal, Ms.D., Psy.D., is the Spiritual; Teacher of a multitude of Seekers of Light, having founded a Metaphysical Church and College - The Brotherhood of the White Temple, Inc.

VENNARD Assistant Professor of Fluid Mechanics New York University. PREFACE: Fluid mechanics is the study under all possible conditions of rest and motion. Its approaches analytical, rational, and mathematical rather than empirical it concerns itself with those basic principles which lead to the solution of numerous diversified problems, and it seeks results which are widely applicable to similar fluid situations and not limited to isolated special cases. Fluid mechanics recognizes no arbitrary boundaries between fields of engineering knowledge but attempts to solve all fluid problems, irrespective of their occurrence or of the characteristics of the fluids involved. This textbook is intended primarily for the beginner who knows the principles of mathematics and mechanics but has had no previous experience with fluid phenomena. The abilities of the average beginner and the tremendous scope of fluid mechanics appear to be in conflict, and the former obviously determine limits beyond which it is not feasible to go these practical limits represent the boundaries of the subject which I have chosen to call elementary fluid mechanics. The apparent conflict between scope of subject and beginner f s ability is only along mathematical lines, however, and the physical ideas of fluid mechanics are well within the reach of the beginner in the field. Holding to the belief that physical concepts are the sine qua non of mechanics, I have sacrificed mathematical rigor and detail in developing physical pictures and in many cases have stated general laws only without numerous exceptions and limitations in order to convey basic ideas such oversimplification is necessary in introducing a new subject to the beginner. Like other courses in mechanics, fluid mechanics must include disciplinary features as well as factual information the beginner must follow theoretical developments, develop imagination in visualizing physical phenomena, and be forced to think his way through problems of theory and application. The text attempts to attain these objectives in the following ways omission of subsidiary conclusions is designed to encourage the student to come to some conclusions by himself application of bare principles to specific problems should develop ingenuity illustrative problems are included to assist in overcoming numerical difficulties and many numerical problems for the student to solve are intended not only to develop ingenuity but to show practical applications as well. Presentation of the subject begins with a discussion of fundamentals, physical properties and fluid statics. Frictionless flow is then discussed to bring out the applications of the principles of conservation of mass and energy, and of impulse-momentum law, to fluid motion. The principles of similarity and dimensional analysis are next taken up so that these principles may be used as tools in later developments. Frictional processes are discussed in a semi-quantitative fashion, and the text proceeds to pipe and open-channel flow. A chapter is devoted to the principles and apparatus for fluid measurements, and the text ends with an elementary treatment of flow about immersed objects.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=kFN8CgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mission: A novel","description":"\\"Exceptionally absorbing and thrilling. ... Masterful.\\" --Nature A \\"magnificent\\" (Scientific American), genre-defying narrative of the most ambitious science project ever conceived: NASA's deep space mission to Europa, the Jovian moon where might swim the first known alien life in our solar system In the spirit of Tom Wolfe and John McPhee, The Mission is an exuberant master class of creative nonfiction that reveals how a motley, determined few expanded the horizon of human achievement. When scientists discovered the first ocean beyond Earth, they had two big questions: \\"Is it habitable?\\" and \\"How do we get there?\\" To answer the first, they had to solve the second, and so began a vivacious team's twenty-year odyssey to mount a mission to Europa, the ocean moon of Jupiter. Standing in their way: NASA, fanatically consumed with landing robots on Mars; the White House, which never saw a science budget it couldn't cut; Congress, fixated on going to the moon or Mars--anywhere, really, to give astronauts something to do; rivals in academia, who wanted instead to go to Saturn; and even Jupiter itself, which guards Europa in a pulsing, rippling radiation belt--a halo of death whose conditions are like those that follow a detonated thermonuclear bomb. The Mission is the Homeric, never-before-told story of modern space exploration, and a magnificent portrait of the inner lives of scientists who study the solar system's mysterious outer planets. David W. Brown chronicles the remarkable saga of how Europa was won, and what it takes to get things done--both down here, and up there.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=UBlozgEACAAJ&dq=Mission:+A+novel&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The life and death of the Ithaca Calendar Clock Company","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=J1krswEACAAJ&dq=The+life+and+death+of+the+Ithaca+Calendar+Clock+Company&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Minnesota Timberwolves (NBA Today (Mankato, Minn.).)","description":"Minnesota Timberwolves is a beginner's history of the NBA's Minnesota Timberwolves.

[A] beautifully conceived and penetrating book . . . one of the finest studies of American slavery ever written.  The New Republic Published some thirty years ago, Robert Manson Myers s Children of Pride: The True Story of Georgia and the Civil War won the National Book Award in history and went on to become a classic reference on America s slaveholding South. That book presented the letters of the prominent Presbyterian minister and plantation patriarch Charles Colcock Jones (18041863), whose family owned more than one hundred slaves. While extensive, these letters can provide only one part of the story of the Jones family plantations in coastal Georgia. In this remarkable new book, the religious historian Erskine Clarke completes the story, offering a narrative history of four generations of the plantations  inhabitants, white and black. Encompassing the years 1805 to 1869, Dwelling Place: A Plantation Epic describes the simultaneous but vastly different experiences of slave and slave owner. This  upstairsdownstairs  history reveals in detail how the benevolent impulses of Jones and his family became ideological supports for deep oppression, and how the slave Lizzy Jones and members of her family struggled against that oppression. Through letters, plantation and church records, court documents, slave narratives, archaeological findings, and the memory of the African American community, Clarke brings to light the long-suppressed history of the slaves of the Jones plantations a history inseparably bound to that of their white owners.  Clarke s magisterial, multiperspective study of the antebellum South describes two family groups . . . a  total  history of interconnected people divided by race, legal status, and gender.

Since the theory of reincarnation is not widely accepted, we tend to explain away memories of previous lives as false memories. Contemporary American painter Anton Brzezinski would be the first to agree that his own memories of previous lives are productions of his prodigious imagination-but Brzezinski's memories of his own experiences need no exaggeration to make them fascinating.

In response to the need to craft appropriate roles for technology in school mathematics new technological approaches have been applied to the teaching and learning of mathematics, and these approaches have been examined by researchers world-wide. The second volume has a dual focus: cases and perspectives. It features descriptive cases that provide accounts of the development of technology-intensive curriculum and tools. In these cases the writers describe and analyze various roles that research played in their development work and ways in which research, curriculum development, and tool development can inform each other. These thoughtful descriptions and analyses provide documentation of how this process can and does occur. The remaining chapters in the second volume address research related issues and perspectives on the use of technology in the teaching and learning of mathematics.

This book is a multidisciplinary work that investigates the notion of posthumous harm over time. The question what is and when is death, affects how we understand the possibility of posthumous harm and redemption. Whilst it is impossible to hurt the dead, it is possible to harm the wishes, beliefs and memories of persons that once lived. In this way, this book highlights the vulnerability of the dead, and makes connections to a historical oeuvre, to add critical value to similar concepts in history that are overlooked by most philosophers. There is a long historical view of case studies that illustrate the conceptual character of posthumous punishment; that is, dissection and gibbetting of the criminal corpse after the Murder Act (1752), and those shot at dawn during the First World War. A long historical view is also taken of posthumous harm; that is, body-snatching in the late Georgian period, and organ-snatching at Alder Hey in the 1990s.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Gx4vDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Doomsday, 1999 A.D.","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=AQwLK2YELigC&dq=Doomsday,+1999+A.D.&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hungry Hollow: The Story of a Natural Place","description":"Starting with an elegant description of a small piece of land called Hungry Hollow, A.K.

Decorated NYPD Officer John Coglin always thought his picture on the front page of the newspaper would be one for the scrapbook. That was before he had the bad luck to be forced into a witness-free, kill-or-be-killed confrontation with a drug-dealing thug. It's of no help to him that the incident took place during the run-up to a bitter mayoral election campaign, and that his adversary was sixteen years old and black. Now, instead of another commendation, Coglin is staring down the barrel of a media- and politics-stoked murder rap. But on the eve of his sure conviction arrives a fateful telephone call. It's not the governor, but his long-lost uncle, Aidan O'Connell. A veteran of the IRA and a recently released guest of San Quentin Penitentiary for armed-to-the-teeth robbery, Aidan offers his nephew a pardon that has nothing to do with lawyers. Coglin is about to find out that the type of amnesty Uncle Aidan is proposing is the kind that involves a beautiful but dangerous Mafia widow, a car trunk full of M-16s, and thirty million dollars in jewels smack dab in the middle of Rockefeller Center. Before the Devil Knows You're Dead is a highly entertaining, deliciously gritty, super-fast thriller that takes us on a cutthroat ride into an urban realm where criminal intent collides head-on with the vagaries of fate and the inscrutabilities of the human heart.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=1IykHOGEVQ8C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Telescopes and Techniques: An Introduction to Practical Astronomy (Patrick Moore's Practical Astronomy Series)","description":"The modern aspiring astronomer is faced with a bewil dering choice of commercially produced telescopes, including all the designs considered in the preceding chapter. Yet only four decades ago the choice for a small telescope would have been between just a refrac tor and a Newtonian reflector. That change has come about because of the enormous interest that has grown in astronomy since the start of the space age and with the mind-boggling discoveries of the past 30 or 40 years. Except for some of the very small instruments which are unfortunately often heavily promoted in general mail order catalogues, camera shops and the like, the optical quality of these commercially pro duced telescopes is almost uniformly excellent. Although one product may be slightly better for some types of observation, or more suited to the personal cir cumstances of the observer, than another, most of them will provide excellent observing opportunities. The same general praise cannot be applied, however, to the mountings with which many of these telescopes are provided, and those problems are covered in Chapter 6.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=vG0QBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Executive Temping: A Guide for Professionals","description":"EXECUTIVE TEMPING Temporary employment is booming with opportunities for high-level professionals.

Addams first created Morticia, Lurch, and The Thing in a cartoon published in a 1938 issue of the New Yorker though he hadn't named them at the time, or even conceived of a family unit. (When he did name the deadly matriarch, he was inspired by the Yellow Pages listing for \\"Morticians.\\") Other characters were born and developed in a multitude of Addams's cartoons over the next twenty-six years, before the cheerfully creepy clan debuted on ABC television in 1964 and later on the big screen, twice, in 1991 and 1993.The Addams Family: An Evilution is the first book to trace The Addams Family history, presenting more than 200 cartoons created by Charles Addams (American, 19121988) throughout his prolific career; many have never been published before. Text by H. Kevin Miserocchi, director of the Tee and Charles Addams Foundation, offers a revealing chronology of each character's evolution (for instance, did you know that Addams originally named Pugsley \\"Pubert\\"?), while Addams's own incisive character descriptions, originally penned for the benefit of the television show producers, introduce each chapter. As the presence of the Family continues to permeate generation after generation, and in celebration of the Broadway musical debuting in 2010, this book reminds us where these oddly lovable characters came from and, in doing so, offers a lasting tribute to one of America's greatest humorists. A phenomenon of rare proportion, The Addams Family is the manifestation of one artist's dark but irresistible wit, expressed with an uncommonly deft hand.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xp-eQQAACAAJ&dq=The+Adams+family,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How to Get Straight A's...And Have Fun at the Same Time","description":"The author of Getting Straight A's draws on an education philosophy that any student can achieve high grades; in a guide for students, parents, and teachers that focuses on the needs of younger children.

This book investigates the key factors underlying this paradox. The authors show that the legacy of past residential segregation as well as the more recent phenomenon of urban sprawl both work against inner city blacks. Many remain concentrated near traditional black neighborhoods south of the city center and face prohibitive commuting distances now that jobs have migrated to outlying northern suburbs. The book also presents some promising signs. Few whites still hold overt negative stereotypes of blacks, and both whites and blacks would prefer to live in more integrated neighborhoods. The emergence of a dynamic, black middle class and the success of many black-owned businesses in the area also give the authors reason to hope that racial inequality will not remain entrenched in a city where so much else has changed.

In 2008, the average author earned less than  7000 per annum. According to The Times approximately 200,000 books were available for sale in the UK in 2007. Of that total, 190,000 titles sold fewer than 3,500 copies. The top 5% of titles by sales volume accounted for over 60% of total book sales. No wonder publishers are careful about signing new writers. But there is good news in amongst all the doom and gloom. Right now, it has never been easier to be published. Everyone who posts something on Facebook is in effect a published author. And some blogs are read by tens of thousands of people daily, many more than might pick up a physical book by the same author. Then there's self-publishing, vanity publishing, print on demand and so on. But how do you find your way round this minefield?

David K. Shipler, Pulitzer Prize-winning author of Arab and Jew  Gratitude is due to Mr. Klein for his painstaking . . . book, the best one could possibly hope for.  Walter Lacquer, The Wall Street Journal Award-winning journalist Aaron J. Klein tells, for the first time, the complete story of the 1972 Munich Olympics massacre and the Israeli counterterrorism operation it spawned. With unprecedented access to Mossad agents and an unparalleled knowledge of Israeli intelligence, Klein peels back the layers of myth and misinformation that have permeated previous books, films, and magazine articles about the  shadow war  against Black September and other related terrorist groups. In this riveting account, long-held secrets are finally revealed, including who was killed and who was not, how it was done, which targets were hit and which were missed. In the end, Klein shows that the Israeli response to Munich was not simply about revenge, as is popularly believed. By illuminating the tactical and strategic purposes of the Israeli operation, Striking Back allows us to draw profoundly relevant lessons from one of the most important counterterrorism campaigns in history.  [Klein] makes it clear why [the Munich attacks were] a pivotal event in the evolution of global terrorism.

Not to mention rumours which agitated the maritime population and excited the public mind, even in the interior of continents, seafaring men were particularly excited. Merchants, common sailors, captains of vessels, skippers, both of Europe and America, naval officers of all countries, and the Governments of several States on the two continents, were deeply interested in the matter. For some time past vessels had been met by \\"an enormous thing,\\" a long object, spindle-shaped, occasionally phosphorescent, and infinitely larger and more rapid in its movements than a whale. The facts relating to this apparition (entered in various log-books) agreed in most respects as to the shape of the object or creature in question, the untiring rapidity of its movements, its surprising power of locomotion, and the peculiar life with which it seemed endowed. If it was a whale, it surpassed in size all those hitherto classified in science. Taking into consideration the mean of observations made at divers times rejecting the timid estimate of those who assigned to this object a length of two hundred feet, equally with the exaggerated opinions which set it down as a mile in width and three in length we might fairly conclude that this mysterious being surpassed greatly all dimensions admitted by the learned ones of the day, if it existed at all. And that it DID exist was an undeniable fact; and, with that tendency which disposes the human mind in favour of the marvellous, we can understand the excitement produced in the entire world by this supernatural apparition. As to classing it in the list of fables, the idea was out of the question. On the 20th of July, 1866, the steamer Governor Higginson, of the Calcutta and Burnach Steam Navigation Company, had met this moving mass five miles off the east coast of Australia. Captain Baker thought at first that he was in the presence of an unknown sandbank; he even prepared to determine its exact position when two columns of water, projected by the mysterious object, shot with a hissing noise a hundred and fifty feet up into the air. Now, unless the sandbank had been submitted to the intermittent eruption of a geyser, the Governor Higginson had to do neither more nor less than with an aquatic mammal, unknown till then, which threw up from its blow-holes columns of water mixed with air and vapour. Similar facts were observed on the 23rd of July in the same year, in the Pacific Ocean, by the Columbus, of the West India and Pacific Steam Navigation Company. But this extraordinary creature could transport itself from one place to another with surprising velocity; as, in an interval of three days, the Governor Higginson and the Columbus had observed it at two different points of the chart, separated by a distance of more than seven hundred nautical leagues.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=LGIiDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Baroque Music Today: Music As Speech : Ways to a New Understanding of Music","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ZDMZAQAAIAAJ&dq=Baroque+Music+Today:+Music+As+Speech+:+Ways+to+a+New+Understanding+of+Music&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Microsoft Internet Information Server 4 0 Sourcebook","description":"This book provides a complete plan for setting up an Internet and intranet server using Microsoft's Internet Information Server.
