I can really say that the time spent with Jane Eyre was a bright spot in my summer."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I bought this book as an audio CD for a trip I was taking with my son. Jane Eyre was summer reading, and I figured he could knock out this assignment on our trip AND we could have some fun talking about it. This plan worked out wonderfully. The narration was great and we had some good discussions.One area that I made my son nuts was complaining about the character of Edward Rochester. I look at his behavior, and cannot understand why so many readers consider him a romantic hero.He treats women terribly. He ignores the emotional needs of Ad&egrave;le Varens. While it is noble that he pays for her care while his paternity is not clear, he has assumed the role of guardian and is not emotionally present for her.Next, Lady Ingram is a narcissistic gold digger. At the same time, she is a feeling human being (in the context of the story). Rochester just uses her to make Jane jealous. He gets Lady Ingram to dump him by telling her a lie when posing as a gypsy fortune teller. This is not an honorable way to end a relationship.He does his worst to Jane. He knows full well that he is already married. Yes, he really does not like Bertha Mason Rochester. No, he really REALLY does not like Bertha Rochester. But, he is legally married to Bertha and he knows it.We find that his plan is to wed her, take her on a honeymoon, ruin her for other men (by the standards of the time), and then drop the bombshell on her that he is already married and that their marriage is not legal.So why do so many women seem to overlook how badly Rochester was going to treat Jane and love this is a romantic story. Jane should have dumped him and not looked back. He is a cad and not worthy of true love. What am I missing?"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I was just looking for a free classic to read for fun this summer; this book far exceeded my expectations.

This book is 'old school' but very ineteresting and I'm glad to say I have now read it.

I highly recommend this book for anyone who enjoys reading for the sake of reading and who can handle 'deep' reading. If you've not read a lot of classic books this is a good start to add one to your list."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I love the Bronte sisters.

She is faced with incredible temptation yet she choose to do what is right rather than what feels right and Providence rewards her for it.I have been reading this on my phone rather that a reader, but I've found the kindle edition to be just as easy to read as having the book and I always have it with me, even when I just have a few quiet minutes in the car waiting for kids."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I read Jane Eyre for the first time in my early 30's.

A marvelous book for anyone."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"In British literature, my favorite writers are Bronte sisters.Bronte sisters are the genius that their names were known to by a few novels in the world.The heroine Jane Eyre in Charlotte Bronte's novel was brought up by a mean aunt.Therefore Jane Eyre received terrible bullying.The problem of the bullying becomes the great problem in Japan now.In a school a few children sometimes are bullied, and to my surprise, a few parents in Japan abuse their children.The first scene of Jane Eyre is her unhappy life's departureI watch deep depth of human existence there.That chief director who took care of Jane Eyre must be crazy , if we consider by modern sense.It is odd that he is a Christian .Because Christ taught love and impressed the human. And Christ taught us that we are the light of the world.Helen is a kind friend of Jane Eyre in the school and has the heart like the angel.That chief director did the evil that he lets weak Helen walk in the rain .Thus, Helen dies.Furthermore, everywhere in the novel, a British beautiful rural scenery is pictured with the fresh and young sensitivity of a young woman .The mansion which she visited as a tutor is right attractive like an old cave.A big mansion has a secret.A thing that suggests a modern horror novel drifts.Gradually young Jane Eyre is charmed by middle-aged Rochester with the naivete such as the wild beast.This description will be a example of the love story's masterpiece .There are \\"The sorrow of young Werther\\", French \\"The lily of the valley\\", Russian \\"Anna Karenina\\" in the world love stories.But in their novels ,three women are the noble or the rich.In that respect, Jane Eye is from the misfortune.I am interested by the existent problem that this human being is born.Jane Eyre gets true love by power of her intention in the misfortune.It is not at all a light novel.On the contrary, it is a heavy novel.I read Jane Eyre and remembered \\"Light in August\\" of Faulkner."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"It had been years since I read this book. I enjoyed it immensely. No wonder it is a classic and will be forever!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I first read JE in Spanish when I was 11 or 12 - my memory seldom serves me well. Years passed but JE didn't - have no idea how many times I read it! After some years of studying, I was able to read - and enjoy - Bronte in English. That was sublime! My printed version is really worn out now but I am enjoying my Kindle version greatly!Love all the features! Highlight and mark all my favourites paragraphs - and find them in a second! I gather more easily now all the lines that show how empty, wounded and deeply hurt EFR's soul was and how Jane gave Rochester's heart a voice. And a voice is meant to be heard... and followed.J+E's characters symbolize now to me an encounter of one spirit seemingly divided in two. But they both had to learn their lessons of acceptance and forgiveness before such awareness arose in their hearts.After leaving Thornfield, Jane's journey was about acceptance. She had to acknowledge - fully and wholeheartedly - her love for EFR past any conventionality. She came back to him out of love. She had no expectations but to be with his \\"best earthly companion\\".Rochester's journey was about forgiveness. He himself had to admit - heartily and unconditionally - his wrong actions and forgive himself. He lied, hid and manipulated out of fear. He did not know how to do things differently - out of love."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I love this book! Easily my favorite book to date.

I will most likely read again before I go..."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"As a writer with an MA in literature, I of course read this book as a adolescent and as part of courses in Victorian English writing. The book is a little long--but then all Victorian novels are (people had more time to read then),but the material before about who Charlotte Bronte was and that she served as a governess herself gave tremendous background to what might seem like an over-dramatic story. Charlotte Bronte was one of the first novelists to talk about the plight of single women (who had to make a living) of that era in England. Descriptions of the country side and the travel by coach are amazing and the reader feels as if he/she can actually see and experience what it must have been like to live and travel there.Charlotte Bronte's characters are sharply delineated and the main character is a strong woman in an era of weak ones; I compared them with some of the strong women found in the novels of Jane Austen. I definitely recommend it for winter reading, when there is time to snuggle up to a wood stove or fireplace with a cup of cocoa or a glass of wine and immerse oneself in another era. Probably not for male readers unless they are English majors or really appreciate women."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"This is a great book. The only complaint I have is I think because it's the kindle version, sometimes I feel like I'm missing things here and there. For example, they keep mentioning a place called ***Shire....But all I can see is ***Shire. Anyway, not sure if it's like that in the hardcopy book, haven't checked.

I would recommend this book to anyone, especially to young women above the age of twelve who want a clean love story and Christian readers who seek an inspirational message. A good choice for pleasure reading, book groups, or for school!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Excellent read - there is nothing like a good period novel - I would recommend this book to all Bronte readers who love a suspense, thriller and romance all in one!!!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"The title says \\"Jane Eyre (Penguin Classics)\\" edited by Q.

I used to groan when I was in school and I was faced with the prospect of reading one of the \\"classics,\\" but Jane Eyre always stuck out as the one I loved. Jane is a heroine we can all relate to.. she's plain, mousey, and she's had a difficult life, but she also has an underlying fire. She meets her match in Rochester, a gruff man with many secrets. It is depressing, but also redeeming. Sad, but also romantic.

It contains some aspects of our modern literature but the antics from its time of origin.As a book for AP English, I would rather have selected another book, but this is not the worst. Most readers will fare better in this book for school rather than the infamous \\"Invisible Man\\" and other commonly used senior lit. books.Be prepared for a long read, as JE is definitely longer than what a modern book usually will be. Otherwise, read away - this book has its own unique style that is interesting in all its own."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I had to read this book for school, and I was relatively impressed with it. The plot developed way too slowly for my liking though, and I found myself quickly reading through the \\"stuffing\\" to get to the juicy parts. Throughout the novel the reader gets to know the characters involved very well, and even though they aren't very realistic, they are pleasantly developed, and fun to watch grow; Jane, the main character, proved to be the most satisfying character to follow and watch grow. However, this book is written in Victorian style language, and I found this style to be incredibly boring and difficult to read through or understand at times, but the themes and motifs embedded within this novel are effectively incorporated, and they kept the reader interested in analyzing the text. As for the ending of the book, I must say that I was very satisfied; with most of the intense emotional action happening towards the end of the novel I'm not surprised Bronte found a nice, and pleasant way to end her story. Overall, this book is great for classroom discussions, or to just sit down and read for fun. Enjoy :)"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre is very inspiring piece of literature and motivates women to uprise against the society. I thought this book is very interesting but in some parts they are dull scenes. The language is well written; however, not modernize. The sentence structure is very long winded and contains a lot of imagery and metaphoric phrases. I hope to the outcome of Jane's life in the future, but I thought that its not very appropriate now in our modern society.The characters i think is well develop in the novel, but the only thing that don't convince me is the unfortunate events that the characters done in the novel is not very realistic.

I have read it at least 20 times through the years, I consider Jane Eyre a must read especially for all females regardless of age."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Today's literary environment is filled with books that read like a bowl of popcorn--they are quickly devoured and lack any substance. However, I understand why many readers shy away from the classics. Most of the time, when I pick up a book I'm just looking to be entertained and diverted--I don't want to feel like I'm in my 12th grade English class. Don't despair if that's you: there are some classic novels that capture the best of both worlds. Jane Eyre is one of those books.Jane Eyre is filled with poetic and beautiful prose that will enlarge your vocabulary and stimulate your imagination. I especially enjoy the dialogue between Jane and Edward Rochester. Not only do the characters speak beautifully, but they also speak intelligently. There are many times a soliloquy will cut right to the heart of the matter in question with the precision of a scalpel, but with language that is poetic as it is accurate. It's a pity many modern novels can't achieve this same balance.Reading Jane Eyre is not like eating your literary vegetables. This book is hugely entertaining. It's gothic romance at its best. Edward Rochester is brooding, seductive, passionate and troubled--the quintessential bad boy. He is infinitely more compelling than that other Edward you'll find lingering around Forks. Jane is a tower of strength. She is a woman who falls deeply in love, but is not defined by that relationship. She does not find her identity in any man, but in the treasure of the spirit God gave her. She faces what would seem to most of us like unendurable suffering in the most admirable way--yet she doesn't come off as superhuman. This is the kind of character teenage girls should be reading--not the simpering, swooning Bella Swan.If you pick up this book, I promise you'll be entertained--but while you are entertained, you will also be uplifted."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I've read the book and watched the excellent BBC video. But the audio book version is a revelation. The narrator teased apart the different strands that lie behind the obvious storyline with great sensitivity. Parts of the book that in my previously too-hurried reading I had found a bit slow and heavy-going, Susan Ericksen reads with considerable thoughtfulness and tenderness. Jane's provoking episodes come across with a gentle lightness, and I could go on. Sufficient to say that each character comes effortlessly and believably alive. I've come away with a whole new respect for Charlotte Bronte's skill and insight. In this reading the book becomes a very special experience.Oops!

Jane never forgets or loses who she is no matter what she goes through. And in the end, not even her wildest dreams could compare to what became her reality and it's all because she stayed true to herself. Jane Eyre, in all her bravery, quickly and easily became my most beloved heroine. She never tried to change Mr. Rochester into something he wasn't. She wouldn't allow him to spoil her with superficial things. She didn't want anything his money could buy, she just wanted to be needed, to be loved. And in the end, that was all Mr. Rochester wanted as well. What more could you ask for? Charlotte Bronte worked wonders. She made Jane feel as if she is an old friend telling her life story through laughter and tears. Reading this book will be one of the best decisions you've ever made. I guarantee it. Disney princesses can suck it. Jane takes the crown."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"The reader can understand more of the past through the eyes of Jane Eyre.

It had references, a brief little biography, and quotes...it is so wonderful and I enjoy reading it to my friends. Thank you so much."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"After her uncle dies, Jane Eyre is grudgingly raised by her aunt (bound unwillingly by a promise made to her husband), in a home where she's constantly reminded of her inferior birth, orphaned state and dependence on her relatives. To top it off, she is of unremarkable appearance and is as poor as a church mouse. Yet there is something in Charlotte Bronte's protagonist that sets her apart from the rest of the world, a sense of self-worth and self-discipline that gives her strength and resilience against the many hardships that she'll face in her lifetime.Charlotte Bronte's story begins with Jane as a young girl, living unloved and neglected amongst the untouchable splendour of Gateshead and the Reed family. Jane's only escape is in her love of books and learning, for her spiteful aunt and cousins have no control over the power of her mind - though reading must be done on the sly as John Reed will stoop so far as to deprive her of books he has no interest in himself. When such an event occurs, Jane summons up the spirit to defend herself against her cousin and is duly punished for it. Estranged from human company, her aunt orders her locked in the red room, the chamber in which her uncle dies and which holds imaginary horrors for Jane. This terrifying experience is the catalyst of her childhood which will be remembered in all frightening and unnatural occurrences henceforth in her life.Relief from her extended family comes only when she is called away to school, and despite the poor living conditions and the zealous religious restrictions of Lowood School's patron Mr Brocklehurst, Jane finds a new outlook on life through her somewhat sentimental friendship with the pious Helen Burns. Amazed at Helen's patience and resilience with teachers that constantly heckle and beat her, Jane discovers Helen's devotion to God which puts to shame her own practice of fighting back at those who wrong her. An important stage in her inner growth, Jane takes upon herself Helen's teachings, survives illness at the school and enters the world as a governess.It is here that the story begins proper (not that the proceedings are unimportant), as Jane takes up a governess position for the young ward of Mr Rochester at Thornfield, stretching her wings for the first time. Here she befriends the elderly housekeeper Fairfax and her young charge Adele, and finally comes to meet her master, the intimidating and elusive Mr Rochester. Sharing a prickly and awkward acquaintance at first, Rochester soon recognises the intelligence and wittiness hiding behind Jane's modesty and plainness. Respect turns to friendship, and from there comes the first inklings of love...But something is amiss in Thornfield in the novel's most overtly Gothic thread. Jane becomes increasingly aware of sinister goings-on in the house: mad laughter rings throughout the halls at night. Mr Rochester's bedchamber is set alight and only Jane's quick action saves him from death. A stranger arrives at the house whose presence upsets Rochester and who is found badly wounded that very night. Jane suspects the quirky housemaid Grace Poole, but ultimately this mystery has a far more devastating answer, which once more upturns Jane's life and ambitions.Charlotte Bronte's heroine is one of literature's most unique and introspective characters; an ever evolving and maturing individual, who constantly searches her soul and conscious for meaning and identity. Jane's self control is remarkable, as his her ability to rationalise problems and follow through with the decisions that she makes. By today's standards, where self-indulgence and reward-systems are the norm, Jane's state of mind is like a bucket of cold water over the head. When the moment of Jane's great choice comes, she reacts exactly as should be expected, not as some overly-virtuous, too-good-to-be-true Victorian girl. Unlike other heroines, who might be repulsed or frightened at Rochester's offer, Jane is very sorely tempted. It is from herself and the knowledge of her own weakness that she flees, not from Rochester and his pleas. In this moment the strength of her conviction and will-power is sure to impress.It is important to know that this is not just a romance novel, though it is certainly the driving force of the latter half of the novel. What is most fascinating about the relationship between Jane and Rochester is the complex power struggle that goes on between them, something that often does away with romantic disillusions and deals with the practical and often uncomfortable components of attachment. Mr Rochester is Jane's employer, her social superior and a man considerably older than our teenage protagonist, yet Jane is constantly attempting to exert a sense of control over him and her feelings for him, knowing the cost that would come in succumbing to the man she describes as nearly taking the place of Almighty God in her estimation. The games they play with each other, the testing and the intrigues formed between them are riveting stuff and explore the darker power-struggles of male and female relationships that are almost always lost in typical romance novels. Bronte creates an astonishing amount of equality between the two lovers, for as the novel progresses Rochester becomes more and more reliant on Jane.Jane Eyre is in many ways a feminist novel, addressing to its contemporary audience the drudgery and monotony of female existence that \\"confine themselves to making puddings and knitting stockings, to playing on the piano and embroidering bags\\". Jane's \`adventures' through school and into the world of employment, her experiences of passionate love and destitution in the wilderness, reflect Charlotte Bronte's own struggles in a man's world. Most (if not all) of the men that Jane meets in her travels attempt to control her in one way or another, and Jane is constantly fighting to walk her own path. As she says at the crucial point in her life: \\"I care for myself. The more solitary, the more friendless, the more unsustained I am, the more I will respect myself.\\" The loneliness apparent in this passage, and the aloneness in which she spends most of her time is what makes the character of Jane so memorable - here is girl that has no one to look out for her but herself, and yet she keeps her kindness, faith and honour without falling into self-pity or bitterness.\\"Jane Eyre\\" is one of those classic books that everyone's heard of - but it's up to you to take the next step and read it for yourself."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"The epic story of Jane Eyre, Charlotte Bronte's 'poor and plain' 19th century heroine, is a rare and wonderful combination of intelligent prose and keen emotion. It's a sweeping masterpiece of a love story, and a book which, even now, remains as accessible and valid as it did upon its first release.Jane, the heroine, is an orphan, being raised by her cruel Aunt Reed. Tired of her troublesome charge, Mrs. Reed sends Jane to board at Lowood Charity School, where she discovers a new way of life, sometimes as cruel as her time at Gateshead, sometimes full of friendship and laughter. Presently, she accepts the job of Governess to the precocious daughter of Mr. Rochester in Thornfield Hall, and falls in love. She discovers inner strength and self-worth through the redemptive power of that love.Unlike the novels of Jane Austen, Bronte's heroine is from an underprivileged class, and the mood of this story is generally sombre. However, compared to 'Shirley', or Emily Bronte's masterpiece 'Wuthering Heights', 'Jane Eyre' takes what is essentially a sorrowful tale and imbues it with vivid, if brief, descriptions of happiness and love. A sense of belonging pervades the latter half of the story, thrown into high relief by several traumatic events, and culminating in Jane achieving her heart's true desire - a family of her own.It's a more straightforward and rewarding book than most 19th century epics, and for that, it's a better way of introducing oneself to 19th century literature. Bronte's acute awareness of the complexities of human emotion is palpable, and her heroine Jane displays a sense of isolation and self-reliance not found in many other novels, contemporary or otherwise. This is the hook, this is what draws the reader to the character of Jane, she is hard and self-sufficient, without resorting to bitterness or introversion. This subtle contrast forces us to empathise with Jane's plight, and we are all the more satisfied by the story's end.Basically a love story played out against the backdrop of harsh, austere 19th century rural England, 'Jane Eyre' is a book you will return to, again and again. It's romantic, gothic, sparse and, conversely, lush, and truly deserving of its status as Classic. Buy it."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"The title character of this novel is unusual, indeed, extremely rare - Marian Halcombe in The Woman in White is the only other such romantic literary heroine I can think of - in that she is not physically attractive. She has neither looks nor fortune. Most romantic heroines have the former but not the latter. It is Jane's character alone that the hero falls in love with. It is clear from the writing that Charlotte herself was unattractive and painfully aware of it. Strangely, the reading public have been unable to accept this, the very element of the book that makes it a perfect romance. The portrait of Charlotte that is most often reproduced is an idealized effort that makes her look beautiful. And whenever a screen adaptation is made of the book, the actress playing Jane is always beautiful. This reduces the theme to that of a rich man falling for a pretty servant girl. As always with classic literature, if you have only seen the movie, you emphatically do not know the book.My first Bronte novel was Emily's Wuthering Heights, which I found very disappointing, with its heavy-breathing masochistic melodrama. But sister Charlotte is a writer of a very different caliber. From the first few pages, the reader knows they are in the hands of a great artist. The heartrending portrait of childhood with which the story opens is based on the author's own experiences, and it shows.The book is not without flaws. The latter stages of the plot are carried along by a series of totally incredible coincidences and there is rather more Victorian melodrama than most modern readers would care for. But it remains, with its Plain-Jane heroine and its unlikely hero (in the end, he satisfies none of the conventional requirements of a romantic hero) the perfect romance. Never was the power of love more satisfyingly expressed."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I'm sorry and rather shocked that our kids apparently find this marvelous novel a drag. I'm 53, and I've read it about once a year since I was 12. . .never once as a school assignment, much less a punishment. I've read for pleasure all my life. . .voluminously, addictively. . . and Jane Eyre is my alltime, number-one favorite novel. Dull?!? Good grief, silly girls, it's the first fullblooded feminist novel in English, and still the very best! It has a bright, strong, creative, misunderstood and abused kid heroine who nearly dies of her maltreatment, but survives, thrives, ignores her era's view of women as brainless porcelain dolls, experiences passionate love on her own terms rather than his, refuses to give up her enormous integrity for a false heaven, lives homeless and nearly dies of it rather than become anyone's plaything, fends off patriarchal religion with rare spirit and honesty, and finally. . .well, I'll let you read the absolutely splendid ending for yourselves, if you haven't been rendered incapable of understanding it by today'salleged educational system. Suffice it to say that it was sufficiently radical in its day to get the author a lot of hate mail. . .to which she replied with a spirit that would've made Jane proud."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Charlotte Bronte's \\"Jane Eyre\\" has been one of my favorite novels since I first read it in high school. It is one of those special books which can be read and savored over and over, and seems to improve with each reading. The tale is narrated by Miss Eyre, herself, inviting a special and intimate relationship with the reader. It is through Jane that we meet and grow to care about, or hate, so many of the memorable characters one becomes acquainted with on these pages. And it is through her narrative, first as a little girl, then as a young woman, that Jane's complex persona is revealed. From an early age her morality, wit, determination, sheer grit and romanticism are evident.Published in 1847, the novel, at first glance, appears to be another well written gothic romance, of the kind so popular in the Victorian Age, with its mystery, horror, brooding hero, touch of the melodramatic, and dark castle-like setting. The rise of poor orphaned Jane, who against all odds, redeems her tormented hero through her steadfast love, is really not unique at all. Charlotte Bronte did not, however, write a mere romance, no matter how riveting the read. Throughout, the author makes some serious statements about women's equality, the treatment of children, and of women forced into a dependent state during the Victorian epoch, religious hypocrisy, romantic relationships between men and women, the nature of true love, and the development of self. This is a beautifully written work of fiction which combines a riveting storyline, compelling characters, vivid descriptions along with a powerful testimony about the period in which the book was written.Young Jane, orphaned at an early age, is grudgingly taken-in by her Aunt, Mrs. Reed, who seems to despise the child. The Reed children are spoiled rotten, and the eldest son is somewhat of a sadist who abuses his young cousin terribly. Aunt Reed always finds a reason to blame Jane for the household's ills. When the boy takes his torture too far and Jane attempts to defend herself, her aunt has her locked in the room where her uncle died, terrifying the poor girl into hysteria. Unwilling to care for the girl any longer, Mrs. Reed packs her off to the harsh Lowood School, a miserable charitable institution which is more like a prison than a place of education. Lowood's despicable headmaster, Rev. Brockelhurst, does everything in his power to break Jane's spirit. At one point, when he asks Jane how to avoid going to hell, she defiantly responds, \\"I must stay well and not die.\\"A particularly compassionate teacher recognizes Jane's intelligence and sensitivity and befriends the girl. When Jane graduates she stays to teach at Lowood until her mentor leaves to marry. Jane then decides it is time for a change, and applies for a position as a governess. She is offered a job at the distant Thornfield Manor. Mrs. Fairfax, Thornfield's housekeeper, welcomes her warmly and introduces her to the staff and to little girl who will be her pupil, the precocious Adele. She is not, however, introduced to all the household's inhabitants - especially not to one who inhabits the uppermost floor. Thornfield's owner, Mr. Rochester, (one of my favorite literary heroes), is away when our protagonist arrives, yet it is he who will have a most profound effect on her life - and she on his.If you have not read \\"Jane Eyre\\" yet, why wait any longer? If you have not reread it for a few years, now's the time! My highest recommendations!The Barnes and Noble Classic Edition provides an excellent Introduction and Notes by Susan Ostrov Weisser, a Professor of English at Adelphi University where she specializes in nineteenth-century literature and women's studies. Her research centers on women and romantic love in nineteenth-century literature, as well as on contemporary popular culture. This is a hardcover book. Highly recommended!JANA"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Reading any Bronte work requires the rare ability to speak in both a refined and musical woman's English accent, and immediately switch to the voice of a commanding and brooding male who likes to throw things.Susan Erickson is up to the challenge. Her fitting voice and intonation naturally rise and fall between Jane's contrasting Victorian reserve and fiery passion. Whereas some reader's tones obviously change between cuts, Erickson's are seemless. Her speed and diction make the story very clear.This unabridged performance seems to sell for cheaper than the others, but that is not because the performance is lacking.Technical issues: Each CDs track number goes up to around 97, 98, or 99.

It captured my imagination as a young teenager and it continues to capture my imagination as a grown woman with a child of my own. I read it probably about once a year and every time I read it, I find more to love. The story is timeless and the themes are relevant even in today's world which is certainly a mark of Bront's prodigious talent and insight.This is a feminist tome in so many ways. Right up front, we are told of Jane's plainness and in an age when being pretty was about the best a woman could hope to be, this is an especially significant detail. It quickly becomes clear that Jane will not make her way in the world thanks to her looks and it immediately frees the author to focus on what is truly important: Jane's heart, soul, and mind.Her grossly abusive childhood is repugnant in all senses of the word and especially so when one considers that there were likely many, many young girls who suffered in exactly the way Jane suffers. This is a great characterization of the concept of heartless charity and false piety. Aunt Reed and Mr. Brocklehurst are textbook examples of Christians who have no real connection or adherence to their beliefs, who are more or less going through the motions in order to make themselves look good in the eyes of others. I find the scene where the sumptuously attired Brocklehurst women visit Lowood to be one of the book's many stellar scenes. With great subtlety and skill, Bront drives home her point that those who excel at making themselves appear superior to others are often those leading the most hypocritical of lifestyles.I am also always struck by the realization of how bleak Jane's prospects are. Ultimately she is fortunate to find a position as a governess in a house with one obedient and affectionate child. Though Ad&egrave;le is nowhere near an intellectual equal to Jane, she is not the wild, spoiled child that many governesses likely had to suffer. What's more, Jane has an employer who may be absentee, taciturn, and mysterious but pays her well, solicits and respects her opinions, and sees her as his intellectual equal. Again, Bront vividly underscores Jane's lot with the scene in which Lady Ingrahm bemoans the \\"martyrdom\\" she has suffered because of her many governesses, at which point her spoiled and gold-digging daughter professes how much she and her siblings enjoyed tormenting the women forced to attempt to educate them.As for the romance, it is one of the very best. There is no scene that can even hold a candle to Mr. Rochester's description of the string that binds him to Jane. The passion between Mr. Rochester and Jane is so vivid that it practically leaps off the page and it is sexy in a way that no tawdry novel could ever hope to replicate.Ultimately, though, it is Jane who makes the story what it is. Though it may break her will or her heart or both, Jane refuses to be anything less than true to herself, a truly revolutionary concept given the era in which the novel was written. Jane is strong-willed, loving, and intelligent and she never seeks more than to be exactly who and what she is. Though she is a kind person, she seeks no one's approval and when she must ultimately make a choice between her own soul and her heart's desire, she refuses to compromise herself in any way. There are few messages stronger than this for women of any age.This is a truly ageless masterpiece that demands repeated readings and that deserves a place of honor on the shelf of anyone who loves literature. I can hardly wait to share it with my daughter when the time comes. In this age of Bratz dolls and Britney Spears, girls need a role model like Jane more than ever."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"It's hard to imagine a better gothic romance than \\"Jane Eyre\\" -- gloomy vast houses, mysterious secrets, and a brooding haunted man with a dark past.In fact, Charlotte Bronte's classic novel has pretty much everything going for it -- beautiful settings, a passionate romance tempered by iron-clad morals, and a heroine whose poverty and lack of beauty only let her brains and courage shine brighter. And it's all wrapped in the misty, haunting atmosphere of a true gothic story -- madwoman in the attic and all.Jane Eyre was an orphan, abused and neglected first by relatives, then by a boarding school run by a tyrannical, hypocritical minister. But Jane refuses to let anyone shove her down -- even when her saintly best friend dies from the wretched conditions.But many years later, Jane moves on by applying to Thornfield Hall for a governess position, and gets the job. She soon becomes the teacher and friend to the sprightly French girl Adele, but is struck by the dark, almost haunted feeling of her new home.Then she runs into a rather surly horseman -- who turns out to be her employer, Mr. Rochester, a cynical, embittered man who spends little time at Thornfield. They are slowly drawn together into a powerful love, despite their different social stations -- and Rochester's apparent attentions to a shallow, snotty aristocrat who wants his wealth and status.But strange things are happening at Thornfield -- stabbings, fires, and mysterious laughter. Jane and Rochester finally confess their feelings to each other, but their wedding is interrupted when Rochester's dark past comes to light. Jane flees into the arms of long-lost family members, and is offered a new life -- but her love for Rochester is not so easily forgotten...\\"Jane Eyre\\" is one of those books that transcends the labels of genre. Charlotte Bronte spun a haunting gothic romance around her semi-autobiographical heroine and Byronic anti-hero, filling it with brilliant writing and solid plot. It has everything all the other gothic romances of the time had... but Bronte gave it depth and intensity without resorting to melodrama.Bronte wrote in the usual stately prose of the time, but it has a sensual, lush quality, even in the dank early chapters at Lowood. At Thornfield, the book acquires an overhanging atmosphere of foreboding, until the clouds clear near the end. And she wove some tough questions into Jane's perspective -- that of a woman's independence and strength in a man's world, of extreme religion, and of the clash between morals and passion.And Bronte also avoided any tinges of drippy sentimentality (Mrs. Reed dies still spewing venom) while injecting some hauntingly nightmarish moments (\\"She sucked the blood: she said she'd drain my heart\\"). She even manages to include some funny stuff, such as Rochester disguising himself as an old gypsy woman.The story does slow down after the abortive wedding, when Jane flees Thornfield and briefly considers marrying a repressed clergyman who wants to go die preaching in India. It's rather boring to hear the self-consciously saintly St. John prattling about himself, instead of Rochester's barbed wit. But when Jane departs again, the plot speeds up into a nice, mellow little finale.Bronte did a brilliant job of bringing her heroine to life -- as a defiant little girl who is condemned for being \\"passionate,\\" as an independent young lady, and as a woman torn between love and principle. Jane's strong personality and wits overwhelm the basic fact that she's not unusually pretty. And Rochester is a brilliantly sexy Byronic anti-hero with a prickly, mercurial wit.Of Charlotte Bronte's few novels, \\"Jane Eyre\\" is undoubtedly the most brilliant -- passionate, dark and hauntingly eerie. Definitely a must-read."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"More than a simple love story, a gothic romance, a Victorian novel, or even a female picaresque work, Jane Eyre is, quite simply, a wonderful book. Written, as it was, in Victorian England by a female author, Jane Eyre has occasionally been pigeonholed as a garden variety gothic romance. It is much more than this, however: not only is it a genuine classic, it epitomizes its genre. There are several factors that set it above the pack. For one, it is extremely well-written: Bronte's characterization is masterful and the plot is well-developed. One comes to identify with the character of Jane, who narrates, and the other characters in the book, most of whom are well-drawn, rounded characters. The book also features other elements which are unusual for a book of its kind and which were genuinely new at the time. For starters, take its protagonist, the title character: she is not beautiful, like Edith Wharton's Lily Bart; she is not rich, like most of Jane Austen's female characters; she is not ambivalent and wish-washy like Kate Chopin's Edna Pontellier; she is not an intellectual. Jane is a well-drawn, rounded, truly believable character -- and a genuinely likable one. The reader comes to empathize and identify with her. Strong-willed, independent, and indefatigable, Jane is not a hard-to-like character like the aforementioned Edna Pontellier from The Awakening; the book could almost be called a female picaresque novel, were she not so practical and solid a character. Also setting the book above its ilk are several dark story details that set the book above the of the typical love story. Bronte also uses the book as a medium to criticize certain aspects of Victorian culture: the inhumane and non-emphatic treatment of the poor by the rich, the denial of the pursuit of happiness, the plight of orphans and other who had no well-defined place in society, the often cruel sternness of church and other authority figures, among much else. Bronte also pauses from time to time to take on spiritual and quasi-philosophical elements, which give the book an added depth and sophistication. With all of this, Bronte succeeds in bringing the book out of the sphere of mere feminist literature: its universal theme and eclectic contents set it above the works of Austen and Chopin, among others. Though many aspects of the novel show it to be a clear product of the Victorian era, the book, with its just-mentioned strengths, is a universal work that will endure for centuries yet to come. In this way, it is much more applicable to our present day than works such as, say, The House of Mirth, which deal primarily with ephemeral concerns. On top of all this, it is a wonderful and delightful read. What we have here is a true classic.This is essential reading for any fan of romances, gothic literature, or Victorian literature in general; readers looking for a truly great and easily-accessible classic need also look no farther."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Jane Eyre, by Charlotte Bronte, is an enticing Victorian love story of a young woman as she grows and matures. The plot made me want to read so I could find out what happens. The characters have realistic feelings and thoughts, which made me sympathize and feel with them. Even though I thoroughly enjoyed this book, I often found myself re-reading a paragraph so I could fully understand what I had just read. These long paragraphs, however, did not stop me from reading forward and liking the book.I would recommend this novel to late high school and college students.

I read this book for the first time at age thirteen and loved it, and as a huge Bronte fan, cannot fathom why so many people I know cast off classics as boring. My only guess is that they have not read them.I will skip giving a plot overview here. But I will mention that one complaint I have heard frequently is that there is little action in this story. Well, just because our attention spans have decreased drastically because of TV doesn't mean that good books should move just as fast. The beauty of the macabre and ethereal Jane Eyre is not in the plot, though that is also wonderful, but in the descriptions of Jane's own feelings and turmoil and love. She is easy to relate to for women of all ages - who hasn't understood the feeling of wondering where to go with one's life?I have also heard complaints that there are problems with the edition, especially spelling mistakes (i.e. Rochester calling Jane Janet). This is a pet name. It appears in every edition true to the original text - often, it is taken out to avoid confusing people. Overall, Penguin is a wonderful classics publisher, especially the annotations and footnotes. They explain a lot of the dated references or confusing dialect.Though I personally would have preferred a bit darker a novel (i.e. Wuthering Heights), I believe this to be one of the timeless classics of English literature and a must-read for everyone, lit major or not."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"The story of an innocent young woman who falls in love with a mysterious older man with a dark past is tried and true. In the hands of Ms. Bronte, it acquires a depth of feeling and sincerity of emotion that raise the story type above the maudlin. There may have been other gothic romances similar to \\"Jane Eyre\\" before this was written, and there have certainly been many after it, but none have been quite so wonderful.Lord Byron may have supposedly invented the Byronic hero when he wrote about \\"Manfred\\", Mr. Tortured By A Troubled Past... but Bronte's Mr. Rochester is a perfection of the type. He's sensitive, yet abrupt. Demanding, yet tender. Proud, yet remorseful. Every time I read this book, I fall in love with him all over again.Jane Eyre herself is an even more complex character than Mr. Rochester. She's tough and stern, yet playful. She has a firm moral center and does not hesitate to do what she believes is right, even when it hurts herself or those around her. And by being true to herself and what she knows is right, she ultimately triumphs over a variety of people who might do her great injury (intentionally or not). Again, literature has seen many sturdy, spunky heroines come and go, but Jane Eyre is a perfection of the type."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Last night I finished reading Jane Eyre and I just cannot ever remember being so moved by such a book. Throughout the whole novel, I screamed in shock, in agony, and in suspense. To the very ends of its pages, I would turn each leftlet in fevor, waiting wishing and trying to imagine what would happen. I would not have had the strength to run from the man I loved; I would not have the dignity to turn down St John; I would tremble in the presense of such a strong willed and determined woman as Jane. She set her faith on the One Above and let him guide he no matter what. Her challeges and triumphs are proof of that in itself. I really wonder what Charolette Bronte could have possibly been going through when she sat down to write this book. Every word is delicious and savoring yet some are quite agonizing, so much in fact that I once threw the book down and didn't want to read on, for fear of what Mis Bronte woudl throw on me next. This book will probably be my favorite book of all time. I just dont think I can desribe in words how much it has effected me. I really want to discuss this with someone, but it seems everywhere i talk about it it falls on deaf ears.

Jane's character is one that anyone could identify with, not pretty, not special in any way, and low in the self-esteem area. But through the course of the book, she blossoms, and reveals herself to be a woman of great strength, intelligence and integrity. Her relationship with Mr. Rochester is complex and satisfying.

She is praised not only for her beautiful and eloquent writing but also for her captivating stories that fascinates readers of all generations. In this riveting novel that many considered the most prominent literary work of Charlotte Bronte, the life of a 19th century young English woman, Jane Eyre, is portrayed vividly. It is a life of shocking reality, a combination of misery and at the same intrigue and triumphs. Starting from her youthful years, she is met with great obstacles. As a small girl, Jane lived under the scrutiny of her cold hearted aunt, who not only showed bias but also cruelty. Sent to Logwood School at a young age, Jane is cast aside from the other students. Constantly tortured by her teachers and declared as a definite sign of evil and wickedness, she has grown up through a bitter childhood into a woman of great determination and tremendous courage. Striving in a world meant for the wealthy and fortunate, Jane is granted a job as a governess in the mansion of a rich yet mysteriously shrouded man, Mr. Rochester, who only visits the place years at a time. Handsome and prosperous, Mr. Rochester has had his own life of torment, one complicated by deception and remorse, and a shadowed past of beguilement concealed by intricate lies that haunted him for years. Yet, either by coincidence or fate, he unexpectedly went back to his mansion right after Jane's arrival. Inspired and warmed by Jane's calmness and wisdom, the pair soon becomes entangled in a complicated labyrinth of romance mingled with obscurity and dark secrets. With the greatest chance of happiness inches away, Jane discovers a terrifying truth, one that can ultimately destroy ...or save her.Through the main character, Jane Eyre, Charlotte Bronte graphically woven this book into a world where we, as readers, can all connect to. I highly recommend it to everyone! It is a classic that cannot be put down!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"The story of Jane Eyre is a classic tale of a search for human compassion. From the tragedies of her orphaned beginnings and a childhood with a hateful aunt who, out of spite, sends Jane to a prison-like life at Lowood Boarding School, Jane's strength of character shines through. Through each ordeal the reader develops a true concern for this \\"plain Jane\\". When she finally begins to find a more content life at Thornfield and as her relationship with Rochester develops into love the reader feels happiness for her, but follows her through the depths of despair at the shocking revelation that prevents her from marrying him. The reader cheers for her as she rebuilds her life as a strong, independent woman who is able to choose her destiny.Jane Eyre is a beautifully written book, although at times Charlotte Bronte's descriptions were very wordy and therefore the reading process was difficult. Understandably, this descriptive style of writing was typical of an era in which the average person did not have the opportunities we now have to envision different people and places."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Charlotte Bronte takes a plain Jane, and makes her one of the most memorable characters from the likes of Bronte sisters. This novel starts at a boarding school, as we learn of Jane's painful childhood, grows into an exciting love story as governness Jane falls for Mr Rochester, (whose daughter she tutors), and after a lot of twists, drama, separation and engrossing trains of events Jane finds home, love and happiness.I have had read the abridged version at age of 11, and loved it then. Over the years, I have repeatedly reread the novel. Like all classics, everytime I read it, it offers an array of previously unfelt emotions and of course remains as enchanting as ever. To say very least, it is like your favorite soap opera that you watched while growing up, has characters and events you nearly can never forget, and due to its ageless charm, you revisit those times and emotions through all the reruns and remakes. Maybe the weight of my years of association makes this novel unforgettable for me, but trust me, read it and you will definitely feel the romance, the pain, the emotion, the passion: and maybe like me, return to read it again!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Jane Eyre, by Charlotte Bronte, is a touching love story from the 19th century. Within the first few pages you will be swept up into a poor orphaned girl's troublesome life. Jane Eyre's sorrows, triumphs, and love are woven together in an almost magical way that keeps you reading until the end. There is mystery, suspense, and drama in this book, and also humor and happiness.Jane is an orphan who was raised by her cruel Aunt Reed. She was sent off to a charity bording school called Lowood. There our 'poor and plain' heroine spends eight years. With sad and happy memories from Lowood, Jane departs to become a governess at Thornfield Hall. Little does she know of the mystery in the attic or the love that awaits her.I reccomend this book to anyone who enjoys reading a good classic. It's really a magical tale that is worth reading over and over again.The reading is moderately hard, it is probably about high school reading level. I loved it, andunderstood it, even though I am in 8th grade.I think that when I finished this book I was slightly changed from what I was when I started this book. I can really relate to Jane Eyre, and that is why I think that girls tend to like this novel more than boys. Also because it is a romance,but who knows, it really depends on what kind of person you are.Jane Eyre is a passionate novel that sketches the way women felt in the 19th century, and what they went through. Jane Eyre's passion pours out of her so strongly, especially in this sentence:\\"...my soul began to expand, to exault, with the strangest sense of freedom, of triumph, I ever felt. It seemed as if an invisible bond had burst, and that I had struggled out into an unhoped-for-liberty\\""},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I thought I was seeing things, so I enlarged the picture of the cover: does it *really* say Jane Eyre, by Emily Bronte? I know that it's the thrift edition, but was it necessary to be so thrifty that they credited the wrong sister? Maybe I wouldn't have been so \\"up in arms\\" if this weren't my favourite novel of all time... I still remember reading it for the first time... wondering about the mystery and fear surrounding Grace Poole (don't worry: I've given nothing away). Ms *Charlotte* Bronte has written a romantic, mysterious, heartbreaking page-tuner of a novel, and everytime I get to the last page, I'm bereft. Read it, at any cost...I see that the people who've dissed the novel have largely been *forced* to read it at school etc. Shame that they feel this way, because it's one of the most powerful novels with a woman protagonist that has ever been written.Yes, Charlotte has written what feels to our 21st-century eyes like a romantic piece of pap, but consider this in the context of the time: it was written by a woman (albeit under a male pseudonym initially), about a woman character who was in control of her own life, and able to make her own life decisions, rather than being under the male yoke. This was groundbreaking stuff, and actually manages to subvert the apparent genre. Read from this perspective, this novel is revolutionary, and far from pap.(By the way, if you want to read a *real* Emily Bronte novel, then it's probably Wuthering Heights you'd be after)"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I don't especially know why I picked &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; off my shelves recently.

The narrative: descriptive, philosophical, flawless. The charaters: both believable and lovable. I was so engrossed I found myself getting angry when plans went awry and on the verge of tears when they went right. I recommend that you DO NOT read this while you are young, as a previous reviwer suggested... I did so the first time around and in no way shape or form was able to appreciate its subtleties and sheer elegance to a thousandth of the degree I do now.

However when it is forced down the throats of unwilling English students, Bronte's ultra-quixotic plot, and seemingly incessant need to detail the most superficial minutia only add to the painful legnth of the novel.By page 400, I had become so tired of Jane's apathetic nature, I was indifferent to the outcome, so long as it came swiftly."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"First I've read this amazing story.

I liked the Biblical references that are littered throughout the story but the book gives very little insight as to whether there is any real religion observed.

She starts out in the home of her aunt and three cousins all of whom despise her. She was left there as a young girl with her caring uncle when both of her parents died. Her uncle died shortly later and Jane was left in less than desirable conditions. After a blood-curdling incident her frustrated aunt sends her off to boarding school where, for the most part, she is treated worse than she was in her aunt's home. From there she becomes a governess and takes care of a little girl for a man whom she later falls in love with. This is where the story really gets interesting as several twists and turns take the couple towards an unexpected ending.Charlotte Bronte, the author, has a writing style typical of the romance period. Her vivid descriptions, while being wonderfully picturesque, can at times be lengthy. There are so many images of gardens and mountains and sunsets that the plot often gets lost somewhere along the way. The story can also become frustrating at times. I often longed to yell at the characters and set them in the right direction as they slowly picked their way through the tangled mess they were enveloped in.Bronte's heart was in the right place with this one. The story is one of a great love and an extraordinary woman. Jane Eyre is a one in a million kind of girl whose life story is definitely one worth telling. However, it is one that could have been told much more simply. There are parts of the novel that don't seem to have any real purpose other than to fill pages. They don't give away anything as to how she is going to end up. It merely confuses and frustrates the reader into utter boredom. So while the story and writing are both tasteful, Jane Eyre can only be taken in small doses."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Jane was such a brave woman throughout her misfortunes .She began as a womanly child, professing to ignore her troubles and trying to love life for its worth .She deserved LOVE."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I have a good hint for all you people who have to read this or any other book for summer reading or as a class assignment.

All I say is that there was an Anti-Semitic comment by Jane Eyre in the middle of the book that turned me down. I started to doubt Jane's moral and could not recover from that ignorant statement. I finished the book just to know how that story would end. I don't have any admiration for the character."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"It seems that the basic purpose of the character Jane Eyre is to suffer nobly and then eventually succeed. Both elements are highly problematic as presented. Her noble suffering acts to undermine her actual character, making someone that reacts the same to most of the challenges--stoic, determined, largely silent, resigned. This required attitude makes her too much of a blank slate, too reactive, with insufficient personal details to be memorable or seem like a complex psychological portrait. One gathers that Bronte was trying to subvert common norms in representation of woman, by making Jane a lot plainer and less accomplished than was the usual style. She may have made a major improvement in this, and as discussed below there are some interesting elements to all this, but the basic result undercuts the character's agency too much. Jane can work as a symbol, she does not work as a person, and the novel is too deeply linked to her consciousness for that to be a passable loss.As well there are major pacing issues and apparent questions on the larger arc, with much of the first hundred pages and the last hundred and fifty being off-tangent to the necessary interactions for the particular story. Still, it was hardly the worst or most difficult work to get through. For much of the first two hundred pages I found it moderately enjoyable, without thinking it was very good. I was reading it as a dark comedy, framed by a blank protagonist in a fundamentally ridiculous situation. The humor--genuine though presumably unintended--came from the contrast of the stylized language forms and general etiquette focus and how cruelly people acts. See in particular the treatment of Jane in the devil child scene, in the way that's she stiffly defends herself as opposed to how the school argues she's a literal follower of the devil, and how that's a bad thing. Amusing, in a twisted sense, at least as I took it.Where I stopped being able to do this was precisely the point that the horrid and creepy Mr. Rochester became crucial to the story. He was a fundamentally twisted, harsh and disturbing person in his own right, and the eventual arc of the book where Jane does marry him and this is apparently a good thing fatally undermines the book. The way Jane plods on is problematic in itself, but it's what he ultimately plods to that is truly wrong. Rochester's focus on pride and control, his lies, his age, his borderline-deranged manner of fixating on women, the fact we have only his own word on the true story with his first wife, all these make Jane's eventual marriage with him very far from a happy thing. Yet the book seems insistent to regard it in this light, as if Rochester's injury has in itself transformed his character enough that Jane waiting on him for the rest of his life a satisfying resolution. It's the ending scenario that makes the conclusion of the author and the whole structure of the narrative less than even good.Nevertheless, the novel is an accomplishment in a number of ways. That it exists at all, that early in the nineteenth century a woman could be published. Furthermore, it's extraordinary that she was able to include so centrally in her work a protest and anger against the systemic condition of women of her time, and that both elements have been perpetuated down into the present. Creepy as some of the above subtext is, that's a worthwhile development amidst what was a pretty terrifyingly close-minded century.There's also some interesting stuff at work with religion, class and attitudes in the nineteenth century context, Jane occupying a bit of a hybrid position in all of these, not affluent nor truly destitute, not tightly religious or a firm skeptic. The hybridity of her position is very revealing to a lot of norms that we might not see in novels of the period, as her very existence in the text portrays social structures even while it undermines them. Jane Eyre the character and book are transgressive in certain ways, then, and the way this plays out is interesting. Yet, I find this appealing and informative more in my hat as historian than as a reader. The book is quite revealing of the cultural context of the author, but that's going to be the case for almost every book ever published, and it's notably less effective in framing the context for its invented narrative, cast of characters, and atmosphere. I could forgive a lot more in this book, and even come to value much of it, if it weren't for that ending that pushes the whole thing into a disturbed romance. However the book does, and so let it rest.Jane Eyre reminds me of and is better than: Bronte's Wuthering HeightsJane Eyre reminds me of and is worse than: Shelly's Frankenstein"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Charlote Bronte is a beautiful writer who brings the reader for an emotional ride. You'll cry for Jane and laugh with her. I am only sixteen and I first read this book when I was fourteen. I fell in love with it and since then have read it many times.

It clearly conveys the love between Jane Eyre and Mr. Rochester as Jane Eyre emerges into womanhood. It is about life strengthening situations and finding a love that clearly does not look at the physical, but a true love that is deep within the heart. Jane Eyre is a great book by Charlotte Bronte and I will treasuer it where I go, and reread and reread it over and over. It's spectacular."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I will probably read this book again. I borrowed it from a friend and will most likely get my own copy. I liked Jane Eyre as a main character better than Catherine from Wuthering Heights because Jane was more compassionate. I also liked her because of her intriguing personality. From the beginning she sets herself as different from other people, more hardy and thoughtful. Her stay at Lowood is interesting, mainly because of her relationship with Helen and the contrast between the two. Her romance with Mr. Rochester is original. Some of that is due to the fact that Jane falls in love without being made foolish by it. Her stay with the Rivers family was sort of frustrating, because her character was suppressed by St. John. I really didn't like him. The ending was very good except for the last few paragraphs which dwell on St. John. But, that aside, Jane Eyre is a wonderful book, deserving to be read and reread by everyone."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"As a child of the eighties, when reading recently published books and seeing movies, I've grown accustomed to &quot;love&quot; being graphically depicted sexual attraction that eventually turns into romance. How refreshing it is to read Jane Eyre, where the order is reversed! A portrayal of love like this is hard to come by. In Jane Eyre, everything is pure, and the love is passionate without anything you'd be embarrassed to tell your parents about. The characters are likeable - I found myself rooting for the protagonsits, hoping Jane and Mr. Rochester would wind up togther no matter how many obstacles they may come across. Yeah, there are a lot of descriptions, but surprisingly, there was even a little adventure.

I too read this book for school, but began about six months before it was due. I think it is truly one of the most beautiful books I have ever read, with strong messages about human behavior..Jane, despite difficult beginnings in her life, became the strongest, most loving charcter in the book. Who really cares that she fell in love with an &quot;old guy?&quot; Here's a newsflash..he was only in his thirties or forties, and that isn't so old. Jane found love, and that's a bigger accomplishment than a lot of us can claim. Try Jane Eyre again some other time if you're up against a deadline..details are not evil, description is not boring. If the rest of the world says Jane Eyre is a classic, although you are entitled to your own opinion, there's a good chance it is. And one more thing-&quot;renting the movie&quot; and buying &quot;Cliffs Notes&quot; are not alternative options to reading a novel. To think that taking shortcuts in reading for school assignments is an advantage, is to fool yourself.

This is a novel not to be read, but to be experienced."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"A WOMEN'S MASTREPIECE&quot;Dear Reader&quot;- Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre was a milestone for English Literature as we know it. The fact that this captivating novel was written by a 19th century women only enhances it's genius. Charlotte Bronte acted as a trailblazer for all the women authors that would follow her; her unique style of writting and the essence of her characters stimulates the interests of every individual who reads even one line. Jane Eyre is a romantic novel about an innocent girl's voyage through life. The main character,Jane, is a orphan who we are introduced to as she is living in a house full of cruelty. The home belongs to a sour, cold women called Mrs. Reed and her three aggressive children. &quot;He bullied me and punished me ; not two or three times a week, nor once or twice in the day, but continually : every nerve I had feared hom, and every morsel of flesh on my bones shrank when he came near.&quot; Mrs. Reed's son John's treatment of jane caused harsh and long-lasting effects. The family's unjustifiable hatred for Jane results in her being sent to a distant school. Lowood is a cold, and gloomy institution for girls. Its routines are militay, its teachings are restrictive, and its conditions are horrible. She attends this school for eight years during which she excels in her studies as well as in sense. Despite the unsettled environment of Lowood, Jane enjoys her time spent there and more importantly cherishes the friendships made there. This is the place where Jane meets her first true friend Helen Burns. It is through helen's example that jane learns to be patient, diligent and expressive. &quot;Her (Helen) soul sat on her lips and language flowed, from what source I cannot tell.&quot; After eight years, Jane desires to move on in life. jane is now educated, confident and ready for change. After advertising for a teaching position, Jane accepts an offer to be a governess at Thornfield. Thornfield is a grand, old estate surrounded by the lonely moors of England. Her motive for going to Thornfield is to instruct the vibrant, young pupil Adele. The immense events and heart wrenching romance that she encounters there change her intentions quite dramatically. Jane's relationship wiht the dark and tortured owner of Thornfield, Mr. Rochester, forms the foundation of Jane's womanhood. The most unique aspect of this romance is the heroine's response to love. the majority of romance novels present a similar picture of love's hold on womane. they become increasingly more like the men they love and less like themselves. they grow weaker, more compliant and vulnerable. However, this novel's heroine does not conform but rather defies the expected. Jane discovers her love for another through the discovery of the love for herself. &quot;Women feel just as men feel.&quot; It would be pure arrogance and a literary sin if I were to describe what happens within the hidden walls of Thornfield. For this novel's majety lies not only within it's story but in the actual words of Charlotte Bronte. The way she can so vividly depict a scene or how she so clearly desribes love is a wonder. &quot;I looked at my face in the glass, and felt it was no longer plain: there was hope in its aspects, and life in its colour: and my eyes seemed as if they had beheld the front of fruition, and borrowed beams from the lustrous ripple.&quot; Charlotte Bronte had the gift of being able to capture emotion and reflect it on paper; making the image more enticing than the subject. i strongly recommend this book to anyone who has a hunger for passion, a thirst for excitement and a desire for intellect. You are not only given complete enjoyment from this novel, but a life lesson as well. This lesson implies that the only thing that matters is that you are true to yourself and to what you love. This is a lesson that you can carry with you on your own journey through life, as Jane Eyre did."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I was at first really absorbed in reading the parts that had to do with Jane's childhood. I did not miss a word of it. However, I found the parts after she became a governess a bit boring. I had a hard time with her falling head over heels with Mr. Rochester. He is too cold and self absorbed. Not the chivalrous hero of most fairy tales. His personality doesnt change one iota despite all of the things he has been through. I never ever see a resolve where he loves and accepts Adele. I thought that his indifference toward Adele was one of the things that TURNED JANE OFF about him!! Then she goes weak in the knees over him. I just found that really hard to digest. Yes, I know it's just a fiction, but the inconsistency of the woman who *seemed* to be consistent in her character threw me off."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Just to correct some other comments, the present book is only \\"Jane Eyre.\\" It is not a collection of books by the Bronte sisters as implied in the spotlight comments above.This is a great read. I bought this Oxford Classic after reading some very negative comments by Virginia Woolf in her polemic \\"A Room of One's Own.\\" There she thought that Charlotte Bronte had gone overboard mixing fiction with her own conservative views of feminism. So, I was eager to see how bad this book was.This is a great read and I read the book almost non-stop for two days. It is hard to put down. This was Charlotte Bronte's first successful book and it is her best. I am reading her next book written after \\"Jane Eyre\\", \\"Shirley,\\" and it is not as clearly structured. The present book is similar in some ways to that great classic \\"Madame Bovary\\" in that it is compact, concise, and consists of a well formulated plot; and, it has one strong central protagonist. It is a clear and compelling read. By the way, the character is almost the complete opposite of Madame Bovary in terms of morals.One can quibble about parts of the story since it relies to some extent on coincidence and luck. Those parts lack realism.The book was attacked by Christians at the time of publication almost 160 years ago and later by feminists. But that is secondary.This Oxford version has a good analysis. It has a biography of Charlotte Bronte and comments on her sisters. The Oxford introduction by Sally Shuttleworth places the book in histrical context. Also, extra notes are included on the text. I read the comments after reading the book, and the less you know about the plot before reading the book better off you will be.This is simply a great read."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Jane Eyre is a brilliant novel!

She is also quiet, meek (in her own way), but has strong opinions in the book. Mr. Rochester is dark, miserable, and extremly moody. I disliked Adele because she is way too irritating and spoiled. Miss Ingram is just as spoiled as Adele, intolerant, shallow, and insensitive. I don't really understand why Jane did not really investigate the strange laughter and Grace Poole. Well, she did but it was a very light interogation. She took Mrs. Fairfax's word for everything. Some of the things she said would be worth checking out. It gives more mystery to the book."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Jane Eyre is the ultimate orphan senario: a child's parents die and they are left to live with an aunt or uncle.jane is a governess hired by one Mr. Rochester to teach a sweet blonde child who may or may not even be his ligetimate child (not that it matters).While Jane teaches in mr. rochester's house, the two of them fall maddly in love. but, like most men in dark fiction romance, mr.

The way Charlotte Bronte descibes the characters' emotion is simply captivating. Surprises are around every corner in this book. My overall impression of this piece of work is \\"mind thrilling\\"From a most hated orphan to an educated governess, Jane Eyre does it all. At the beginning of the book we start off with the hardships of her childhood. Feeling no love except from the beloved servant Bessie, Jane Eyre can't wait to go to school and earn the affection of her teachers and get the highest rank in her class. Later on Jane finds herself in different situations taht aren't easy to get out of and as a governess for Mr.Rochester. She runs away from her half{as in her soulmat into the arms of relations whom she never knew existed.I recommend this book to anyone willing to be patient and that has a wide vocabulary.{ Specifically ages 13 and up.}- Gandalf The White"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Kathleen MarcotteMiss Wilson's 8th period English classDeath, deception, love, pain and you're not even halfway through the book. The book Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte tells the story of a strong woman named Jane and her growth from a rejected orphan to a strong and independent woman. After living like a servant in her cruel aunt's home, Jane is sent off to receive an education at a poor institute for orphans. After witnessing the death of her best friend and surviving six more years there, Jane becomes a teacher and eventually a governess at the Thornfield Manor under the master, Edward Rochester.Unlike many stories about love, in this one it is Jane's intellect and passion that is what attracts Edward Rochester. They fall deeply in love, but the discovery of Edward's insane wife causes Jane to run away. Charlotte Bronte uses her talent with words to vividly describe Jane's pain.\\"Jane Eyre, who had been an ardent expectant woman---almost a bride---was a cold, solitary girl again: her life was pale; her prospects were desolate. A Christmas frost had come at midsummer; a white December storm had whirled over June; ice glazed the ripe apples, drifts crushed the blowing roses; on hayfield and cornfield lay a frozen shroud: lanes which last blushed full of flowers, to-day were pathless with untrodden snow...My hopes were all dead---struck with a subtle doom\\" (314).Homeless, penniless, and near death Jane somehow finds work and a place to stay. Her path of self-discovery continues in the finding of her cousins and her inheritance of her uncle's fortune.She finally returns to Edward to find him staying with his servants. The once wealthy businessman had become wifeless, homeless, blind, and crippled from a fire. Jane and Edward's love had not diluted in their time apart but grew stronger. The story ends happily with Jane and Edward's marriage and birth of a son.This book is written with such detail and emotion, you instantly connect with the young woman. The depth and compassion of this book draws the reader in and teaches him/her about determination and self-worth. Her morality and strength, in a time when women were not accepted for their minds, makes Jane stand out from other heroines. When she is at the point of near death from hunger and fatigue, she will not give up.\\"While the rain descends so, must I lay my head on the cold, drenched ground? I fear I cannot do other wise: for who will receive me? But it will be very dreadful, with this feeling of hunger, faintness, chill, and the sense of desolation-this total prostration of hope...And why cannot I reconcile myself to the prospect of death? Why do I struggle to retain a valueless life? Because I know, or believe, Mr. Rochester is living: and then, to die of want and cold is a fate to which nature cannot submit passively. Oh, Providence! Sustain me a little longer!\\" (351).Jane Eyre is a classic book, but the text is quite long and at times can seem to trail off. There are points in the book that don't move and slow down the story. During one conversation between Jane and Edward the story feels like it's dragging on.\\"'Sententious sage! So it is: but I sear by my household god not to abuse it.'\`You are human and fallible.'\`I am: so are you-what then?'\`The human and fallible should not arrogate a power with which the divine and perfect alone can be safely entrusted'\\" (144).Over all, the book is excellent. It is captivating and powerful. It is a long read, but worth the time. I would recommend this book to everyone, not only women. Regardless of the gender of the hero, this book shows what one can accomplish no matter what obstacles life throws your way."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I first read \\"Jane Eyre\\" shortly after high school and was completely mesmerized by it. I have read it several times since and I come away with a different view point each time. Jane is the ultimate heroine: she's independant, doesn't bow down to what the \\"ideal woman\\" should be and doesn't let anything (or anyone) compromise her principles, even the man she loves. The book appeals to the reader both emotionally and intellectually. The emotional aspect of the book is what I love about it. When Rochester tells Jane of his feelings for her, I can the passion of the characters. And later, when Jane leaves him, the agony of the characters is palpable.\\"Jane Eyre\\" always seems to fall under \\"Wuthering Heights\\" shadow. \\"Jane Eyre,\\" I believe, is the better novel. It has all the atmosphere of \\"Wuthering Heights\\", but the romance of Rochester and Jane is far more romantic and believable than that of Cathy and Heathcliff."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I read this book when I was 15 for a school English project when a friend recommended it- I'm now 17 and I'm actually in the process of reading the book again. It's just that good. One thing I really like about this book is that Jane isn't pretty, at least not pretty like many other girls around her, and she isn't high class, but she can still have a wonderful life regardless!

The Penguin Classic differs slightly from the Norton Edition (which was assigned), so I found myself looking in the text for further detail, but it is the same story. The Norton simply gives footnotes to explain certain things, such as translating some of the French phrases. Great if you have a commute and need to read this, or just want to.

I have only read one of the books (Wuthering Heights) and I liked it. I was planning on giving these as gifts, but now I am going to keep them! My only qualm...the pages are bright white, and I wish they had gone with a more \\"vintage-y\\" look on the inside to match the outside. But I guess they will get that with age ;)"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I found this book shoved under my bed last week...it's been there since I was in high school (apparently it never got returned to the school...)I remember starting to read it 6 years ago and only got about five pages in before I lost interest and tossed it aside. However, I started it again a few days ago and completely fell in love. I love the prose, the plot, everything. I just can't keep myself away from it. Bronte's writing style is so poetic and beautiful that the story itself could be absolute trash and I would still love this book.Thankfully, though, the novel is not a load of tosh and the story itself is engaging beyond belief. Jane is left with her uncle's wife when he forces her to care for her when he dies. She's cared for about like Harry is at the Dursleys and escapes to school. Unfortunately for Jane, Hogwarts does not await her, but a rather dreary school. She remains here for 8 years, first as a pupil, then a teacher. She later gains employment for a gentleman who pays her twice her wages at Lowood and there she meets the love of her life. Unfortunate events prevent them from marrying and she continues to seek a happy place and make her way. I won't give away more.If you like Austen you will love this book. It's got the characterization and insight of Austen's books with the adventure of a more modern novel. The average young male probably won't appreciate this particular book, but I advise women at least 16 and older to read it. It is absolutely fascinating and much better than the current pop-literature pumped out today."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Jane Eyre was long, wordy and old. It was a recipe for instant dislike. While I didn't love the book, I certainly enjoyed it. The character of Jane Eyre was upstanding and brave. She showcased many qualities women strive for and find hard to reach even today. Mr. Rochester was both off-putting and strangely likable at times. The mixture of drama, romance and a bit of mystery was engaging. While I often put the book down, I never once thought of not finishing it. A deserved classic."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"It's incredible to think or imagine that, of the two most intense, passionate heroines of 19th century literature, both would be written by sisters of the same family. But this is, indeed, the case. With Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre, you are drawn into a personal narrative that from the start is compelling and becomes more disturbing and troubling. Many things have been written about Jane Eyre as a character, but to me there is no doubt that her intense character compels you to understand very specific and certain imperatives (nowadays described as feminist - then, Bronte was alone in imaginging it).The 19th century was a deeply moralistic society, at least on the surface, but one within and beneath which women as such had no identity or power beyond certain circumscribed roles (governess, wife, spinster, etc.). With Jane, you have a particular set of codes of behaviour that are radically established and are uncompromising about the male-dominated status quo: to cope with all circumstances without significant protest; not to give in to compromise that will drag your own personality down to nothingness; to speak up in situations involving the most appalling difficulties, when it matters; don't give in to compromise that will drag your own personality down to nothingness; ultimately, remain true to yourself. Such coda are radical not only in 19th century literature, but all literature before.Jane Eyre is a revolution in thinking and morality as far as male and female relationships are concerned. The only other novel that is as passionate, and as determined in thinking of the singular female self as Jane Eyre, is Emily Bronte's novel, Wuthering Heights, and her character, Catherine Earnshaw; yet Jane Eyre remains, through her novel, uncompromised of her own integrity and character, despite her circumstances et al. Catherine, according to Emily's narrative, is never given such a choice, or options of such freedom, i.e. independent female thinking.Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre is an astonishing novel: besides Wuthering Heights, by her sister Emily, it is one of the most passionate, intense, uncompromising, painful, and beautifully and intensely emotionally sustained novels of all literature. An astonishing achievement, irrespective of genre, author or century."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I've watched the movie(s) over and over but have never read the book until now.I knew what was going to happen, and still I couldn't put it down.I will be reading it again."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I loved this book so much, I have started everyone I know reading it!!

The dialogue that she would exhibit was far beyond her years, especially when she would go back and forth with Rochester. I was fascinated by just about everything Jane Eyre went through.It takes me a while to read books but it didn't take long for me to read \\"Jane Eyre\\" by Charlotte Bronte. My daughter read it in grammar school and she enjoyed it, but I think I enjoyed it better because of the period it was set in and the way the story evolved.Whether you are in high school or an adult, if you like classic stories, I don't think you can go wrong with this classic romance novel.Kindle 3G, Free 3G + Wi-Fi, 3G Works Globally, Graphite, 6\\" Display with New E Ink Pearl Technology"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Great read!

The book came in wonderful condition (considering its age). Could not be happier with this purchase!!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Although classics are largely respected books for their ability to withstand the test of time, in most cases, these classics often seem overly erudite for most students. JANE EYRE seemed to, at first, embody the rather intimidating characteristics of a classic, but I later learned that it was my lack of experience, not my lack of old-English proficiency that hindered my true respect and understanding for the novel.Compared to other classics, such as the novels of Charles Dickinson, JANE EYRE presents itself in a more approachable style of writing. This helps readers of many different English proficiency levels be able to understand Jane Eyre's tragic events and unusual acquaintances.Despite the fact that many can grasp the literal meaning of the story, it takes a lot more experience and wisdom to be able to fully understand the underlying messages. Some themes that were hidden were the limitations of women in society and the conflict that people have to accept themselves.JANE EYRE, quite truthfully, was a rather slow and sometimes dull read for me. Although my first read was disappointing, I'm sure that I will be able to learn more from the novel when reading it in the future when I encountered different events and experiences. This unending learning that can be earned from reading classics is probably what justifies their endurance through continuous changes in culture and language. I highly encourage readers to read JANE EYRE periodically throughout their life because a new side of this book will be revealed every time it is read."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"For me, the book was a little slow getting started.

I enjoy the older books better than most of the new ones."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Numerous movies have been made of this novel, or based in parts on the novel, and there is a reason why: it is a haunting, coming-of-age story, with a dark mystery and love story embedded within. Jane Eyre, who is shunted around due to her &#34;unladylike&#34; intelligence and strong sense of self, discovers love with her employer-the strange and moody Mr. Rochester. He is hiding a secret though, and it will threaten Jane's chance of happiness. Unlike many &#34;love&#34; stories from past and present however, Jane uses her inner-strength to succeed on her own, and sets the example for future &#34;strong women&#34; stories that have developed since this groundbreaking novel was written.The wordy descriptions and redundancy of some of the writing clearly dates this novel as a &#34;classic&#34; but do not let that scare you from reading. Having read this more than once, I like to skim much of it, including descriptions of her early years at the school Jane is sent to, for standing up for herself at the home she were she grew up. The descriptions DO set the mood for everything, but are still overly-wordy, which was the norm for this period of writing. One exception to this, is the novel &#34;Ivanhoe,&#34; set during the time of Robin Hood and written during the time of Queen Victoria's birth. Otherwise, as with the Bronte's works, you will deal with a lot of seemingly-useless descriptive paragraphs. AGain, it does set the mood though, and the writing itself is beautiful, even if it doesn't always forward the purpose of the story.This story is haunting, much like &#34;Wuthering Heights&#34; but I prefer &#34;Jane Eyre&#34; any day for the sheer strength of the heroine, and the surprisingly moving passion of the star-crossed lovers."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"A good classic.

She shows rare strength of character and wisdom when she literally runs away from temptation. She knows if she stays with Mr. Rochester, she will never be able to be truly happy, and that despite his promises to the contrary, that she will lose his respect, and she will lose her self-respect. She gives up everything to do what she knows is right, and in the end, she is rewarded in unexpected ways.

The novel follows the life of the fictional Jane Eyre, an orphan from birth, as she progresses from a student, teacher, governess, to finally, a wife. Some of the events Jane experiences are based on Bronte's own life. Bronte began writing Jane Eyre in 1846. It was an immediate and thorough success upon publication in 1847. The writing is enthralling, touching, and artful. The reader cannot help but become involved and interested in the compelling story of Jane Eyre."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Jane Eyre is the epitome of independence and success. Living in the nineteenth century was difficult for everyone, especially women. The conformity of their situation is shown by the author, Charlotte Bronte by the school Jane goes to. Despite the rigid life she was forced to endure, Jane started a life of her own. She faced many conflicts and difficulties in life. Fortunately, she fought and won the battle to realease the invisible bonds society placed on her. This was intriguing and well written.

The love story in it was (in my opinion) very intense a lot of the time (the part where she comes back just kills me every time). I can understand how you would not like this book if you don't like cheesy love stories (and, trust me, the ending is VERY cheesy) but it's just a wonderful book in all. The parts where Jane is not with Rochester can be tedious sometimes but, fortunately, since I've read it, I can skip those parts and just read the good ones. When Jane leaves Rochester, Bronte describes it in such a way that it makes the reader feel as if they were leaveng their one true love. The only thing that gets me is the age difference between Rochester and Jane but I don't stress over it. I recommend this book to anyone who needs a good romantic pick-me-up."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Jane Eyre is most definitely one of the most wonderful and captivating books that I've ever read.

I liked it a lot more htan I was expecting to. The characters are able to keep the readers interest, as is the plot. Throughout the story I wanted to know what was going to happen next. Starting out with Jane's childhood was a good way to help the reader understand her behavior throughout the book. I thought that at times there was perhaps too much foreshadowing, but overall I was in suspense as to what would happen next. I definitely recommed reading it."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"One could read this book over and over. Made of many different stories it compilles to something wonderfull.

All the suffering that Jane had through her life, and how she handled them. I liked the book and recommend it to anybody. Jane Eyre, a story of a girl who lived in a house that didn't belong to her, with a family that wasn't hers in which she was treated like a servant,and even less than that in certain occasions, and about her falling in love with a moody man.

The plot was semi- precictable, however the way that the plot was unveiled was creative and twisted. I enjoyed the realistic character of Jane with her insecurities and imperfect appearance. Rochester also embodies a realistic, darker, yet genuine aspect of human nature. I liked the characterization in the book as well as the diction of old British literature. I would reccomend this book to girls, not necesarily boys. Good luck with your choice!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"A Favorite! This is a must have classic. You can't put it down... a real page turner... you'll experience great emotions and it will make you cry."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Charlotte Bronte's \\"Jane Eyre\\" was never one of my favorite British novels. However, I finally revisited the book after many years and enjoyed it much more this time around.Jane Eyre is a young, determined girl who is determined to find her proper place in the world. As an orphan who was brought up by her cruel aunt, Jane is sent away to boarding school at a young age, where she and the other students suffer under the hand of an evil headmaster. Things improve at the school when the institution's poor conditions are brought to light following a typhus epidemic, and Jane finishes her schooling and then remains at the facility as a teacher for several years.Although she's content working at the school, Jane still thinks that life has something else in store for her. She accepts a governess position at Thornfield Manor, where she is employed by the dark, brooding Mr. Rochester. Despite his rather surly disposition, Jane finds herself falling in love with Rochester, and is stunned when he returns her affections and proposes marriage. Unfortunately, the wedding never takes place due to a massive secret that Rochester unsuccessfully tries to keep hidden. Jane ultimately flees Thornfield and arrives at another manor called Marsh End, where many surprises await her. Another man eventually proposes marriage to Jane, but she must listen to her heart and return to the one place where she's ever truly felt at home.Jane possesses great strength, self-worth and personal dignity. She's a woman who stays true to her principles throughout her entire life, regardless of the many challenges thrown into her path. Also, \\"Jane Eyre\\" is a love story of sorts, and it has a very romantic ending, which I always enjoy.I still think there are parts of this novel that really drag, but I appreciate it a lot more than I did when I was younger. \\"Jane Eyre\\" doesn't come close to \\"Wuthering Heights,\\" in my opinion (Emily was SO the better Bronte!), but it definitely stands on its own as one of the first truly feminist novels ever written."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"This was the first book I read by Charlotte Bronte, and after I finished it I immediately got Villette, then The Professor, and Shirley, and others! She quickly became my favorite author, mainly due to the spirit I felt coming through her writing. She seems to be a true Christian, free from a religious mind-set, and with hopeful views of humanity. I think she is very intelligent, and a little ahead of her time. I love her language and the flow of her writing. The book is romantic but a bit dark, which was a bit refreshing actually. (Although nowhere near as dark as her sister's Wuthering Heights). Read it, it is great, and don't stop at just this book. Shirley is by far my favorite."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Contrary to popular fiction of her day, Bront is keen to keep reminding us that Jane Eyre is no beauty, irregular in feature, and plain. That Rochester is dark, brooding, and not handsome, with a deficient moral history.Can such imperfects unite? Can earthy limits find heaven in love and devotion? Often he calls her by her own name. Other times he calls her by another name, an invention of endearment. What does he call her? From calling him Sir she moves to a name born of equality and devotion. What does she say? New naming is not so strange, as in Revelation 3:12: \\"I will write upon him my new name.\\"Can we ordinary persons unite? Can we couples live with each other's limitations, and be happy and joyful? We do it all the time. How many of us are perfect?Are the marriages of the \\"beautiful people,\\" the celebrities, superior to those of the rest of us?

But to fully appreciate this book requires that you be a \\"mature\\" reader. And also realize that this book was written in another era, where society and standards were much different than today.I originally read this book years ago for my highschool literature class. Although I didn't dis-like the book, I didn't exactly like it either. It did not have much of an impact on me. I think I was too immature (lacking in life experiences) to relate to and understand some of the strong emotions and the complex sides of human nature portrayed in the book.Reading this book years later as a mature adult, I was deeply touched by the story of Jane Eyre. You experience a variety of emotions: abandonment, despair, love, romance, mystery, danger, heartache. And Jane Eyre was really a character ahead of her time - Although content to conform to the standards expected of a woman in her time period, Jane had an independent mind and spirit. She would not do something against her will, heart, or conscience. She was not afraid to speak her mind. She had strong Christian moral beliefs and would not waver from them. She is a heroine to be admired and respected.So much more could be said, but I will leave it at that. If you were disapointed by Jane Eyre if you read it as a teenager, try reading it again as an adult."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Quite arguably one of the greatest British novels ever penned, Charlotte Bronte's &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; is so all-around-wonderful, it's no wonder that it's been adapted into 5+ movies.We first meet Bronte's Jane as a child, young and abused, in the care of her aunt. We immediately take Jane under our wing, feeling more her personal protector with each turn of the page. Then, one day, Jane is a woman. Though retaining many of her childlike tendencies, Jane is determined to be independent: leaving her old boarding school victorious and free, she begins a governess position at the manor home of the elusive and mysterious Mr. Edward Rochester. It is Jane who tames Rochester's brooding and arrogant heart, reducing him to schoolboyish desperation.So deliciously provactive is &quot;Jane Eyre,&quot; that it is impossible not to devour it within days; my own worn-with-love copy sits next to a dog-eared &quot;Villette.&quot;It is sometimes speculated that Charlotte Bronte exercised her complicated mind through the written word; &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; is beautiful evidence of that.As the story slows to its conclusion, you will find yourself lost: hungry for more of Jane, more of Rochester, and more of the magic that is &quot;Eyre.&quot; Quench that thirst with more Bronte (perhaps Emily's &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; or some of Anne's poetry?) or, if you're like me, a second read of the irresistible &quot;Jane.&quot;"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Jane Eyre was orphaned at an age where she didn't remember her parents and was raised by a real she-wolf of a mean aunt. She is sent away to a very strict school which sad to say, was an improvement on her aunt's residence.

When I saw the 2011 Jane Eyre with Mia Wasikowska and Michael Fassbender, I had to read the book because I was hooked.Charlotte Bronte has such talent for words. She brings you to Jane's life, her experiences, her thoughts, her feelings with such clarity that you feel like you are actually there. The narrative proceeds with great pace, just right, not too slow nor too fast. She'll take you to those great houses....those \\" Halls \\" ... Manor ....those big beautiful homes we see only in travel books.... But she has put life in them. So we see what it is like to actually live there. And what a \\" life\\" she has put in those houses!Charlotte narrated a life that is so full of passion! Among others.....grief from death, isolation,, fear, courage, sympathy, faith in the goodness of others, and Love! Mr. Rochester is a very attractive character...full of life.The dynamic between a young 18 year old girl and a 38 year old man is realistic enough. The young inexperienced girl had to earn \\"life out there in the real world\\" before she can actually be on the same level , (somehow) as Mr. Rochester. This is not the typical beautiful underdog being saved by a handsome powerful man. It is more about 2 people completing each other."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I have read this book a number of times and am always intrigued by the plot. This is also a vocabulary-building book if you enjoy learning new words."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Even I find it a little hard to believe that I only just now read this classic, and specifically because it was for book club. Even more surprising is that after all this time, I was unaware of how the book ended, so the entire conclusion was unspoiled for me. I am not a huge fan of literature from this period, although I could appreciate the gothic atmosphere and the very puritanical British-ness. Jane is a profound character and it's no wonder she is a favorite literary figure. Her determination is inspiring and I very much enjoyed witnessing her evolution. I don't think I can say much more about this most fundamental novel, other than it was so much better than I expected."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"After reading Jane Eyre 5 times, I learn more and more things.

Yet Jane Eyre transcends the thrilling parts of the book to become one of English's greatest novels.The novel is not without weakness; the entire St. John section is a bit overdramatic and somewhat contrived; yet it is essential to the novel not only for the symmetry but also to contrast a life that would only satisfy the flesh and sacrifice the soul (Mr. Rochester's proposal) versus a life sacrificing the flesh entirely for the sake of the soul (St. John.) Jane Eyre never falters from her conviction that, to be whole and true to oneself, both the spiritual and the carnal sides must be fulfilled. This was a daring proposal in Victorian England, and Jane Eyre was labeled \\"coarse\\" by one critic. Even more daring was that this philosophy was espoused by a woman writer, which is why Charlotte Bronte wrote the book under a gender-neutral pseudonym (Currer Bell.)Why should you read this classic? Initially, Jane Eyre can be enjoyed for its well-told and enjoyable story--very romantic and exciting. What makes Jane Eyre an enduring classic is that you can read it and re-read it many times over for the perfection of its structure. I have a hard time choosing between Jane Eyre and Eliot's Middlemarch as \\"best English novel.\\""},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Jane Eyre is as perfect as a book can be. It's the wonderful, multi-layered story of a poor orphan who falls in love with a man of the British upper class.Jane Eyre is a fully-fleshed out character who is, in many ways, more modern than her nineteenth century counterparts. She is definitely a character to &quot;fall in love with&quot; and one that is truly unforgettable.Although some of the events in Jane Eyre are more than a little far-fetched, the plot is so enjoyable we can easily forgive Bronte a few minor faults. The pages simply fly by as we want to learn more about Jane and Mr. Rochester and their ultimate fate, both together and apart.Jane Eyre is a classic in every sense of the word and extraordinarily enjoyable as well."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"but definitely for the more educated. If you don't appreciate literature, I would say...don't read it, you won't like it. I love it...it is my favourite book of all time, hands down, but from what I have read and heard from others, it seems that the a person merely looking for a feministic book, or something easy to read that dosn't take much intellect, would not like it at all. As far as the content.... Charlotte Bronte had such a grasp of the wonderful pathos that love can fill a person with, it's incredible. The characters are well-portrayed, and you really get to know Jane and Mr. Rochester, which is more I can say than many works of it's day. I would say that Jane Eyre is one of the ultimate triuphs of literature."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"The search for freedom is a common underlying theme that can be found in many novels. Charlotte Bronte really emphasized this theme in Jane Eyre. This novel illustrates the path a strong young woman takes in her search for contentment. As she travels from place to place it becomes obvious that she is seeking a true home. The repetition of bird motifs throughout the novel is a device that accentuates the theme of freedom. In paying close attention to these motifs one can see that Jane is actually equated with a bird. Like a bird Jane Eyre is constantly in flight in search of her dreams. Her \\"spirit followed on willing wings the flight of Hope up and on to and ideal Heaven\\" (333). The comparison of Jane to a bird, when understood, is very important to the overall meaning of the novel. At the time Charlotte Bronte wrote the novel her ideas were pretty radical, considering that it was unheard of for a woman to be independent and free willed, which are the key aspects of Jane Eyre's character. The romanticism and feminism of this novel is inspirational. I strongly recommend Jane Eyre to any woman who is not afraid to follow her own dreams."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"As an orphan, Jane has no money and no one to care for her. After enduring hardships with an aunt who doesn't love her and struggling at a strict boarding school, Jane has come to a place where she may be able to find happiness and love. This novel starts out slow, but the action picks up, developing the romance and the mystery in the novel. Charlotte Bronte uses imagery and numerous allusions in the novel. The most notable allusion is the bird allusions. This bird motif suggests freedom or independence, specifically, the independence of Jane. This theme, on a broader scheme, suggests women's independence, a subject that is not uncommon, but unorthodox at this time period. Another common allusion is a biblical allusion. These set a religious tone in the novel. Not only does Bronte allude to the Bible, she also uses religion to play a role in the development of Jane, most notably the religious boarding school and St. John Rivers. These things seem to have a negative effect on Jane, which cause her to sometimes stray a bit from religion. Even though she is negatively effected by those two elements, Jane still has religious morals that are found in the novel. Jane is honest and is not afraid to speak her mind to anyone. One can find many elements that make this book enjoyable and well worth reading. Even though starting out slow, the action intensifies with plot twists and suspense that make one rush to finish this novel."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Don't let the title of this review deceive you. I really enjoyed this book, very much. It does, however, follow a strikingly familiar formula, as do many of the &quot;strong heroine&quot; novels of the nineteenth century.Jane Eyre is a girl orphaned at a young age. She endures a very Dickensian treatment at the all-girls orphanage she is relegated to by her less than sympathetic relations, after being branded a trouble-maker, and having a bad character, and a deceitful dispostion.She survives the orphanage, only to be enlisted in the employ of a Mr. Rochester, as tutor and nanny to his charge, Adela. She is at once intrigued, if not a bit repelled by his brusque nature, and yet finds herself falling in love with him.Jane is caught up in the mystery of the 'tenant' on the third floor, a dangerous, diabolical person who places Jane's life, as well as Rochester's, in jeopardy, as Jane goes about her duties, all the while growing more and more amorous of Rochester.Eventually the identity of the 'tenant' is revealed, and Jane must chose between love and sense of duty. Being the forthright person that she is, she of course chooses duty, much to the heartbreak of both herself and Rochester, who has grown as enamored of this plain, headstrong creature as she has of him.Jane Eyre plays out in a very formulaic manner, much like many novels of the same ilk, but it is a wonderful read. The characters are engaging and entertaining. The story holds a few twists and turns, and delivers a very well-realized conclusion.For anyone who had this book thrust upon them in their teens, give it another try. For those who did not, it is well worth a first look."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Reviewers may say that as an author, Charlotte Bronte does not quite equal the best classical writers, or that her plot is too contrived, or that her dialogue is too stilted. None of these things matters, because in Jane Eyre, Bronte created a character whom I believe has no equal in fiction.Jane Eyre is a survivor in an age much more merciless than today. Condemned and degraded as a little girl by adults she trusted, she never loses her grip on her self-respect. Although she is reviled by her guardians and boarding school authorities, she retains not only her belief in herself but her innate goodness. Instead of returning harsh treatment with bitterness, she develops a character containing equal parts of toughness and kind benevolence.Her integrity is perceived by an employer whose deepest need is to recapture his own integrity, which he believes lost. Jane's guarded response to him forms much of the book's plot. Jane emerges quietly triumphant in a world in which she encountered hostility and love and ignorance and enlightenment, and met it all head on."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"...and that's saying a lot coming from me. I read about 2 books a week but none has captured me the way &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; has. Many of the reviewers here have said that the vocabulary is difficult but this is what makes Charlotte Bronte such a fabulous writer. She was a poet before a novelist and all of her dialogue is written in prose. I've seen the Orson Welles version of this movie but a movie couldn't possibly do justice to this book. Ms Bronte not only relates us to Jane Eyre but with the prosaic descriptions she allows the reader to feel what Jane Eyre feels. Also, the book is timeless...unrequited love, jealousy, rage, passion..will never go out of style which is why even readers 100 years from now will still be unable to put this book down. I've recommended this book to my daughter as my mother has recommended this book to me and as her mother recommended to her. I know this book will continue being passed from generation to generation and I plan on reading it a second time."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I have previously reviewed Jasper Fforde's The Eyre Affair and stated that although I had never read Jane Eyre, I enjoyed Fforde's take on it. I had also prided myself on never having read recreationally anything that could be considered literature that wasn't required for school. I started Jane Eyre with the attitude that I'll read it until I get bored, then stop. I didn't get bored. Charlotte Bronte created a masterpiece that kept me enthralled from start to finish. There was crime, passion, mystery and women's rights rolled into one effort. For the era in which it was written, Jane Eyre was an amazing book showing a woman of intelligence and strong character. Now I have to reread The Eyre Affair to really appreciate it."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"The first time I had ever heard about Jane Eyre I was a senior in high school, and no it was not required reading. I feel as though more and more the school systems are moving away from great literary classics. I for one did not read very many, and as an English major in college, I find I have to do a lot of catching up on my classics . . . but that's a totally different topic.I saw very early on in Jane Eyre a sort of Cinderella story unfolding, and it turned out to be very close to the story, however it was by no means exactly like the Disney version everyone knows. I loved her struggle, independence and stop-at-nothing-to-be-happy-and-fulfilled drive to change her life. At first I was angry with her for leaving Rochester, but then I felt respect for her because she was just standing up for her morals and values. Plus, it all turns out happy in the end!The one part of the novel I was unhappy with was when she runs off into the country side and coincidentally discovers her long lost cousins, the Rivers. This part of the book is very dry and dull in my opinion. It also gets creepy when her male cousin St. John tries to marry her. Yuck! But, going through that section makes the ending that much more enjoyable and happy. Some men may not like the end, but it is very beautiful and romantic. Cinderella gets her prince. This is a great feminist novel as well."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I had never seen any of the movies before I read the book, but I wanted to see what all the fuss was about since the newestJane Eyre [Blu-ray] came out.Jane Eyrehas now become one of my favorite novels. It's great literature, written very beautifully and in which every sentence, every chapter is important to the events in the book. When Jane Eyre begins telling the reader her story, you're immediately drawn in. The book wasn't that difficult for me to read--I occasionally had to look up some words on my Kindle's built in dictionary and I know absolutely no French (some characters speak sentences/words in French, but it's very minor), however this didn't take away from the beauty of the book at all.The whole romance between Jane Eyre and Mr. Rochester is amazing. It's definitely not trashy...it's classy and sophisticated...it's romantic.Charlotte Bronte evens manages to weave in a deep mystery at Thornfield Hall, done VERY successfully. I love mysteries and I had my own hypothesis of \\"who-done-it\\" and why, and was WRONG. I love that.I don't want to give anything away, if you're a new reader like I was. The movies do not even compare to the book (I went to compare as soon as I finished the book); the book is so much better, it's a delicious classic to read. I was very sad to finally put the book down when I was finished. Jane Eyre is a must read, and definitely a re-read. One of my top favorite books now.For Kindle readers: There are little to no errors in the Kindle Edition ofJane Eyre. Reading on the kindle definitely took out the anxiety factor of reading a thick book. No TOC. The only thing that slightly bothered me was instead of having the whole name of a city/town/county that ended in \\"shire\\" it was presented as \\"---shire\\". But not a huge dealbreaker considering it's free. I'm not sure if this is how it was supposed to be presented or not."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I have to say I am truly surprised. This is the third time I've read Jane Eyre, and yet the first time I've found anything positive about the experience. I read it once as an 11/12 year old because my mother bought me a lovely red leather-bound edition (apparently she loved the book and thought I would too). I hated it- too hard to read, too much philosophical rambling, no action, annoying heroine, etc. I read it for the second time as a freshman in high school because it was required. I no longer found it hard to read, but I still found Jane annoying and unsympathetic, and I still hated the book.Fast forward to this year and my decision to revisit the classics, including giving Jane Eyre one last try before forever consigning it to the \\"I just don't understand how people can like this book\\" pile. All I can say is thank goodness I gave it that one last try because the book is a masterpiece. All the philosophical rambling that bored me before is now a central element to the text, superior in many way to the storyline itself. I see now that there is a lot of action for a book of its time, and Jane is certainly not annoying so much as she is inspirational. I mean, she is still a bit pious for my taste, but even so she rebels strongly against the conventions of her time to try to live a life that she finds both emotionally and spiritually satisfying.All of the things that annoyed me when I read this book as a child are the elements that resonate most strongly with me as an adult. I read this book too early, and was too dismissive of it at the time. Like with Anna Karenina, I saw everything in black and white with the merciless clarity of a teenager; I now understand how wonderfully shaded with grey life (and good literature) often is. If you haven't read Jane Eyre since high school, I highly recommend giving it another try- definitely a 5 star!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"It's hard to imagine a better gothic romance than \\"Jane Eyre\\" -- gloomy vast houses, mysterious secrets, and a brooding haunted man with a dark past.In fact, Charlotte Bronte's classic novel has pretty much everything going for it -- beautiful settings, a passionate romance tempered by iron-clad morals, and a heroine whose poverty and lack of beauty only let her brains and courage shine brighter. And it's all wrapped in the misty, haunting atmosphere of a true gothic story -- madwoman in the attic and all.Jane Eyre was an orphan, abused and neglected first by relatives, then by a boarding school run by a tyrannical, hypocritical minister. But Jane refuses to let anyone shove her down -- even when her saintly best friend dies from the wretched conditions.But many years later, Jane moves on by applying to Thornfield Hall for a governess position, and gets the job. She soon becomes the teacher and friend to the sprightly French girl Adele, but is struck by the dark, almost haunted feeling of her new home.Then she runs into a rather surly horseman -- who turns out to be her employer, Mr. Rochester, a cynical, embittered man who spends little time at Thornfield. They are slowly drawn together into a powerful love, despite their different social stations -- and Rochester's apparent attentions to a shallow, snotty aristocrat who wants his wealth and status.But strange things are happening at Thornfield -- stabbings, fires, and mysterious laughter. Jane and Rochester finally confess their feelings to each other, but their wedding is interrupted when Rochester's dark past comes to light. Jane flees into the arms of long-lost family members, and is offered a new life -- but her love for Rochester is not so easily forgotten...\\"Jane Eyre\\" is one of those books that transcends the labels of genre. Charlotte Bronte spun a haunting gothic romance around her semi-autobiographical heroine and Byronic anti-hero, filling it with brilliant writing and solid plot. It has everything all the other gothic romances of the time had... but Bronte gave it depth and intensity without resorting to melodrama.Bronte wrote in the usual stately prose of the time, but it has a sensual, lush quality, even in the dank early chapters at Lowood. At Thornfield, the book acquires an overhanging atmosphere of foreboding, until the clouds clear near the end. And she wove some tough questions into Jane's perspective -- that of a woman's independence and strength in a man's world, of extreme religion, and of the clash between morals and passion.And Bronte also avoided any tinges of drippy sentimentality (Mrs. Reed dies still spewing venom) while injecting some hauntingly nightmarish moments (\\"She sucked the blood: she said she'd drain my heart\\"). She even manages to include some funny stuff, such as Rochester disguising himself as an old gypsy woman.The story does slow down after the abortive wedding, when Jane flees Thornfield and briefly considers marrying a repressed clergyman who wants to go die preaching in India. It's rather boring to hear the self-consciously saintly St. John prattling about himself, instead of Rochester's barbed wit. But when Jane departs again, the plot speeds up into a nice, mellow little finale.Bronte did a brilliant job of bringing her heroine to life -- as a defiant little girl who is condemned for being \\"passionate,\\" as an independent young lady, and as a woman torn between love and principle. Jane's strong personality and wits overwhelm the basic fact that she's not unusually pretty. And Rochester is a brilliantly sexy Byronic anti-hero with a prickly, mercurial wit.Of Charlotte Bronte's few novels, \\"Jane Eyre\\" is undoubtedly the most brilliant -- passionate, dark and hauntingly eerie. Definitely a must-read."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I remember that I read Jane Eyre back in high school... This time, it was completely different!! I can only guess that, as a teen, I was impatient for action, and skipped over large parts, not taking the time to truly read the book.This is a very absorbing tale! Yes, it is clear that it was written from a very non-modern outlook, and that it is not completely timeless. However, it is also clear just how different this character is from the norms of her time. The characters and their personalities are clearly drawn, and it is easy to see that they broke the mold then, and that they still break the mold now.I ended up re-reading the book immediately after finishing it. It remained fresh and fascinating. What a great book! No wonder Jasper Fforde chose this for Thursday Next's first adventures..."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I have just finished reading Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte for the fifth time in my life. I find that every time I read this book I learn something new or interpret a scene differently. I have read this book during all different phases of my life and I find that through every reading I am completely affected with the story even though I know exactly what is going to happen.The premise of the book everyone knows, our story is about the life of Jane Eyre through her childhood living at the home of her aunt who doesn't love or want to keep her to her adult years as governesses for the ward of Mr. Rochester of Thornfield Hall. Jane develops a relationship with her employer that soon blossoms into a fierce love but Mr. Rochester has a secret that he is keeping from Jane that threatens to rip everything apart leaving Jane utterly homeless and alone.This book has been talked about time and time again and I think one of the main reasons it stands the testament of time is that Charlotte Bronte creates a heroine who is so easy to sympathize with and Jane's connections with her audience is felt throughout the entire book and begins on the first page. This to me is the best thing about the book because we know exactly how Jane thinks, and feels and we come to love and adore her for her plainness, intelligence, and spirit. Of course it also helps that our hero Mr. Rochester is so attractive with his brooding, temperamental personality but he is one of my favorite male characters in all of literature because he is so developed I can picture him perfectly in my mind. Every young woman dreams of meeting their Mr. Rochester because he loves Jane with a passion that is hard to believe could exist. So I highly recommend reading this novel because I think it deserves all of the attention it gets. Charlotte Bronte is a master storyteller and uses such elements of horror to create a timeless gothic romance novel."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Though it took me a while to find the time to read this lengthy tome, I am so glad I did, because I absolutely adore this novel. I loved the story, the characters, the blend of romance, mystery, and gothic elements--in short, I loved everything about it!The story is a fictional memoir, which narrates the life of Jane Eyre from the age of 10 to about age 19. We follow Jane from her miserable childhood living with an aunt and three cousins to her sojourn in a charitable boarding school for girls, and then to her station as a governess (at age 18) in the country estate of Mr. Rochester. I will not spoil any of the plot twists (if you don't already know them), for there are several and they make the story truly compelling. Jane herself is an immensely likeable protagonist, right from the start. Even at the tender age of 10, she is full of spirited passion, which makes her real and believable. She grows up before her reader's very eyes, and for me, it was a pleasure to watch her development as a person and character.It has been a long while since a \\"classic\\" work has so absorbed my attentions and thoughts. Once I found the time to read it, I raced to reach the book's conclusion, and then I was sad when I finished the final page--which to me is always the mark of a truly great book! I wholeheartedly recommend \\"Jane Eyre\\" to any lover of literature, and to any and all romantic souls...it (and Jane) will not disappoint!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Hands down one of the best pieces of literature I've ever read, I mean this book is somewhere in my Top 3 and I've read a lot of books. At first glance, some people might think this is a cheesy love story, but it's not. It is very much a love story but actually a REALLY GOOD one!! I love the main character Jane Eyre and how she's able to be humble and respectful, at the same time growing in the story and speaking her mind when she needs to, standing up for herself. The story flows soooo well and takes you on a journey that is brave, devastating and beautiful all at the same time.Charlotte Bronte, correct me if I'm wrong, hasn't written too many novels, but she didn't even need to. This book stands on its own and I can call her one of my favorite writers of all time, solely based off this one book. Just incredible stuff all around, incredible writing, story, description, imagery - this book has everything you want from a piece of literature. Please get it and you'll be thrilled you did! I can guarantee this book will become one of your favorites of all time :)"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"One of the great gothic romance classics of all time. This novel was written and published in the 1840's, well before women were conceived to be \\"gifted\\" enough to command an audience. In fact, all the Bronte sisters published under male pseundoyms (Currier Bell, Acton Bell, etc.) in order to be considered serious writers.This novel is a story about enduring character and its ability to strive for the unattainable and inconceivable. A poor orphan raised by an aunt and uncle, Jane is schooled in a loveless environment of neglect. She graduates from this dreary environment and is hired by Rochester to tutor his ward, Adele.The employer-employee relationship between Rochester and Jane grows into a solid friendship. From there, it graduates to love. Unfortunately, there is a shadow over this relationship that precludes a happy ending and Rochester's past comes to haunt him. Fortunately, Jane's strength and enduring character help Rochester surmount his painful past. Her love nurtures Rochester in his darkest hours.This book has continued to be one of my favorites over the years. The Kindle version is free, so if anyone is looking for an excellent book to add to their Kindle collection, I heartily recommend this."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"The main theme of Jane Eyre is that happiness and contentment can be found during our lives on earth. This is shown in the fact that Jane led a very discontented and sad childhood, but she found happiness in her relationship with Mr. Rochester. This theme also came out very strongly through Jane's cousin John. He was so dedicated to serving God and being a missionary that he asked Jane to marry him because he thought she was a hard worker. He didn't love her, but he believed that serving God came before his own happiness. The book makes it seem as though this is wrong, because in the end John goes to India by himself and does not enjoy the rest of his life. It is presented as though Jane did the fulfilling and satisfying thing by marrying Mr. Rochester, and John did the good but unhappy thing by becoming a missionary in India. Obviously, it is not good to marry someone that you don't love, but Charlotte Bronte seems to take this to the extreme by saying that unless you get married to the person you love, you will not lead a satisfied life. In truth, if you lead a life dedicated to serving and praising God, you will have a satisfied life. It is not just people and circumstances that can make us happy, but a close relationship with God. Nevertheless, I thought that Jane Eyre was a very good book. There was always a little hint of mystery to keep the reader interested, and the book presented some interesting ideas to think about. Jane Eyre did a good job of presenting Charlotte Bronte's ideas, and it is a very well-written, descriptive book."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Jane Eyre is the rarest kind of novel - one that conveys boundless emotion without stumbling too far into darkness and misery.Plain and poor, Jane works as a governess in the house of Mr Rochester, a brooding and temperamental man with a dark secret, and eventually falls in love with her wealthy employer. She looks to the future and begins to overcome the unhappiness that has plagued her all her life, but Rochester's shady past comes back and brings everything down again.But unlike in the author's sister Emily's Wuthering Heights, this sadness neither dominates nor concludes the book when all is resolved in a happy, if somewhat bittersweet, ending.The real brilliance of Jane Eyre lies in the characters - we can all see ourselves, or our aspirations, reflected in Jane, who overcomes her circumstances to find happiness."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Jane Eyre is the rarest kind of novel - one that conveys boundless emotion without stumbling too far into darkness and misery.Plain and poor, Jane works as a governess in the house of Mr Rochester, a brooding and temperamental man with a dark secret, and eventually falls in love with her wealthy employer.

I'm sure if you read Jane Eyre, you will love it as much as I did."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I think Jane Eyre is a book full of love and point. The book starts off with Jane, a lonely ten year old abandoned by her aunt in a prison-like boarding school. It continues as Jane finds an occupation as a governess fro a little French girl. But, beware as Jane is falling madly in love with Mr. Rochester (her master as she calls him-is it just me or is I Dream of Jeanie popoing into my head), who has a secret terrible enough to destroy Jane and himself too. I recommemd this book for the older more mature reader (13 and up). Even though nine year olds can read this book, to fully understand the passion and adult situations you must be a little more mature. To really fully understand Jane Eyre you must read past the words and into the heart of little troubled Jane."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"The story of Jane Eyre told by any other author would be a tale told to elicit tears, or sometimes a smile. As it is the book is so sincere and frank it seems to weep in your hands, and requires no acknowledgment from you. Indeed, Jane Eyre is very likely above such avowal even were you to tender it. To me this otherwise magnificent piece served as a reminder of my dispassion, indolence, insincerity, and how hot it will be when I'm eternally burning in hell."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I'm reading this novel for my AP English class, and it's okay so far (I'm about 50 pages short of finishing the book). Bronte definitely has a way with words, and Jane's story, though in some parts a bit unrealistic, certainly makes for a good read. However, the dialogue is a little confusing sometimes because the author uses the wrong pronouns (like: &quot;Would she like a morsel of bread?&quot; when it ought to be &quot;Would YOU like a morsel of bread?&quot;)This happens pretty often near the end, and it's terribly annoying. These flaws not withstanding, however, &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; will appeal to anyone who enjoys the romance and soap-opera plots of Victorian literature paired with some gothic characteristics (crazy Bertha screaming and doing mischief in her locked cell)."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"As many people may know, \\"Jane Eyre\\" is the story of an orphaned girl who has an evil aunt that locks her away in an eerie red room where her uncle died in. Being the protagonist of the novel, Jane breaks away from her aunt's oppression and stands up for herself. As Jane lives life away from her aunt, she realizes that the outside world is just as strenuous. Against many odds, Jane pushes forward with her life. She finds a job as a governess and falls in love with her employer and he loves her back, but of course with Jane's luck, more obstacles are hurdled at her.Being set during the Victorian period, social status already plays a big obstacle in Jane's life. When obstacles, though some highly unlikely, beyond social class prevent her from marrying the love her life, Jane must establish her own code of ethics. What is wrong and what is right? What can she do and what can she not do?The novel may seem to focus much on the aspect of Jane's love life, but there's much more to it than that. Throughout Jane's love story, there's always eerie things going on, for example the shrieking yell coming from a room no one is allowed in and that's just the beginning. \\"Jane Eyre\\" is a book that has many different aspects and a hint of gothic fiction. There's love, mystery, strength, courage, and faith. It's the journey of a lost female on the road of identifying herself. This is a classic that should not be passed up especially if you're a person who believes that love prevails against all odds. This classic is a refreshing book to read; it's not every day that you find such a strong female character in literature.Even though the only complain I have to offer is the lengthiness and the endless dialogue, this novel is worth it all. Read along with Jane's story as she discovers what she has to offer the world and herself. The story will have you at the edge of your seat wondering what is going to happen next. The main question, however, will Jane get her happy ending?"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"This book is really good. It is one of my favorites.

It's a different experience reading as an adult! I wish I could say I loved it but I just can't. Charlotte Bronte used so many words and descriptors when much less would have done just fine. (Have a dictionary handy. Many of the words used in Jane Eyre are archaic and need definition. Otherwise much of what Bronte is trying to convey is lost. This is not a criticism - just part of reading Jane Eyre.)I have 2 main difficulties with Jane Eyre. First, it was difficult for me to see either Mr. Rochester or St. John Rivers as desirable. Both were manipulative control freaks. Secondly, there are some \\"coincidences\\" (specifically with regard to the Rivers family) that seem so entirely unlikely that it's distracting. (As a side note, I question whether Jane's time with the Rivers was necessary to advance the story. That section of the book seemed especially plodding.)Last but not least, Jane Eyre is deeply religious. This is not a bad thing, but much of the book is spent sermonizing. This, too, adds to its length.I came away from Jane Eyre disappointed but also appreciative of Jane's amazing (if flawed) journey."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I'm going to rate the quality of the Kindle Edition since this seems to be the only place to do so. I won't go into the story since there's a perfectly good sysnopsis on the description page and several well written reivews on the work itself. The kindle edition was good to say the least. I did find a few spelling errors that were annoying, but none more so than the heroine, Jane, repeatedly being referred to as 'Janet' throughout the entire novel; I find this to be unacceptable. I do not know if this occurs in the print-versions as this was my first encounter with the story. Had there been less (or no) spelling errors as well as the correct name reference to the main character, I would have given it 5 stars on content alone---although it still creeps me out that 19 year olds and 40 year olds so frequently ended up marrying in that day and age, but I just had to put it out of my mind when reading.

That it is a semi-autobiographical novel written by a staunchly, independent female author who herself was struggling to survive by her own wits and means and stand on her own two feet makes the story all the more poignant and compelling. While it is a prime example of Gothic romance peppered with the typical fixtures of a Gothic novel - the spectral Thornfield manor that seems to attain a life of its own; the allusions to mythological characters such as ghosts and vampires; the uncanny timing of such weather phenomenon as lightning or a chilling, drenching downpour to accompany major events in the novel - it also breaks new ground in that it avoids some of the typical conventions of Victorian literature. And, finally, it is a piece of masterful story-telling built around larger than life characters that for over 150 years has enchanted readers of all ages and thrilled watchers of numerous television and movie adaptations.For those few of you that have yet to read this wonderful novel, the story can be summarized quickly enough. A dying father extracts a death bed promise from his sister to raise his infant daughter, Jane Eyre. The sister, a spiteful and mean spirited woman grows to hate the obligation that Jane represents and soon sends her away to a boarding school. (Did anyone else have flashbacks to Charles Dickens' Nicholas Nickleby when they were reading this portion of the novel?) In spite of the harsh mental and physical cruelty she endures at the hands of the school's administrator and its teachers, Jane survives to become a teacher at the school. Ultimately she leaves to seek her own way in the world and secures a position as governess in the household of Edward Fairfax Rochester.At this point, most readers will correctly guess that Jane and Mr Rochester fall in love with each other but to tell more of the story would be to spoil the effect of this magnificent novel for first time readers.Suffice it to say that Charlotte Bront has woven an enthralling story into the exploration of a multiplicity of themes that will occupy students of the English language novel for decades to come - the interplay of self-respect, morality, conventional mores and religion; the effects of social standing and class discrimination; gender relations in a patriarchal staunchly male-dominated society; legal issues of the day that related to marriage, inheritance and ownership; contrasting extremes of religious zealotry as displayed by Brocklehurst's hypocritical Puritanism reflected against St John Rivers' obsessive but well-intentioned determination to spread Calvinist dogma as a missionary abroad.While many of these issues have clearly been relegated to the history of the 19th century, it's also a fact that much of the controversy that Bront has so eloquently built into her characters' lives persist as issues into our own 21st century. Little wonder that \\"Jane Eyre\\" has such enduring power in the world of English literature!Highly recommended.Paul Weiss"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"This is without a doubt, the most romantic book I have ever read!

My point of view changed as I realized that all of the families mentioned in the book are all dysfunctional, all of them had some sort of problem. I made this my thesis. In order to get the most out of this book, you must appreciate the detail of each thought that Charlotte Bronte put into text.

She's not georgous, not excellent at any one thing, yet she gets her man. i found the characterization to be masterful, by the middle of the book you could tell what jane would do, yet the book wasn't as predictable as some other classic writers. (ahhem Charles ahhemmm Dickens ahheeemmm Ernest aaahheem Hemingway aaahhheeemmm)sorry, i just had to clear my throught there. this is definately a book for girls. i'm not sexist, but i find that if i can relate to a character in the book than i will find it entertaining. i would not reccomend this for any guys. but definately the best book i have ever read."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I read this book when a friend challenged me to deliberately read more books by women authors. This was one of the books I read, and I'm glad I did!I read that the Bronte's grew up writing stories for entertainment -- it seems to show. This story was moving and obviously written by someone with much experience. By the time I was half-way through the book, I was wrapped up in the story, and felt a commitment to the characters."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"This is my favorite book so far. Charlotte Bront was a splendid artist, she gave so much power to the story of the poor orphaned girl who grows to be a sensible, sensitive, self-concious, though passionate, young woman. A must-read!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"The way you become a friend of Jane's, follow her experiences, and see things from her point of view would make me give it five stars. Charlotte Bronte is an excellent author, really gifted. Why, then, did I only give it four stars? This is because I grew sick and tired of the long, dull details towards the end of the book. I just wanted Jane to go away. I wanted it resolved, but quickly. I was becoming quickly agitated and annoyed. But still, as angered as I was towards the ending (by the way, I didn't care for the deal with the Rivers family at all), the beginning was so majestic I just couldn't insult it too much. I could feel Jane's pain so much. I even began saying, when I was notifying everyone I was going to go read it, that I was 'going to visit Jane.'"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I had to read this book for a school assignment, and I actually ended up liking it. I couldn't put the book down when I first thought that the two might fall in love. I wanted so badly for him to ask her to marry him. I was heartbroken when I found out the truth about Mr. Rochester. Throughout the rest of the book, I kept hoping that somehow they would get back together. I almost cried at the end when Jane talks about Mr. Rochester seeing his first born. I loved this book."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Jane Eyre is the best book I have ever read. It is a story woven in perfect harmony holding a daring and almost forbidden romance.

Jane Eyre is in us all and so is the dream of a true and boudless love."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"When I first picked up the book for a school assignment, I felt overwhelmed b/c of the length and extensive vocabulary...but then I really got into it! Every time I thought that things were calming down, there was another new and surprisingly unexpected twist!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I read Jane Eyre once in high school, once in college and just now, five years later. It is a wonderful example of a book that can be read over and over again and with each reading comes a new experience. Charlotte Bronte tells a formidible tale of one woman's intellect and passions which break across &quot;custom&quot; and &quot;caste,&quot; to use Bronte's own words. Bronte wonderfully describes the inner voice of Jane which Jane instinctually values from a young age. It leads her to take extraordinary emotional risks. She does not allow herself to be shamed into behavior, nor does she shy away from her own desires and ideas. This is a book for ANY person, male or female of any color who likes a great mystery and a profound tale of human strength and experience"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"This book has a very long, slow beginging but once you get into it, it gets interesting. In my opinion, you should just rent the movie. It goes a lot faster and you can understand it."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I had to read 'Jane Eyre' for a book report for school I thought its too long but I couldn't put it down!I finished it in one night!

Charlotte Bronte's writing style is so wonderful, different and refreshing. Her descriptions are so vivid, I can see why she caused such controversy in her day! This novel is honest, compelling and Jane is way ahead of her time, as Charlotte must have been. This has sparked me to dive headfirst into more classics and see what truly makes them classic. I would really recommend this for summer vacation at the beach, or curled up in a storm."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I had to read this for a class and expected to have to force myself through it. Surprise! It was really enjoyable and I breezed through the finish weeks before my classmates. I don't know much about contemporary romance novels but having read a couple Austen novels for previous classes, I can say I prefer Bronte and look forward to trying some of the other novels from the Bronte sisters. I like the 'ugly ducklings in love' storyline between Jane and Rochester and it kept me intrigued but I was even more pleased with Bronte's accessible prose. Recommended."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"There is a reason this book has remained popular over the last 160 years. It is a dynamic novel written by Bronte who grew up in the isolated Moors of England in the Victorian Era which is used for the backdrop of this seemingly, at first, romantic story. However, as the events unfold, the novel reveals itself to be a gothic story filled with terror, intrigue, and true love. I recommend this book to everyone from age 7 to 70. A must read."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"What can I say about this beautiful classic that hasn't already been said?My only word of caution: DO NOT READ THE INTRODUCTION if you've never read this book before. Ms. Jong feels the need to fill you in (spoil is more I like it) on several key details/events that any hungry reader would rather devour on their own. Skip her."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Jane Eyre is my favorite book. I love it.I read it first when I was 10, but it did not appeal to me at all, so I stopped reading it. I tried a year later. It immediately became my favorite book. I have read many other good books too, like Rebecca, but Jane Eyre is #1! I have recommended it to all my friends who love reading. This book is very great for someone my age (12) who is not bored with descriptive writing. (I've read worse.)You should definitely try this book!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Charlotte Bronte's Gothic romance novel which was written over 170 years ago, in 1847, is deservingly a classic of English literature. \\"Jane Eyre\\" has been one of my most beloved books since I was an 11-years-old girl and the friend of mine gave it to me with the words, \\"This book is amazing\\" and so it was. I have read it dozens of times and I am still not tired of it. Its language is beautiful - refined, fragrant, and surprisingly fresh. The dialogs and descriptions are memorable and visual. Above all, the novel introduces us to two main characters, a young orphan- pale, thin, \\"almost un-earthy\\" but determined, strong-willed, kind and reasonable Jane and Mr. Edward Rochester - sardonic, powerful, passionate, and tormented master of Thornfield. The story of their impossible love has attracted millions of readers not only in the English speaking countries but all over the world. \\"Jane Eyre\\" has been adapted to TV and big screen 18 times. The actors as famous and marvelous as Joan Fontaine and Orson Welles, William Hurt and Charlotte Gainsbourg, George C. Scott and Susannah York, Ciar&aacute;n Hinds and Samantha Morton, Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke, have played the couple that had to overcome hundreds of obstacles made by society, laws, religion, by the differences in age, backgrounds, experiences, and by the fateful mistakes that would hunt one for many years."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"The illustrations are appealing and really portray the emotion of the story.My mom sent me this book as a present, and I immediately loved it; but that is perhaps because I have slightly gothic/victorian tastes and because the drawings remind me of myself. Not to mention, the story of Jane Eyre, which is classic and easy to read. I really enjoy the drawings by Dame Darcy. I also like the cover's design; it is actually the photograph of an antique book."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"These little books are awesome. I love the classics, but collect these for the decorative aspect as well. They come in nice colors with interesting petite patterns. They are great to stack flat on a shelf with a small bud vase (or the like) on top."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Whenever anyone asks me what my all-time favorite book is, this is the one I tell them. And it's true. I started reading it once when I was younger, but I wasn't quite ready for it yet and I couldn't get past the first chapter. When I picked it up again a couple of years later, I fell for it. I remember hating Mrs. Reed and her children - especially John - with such a passion, I wished I could reach through the book and wring their necks until they gained some sense. Mr. Brocklehurst, too. And being terrified when she was stuck in the red room. I've reread it at least five times since then, and it always seems that I come across a scene or a character that I've forgotten about in the year or two since I read it last. In college, I wrote a paper on it and came across interpretations that I'd never even began to consider, prompting careful rereading of most of the chapters once again. I think it was the first real \\"literary\\" book I read as a kid, and possibly the first book that made me feel so strongly for the characters (whether it was hate or love) - that just may be why nothing has been able to replace it as my favorite."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"one of my favorite books from the long list of the ol' required high school reading. I fell in love with Jane immediately, though it took a while for me to appreciate the novel on a whole. I came back to the novel again in more recent years, and I have enjoyed it more and more with each read. Having heard it as a book on tape while on bedrest brought the story to life even more and made the mysterious Bertha and the dark and moody Mr. Rochester that much more intense. This is so much more than a romantic tale between an unfortunate governess and her brooding employer; it is truly the story of a young woman coming into her own."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"How can I put into words how much I love this book? I read it for the first time when I was 12, and at 26, it still has the power to stir me as it once did. It has everything one could possibly want in a book. Romance, lust, horrid relatives, a brooding hero, near-death experiences, and to top it off, a mad woman in the attic. I have read literally hundreds and hundreds of books, some more than once, and still Jane Eyre remains my favorite. It is , in my opinion, a must-read in everyone's lifetime. The best of the Bronte sisters work, let alone Charlotte's, you cannot possibly be disappionted at reading this book."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Jane Eyre is one of the few books I can say I absolutely adore.Charlotte Bronte is the one author I have found that can REALLY put passion into a novel.She writes like she has lived it even though she led a secluded life.Jane Eyre is so full of passion &amp; you have to love it. The way the characters speak to one another is unbelievable due to this passion. The romance is beautiful because of the way Jane &amp; Rochester speak to one another &amp; how full of emotions &amp; love for each other , not because of sex, like modern day romance novels . Bronte was a genius &amp; this is one of those books that I can call a favorite &amp; one I'll read over &amp; over again. it is one of the most beautiful &amp; passionate &amp; romantic novels ever written that has class &amp; you're bound to love it.You just gotta read it !!!!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Let's get one thing straight..I LOATHE romance novels. My Grandmother reads hundreds of those Fabio-plastered, heaving cleavage covered paperbacks...but NOT ME. Don't get me wrong, I loved Gone with the Wind...but as I explored a few more of the more classic romances ie..Emma, Wuthering Heights, or Sense and Sensibility..I found the movies much more appealing. Then along comes Jane Eyre. She is not buxom and airheaded and dashingly beautiful. She is plain, modest, and smart...That's right! a more modern woman!! Jane does not faint at the sight of a handsome man, nor does she swoon over expensive clothes....Let me tell you a little more about Jane Eyre..... As a child, Jane was left an orphan with her brutal aunt and cousins. Treated unfairly and taunted buy the other children she soon developed a quick-witted tongue. After receiving an honest verbal lashing from Jane, her aunt packed her few belongings and pretty much &quot;shipped&quot; the young girl off to a dreadful and gloomy school called &quot;Lowood&quot;. At Lowood, Jane quickly learned to bite her tongue through strict discipline from the Headmaster.(Lowood often reminds me of the discplinary school David Copperfield received some beatings in.) Here at school Jane is educated and cared for but never loved. She stays on at Lowood to become a teacher herself, but soon finds a position in a far away town to be a private counsel and teacher to a young girl Adele. Adele is the young French, beautiful and very spoiled ward to a great man known as Mr. Rochester. Jane soon learns that Mr. Rochester is very mysterious and aloof ..he often leaves her and Adele alone for months at a time on business travel. When he is at home Jane finds herself drawn to him, his strange conversation style and his knowledge of good books. He is by no means a HANDSOME man but attracts a great deal of attention because of his financial means. I Loved this book for many reasons. I loved the contrast between Jane and Adele...Adele is spoiled, loved and beautiful....Jane the opposite. And the MYSTERIES! Where does Mr. Rochester go? WHO is Adele? Why are there screams late in the darkness of the manor? Who could it be? And the best mystery of all? What will become of Mr. Rochester and Jane? Romance? Jane never OUTWARDLY desires to be a distinguished lady like the beautiful women Mr. Rochester frequently entertaines. But as a reader you feel she deserves such a posion. You will find yourself page tuning faster and faster as you secretly wish for modest Jane Eyre to succeed and and achieve status and the love she deserves."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I recently saw the Broadway musical of Jane Eyre and was inspired to read the book. It is one of the best books I have ever read. Jane seems so real as a character that I wish I could meet her. What an amazing heroine! The reader roots for her success all through the book. Her romance with Mr. Rochester is one of the best in all of literature. In high school the classics I had to read were usually so dull (including Wuthering Heights by Emily Bronte) that I tend to stear clear of classics now, even though I am a voracious reader, but Jane Eyre is so fast paced that it hardly seems like a classic. I couldn't put it down! Don't read this story because its touted as being about female empowermant and don't avoid it for the same reason. Wether you are male or female, read this book, because it is a great story with great characters you will remember for a lifetime!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Contrary to the MGM film of the 40's, this book does not begin with, \\"My name is Jane Eyre...\\" Instead, we get an opening chapter about a little girl who is cruelly treated by an abominable family, and her attempts to stay afloat. The Jane Eyre of the novel is a spirited young woman, who yearns to be able to experience life despite the limitations society has placed upon women. This book is a wonderful read. Bronte's 19th century England is not the neo-classical world of manners and balls that permeate Jane Austin's universe; rather, the world of Jane Eyre one of ragged romanticism that plays out against the harsh elements, and the world seems as primitive indoors as it does outside. Bronte writes in a very lucid, revelatory style, and the first person narrative does a lot to help draw you into this story. Even if you know the secret in the attic, there is so much more about this novel that you may not know about.The biggest surprise about this novel once I read it was that Jane's story does not end with the revelation of Rochester's dark gothic secret (even though this was written several years after Austen's Northanger Abbey, it's fun to read the two books in conjunction). I am surprised that most film and stage versions of this novel rarely include the important last third of the book. But I'll let you discover the developments to Jane's character on your own. The ending is a tear-jerker (but in a great way). This is definitely the book to read on the front porch of a summer cottage, or in front of a fire on a winter night. Mystery, romance, intrigue, religion, and feminism... it's all in here. And it's worth the read."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"This was the best book I have ever read and I cried when it was over. I wish Charlotte Bronte had written more books. This is my new favorite book, and my standard for all books I've ever read and ever will read. I sincerely reccommend it to everyone who loves suspensful love stories."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I am 14 years old, and I really enjoyed reading this book. I read it first four years ago and was particularly impressed with the quality of the writing and the ideas displayed. Charlotte Bronte very cleverly used her book as an outlet for her own feelings and experiences as a woman which, in her day, were not considered or acknowledged. Unfortunately, while reading some of the other reviews on this page and elsewhere, I have noticed that some people are still discriminatory and insensitive towards female writers and believe that their views can simply be dismissed as soppy and foolish. I do not think that this is right. The fact that a person can write about his or her life using such great detail and keeping such an objective view of it as Charlotte Bronte did should not be dismissed as monotonous or boring, but rather should be acknowledged as a talent and as a result of hard work. It also shows that it cannot be easy to analyse your own life in such a way that you can understand and write about every detail of it. Charlotte Bronte's writing of Jane Eyre reflects her own character; that she wanted, like Jane, to be independent and go out into the world, and I think that it is this element of independence in many women that defies the assumed 'authority' and 'superiority' of the opposite gender and therefore they resent feminists speaking out. All in all, I think that Jane Eyre is an excellent novel and that it should not be labelled as some foolish, whimsical piece of writing that is only respected because it was written more than a century ago. The quality and status of a book and its author should not be undermined by the period of time in which it was written."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"an amazing and enthraling tale about love. it tells us to never give up in hope. many twists and turns,and leads to strange places. charlotte bronte has captured love and mystery in one fantastic tale."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"haha im into horror books.. but we had to do an Historical Fiction book report recently and i remember my mom buying me this book saying i should read it in high school, im in 7th grade, I have to say this is probably the best book i have ever read, although after she left mr.Rochester i wanted to stop because i thought it would just be depressing. but im glad i went on. Bronte is an amazing writer, I fell in love with mr.Rochester and it broke my heart knowing that he was blind. haha well i can't wait to find her other books and readd them."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"It's always good to take time to reread those required books from school once you've obtained some years and maturity. This is a lovely and somewhat autobiographical tale of Jane Eyre, orphaned and raised by self-centered and uncaring relatives until they send her off to school. Eventually she is hired as a governess to a young girl and meets the girl's guardian Mr. Rochester, and of course they fall in love and plan to marry. But, there is a mystery about the house that once it is discovered destroys the wedding plans.A lovely tale, and Bronte has such a wonderful prose that makes you want to slow down and savor it and the story like a fine red wine or chocolate. The version I read isSelected Works of the Bronte Sisters (Wordsworth Special Editions) (Wordsworth Special Editions), so I did not have the distraction of the foot notes to refer to, and I don't feel that I missed much without them. Highly highly recommended, one that should be taken off the shelf and reread every couple of years or so."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"We were forced to read Jane Eyre in high school.

The feistiness and lovableness of Jane has never faded for me, even after several readings. My favorite passages from the text are those when Jane leaves Rochester and ends up at Marsh End; and when she is &quot;called&quot; by Rochester from afar and flees to return to him.

I certainly thought that it was very good. The main character is not like any other heroine which I can think of. She was not beautiful like most, nor extremely cunning. Somehow Bronte manages to develop her personality perfectly, and gets you to like this Jane Eyre, though she is probably the only one in the story who you will like. Bronte makes all of the other characters extremely one sided in their personalities, all dominated by a fatal flaw of some type (the domineering spirit of Mr. Rochester, the extreme sacrafice of emotion by Saint John, the extreme simplicity of Mrs. Fairfax, etc.) This was both good (in that it helps one to see that nearly any character trait can be taken too far and become bad) and bad (the characters were rather stiff somehow).The only other complaint that I have is that it was a bit long and drawn out. Somehow it should have been about 50 pages shorter, though I am not quite sure where the 50 pages should be cut from. It seemed almost like too little butter scraped over too much bread."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I read this book in high school and liked it a lot..

Her mixed life mingles between feeling sorry for her orphaned self and trying to be a romantic wife to Mr. Rochester. The novel, Jane Eyre, is an excellent work of Charlotte Bront not only because of the work itself, but because it is a relation to herself as an autobiography. Charlotte Bront was not that much different than the main character, Jane Eyre, in that they both lived without parents and they both know what loss can be like. The book flows eloquently from start to finish and contains many life morals concerning pride, love, and what it takes to live in this world. Jane Eyre shows how one can mature in to the person that they will be for the rest of their life. Because of this book, my life has been enlightened with good morals and I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"This book is about Jane who is an orphan. When she grew up she found a job as a governess at Thornfield and fall in love with Mr. Rochester, who kept a terrible secret.Maybe it's because I'm only 10 years old,but I found this book rather [odd] and not very romantic at all"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"The book Jane Eyre, by Charlotte Bronte is about a girl who is about ten years old, and she lives with her aunt, cousins because her parents had died when she was young. Her cousin John, who is the master of the house, always harasses her. Jane leaves to go to school, and then she put an ad in the newspaper. A lady named Mrs. Fairfax comes to take her to where she works so Jane can live with them. Jane is a governess who teaches a little girl named Adele. When the master of the house, Mr. Rochester, comes and Jane starts to like him. Jane is eighteen when she went to live at the house in Thornfield.After Jane has been at the Thornfield house for so long she gets a letter saying that her aunt is dying. So Jane goes to her aunts house before her aunt goes and stays for a little bit until she has to get back to work at Thornfield. After that she leaves Thornfield and found a nun who knew her parents. Jane heads back to Thornfield and falls in love and almost marries. But then she finds her self-alone and penniless, then Jane finds that she is rich. The book is good and exciting until the end because of what happens to Jane in the novel.The book has a lot of mystery like when Jane had to put out a fire in Mr. Rochester's bedroom, and romance. In the book in the beginning there is discrimination against woman's rights when master John hurts Jane with his bare hands, this book does have woman's rights in the beginning and in the middle of the book. This book is interesting because it was very expressive of how a teenage life is through this book. The reason why it is so expressive is that the book drags out a teenager life of how problems come and go around. When they explain what is going on in the story with Jane the author explains the weigh she takes the problem in the novel.This book would be really good for people who like love stories and mysteries all in one. This book is a good for maybe teens to high school or even the beginning college students that what a adventure or two with the love and passion in the novel."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok and it was free so not too bad"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Now this was a real surprise - a &#34;classic&#34; that was worth reading.

Never had to at school, like so many people I know, so I had a totally open mind. I love Wuthering Heights, by sister Emily, and I was sort of expecting something of the same calibre. Maybe it is because Jane Eyre is more from the romance genre... I am not so sure. I certainly don't think that Charlotte's writing is anything near her sister's. I also find that there are two stories in Jane Eyre - the main one with Mr Rochester, and the second one with St Johns, and I found them slightly disjointed.

Two years later, we read it again in English, and I liked it even more.This book portrays it's main character as a strong, outspoken, smart and independent woman, written in a time when it was unconventional to do so. While the book is over 100 years old, it is not outdated because it's message is something that people can relate to today.Because it is wordy and not exactly fast, easy reading, some people disregard the book as being boring. However, if you give it a chance, you will probably find that it is suspenseful and exciting.There are many surprises. Just when you think that something is going to happen, some strange twist of fate changes the course of the story. It's also mysteroius and even funny.Ultimately the book has a positive message. Jane is an incredibly strong character who shows what it means to be true to yourself.Many people have to read this book, whether they want to or not. Other people choose to read it.

Bronte captures the horrors of Jane's family (I use the term loosely) and the physical, as well as emotional, hardships she had to endure throughout the whole of her childhood and ultimatly her life until the end of the novel. The book is much more readable than the indominably beautiful heroine who only briefly suffers and finds superficial happiness in the one she loves. Jane's love for Mr. Rochester goes deeper than the surface for she does not even glance at the startling deformities of his body, but tries to heal the deformities of his soul when she returns to him.

With that in mind, I thought it would be fun to REread Jane Eyre. About half way through the book, I realized that I had never read it before: this was my first read! Interestingly, the woman who led the discussion on Wide Sargasso Sea had the identical experience. So did another. We decided that it was more than the movie in which the still only babyfat Orson Welles wished himself to be the romantic hero: Jane Eyre was so much a part of Western Culture that without actually having read the book, we knew it. Charlotte Bronte, writing at the very beginning of the 19th century, was a much better writer than many who followed her. George Sand's writing is more pretentious and more closely tied to the 18th century. While &quot;Little Women&quot; is a wonderful book to revisit, Louisa May Alcott's potboilers are tiresome. I can not get into Dickens or James Fenimore Cooper. Until you come upon writers who bridge the gap between the 19th and 20th centuries -- Edith Wharton springs to mind -- no one is quite as readable as Charlotte, unless it is one of her sisters.That is not to say that the plot holds up. It is riddled with co-incidence that nearly undermines Bronte's intentions. However, her characters live and have dimension, even if their circumstances do not. So often, the infamous &quot;canon&quot; is criticized as being full of dead white European males. Charlotte is a woman whose work has shaped our thoughts and influenced us for nearly 200 years. I would say that Charlotte Bronte is part of the Western canon."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I LOVE this edition!

Jane flees into the arms of long-lost family members, and is offered a new life -- but her love for Rochester is not so easily forgotten...\\"Jane Eyre\\" is one of those books that transcends the labels of genre. Charlotte Bronte spun a haunting gothic romance around her semi-autobiographical heroine and Byronic anti-hero, filling it with brilliant writing and solid plot. It has everything all the other gothic romances of the time had... but Bronte gave it depth and intensity without resorting to melodrama.Bronte wrote in the usual stately prose of the time, but it has a sensual, lush quality, even in the dank early chapters at Lowood. At Thornfield, the book acquires an overhanging atmosphere of foreboding, until the clouds clear near the end.

She even manages to include some funny stuff, such as Rochester disguising himself as an old gypsy woman.The story does slow down after the abortive wedding, when Jane flees Thornfield and briefly considers marrying a repressed clergyman who wants to go die preaching in India. It's rather boring to hear the self-consciously saintly St. John prattling about himself, instead of Rochester's barbed wit. But when Jane departs again, the plot speeds up into a nice, mellow little finale.Bronte did a brilliant job of bringing her heroine to life -- as a defiant little girl who is condemned for being \\"passionate,\\" as an independent young lady, and as a woman torn between love and principle. Jane's strong personality and wits overwhelm the basic fact that she's not unusually pretty.

Minimal (if any) errors and well set up. Next chapter always starts at the top of a page which makes it always a good place to stop.Kindle vs. Hardcopy -- one nice thing is that there are a lot of words considered either purely poetical or old or middle English, so no longer or not commonly used and if you move your cursor to the word on the kindle, it will automatically define it. Always useful, but especially where there are many such words.Well worth the buck!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"\\"Jane Eyre\\" by Charlotte Bront is an 1847 novel published as \\"Jane Eyre. An Autobiography\\" under the nom de plume of \\"Currer Bell\\". The novel is told in first person narrative and goes through five distinct stages in Jane's life. In spite of many dark elements the novel has strong elements of right vs. wrong as well as morality.The orphan Jane Eyre, brought up by an duty bound aunt by marriage is having a miserable childhood. The family is spoiled and socially fixated, considering the orphan in their mists beneath them and bans Jane from her cousins. After an incident with her cousin John, Jane is sent to a school called Lowood where the moral pillar of her time finds herself subject to the hypocritical minister who runs the place. Jane endures the school even though she has been branded a liar and subject to a starvation diet as well as other miseries - but she remains faithful to standards which would break any other mortal.Reaching adulthood, Jane leaves Lowood to become a governess for Mr. Rocchester at his home called Thornhill. Mr. Rochester wins Jane's love and respect even though she knows he is harboring a secret. Rochester asks for Jane's hand in marriage, even though she keeps remind him what a poor, plain girl she is. At the last moment the marriage is thwarted, Jane flees Thorhill all alone and without a penny to her name. However, Jane finds her way back to society and moves up the social ladder only to make her way back to Mr. Rochester to discover his painful secret.I can certainly see why \\"Jane Eyre\\" is considered a classic. Bront's use of strong language , rhetorical brilliance and lovely narrative are certainly impressive. The author also had the guts to tackle many social issues head on, something that we, at this voyeuristic age, seem to take for granted. Even though this book was not meant to be historical, several decades later I found it captivating to read about the day-to-day living of 1800's England.The book described the fascinating social ladder of the 1800's where governesses (nannies/teachers) were far below their employers, yet often better educated. I felt that Jane's assertions to Rochester that she is his equal was something that was simply frowned upon a society which thrives on ambiguities.I found myself increasingly interested in the outcome of the story, the Rochester secrets, Jane's wit and eventual outcome. The personal story of Jane Eyre is very absorbing and well written. Bront's observations are poignant and engaging, her storytelling, when she's not of on a tangent, is admirable.But,oh the tangents... as much as absorbing as the book was, when the characters start going off on departures about religion and morality I almost felt as if I was being scolded. The huge amount of storytelling which is meant to be nothing but a filler got to be annoying after a hundred pages or so. The only conflict in the book is between Jane and Rochester, the rest of the book is filled with Jane being Jane, preaching to the reader about morality, virtues, temptations which might have some charm, but certainly isn't interesting.My favorite book, Don Quixote is known for its unbalanced structure, but the Quixote chapters are completely separate from the stories within a story parts. In \\"Jane Eyre\\" Bront tells the tale in logical progression which is structured around the protagonist. However, the consistency of the narrative is done at the expense of the overall strength of the whole."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"What can I say about this work that has not already been said in the many reviews that came before? It is truly one of the greats of English literature, and re-reading it as an adult is a pleasure that reaps even more rewards than when I read it as a girl.My only warning is for those who are reading it in the Kindle edition. The good points are that it is nicely formatted and almost free of spelling errors. The negatives are that it has no Table of Contents, linked or otherwise; and although it claims to be illustrated, no illustrations were included in the version I read.For pure reading pleasure, this novel has few equals. For formatting, you might be able to find better."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Jane Eyre is a masterpiece.I thoroughly enjoyed it. The protagonist, Jane, is narrating her biography, and the chronicle commences when she was ten years old, growing up with her cruel aunt and equally cruel cousins, who make her childhood miserable. She could hardly wait to get out of their grip to a school for orphanages, run by a saintly woman. There she befriends a girl, Amy, a noble and true friend, dying of consumption. Jane thrives in the school, later becoming a teacher for two years.But the real drama unfolds when she gets a job as a tutor for a young girl, Adel, a protege of Mr. Rochester, a wealthy bachelor. They fall in love and Mr. Rochester proposes marriage. But he forgets to tell Jane a minor point that he was already married to a insane woman, locked up in the same manor! Jane bolts home and a new adventure unfolds, meets her long lost cousins, finds enormous fortune and dodges her cousin's advances to marry and go on to India to preach! She wants none of this austere life. She misses her love and returns to her old digs but to her great dismay, discovers that the old house is burned to the ground and Mr. Rochester who is now blind, has left town. She runs to find him.It is a great story, nicely woven with unforgettable characters. The prose is eloquent and flows like well honed poetry. She was a century or so ahead of her time when it came to Women's rights and their place in the society. It is hard to believe that author of this classic novel was a unmarried young woman, who had a sister, who penned \\"Wuthereing Heights\\", another tour de force. Only annoying aspect of the book was the religious righteousness, however, that was de rigueur during Victorian era.It is a MUST read."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I'll confess I wasn't particularly looking forward to \\"Jane Eyre\\" when I started. I wanted to read it because I should read it, and because it's a travesty I haven't read it - until now. I assumed it would be dry, at times forcefully witty - a hunt for a man and a conquest. That sort of thing.Not a bit of it!Charlotte Bront creates in Jane a character with whom I find much in common: her manner of thought, her silented spirit, her tendency to love fully and passionately - to sketch, to think, to be content within herself.As a child she is abused by her stepmother and detested for her untamed spirit. She's sent away to school where her dear (and first) friend Helen Burns teaches her to stand bravely under reprimand - and to focus her courage.As Jane advances in school she becomes mellowed - but still the passion broods beneath. The story carries into her young adulthood when she becomes a teacher (at the same school where she grew up) and determines to see what there is in life beyond teaching and solitude and walls. So the orphan woman-child advertises for a governess position and is quickly hired at the home of the restless and gruff Edward Rochester - a man who finds Jane's controlled attitude, her level stare, her unfailing honesty and scathing intelligence enchanting. As their love develops, Jane realizes a secret about Edward that cannot be loved away, and she tears herself bodily from him, a terrified, frightened, heartbroken girl-woman once again homeless.I've no wish to spoil it for those who haven't read it, but suffice it to say, this fourth classic in all that I have read in my life surely inspires me to read more of its kind! I had no idea a Victorian woman would create a story with such passion. I feel moved to write, moved to create, and at a level with Bront that far exceeds death or time. She is a writer, a fervent spirit, and I stand here, nearly two centuries after her death, feeling shoulder-to-shoulder with her. She gives that much of herself to the work. I cried both at the last segment where she is a child, and the end of the novel itself (something I can't recall ever doing while reading.)Having read formula fiction all my life, I'm in particular impressed with Bront's power of description.Bront breaks norm often by flipping to the present tense, creating a quickness of spirit that contrasts remarkably with the more doleful passages. I find her writing comfortable - for want of a better word. Reading her tale was a pleasure - at times deep with wisdom, at times amusing with spirit, at times very doleful. She tours the human plane of emotion, twisting the plot quite more feverishly than I'd anticipated. Several times I sat forward in astonishment as the plot twisted and volted.So much symbolism in this novel, and captured so beautifully, like a still life - the virgin moon, the burning, lustful fires that destroy, fade out, then flicker anew atop candles before a fading portrait of love beautified as the novel draws to a close. In particular I'm struck by the irony in the way Jane and Mr. Rochester meet - and the way the story closes.I fell in love with Rochester quickly - I don't know why. He is rude, arrogant, and self-interested. Yet his changeable (nearly childlike) spirit - and his admiration for all that is reprehensible in Jane to everyone else - captured my heart.Bront writes both as a Romantic and a Victorian - challenging the church, female diffidence, and \`the norm' - and presenting her prose as richly as a woman in love and as candidly as a man of her generation before the court. A writer caught between worlds--and isn't that the richest place to be as a writer?5 out of 5 stars for Jane Eyre. I gave to Bront sleepless nights - and that's no embellishment."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Very descriptive, held my attention from first page to the end. I was able to see through Jane Eyre's eyes, her world of living as an orphan in England in the 1800s, the cruel and heartless people in her life, her selfish aunt who didn't keep her promise to her dying brother to rear her as her own. Throughout the novel, Jane was resourceful, nurturous and intelligent. She became a governess for a rich employer who had his insane wife imprisoned. Jane fell in love with him, suffered tragedies of a broken heart, trials of running from her past, a new identity. She discovered loving friends and family, became rich, and marries her former employer. Every time she had a taste of happiness it was taken from her. I cried and got angry."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I always tell people: \\"ask any girl if they liked Jane Eyre. The answer is sure to be a yes.\\" The story has been outlined through many forms of media, including the stage and the silverscreen. But the experience of reading Bronte's exquisitely detailed, and passionate writing is to be found on the pages.The sexual tension between Jane and Mr. Rochester, the pan-ultimate Byronic hero, is exciting, and Jane's growth as a woman is relational to her position with Mr. Rochester.The gem of the story is its subversiveness, however. Bronte was audacious in Jane's defiance of religious and aristocratic authorities, challenging the traditions that defined British society."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I read this book on a sort of whim, because I'd been harboring a copy about a hundred years old (cloth cover, and kind of cool in it's own right), and because I had just read 'The Eyre Affair' by Jasper Fforde. In his story, the plot for Jane Eyre gets 're-written' to have a 'newer and more popular ending'. While Jasper Fforde is as loopy as Douglas Adams, that is another review. He seizes on something great though, which is the last section of the book where Jane has gone off from Rochester, and (under terrible pressure) is next to assenting to go off to India with her cousin to work herself to death and bear his children. In the Fforde story, that is how Jayne Eyre ends, until his heroine Thursday Next comes in and sets things on a different path. But enough of that. It's worth mentioning that I was intrigued by the glimpse I got of the story from a single remove. I am very glad I was compelled to read it. I found Jane Eyre very enjoyable, and as I mentioned very modern in many of it's features, from plot movement,to the confidential nature of the narrator's speech, to a certain darker caste, which, while gothic certainly, is also the color of the paper that nearly every screenplay and t.v. script is written on today. The rush & dash of the romance is first rate, and I am sure it was ground breaking when it was written. I look forward to reading a morsel more from each of the Bell (Eyre) sisters."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I first read Jane Eyre in 8th grade and re-read it this month as I turned 40.

Charlotte Bronte is so convincing in her description of Jane's love for Mr Rochester that if anyone ever asks me again \`what is love?' then I will tell him or her to read Jane Eyre.The plotline is just marvellous but I won't go into that for fear of spoiling it for future readers.Charlotte Bronte knows how to write a hero.

A landmark on the road to my understanding of female authors. Clean type, wide margins easily read, they chose to make the book slightly wider than thicker so it is comfy to hold.Entering the world of the immortal emotion in a setting long past, not being a scholar, does pose problems.Penguin provides valuable auxilliary notes explaining the context quite well.For instance,I had not known that Thackery was struggling with publishing then and that C.B. was taking solace and courage from his battles.Do other publishings of the classics:Norton,Dover, Bantam, etc. relate to the public as well?I whish my fellow customers or Amazon in its info blurb were more sensitive to how the book they review is made,and how the text is supported."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Of all of the books that I have had to read in high school, I have never enjoyed one as much as \\"Jane Eyre.\\" Charlotte Bronte has created a touching, beautiful heroine: one who finds herself and her one true love. As I read, I couldn't help but find myself rooting for Jane and Mr. Rochester...I so wanted them to be together!Although slow to pick up and drawn out in spots, this novel is nonetheless an enjoyable read. The happy ending makes it all worthwhile--and you will find yourself rejoicing along with Jane and Edward when they finally come together, unobstructed by outside circumstances.

It's one of the best books I've ever read. This has much depth and meaning to it, and has many underlying meanings. The book is beautifully and lushly written. The multi-faceted characters give this book much depth. Strong-willed Jane, Enigmatic Rochester, Kind Fairfax, gleeful Adele, Terrifying Bertha Mason, Stoic St. John, among other characters give this book a variety of characters and all are unforgettable characters.

Thank you Mr. Costa (my daughter's English teacher)!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I admit, it took me about 2 weeks to read this book, but it was good. Jane is a very defined character, and although some of what happens is unlikely to the point of being almost unrealistic, it seemed to make sense.The only complaint I have is that I felt, many times, like I needed a French dictionary at my side. When Jane talks to Adele, and occasionally other people, it is usually in French, with no translation whatsoever.But since it was written in a time when most educated people took French, what can you expect?I would suggest publishers put footnotes with translations. The French is not, perhaps, very important to the story line (not that I would know), but it really bothered me to have no idea what they were saying."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I was a little apprehensive to read this book at first because it was written in the 19th century, and I speculated that it would not be an easy read. I figured that I would give it a try though, and I am glad that I did. Jane Eyre is the best book I have ever read.It is a love story, but not in the typical sense of traditional romances. It incorporates an actual plot line as to how two characters fall in love over a long period of time and follows through the depths of despair and joy. The twisting of conflicts and happiness throughout the story leave the reader laughing and crying, and never being able to predict an outcome.Jane Eyre has a well-developed plot that includes rounded characters whom the reader comes to identify with. Bronte's heroine, Jane, (who also narrates the book) is a believable character because she is not exceedingly intellectual, she is not beautiful, she is not wealthy, yet she is autonomous and strong-willed, unlike Jane Austen's heroines (i.e. Emma Woodhouse), who are invariably the opposite. Although Jane is simple and modest, her life is full of constant suffering. She is easy to like because of these characteristics, just as some of the other characters are easy not to like because of their own unique characteristics.Bronte highlights certain aspects in this novel that people of the 19th century went through and experienced through the depiction of Jane's own life: being poverty-stricken, being orphaned, being unwanted, being plain, or being driven insane with the unattainable. This book not only gives the reader a deeper sense of the past, but also allows him to empathize for people that lived in it, and therefore to empathize with Jane.Each time I read Jane Eyre I cry over and over again. It is a fantastic piece of work that should be read by everyone. Truly a masterpiece!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"This is one of the best books I have ever read. I have read it twice, and I LOVE IT!!! I admit it is slow in the beginning, but it quickly speeds up and you can't put it down! Charlotte Bronte is my FAVORITE author!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I think I've read Jane Eyre three or four times, and the more I look at it the more I appreciate how amazing it is. Often I can't be bothered to start a new book, and I can just pick J E up and read it from any point.I don't understand how Charlotte Bronte could have written so much and had power in almost every sentence. Classics are hard to get into, and maybe the first chapter was slow but at the same time ghostly.I picked out few faults and though I'm an inexperienced school girl I haven't read many more books which were so intense, an yet somehow managed to keep the reader on tenterhooks.How real life her writing is, but at the same time supernatural. For me, Jane Eyre is a living person and she always will be."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"In short, Jane Eyre is the story of a fairly unconventional life. Jane is orpahned when she is young and sent to live with her Aunt Reed, to a horrible &quot;school&quot;, then to work as a governess at Edward Rochester's home. She falls in love with Mr. Rochester but his secrets may make it imposible for them to ever be together.The book has a really slow, melodic feel to it, so if you like fast reads, it is not the book you're looking for.This is one of the best books I have ever read, so good its one of few that I have actually read several times over. Definately a classic."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"This is an absolutely wonderful and captivating book. Once you start it you just gotta finish it!The best part of Jane Eyre (pronounced \\"air\\") is the love story between Jane and Edward, her employer. Edward keeps a dark secret , the nature of which isn't telegraphed but instead thrust upon the reader all at once (very well done!!!), that makes him both penurious and tragic. This makes him a somewhat odd match for Jane who is the epitome of virtue and is self denying. The cat and mouse play in the begining of their relationship, the way they individually struggle after the secret is revealed, and the ultimate resolution of their love story makes this one of the greatest novels in Engish literature.This brings me to the movie. It isn't a very good adaptation of the book. Major parts of the plot are missing or altered beyond recognition and signifigance. I watched the movie AFTER I read the book and was glad I did it in that order. Their are some stories that just have to be read in order for you to enjoy them;Jane Eyre is one of them (David Copperfield is another). But that's o.k., Charlotte Bronte has provided us with a tale that mesmerizes and impacts its reader like few others can. If it comes down to the movie or the book...read the book."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I recently finished Jane Erye and I couldn't bear the thought of there not being more of it to read. At first I thought it was strange that Jane could fall in love with such a cold, hard man. But then it turned out that he had a certain charm and gentleness that was buried deep inside him, not to show its face until Jane uncovered it. I think a big reason that some people don't like this book is because they expect Jane to fall in love with a handsome, obviously charming man. But that kind of romance is done too often in literary works, and eventually it loses its effect. In his own suttle way, Mr. Rochester is Prince Charming, though it takes time and patience to see. The book has a slow start, but stick with it. I've seen two movie versions of this story already, and it's a shame to put the title Jane Eyre on them. They are great stories in themselves, of course, but they hardly do the book justice. I'm 14 years old now, and in a few years I plan to read this book again, in hopes of getting more out of it than I already have."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Jane Eyre, by Charlotte Bronte, is a thrilling romance novel. Set in England in the 1800s, this novel tells of the life of Jane Eyre. Jane is an orphan left in the care of her aunt, Mrs. Reed. At Gateshead, the Reed's estate, she lives a life of solitude and hate, mistreated and misunderstood by all. At the age of ten, she is sent to grim Lowood school, a reformatory school for orphans. Her years at Lowood are gloomy and dull, and she has few friends. When she is 18, she advertises as a governess, and finds a job at Thornfield Hall. Thornfield is all she ever wanted; there she is happy and loved, until a twist of fate and a long kept secret find her once more in peril. This novel is very romantic and heart warming. Charlotte Bronte has a knack for making her characters and situations seem real. At times I felt as though I were right there with Jane, sharing her hopes and dreams. I found this book to be interesting and fun to read, although at times it became drawn out. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes romance novels with wonderful characters, settings, and situations."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I am a 14-year-old girl and a novice towards 19th century British lit. I've never read an Austen and I cannot compair this book to Wuthering Heights (as I have never read that one either). I can only offer my less than expert opinion.This book was very enjoyable, at times. Until Mr. Rochester shows up, however, the book is very slow. The heroine grows on you quickly, so it makes the reading more fun. Jane is likeable, and I certainly cared more and more about her as the book progressed. I liked how blunt she could be at times and how stubborn. She displayed a great deal of strengh and determination, in a tough world, without the gifts of beauty and fortune. Jane has to make it on her own steam, and I think that a lot of modern girls could learn from her example.The story line with Mr. Rochester's crazy wife is a bit random, but very interesting none-the-less, and it added a layer of mystery to the plot.The ending of this book irked me the most, however, because (without giving it away) everything sort of falls into place. This bugged me because, up until then, Jane had to overcome issues and, in the end, her happiness was more or less handed to her.My one other complaint is that dear Jane Eyre likes to ramble about God and life and whatever else she sees fit to ramble about. It is dull dull dull, as the young girl muses on and on in her own head and we have to sit through it.I still very much liked the book though, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for an interesting little romance with an awesome heroine."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"The Brontes were a family of brilliant minds; Charlotte was the most brilliant among them (so beat me up, Emily fans), and Jane Eyre is far and away her masterpiece. I have imagined Handel laying down his quill after penning the final note of the Hallelujah Chorus, reading it over, and exclaiming aloud, \\"Whoa--where did THAT come from?\\" Jane Eyre is the same type of work. The tricks and seams and recycled gimmicks on which artists rely to connect pieces of greatness are absent here. The novel seems unedited, unreviewed, untouched--uncreated, like Jack's beanstalk that just sprang up overnight.That Charlotte Bronte was a genius in the field of human psychology is best proved by the facts that she was a desperate 20-something daughter of a country parson, she craved love (and sex) and excitement and had none, yet she wrote a novel of moral self-denial that remains satisfying to people who have long since kissed their 20's good-bye--people who have, perhaps, denied themselves very little. Without having had the opportunity to kick up her heels (much less participated in the 12-Step program to bring her down to earth), she understood in advance the processes of temptation, restraint, remorse, and rejuvenation.The first 2/3 of the book concerns temptation. It is the Hollywood part of the work, and the section that most appealed to me as an adolescent. Without the final third, however, the novel is another dopey Cinderella story--Maid in England, maybe: nice ordinary girl somehow attracts the attention of prince, great happiness ensues, no one learns anything, close curtain. (The really interesting psychology in these Cinderella stories, if you ask me, is that of the Prince--what's he looking for under those rags and foreign accents? Who's he pissed off at in Prince-land?) To an adult reader, Jane Eyre is monumental because of the struggle through hardship and denial to a less perfect (but, of course, more perfect) happiness at the end. While Jane's moral quandry takes place within the limits of a 19th century British system of Christian ethics, there is surprisingly little hellfire involved. After all, to Bronte, the daughter of a parson, the answer to Jane Eyre's dilemma could have been a simpleminded, \\"It's wrong, don't do it--just get on with it!\\" just as the answer to modern western readers is, \\"It's wrong but fun--just do it!\\"This book is even great in Italian, which is how I reread it--and I'm not sure Italian even has words for restraint and self-denial.Jane Eyre should not be assigned reading for most teenagers, however, and it frequently is. I can't even imagine the torture it would be for that large percent of teenage boys who are just not interested in the human heart; there is very little action in it--it's purely character analysis. (\\"Ghostly happenings\\" occur now and then, but probably not enough to hold the interest of most modern kids.) On the other hand, some first-time adult readers might put it down early, finding the opening 2/3 of the book somewhat ridiculous--there are some broad character portraits, a plot that seems to be heading down that Cinderella path, and a pretty unbelievable series of events leading to the crisis. So, I'm going to recommend this book to people exactly like me: Girls, read it first in your early teenage years and keep it in the back of your brain; then, every 10 or 15 years, as you pass through another stage of life, pick it up again. There's more in there, believe me--even in a foreign tongue!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Neat book.Well written, and the early chapters in particular capture the indignities of childhood in a way I've never read before."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"The secret to enjoying Jane Eyre is to read the first two thirds, and then stop. If you ignore that advice, you might conclude that a woman&#8217;s ideal role is something akin to slavery: total submission to the other gender.Yuk!The two men Jane involves herself with are certainly egomaniacs. Perhaps I&#8217;ve gone too far&#8212;maybe they&#8217;re just maniacs. Maniacs that Jane is more than willing dedicate her life to. The eccentricities of their personalities don&#8217;t bother her at all. What was Bront thinking of?A comparable near contemporary female character is Lizzie Hexam [Our Mutual Friend (Dickens, 1864-65)]. Like Jane, Lizzie was strong. Like Jane, Lizzie submitted herself to a dominant male, Eugene Wrayburn. Perhaps a significant difference is that the man Lizzie served, if not a perfect human, was worlds more appealing (at least to me) than either Eyre&#8217;s Edward Rochester or St. John Rivers.The last third of this book is all the more disappointing because of the quality of the two thirds that preceded it. Jane began as a woman with intellectual curiosity and strength of character. The life and future she ends with are anything but hopeful."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I have seen most all of the movie versions of this book however they can never compare to the complete novel.

It was extremely difficult to get through the book because not only was the plot an absolute bore, the characters also contributed to that boredom.After reading the book twice, trying to comprehend what was the point of the story, I still have yet to understand why Charlotte Bront even bothered writing this book. From what I can interpret, Jane Eyre is a girl who is lonely and dejected but finds love in a man called Mr. Rochester. Everything that happened in the middle is not significant. The story is extremely boring because it is too sentimental, too dull (just like Jane Eyre), and too long for a story with that plot line. What the characters say or do have no lasting effect in the reader's memory- it just blows right by. The characters are basic and have superficial, unoriginal motives. They do not do anything exciting or significant to help add to the plot. I kept skipping pages or rereading the same stuff because each and every page seems identical content-wise. The entire book has absolutely no memorable moments, proving how insignificant the work of literature truly is. Reading the book is a world of pain.If you are thinking about picking up this book and reading, save yourself the time and money, and go read something else worthwhile."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Reading this book was about as pleasant as a throwing knife to the face. I am going to be a senior in high school next year, and I just finished this book for my summer assignments for AP Literature. I literally took a victory lap around my house upon completion. I HATED this book. It was boring and rather pointless. No one cares about the romantic struggles of a fake character. This is basically the chick flick of books. I honestly believe this is the worst book I've ever read.

Thus, it doesn't make any sense to think that a novel like this one is really any better than say, Michael Crichton or Stephen King. Aesthetic standards can't be grounded.Thus, don't listen to anyone who tries to distinguish between &quot;serious&quot; works of literature like this one and allegedly &quot;lesser&quot; novels. The distinction is entirely illusory, because no novels are &quot;better&quot; than any others, and the concept of a &quot;great novel&quot; is an intellectual hoax."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Perhaps this book requires a re-read, but I found this novel to be full of meaningless drivel.

I mean, really a lot. I'll pick up a novel and finish it on the same day. Crime and Punishment? Took me half a day. Middlemarch? A day and a half.Because I read quickly, I tend not to be overly moved by the triumphs and travails of literary characters. I exult with them momentarily, but their brightness fades quickly once I set down the book.Jane Eyre was different. So many of the book's elements defied nineteenth century convention; so many of the book's elements set my heart racing and my mind on edge. The unexpected first person perspective. Charlotte Bronte's mesmerizing lyrical prose. The strength--or, as the British might say, the pluck--of the book's indomitable heroine. The tenacity of Jane's love for Rochester and the reciprocal power of his love for her.I don't often cry when I read novels, but for the last twenty pages of Jane Eyre, I read transfixed while tears streamed down my face. I doubt a novel has ever made a heroine come to life as vividly as did Jane Eyre.Read this book. Love it. Treasure every breathtaking passage and every witty turn of phrase. Watch as mere ink and paper breath life into Jane Eyre's heart--and your own."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"It's hard to imagine a better gothic romance than \\"Jane Eyre\\" -- gloomy vast houses, mysterious secrets, and a brooding haunted man with a dark past.In fact, Charlotte Bronte's classic novel has pretty much everything going for it -- beautiful settings, a passionate romance tempered by iron-clad morals, and a heroine whose poverty and lack of beauty only let her brains and courage shine brighter. And it's all wrapped in the misty, haunting atmosphere of a true gothic story -- madwoman in the attic and all.Jane Eyre was an orphan, abused and neglected first by relatives, then by a boarding school run by a tyrannical, hypocritical minister. But Jane refuses to let anyone shove her down -- even when her saintly best friend dies from the wretched conditions.But many years later, Jane moves on by applying to Thornfield Hall for a governess position, and gets the job. She soon becomes the teacher and friend to the sprightly French girl Adele, but is struck by the dark, almost haunted feeling of her new home.Then she runs into a rather surly horseman -- who turns out to be her employer, Mr. Rochester, a cynical, embittered man who spends little time at Thornfield. They are slowly drawn together into a powerful love, despite their different social stations -- and Rochester's apparent attentions to a shallow, snotty aristocrat who wants his wealth and status.But strange things are happening at Thornfield -- stabbings, fires, and mysterious laughter. Jane and Rochester finally confess their feelings to each other, but their wedding is interrupted when Rochester's dark past comes to light. Jane flees into the arms of long-lost family members, and is offered a new life -- but her love for Rochester is not so easily forgotten...\\"Jane Eyre\\" is one of those books that transcends the labels of genre. Charlotte Bronte spun a haunting gothic romance around her semi-autobiographical heroine and Byronic anti-hero, filling it with brilliant writing and solid plot. It has everything all the other gothic romances of the time had... but Bronte gave it depth and intensity without resorting to melodrama.Bronte wrote in the usual stately prose of the time, but it has a sensual, lush quality, even in the dank early chapters at Lowood. At Thornfield, the book acquires an overhanging atmosphere of foreboding, until the clouds clear near the end. And she wove some tough questions into Jane's perspective -- that of a woman's independence and strength in a man's world, of extreme religion, and of the clash between morals and passion.And Bronte also avoided any tinges of drippy sentimentality (Mrs. Reed dies still spewing venom) while injecting some hauntingly nightmarish moments (\\"She sucked the blood: she said she'd drain my heart\\"). She even manages to include some funny stuff, such as Rochester disguising himself as an old gypsy woman.The story does slow down after the abortive wedding, when Jane flees Thornfield and briefly considers marrying a repressed clergyman who wants to go die preaching in India. It's rather boring to hear the self-consciously saintly St. John prattling about himself, instead of Rochester's barbed wit. But when Jane departs again, the plot speeds up into a nice, mellow little finale.Bronte did a brilliant job of bringing her heroine to life -- as a defiant little girl who is condemned for being \\"passionate,\\" as an independent young lady, and as a woman torn between love and principle. Jane's strong personality and wits overwhelm the basic fact that she's not unusually pretty. And Rochester is a brilliantly sexy Byronic anti-hero with a prickly, mercurial wit.Of Charlotte Bronte's few novels, \\"Jane Eyre\\" is undoubtedly the most brilliant -- passionate, dark and hauntingly eerie. Definitely a must-read."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"If you are a Jane Eyre fan, junkie, or a first time reader, this is a wonderful edition to pick up. Dame Darcy brings the Gothic elements to life in her illustrations with an artistic flourish. I love these illustrations! They both complement the novel and are great on their own. This book was great to have on hand in class discussion on Jane Eyre and gothic literature.The text of this copy is the second edition of Jane Eyre with it's great preface by Bronte. It is a wonderful novel."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"\\"I am not talking to you now through the medium of custom, conventionalities, nor even of mortal flesh: it is my spirit that adresses your spirit; just as if both had passed through the grave, and we stood at God's feet, equal- as we are!\\" - Jane EyreJane Eyre is the wonderful story of a plain and simple girl who, as a child, is mistreated and wrongfully accused by her aunt and sentenced to Lowood, a school for orphans. After recieving an ok education Jane goes to be a governess at Thornfield where she meets the love of her life, Mr. Rochester. Yet she is only a governess and Mr. Rochester is going to be married to someone else. Jane has to make him change his mind before the dreaded wedding date.I don't want to give too much away but there is a lot more to this story than the summary above. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and I read some parts over and over again. Sorry guys but this is mostly romance and drama. How the author tells the story and the plot are very interesting. This book is considered a classic. All of the characters are explained in such detail. You have a connection with Jane Eyre. When I read the back of this book there was one sentence in particular that caught my attention. I hope that will help you in thinking about reading this book. Jane Eyre is now one of my favorite books.\\"Published in 1847 under the pen name Currer Bell, the book heralded a new kind of heroine- one whose virtuous integrity, keen intellect, and tireless perserverance broke through class barriers to win equal stature with the man she loved.\\"That sentence and the quote at the top describe Jane Eyre best."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Although I found this novel a bit too windswept, making it hard to turn the pages in an orderly fashion, I was awe-struck by its darkly gothic mood, the barely suppressed passions of its characters, and the threat of violent transgression that seems to haunt every scene like a towering shih-tzu.My gym teacher used to warn me about books like this. One morning after dodge-ball, he pulled me aside, put his hand on my shoulder, and said, \\"Son, I know your English teacher is having you read a lot of gothic Victorian novels about frightened young women who fall for mysterious, unattainable men with a dark side...\\" He leaned down and looked me straight in the eye. \\"You know I'm worried, don't you. I'm worried about your manhood. I'm worried you're going to waste that great gift you've been given, that great dodge-ball arm, and just -- \\"Oh forget it. I'll save the rest of this story for my therapist."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Word has it that \\"Jane Eyre\\" is one of the most imitated novels in literature, having almost singlehandedly spawned the genre of romantic fiction which supplies all those erotic-looking pulp paperbacks you see next to the magazine rack at the supermarket. What I found in Charlotte Bronte's masterpiece, however, was a smart, resolute, and independent heroine who stands out like a beacon in a sea of Victorian fictional women. As if obeying some sort of literary convention, the book does have a sad beginning and a happy ending, but in between there are some very rich surprises: moments of mystery, tension, and ghostly images, delivered in a tightly paced narrative.Jane Eyre is an orphan who has spent the first ten years of her life with a mean aunt who mistreats her and the next eight years at a miserable school for indigent girls called Lowood. With this education, she qualifies herself as a teacher and secures a position as a governess at a house called Thornfield Hall. Her employer is a man twice her age named Edward Rochester, and her charge is his ward, a little girl of French parentage named Adele.Given that Jane soon falls in love with him, it might be guessed that Rochester is a dashing, noble, gallant gentleman; but no: He is unattractive, eccentric, shifty, assumes disguises, and rarely gives a straight answer to a question. These might merely be manifestations of a quirky, enigmatic personality, or maybe he is so evasive because he is hiding something from his past -- as indeed he is, and that \\"something,\\" incriminating and dangerous, is locked up in Thornfield Hall, unknown to Jane and most of the servants.Rochester falls in love with Jane, too, despite his apparent attention to a conceited society woman named Blanche Ingram. After a short courtship and a marriage proposal, however, Jane breaks off with him when she discovers his secret. Abandoning Thornfield Hall for a new life, she meets a young parson named St. John Rivers who is planning to go to India to do missionary work and would like to marry her because he thinks she too would make a good missionary. Thus, she has had to reject two men in her life: the first because he was not honest with her and made her feel used and deceived; the second because he is not looking for a wife, but a co-worker.Jane is not foolish, but she is human. That she returns to Rochester does not mean she has decided to accept his faults, but that she realizes they have developed that special kind of mutually dependent relationship that only two people who are truly in love may foster. By the end of the novel, Rochester loses a great deal because of his mistakes, and Jane's love is his only redemption; Jane, on the other hand, gains much because of the strength of her character, and Rochester's love is the fulfillment of her desire."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"The book, Jane Eyre, by Charlotte Bronte, is considered to be a work of genius, and with good reason. The story revolves around the life of an orphan, Jane Eyre, living in England in the 1900s. The book starts out during her childhood, when she lived with her cruel Aunt Reed and cousins Georgiana, John, and Eliza, and her years at the Lowood School as both a student and a teacher. Then, Jane takes a job as a governess at Thornfield Hall. When she lives there, she falls in love with her master, Edward Fairfax Rochester, and they plan to marry. But Jane's happiness is destroyed when she learns of the horrible secret Mr. Rochester has keeping from her, and she leaves him. A few years pass, and Jane is now the head master at a small school, when she learns that she has cousins who are still alive, which is very important to her. She lives with her cousins for awhile, but eventually returns to the love of her life, Mr. Rochester, because she misses him. When she returns to him, she learns of the many bad things which have befallen him and Thornfield Hall, but in the end, she is very content with her life.This is an excellent book, especially because of the way the main character, Jane Eyre, is portrayed. She is not perfect, because she isn't very attractive, or very well liked. She is very shy and has many personality flaws, including \\"a wicked heart, especially for such a young girl\\" ( pg. 39). But she also has many good qualities about her; she is very kind and humble. The book provides just the right balance of good and bad to make Jane Eyre a very real and likeable character. Another reason why Jane Eyre is such a great book is because although it is very long, over 600 pages, the book moves very quickly, and there are almost no long portions of the book where nothing happens. Anytime there was a lull in the book, a major event would occur and the plot would move quicker, thus making the book seem shorter than it really was. Another reason why this book was so good was that it was a great picture of life for women in the 1900s. The book really showed that all that most women possessed was there title, and if they lost that, then they had nothing. However, Jane Eyre managed to rise above this, and in the end, the book's moral was about rising above your position in life, so that you could be truly happy.However, some people might disagree with my view on this book. Jane Eyre is at times a very sad book, and not everyone likes a sad book. Although Jane is generally happy, there is always a touch of sadness in her words and actions, which is why not everyone would agree with my review. However, there is plenty of good to out way the bad. This is a very interesting and compelling book which is very highly recommended. The plot is full of interesting people and places, it is written beautifully, and is a definite must read."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I still have the copy of &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; I first read when I was 12 years-old--it is now worn with love and many readings. I can think of no higher compliment to a book than to see its pages worn, cover creased by repeated use. With every reading over the years, I have gained new insight into Jane and Rochester.Jane is (as she describes herself) &quot;poor, obscure, plain and little&quot;, but she is also possesses incredible strength and conviction. Rochester is her match in passion, a dark and complicated hero. Theirs is a love story of two equals. Nowadays, this may seem commonplace (though, unfortunately, not as common as we may think); in Charlotte Bronte's time, this was a major revelation. Indeed, it was considered scandalous. Imagine--a woman asserting her own ideals and independence, considering herself equal to a man! Shocking!I have heard some say that they believe Emily Bronte's &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; to be the masterpiece of the Bronte family. While I loved that book, its protagonists cannot begin to compete with the strong, complex characters that Charlotte Bronte has given us. &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; is not only the masterwork of the Bronte family; it is one of the greatest books of the nineteenth century.Because I love this book so much, I cannot truly do it justice in this review. Please read it if you have not before. If you read it long ago, read it again. I promise you a great read and moving experience!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"A Realistic, Relatable Fairy Tale, by Michelle Giullain, student of Professor SWILUASome people never get sick of fairy tales. I, for one, have an incredible ability to hear the same story over and over again and never tire. Every once in a while, though, I crave something a little more realistic, while still maintaining that fairy tale \`happily ever after' ending. It is hard to appeal to both sides of the spectrum, but Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre accomplishes this daunting task. Though it does have the typical fairy tale ending, it is a novel the audience can relate to. Instead of a fairy tale princess, Jane Eyre is the fairy tale story of a plain girl who faces real struggles. Bronte's realistic, relatable characters who face normal struggles allow the reader to relate to the novel, making it a book that will be thoroughly enjoyed for years to come.The characterization Bronte uses is truly genius, combining archetypal characters with human flaws. Oddly enough, it contains some of the fairy tale archetypes we are oh so familiar with, the evil stepmother and stepsisters. In this case, it is an abusive aunt and her spoiled children, but they fulfill the same role. Other archetypes, such as the sacrificial best friend, Helen Burns, and the crazy ex, Bertha, all show up in the novel. It speaks to the reader's emotions, because everyone has and archetypal figure in their life of some form. Whether or not you have an evil stepmother, or mother in law, it is comforting to read about other people who go through the same struggles as you, especially if your ex is still haunting you.Additionally, the characterization of the protagonist, Jane Eyre, gives the reader a direct connection to the novel. Her imperfections are what make her so perfect. Her outside appearance pales in comparison to the beautiful princesses, literally. Her pale skin and her plain face do not match the description of the usual princess. But, because Jane is not perfect, the audience can relate to her. Not many of us look just like a princess, have a castle, or a fairy godmother to grant our every wish. When we read about someone who isn't that beautiful, those who feel they are not as beautiful as Cinderella have someone to relate to. However, it is not only the outer appearance that makes Jane so ideal. She also has character flaws. She does not posses the patience to tame a beast, like Belle, or Snow White's affinity to the caretaking of small innocent creatures. Rather, her honesty and stubbornness, un-princess like qualities, show that she is human. She is not entirely confident in herself and feels loneliness. In her own words, \\"I abhorred myself...I was hateful in my own eyes\\" (329). Though we may not loathe ourselves all of the time, there are many instances in which a normal human in the normal world would not like themselves. This additional perspective into the imperfect Jane helps the reader connect to the book.Bronte also makes the other character's flaws apparent, especially in the man Jane comes to love. Prince not-so-charming, Rochester, has his own flaws inside and out. He, like Jane, is not beautiful, dashing, or handsome. He is rustic, unrefined, and unkind and that is not all. He tries to control Jane's actions and play with her mind. He has hidden baggage, too. His crazy wife, Bertha, is locked up in his attic. By the end, however, he has proven that he is a good person, just like Jane. He heroically tries to save his servants and crazy wife from his burning house, and loses an eye in the process. The key to the audience connection is the imperfection of not only Jane, but also Rochester. For, how possible would it be that Jane could find a dashing prince charming when she is not beautiful? And if Rochester were handsome, why would he pursue a relationship with a plain Jane? The two is absolutely perfect for each other. To the reader, it makes perfect sense that these two imperfect characters should get together. And, it might even remind them of their own romantic endeavors, or give them a little hope for the future.Beyond the imperfect characters, the relationship between the characters also contributes to the appeal to the audience by creating even more reality amid a fairy tale story. The Rochester-Jane romance is not a love at first sight experience, even though she does sweep him off his feet. (Actually, his horse slips on the ice the first time they cross paths, but that is not really the same thing). Though Prince Charming and Cinderella lacked a bit of communication, they never had any significant relationship problems. Snow white didn't even need to meet her Prince. One kiss and he made her feel alive. However, like most human relationships, Jane and Rochester fight, argue, feel jealously and hurt. They keep secrets and experience disappointments. Rochester invites a party of beautiful women to his house to make Jane jealous. Then, on the morning of their wedding, she finds out that he has a wife in the attic. Jane then runs away because she cannot bear the thought of being a mistress to Rochester. Rochester is devastated and almost gives up living because he has lost Jane. Though they love each other, their relationship is not always perfect. Jane Eyre has no magic spells, princes, dragons, or balls. She has to deal with real life in the real world of relationships. Because this is more like the world we live in, the audience, who has likely experienced jealousy and conflict in a relationship, is able to see themselves in the story.Alas, all is well in the end, once the real life struggles are over. This fairy tale ending is the perfect finishing to the story, because it what the reader \`wants'. Though life doesn't always follow that pattern, sometimes it does. For Jane, something finally went right. Not many sentences in the novel provide as much joy as the simple declaration, \\"Reader, I married him\\" (462). Jane Eyre finds the love she has always wanted, and the reader, at that moment, experiences a small moment of triumph. That moment is the defining emotional moment of the novel, and what makes this novel so appealing to an audience. But, that is the same with any fairy tale.Because Jane Eyre does not simply focus on the \`happily ever after', but integrates the story into a complicated and realistic plot, it is a more believable story. The book does not begin or end with the usual \`Once upon a time\\" and \\"Happily ever after\\", nor does it focus on the marriage and courtship between the two characters. Jane has struggles throughout the novel, from the abusive cousins to the malnutrition at school to nearly dying from exhaustion. Even after she marries Rochester, she must deal with a blind husband who is an emotional wreck. With small triumphs are placed intermittently between many struggles, it reflects what life is like for the audience, and anyone who lives in the real world, for that matter. Jane may have struggles, but she sees the fulfillments of her dream.Ultimately, those who live in the real world have the opportunity to escape into a book that isn't just about some perfect fictional character in a far away kingdom. Jane Eyre is about the same world we live in because it presents the struggles many of us face, and the triumphs that even plain Jane can experience. No matter what time you may be reading this novel, the breadth of the archetypes and the imperfections of the characters give you the opportunity to enjoy and relate to this beautifully crafted novel. If you have not had the privilege to read this book, do so at once! You will be rewarded by one of the most enriching and inspiring books out there."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"It good to read a old classic novel like Jane Eyre, and wonder what it would like to live back then."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I remember first reading this book when I was in high school.

Bronte's command of the words she uses to paint a picture are exquisite. My sister and I decided a few years ago to read some of the 'classics' we had overlooked. Jane Eyre was our first selection. We are forever grateful we did not pass through this life without reading it. Oh, what we would have missed!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Oh how I love this novel! Jane Eyre is one of those novels that I can read over and over again and get something new out of it every time. I consider it to be one of the most readable classics, one I can just pick up and lose myself in it without even thinking about it. To me, that's a testament to how well it holds up, there aren't too many classics I can say that about because I find so many of them to be rather plodding.This time around, I found myself to be much more emotional about the trials that Jane goes through. I've gone through quite a few emotional events since the last time I read this one, and that undoubtedly affected my reading of many of the situations Jane is in. I openly wept when reading about her treatment during early childhood at Gateshead and later at Lowell School.As we get towards the middle section of the book, and Jane finds such happiness at Thornfield, I was so elated to witness her journey again. Yet, because I knew where it was going, I found myself deliberately slowing down, as if I could prevent more pain for her simply by reading the story so slowly. Of course, this didn't work and I was soon crying along with Jane again as another misfortune befell her. At some point, I just want poor Jane to catch a break!I think the thing that struck me most during this reading was how incredibly frustrated I was with St. John. Normally my frustration in this book is directed towards Mr. Rochester, he seems so fickle at times and difficult to read. Speaking of, I wasn't ever sure...is Rochester his actual name, or is that his estate/title? I think Fairfax is his real surname but I could be wrong. Those Brits always confuse me with this stuff!Anyway, back to St. John. He really is a good man, you can see it oozing from him, but he is so incredibly stubborn I wanted to reach into the pages and just slap him! I get that things were different back when this was written, and that what Jane proposed to him really just wasn't feasible. My frustration stems from his inability to just let the whole thing go!Given that he basically knows the entirety of Jane's story, I think it's really manipulative of him to continually try to convince her to do what he wants. He's not a stupid man, he knows that Jane longs to be involved with other people and is eager to please due to her childhood being so grim. And rather than taking a truly Christian path by wishing her the best when she makes her own choice, he continues to try and guilt her into doing things his way, even to the detriment of her own health, without any real concern for what may be best for her personally. Maybe it's my own ambivalent religious beliefs that make this more difficult for me, because I just don't believe that Jane should have to give up the things she believes may make her happy simply because St. John believes she *could* be a good servant to the lord. Needless to say, I agree with the choices Jane makes in the end, as she was finally able to do as she pleased.Because this is a reread for me, I knew all the major plot points ahead of time, and I think that knowledge added to the frustration I felt for St. John. With each reading, I feel like I understand Jane a little more, and feel for her more deeply, so I can almost experience the pain she goes through to the point that her conversations with these important people really affect me on an intimate level. I felt my own happiness being ripped away at the same time that Jane did, and that makes her all the more real to me.I've lost count of how many times I've read this novel, but this one really cemented it as my all time favorite classic, and one of the books I recommend to people when they ask for something new to read."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"It was nice to be able to read this classic for free.

But I pushed through, and by the time I was half finished, I couldn't put the book down. On the surface Jane Eyre is a compelling love story, but underneath it is a heavy handed take on the scripture \\"if your right hand causes you to sin, then cut it off.

Everyone has gone into the gist of the tale but I will tell you what I find most facinating.Charlotte Bronte wrote this in the first half of the 1800's. It's amazing that a woman in that century would be so bold & outspoken. Not only is Charlotte of this character but so is our heroine, Jane Eyre. In the year 2012 not many would find her personality unique but when reading consider that age in which this was written.

It's a bit hard to explain...but that's the reason I found it hard to relate.It was also tough because she at 18 yrs is so much like a girl and she falls in love with a man. It's well written...believable and I guess romantic...but it's hard to think of it that way because I never felt for Jane or Mr. Rochester or even some of the background characters enough to be enthralled by their stories.I did like little Adele though (partly because she was French and partly because she always spoke her mind.

She met each obstacle in her life as a student and governess with courage and spirit. As a governess, she fell in love with her employer, Mr. Rochester, who had a terrible secret from his past; however, their bond was so strong that it overcame even this obstacle.

Interestingly, I had always thought the part between the time she leaves Thornfield and returns was rather less vivid than the rest. Turns out most contemporary reviewers thought so as well.

It is the first book I've read in english,(being spanish my language) since I left school, 52 years ago.I loved the main character, Jane Eyre; her bright intelligence, her moral values, her determination to get the better of life's challenges and the way she loved without expecting anything in return.II find that it answers to the expectations of truth and right of people of any time."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"The novel I read \\"Jane Eyre\\" was very interesting. Jane Eyre was a little orphanage girl, that lived with a family she did not love. Jane didn't feel as if that was her home. Jane says, \\"I was like nobody there. If they did not love me, in fact, as little as I did them.\\" There was to main people that had hurt her the most physically and mentally, Master Reed and Mrs. Reed . Master Reed was a cruel young boy. He liked to criticize, make fun of, and hurt Jane. He thought he was the boss and owned everything in the house. In the book it says that Jane was reading a book and he came along and asked, \\"Why are you touching my stuff? Everything in here will belong to me one day.\\" She responded, \\"I'm only reading a book.\\" He made her look away and threw the book to her head. Master Reed didn't get in trouble at all, because he was Mrs. Reed precious son.Another thing that interested me is that she was a girl that wanted to be different. No matter how people looked down at her, or ridiculed her, she was always determined to be someone in life. Mrs. Reed was very cruel to Jane because she was trying every way possible to put her in school or send her away. Jane began to think that she wasn't good enough for that family. They had downgraded her so much, that Jane began to think bad about herself. Jane began to think to herself, \\" What thought had I been but just conceiving of starving myself to death? She wanted someone to care about her and show her love. This novel would be good for a person looking for motivation or a book that is very inspiring.

Jane Eyre is a curious, intelligent and emotionally volatile girl, who we witness grow up into a woman, seeking to make connections with the world around her. There are so many great elements to this story that, considering how long ago it was written, seem novel and suggestive of feminism. Jane Eyre does not take crap from anyone, and is very honest, candid and assertive about this. She is devoted to making a life for herself without anyone else's help. She listens to her instincts, and let them guide her through the course of her life, not matter what the perceived cost may be.I found this story compelling. Even though the subject matter wasn't gripping or exhilarating, the manner in which it was written was enough to keep me interested every page of the way. The word choice and flow were so well done that I feel like I'm floating down the stream of consciousness that the author expertly disseminates through her passion and skill.

If you have not read \\"Jane Eyre\\" do yourself a favor, turn off the TV, and settle down for a enjoyable and poignant reading experience."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"It's hard to imagine a better gothic romance than \\"Jane Eyre\\" -- gloomy vast houses, mysterious secrets, and a brooding haunted man with a dark past.In fact, Charlotte Bronte's classic novel has pretty much everything going for it -- beautiful settings, a passionate romance tempered by iron-clad morals, and a heroine whose poverty and lack of beauty only let her brains and courage shine brighter. And it's all wrapped in the misty, haunting atmosphere of a true gothic story -- madwoman in the attic and all.Jane Eyre was an orphan, abused and neglected first by relatives, then by a boarding school run by a tyrannical, hypocritical minister. But Jane refuses to let anyone shove her down -- even when her saintly best friend dies from the wretched conditions.But many years later, Jane moves on by applying to Thornfield Hall for a governess position, and gets the job. She soon becomes the teacher and friend to the sprightly French girl Adele, but is struck by the dark, almost haunted feeling of her new home.Then she runs into a rather surly horseman -- who turns out to be her employer, Mr. Rochester, a cynical, embittered man who spends little time at Thornfield. They are slowly drawn together into a powerful love, despite their different social stations -- and Rochester's apparent attentions to a shallow, snotty aristocrat who wants his wealth and status.But strange things are happening at Thornfield -- stabbings, fires, and mysterious laughter. Jane and Rochester finally confess their feelings to each other, but their wedding is interrupted when Rochester's dark past comes to light. Jane flees into the arms of long-lost family members, and is offered a new life -- but her love for Rochester is not so easily forgotten...\\"Jane Eyre\\" is one of those books that transcends the labels of genre. Charlotte Bronte spun a haunting gothic romance around her semi-autobiographical heroine and Byronic anti-hero, filling it with brilliant writing and solid plot. It has everything all the other gothic romances of the time had... but Bronte gave it depth and intensity without resorting to melodrama.Bronte wrote in the usual stately prose of the time, but it has a sensual, lush quality, even in the dank early chapters at Lowood. At Thornfield, the book acquires an overhanging atmosphere of foreboding, until the clouds clear near the end. And she wove some tough questions into Jane's perspective -- that of a woman's independence and strength in a man's world, of extreme religion, and of the clash between morals and passion.And Bronte also avoided any tinges of drippy sentimentality (Mrs. Reed dies still spewing venom) while injecting some hauntingly nightmarish moments (\\"She sucked the blood: she said she'd drain my heart\\"). She even manages to include some funny stuff, such as Rochester disguising himself as an old gypsy woman.The story does slow down after the abortive wedding, when Jane flees Thornfield and briefly considers marrying a repressed clergyman who wants to go die preaching in India. It's rather boring to hear the self-consciously saintly St. John prattling about himself, instead of Rochester's barbed wit. But when Jane departs again, the plot speeds up into a nice, mellow little finale.Bronte did a brilliant job of bringing her heroine to life -- as a defiant little girl who is condemned for being \\"passionate,\\" as an independent young lady, and as a woman torn between love and principle. Jane's strong personality and wits overwhelm the basic fact that she's not unusually pretty. And Rochester is a brilliantly sexy Byronic anti-hero with a prickly, mercurial wit.Of Charlotte Bronte's few novels, \\"Jane Eyre\\" is undoubtedly the most brilliant -- passionate, dark and hauntingly eerie. Definitely a must-read."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I ordered this book along with Pride and Prejudice. They are more beautiful in person that in the pictures. Very well made and durable and the paper is thick and high quality so they will hold up even if you read them over and over as I do with my favorites. Jane Eyre is one of my favorite novels. The story is such a wonderful mix of classic romance but with splashes of the dark and supernatural. I highly recommend these gorgeous penguine classics to everybody and I can't wait to order the rest of them for myself."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"On October 16th, of 1847, \\"Jane Eyre: An Autobiography\\", edited by Currier Bell (pseudonym of Charlotte Bront) was published. It created some controversy at the time, as many believed it was written by a man. The novel was very popular when published, but critical reaction to it varied. Today, it is clearly a classic, the development of a young woman, who does not fit into the stereotype of a nineteenth century woman. She is not submissive, and she struggles to avoid being dependent on others. The original publication was in three volumes, but this Penguin Classics edition is based on the third edition of Jane Eyre, and it is the last edition which Charlotte Bront edited and corrected.The story covers Jane's life from her childhood until her marriage. The childhood chapters can be split into two sections, those where Jane, an orphan, was being raised by her Uncle's family, but her uncle has passed away and her aunt does not like her, but was forced to promise to take care of her. The key parts of this section are Jane's being rejected by the closest thing she has to a family, her morality, and her independence, i.e. her refusal to conform. The second part of her childhood is when she is sent to attend a charity school, called Lowood, where the pupils have to make do with substandard food and clothing. Here Jane finds one teacher who treats her, and the other students, well, Miss Maria Temple. One of the key things in this section is the difference between religion and morality, symbolized by Mr. Brocklehurst a clergyman who is mostly responsible for the appalling conditions at Lowood, and Jane and Miss Temple on the side of morality. Also key is Jane's witnessing her friend, Helen Burns, dying from a typhus epidemic, in spite of her goodness and her submission to the standards imposed by Mr. Brocklehurst and Miss Scatcherd, a teacher as cruel as Miss Temple is kind.The story then picks up many years later, with Jane in position as a teacher at Lowood, but looking to move on. She advertises for a position as a governess and is hired by Mrs. Fairfax. She is to take care of Ad&egrave;le Varens, a girl who is being taken care of by Mr. Rochester, the master of Thornfield Manor where Mrs. Fairfax is the housekeeper. This section has a lot to do with class, as well as morality. There is the difficulty of Jane falling in love with someone of a different class. There is also the looking down on Jane as being of a lower class, by Mr. Rochester's peers. The morality questions are here to, in the comparison of the higher classes verses that of the lower class. Even Mr. Rochester's behavior is in question, in the events leading up to Jane leaving. Jane also finds out that she does have family left, and when it appears that she is to have everything, she sends a letter to her father's brother. It is this attempt to reconnect with family that causes her to lose nearly everything as it destroys what she thought she was about to have.The next section details Jane's life after leaving Thornfield Manor. Here she loses almost everything, and is on death's door when she is on the doorstep of Moor House. The Rivers, St. John, Diana, and Mary. It is from this state of having nothing from which she recovers almost everything she could want. Here she recovers her health, she is employed again and regains much of her independence. St. John is in love with a woman, but he will not ask her because he is driven to devote his life to religion. He does find out Jane's true identity though, and this results in Jane learning she has family, and wealth that she didn't know she had. She is pressured by St. John to marry him and join him in his missionary life, but she knows that he doesn't love her. She rejects St. John, and instead goes to find her one love, Mr. Rochester. She now has wealth and family, and she learns that tragedies in Mr. Rochester's life have made what was once impossible possible.It is a long and winding road which Jane travels in this novel. Probably best classified as a gothic romance, it deals with numerous issues and the strength of Jane's character serves as a good role model for young women, and for that matter anyone. The Penguin Classics edition is filled with supporting documentation as always. There is a wonderful introduction by Stevie Davies, along with a Chronology, suggestions for further reading, notes on the text, opinions of the press, and wonderful textual notes which enhance the reading experience and understanding of the reader."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Never being a great fan of the Victorian period of English literature, I have always steered clear of the sisters Bronte, Jane Austin, and others of their ilk. It is amazing how much we miss when blinded by prejudice. I not only liked Jane Eyre immensely, but was very impressed by the literary abilities of Charlotte Bronte and regretted that I had not read the novel sooner. Although Bronte did not have the formal education and did not share the literary traditions enjoyed by some of her male colleagues, she grew up in a household in which storytelling was prominent and understood that the first task of any writer is the ability to tell a good story. Jane Eyre is a wonderful creation, a story that keeps the reader's interest from the first, and one in which Bronte introduces to the reading public one of the first truly modern heroines.Charlotte Bronte's novel is a complex and structured work and contains within it elements of romance, picaresque wanderings and a preoccupation for the Gothic themes of mystery and the supernatural. But to describe the work simply as a very good Gothic novel would be to ignore the remarkable characterization that Bronte achieves in the creation of the character of Jane Eyre. Bronte's character is quite unique when compared to other female heroines of the era. Jane is not beautiful and does not enjoy any of the privileges of wealth or social position, and it is clear from the beginning that if Jane is to make her way in the world she will have to do it with a combination of hard work and intelligence, and not be afraid to question accepted social conventions. The decision of Bronte to narrate the tale through the eyes of Jane bonds the reader and the main character together creating an intimacy that is first rate. We share all her hardships and experiences from Gateshead to the final reunion with Mr. Rochester, and sympathize with her moral dilemmas and her indignant stand against religious hypocrisy (a feeling strong enough to have her expound more fully in the preface to the second edition of her novel: \\"[The world] may hate him who dares to scrutinise and expose - to rase the gilding, and show base metal under it - to penetrate the sepulchre, and reveal charnel relics: but, hate as it will, it is indebted to him\\").Although the creation of the character of Jane is Bronte's greatest achievement, she is possessed with the talent to write a story that is exciting, mysterious and ultimately rewarding - in other words, a pure classic. Bronte may not possess in full the literary style of some of her contemporaries, but she writes with assurance and surprises the reader with some extraordinary passages, beautiful examples that combine nostalgia, religious mysticism and poetic rhythm into a wonderful prose. The influence of the book is still alive over a century later. Jean Rhys uses the novel as the point of departure for her Wide Sargasso Sea, and groups as divergent as Marxists, feminists, and Horatio Alger types all use the book as part of their lexicon."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Let me just be out with it: I love Jane Eyre. It is my mom's favorite novel of all times and definitely in my (constantly changing) top 5. The Dover Thrift Edition is a wonderfully inexpensive way to get wonderful literature into people's hands, so I am pro-Dover, all the way. But to speak to the novel itself, it's a classic that's been remade into films so many times because it is a great story artfully told. Jane is one of my all-time favorite literary characters, and almost definitely my favorite female one. If you hate romance novels which have the prerequisite of a jaw-droppingly beautiful heroine, let me introduce you to Miss Eyre (though if she were alive today, she might insist on Ms.) Jane is described as \\"plain\\" throughout the novel, and this not-terribly-flattering adjective applies to her on several levels (her appearance, her plain-speaking manner, her direct way of dealing with problems). Because of the first-person narration and the abundance of details of her early life, the reader is drawn into a close relationship with Jane, and to know her is to love her. Here is someone I readily admire with her pluck and nerve tempered by a healthy dose of humility. Jane seems like such a real person as we get right inside her thoughts and see her deepest longings, doubts, and fears. To me the most telling scene is (hopefully not too much of a spoiler) when Jane unfavorably compares herself to Mr. Rochester's presumed sweetheart, the beautiful Blanche Ingraham. To cure herself of any flights of romantic fantasy she may be tempted to indulge in over her boss, she forces herself to make two very realistic drawings, one of herself and one of Blanche, and study them closely, hoping to cure herself of the foolish notion that a man might prefer her to gorgeous Blanche. Wow, what a woman! How many of us have the strength of will or character to study our weaknesses in as strong a light as possible in order to disabuse ourselves of notions we fear may be dangerous? Jane certainly doesn't suffer from the too-common (modern?) disease of self-importance, and we see how this, combined with her certain moral compass, guide her to do the right thing(s) even when they are not in any way fun or pleasant. Pick up a copy of Jane Eyre if you haven't read it before and give one of British literature's most interesting creations the chance to win you over."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Some modern readers may find it hard to believe that this little Gothic novel created quite the scandal in its day. The novel is based on an orphan by the name of Jane Eyre, who is raised by her aunt, the cold-hearted and cruel Mrs Reed. Jane's early childhood is one marked by violence and neglect. Early on, however, the readers learn that little Jane Eyre has a fiery spirit that refuses to become a victim of its oppressive enviroment. She boldly lashes out at those who mean to demean her and constantly remind of her station in life.When Jane fondest wish comes true, she leaves behind her wretched existence at Gateshead House and arrives at Lowood school. Jane's life at the orphan boarding school proves just as trying as her time at Gateshead. Behind the walls of Lowood, Jane suffers many privations and witnesses many acts of cruelty. She remains at Loowood for eight years, first as a pupil then as a teacher. Jane's urgent need for change prompts her to seek a position as a governess. She finds such a position at Thornfield Hall, the home of Edward Rochester, who the narrator falls deeply in love with.The character of Jane Eyre is extremely modern. Readers today will have little problem identifying with her thoughts and wishes. Although of low social standing, Jane speaks her mind to those who mean to subdue her. She reminds her aunt of her promise to look after her when she abuses her as a child. She defies the teachers at Lowood. She refuses to become Mr Rochester's mistress. Jane choses her own happiness over what is expected of her, not a very attractive quality in women in Victorian society, but one modern readers can sympathize withCharlotte Bronte used several personal life experiences as inspiration for this novel. Like Jane, Charlotte attended a boarding school, where she experienced many of the tribulations Jane suffered. The death of Helen Burns at Lowood from tuberculosis was inspired by the death of her sisters Elizabeth and Maria, at The Clergy Daughter's School from the same disease. Jane Eyre is one of the best classics. It's dark and tragic, yet emotional and even amusing at times. Definitely one of my favorites."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"JANE EYRE is a novel of destroyed conventions. At nearly each and every turn within its pages, there is some rule, some assumption of character and plot destroyed. In JANE EYRE, women fight back against tyrannical husbands, governesses \`look above their stations', mothers are absent and men are punished for their subjugation of women. Not content to only poke at society through the safety of a fictional character, Bronte also confronts literary conventions, constructing JANE EYRE as a Bildungsroman about a WOMAN, and an UNATTRACTIVE woman to boot. Is nothing sacred? NO. And this is what makes JANE EYRE such a wonderful read. Looking for just great wit, nascent feminism and in general a pretty good story addled with a few boring inanities about day-to-day life? Go buy a Jane Austen novel. JANE EYRE is nearly the antithesis of orderly Austen, a passionate display of feelings and emotions that would have made Austen's EMMA blush, a full-blown rebellion against the societal constraints upon women.\\"Women are supposed to be very calm generally: but women feel just as men feel; they need exercise for their faculties...they suffer from too rigid a restraint, too absolute a stagnation, precisely as men would suffer; and it is narrow-minded in their more privileged fellow creatures to say that they ought to confine themselves...\\" Within these few scathing lines is contained almost the entire sociological crux of the novel. For Jane, though outwardly calm as \\"women are supposed to be\\", is often raging inside at various acts of injustice perpetrated upon her. Sometimes she releases her feelings and vents, other times she swallows it \\"as women are supposed to\\" do. At this period of time, women in the upper class were mostly ornaments. When men spoke of their accomplishments, they meant things like a woman's ability to speak French, or her grace while playing a piano. Her business acumen would most likely not be counted an accomplishment, but a detraction, a manifestation of too spirited a personality, or too lively a mind. Hopeful mammas made sure that their little girls learned all the correct dances, could play an instrument and sing, or embroider, NOT complete ledgers. Bronte is urging that her fellow women not be confined to the pursuit of such activities, but allowed to exercise their minds and emotions in whatever direction they might want to...and in 1841!It's a wild ride that never ceases to be entertaining. Don't miss JANE EYRE."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"This book is the best book I have ever read. I mean what more could a girl want out of a book. ...

Her reading voice is pleasant and natural-sounding and she conveys just the right amount of emotion. She also manages to vary the tone of her voice just enough that can differentiate between characters but not so much that she sounds foolish.The only drawback to this audio book is that it is recorded on two tracks. That means you have to listen to each tape twice, setting it either to the full right or full left speaker of your stereo. Although this does cut back on the number of tapes, I didn't like having all the sound come from one side of my car."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"In, &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; it is obvious to tell that the author, Charlotte Bronte is the sister of Emily Bronte. The dark tone and twisted love story are all to analogous traits of Emily's Bronte's story, &quot;Wuthering Heights.&quot; Much like Charlotte, Jane is an unattractive girl, who grows up in a school for girls where the accomidations are all but comfortable. She grows to be very inteligent, however, is not the most sought after girl in England. She becomes a governess for a man named Mr. Rochester. Jane is in love with Mr. Rochester, but his dark secrets and overbearing temper are almost too much for Jane to live with. Of all the Bronte books, Jane Eyre is among the finest. The relationship between Jane and Mr. Rochester is interesting and encapturing, but the life of Jane, and her triumphs are far more compelling. Jane Eyre is a classic, that should be read at least once, if not more, by every girl who is searching for a place in this world. The expierences Jane has on her road to becoming a woman are a very interesting reflection of Charlotte Bronte's encounters. Perhaps this is what makes the story so interesting?!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"To be honest, I haven't read many classics, but this is by far my favorite book ever. I was assigned to read it for school and am now completely obsessed. I have three different copies of the story, but my first copy was this cover.What makes this book endurable and able to plow through for the first one-hundred-thirty pages and then keep reading for the next three-hundred-forty-one is the characterization. You love Jane, you hate Mr. Brocklehurst, and I don't know about anybody else, but I loved Mr. Rochester, Helen Burns, and Diana and hated St. John Rivers and Mrs. Reed. All characters stir feelings of either love or hate in you. This truly is the first, and the best, soap opera in the world!I was told by some that they thought the ending lacked - ha ha! The ending couldn't have been better in my opinion. I, personally, didn't see it coming. When Jane was actually contemplating marrying St. John Rivers, I openly yelled \\"No! No! You can't marry him! You love Mr. Rochester whether he's married to a lunatic or not! Don't marry the moron! He's forcing you into it!\\"This book evoked emotions from me I've never gotten before while reading a book. It evoked emotions I never even got watching a movie. Well, maybe it did, only they were excrutiatingly amplified. It was painful to read of Jane leaving Thornfield, even more painful to watch this self-respecting woman beg for food, and yet uplifting to read of her scorning St. John's idea of love and Mrs. Fairfax's label of \\"beggar.\\"All in all, whether you're assigned to read it or not, \\"Jane Eyre\\" is overly well worth its 461 pages."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Dear Anti-Bronte readersI beg you, don't review the books that you read in English class. I noticed that you tend to get to be prejudiced against the book... What do you mean that it's a child's foolery? What do you mean that the author had nothing better to do? Do you know that Bronte was very ill from the beginning of her life and the literature was the only thing that could keep her going up to her short life? Do you know that her beautiful symbolisms and enormous passion for life, let aside the unique plot and attractive characters, reflect her deep understanding of history and literature? She is a thoroughly educated and intelligent author. Her conversations are deliberately yet unconsciously designed. A choice of a word, a sentense is one by one patient, full of love, and &quot;complete beauty, like a Greek statue of Apollo... (quoted from the book)&quot; I can't praise this book enough, I'm usually very tough on literatures... I even think Kafka's Metamorphosis, with its moving plot and unique characters, is 4.5 out 5 stars... So read more and get some real experience, before you do actual reviewing. Your childish rates and opinions might turn away and repel some readers thus reduce their life to the level of yours."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"It was a book my Grandmother told me I should read. I just decided to buy it on impulse really, not knowing what I was getting myself into. I opened the book and was immedeately swept into Jane Eyre's world. My mind played out all of the scenes as I read, only a truly masterful piece of work could create images so strongly right from the start. Charlotte Bronte creates a masterful work of art on the pages of this book.When the book begins, you are taken into Jane's childhood, and given a sense of what it's like to have no love, and no hope of the future. You can actually see the pain on Jane's face. Then at Lowood, you learn with her, and grow with her. Finally, on the night she arrives at Thornfield Hall you are overcome with anticipation for Jane. What is this life going to be like? Then when Edward Rochester appears, you hate him. You can't believe that he talks to her that way. After a while though, things soften, and Miss Bronte introduces a new feeling. Love. The painting seems complete when Jane and Mr. Rochester confess their feelings, and you wonder, what could possibly be better than this? The ending,(which I won't give away)is absolutely breathtaking. I cried for a half an hour when I read it. It was at four in the morning mind you,(the book was so good I could not put it down.)The characters in the novel are whole, they seem like real people. Charlotte Bronte uses her pen to paint a wonderful picture, one can not help but be engulfed in the color. The book has lasted almost 200 years, I see no reason why it could not last forever. If you ever want to read a classic love story that defines the power of women in literature, then Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre is it. I'm 16 years old, and if a teenager can be moved to tears while reading, it must be quite a piece of literature. I walked away feeling like I had taken an amazing journey, and found a new friend in Jane Eyre."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"&quot;Jane Eyre&quot; is a classic of English literature and, although it's easy to see why, I do feel the author missed some opportunities to make this very good book even better.The character of Jane Eyre is a very believable and sympathetic protagonist. No, she's not perfect, as a child or as an adult, and this is all to the the good. She is warm and caring with a tremendous capacity for love to which, understandably, she's afraid to give free rein.Jane's years as a child, both with her relatives and at school, are interesting, but only to a point. They seemed to drag and I was so glad when she finally graduated and the story &quot;really began.&quot;It was during the middle section of the book, during Jane's time in Mr. Rochester's employ, that I felt Bronte missed several good opportunities to &quot;up&quot; both the suspense and the reader's interest. For example, we learn too quickly who Mrs. Rochester is and why she does the things she does. I think Bronte should have built this section up more slowly.After Jane leaves the Rochester estate, her meeting with her &quot;new&quot; family is extremely far-fetched. I know, readers weren't as demanding in Bronte's day as they are now, but still, I thought this was the weakest section of the book and the least interesting by far.Overall, I think &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; is a book that clearly showcases the class distinctions of the times. This is particularly evident in the early chapters, when Jane is still a child and in the chapters that take place during her employment in the Rochester household.&quot;Jane Eyre&quot; is a book that's dated, of course. Times change and reading tastes do, too. If one keeps this in mind, &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; should prove to be both a memorable and enjoyable reading experience."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Have you ever wanted someone to notice your personality instead of focusing on your outer appearance? If so, then you can relate to the title character in Jane Eyre, by Charlotte Bronte. Jane, a plain but spirited governess, falls in love with her arrogant employer, Mr. Edward Rochester.Alas, Jane has a bitter rival, the beautiful and accomplished, Baroness Blanche Ingram. As Jane teaches Adele, Mr. Rochester's illegetimate ward, she gains the notice of St. John, a missionary. This classic takes you through her life- from governess to heiress.If you like a challenging read, you will definately enjoy Jane Eyre. This book is highly recommended to young adult readers. This novel is full of advanced vocabulary and even French conversations! But you don't have to be bilingual to love this remarkable story.This classic has an emontional and romantic voice. Jane is very much in love with Mr. Rochester, as you can see by this quote: &quot;[He] was becoming to me, my whole world; almost my hope of heaven. He stood between me and every thought of religion, as an eclipse intervenes between man and the broad sun. I could not, in those days, see God for His creature: of whom I had made an idol.As you can see, Jane Eyre is a complicated novel, but worth the time it takes to read it. This classic, once published under the pseudonym of Currer Bell, will make an excellent addition to any young reader's personal library."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I absolutely loved this book.

It took me two days to read this book. I could'nt put it down! Jane is so down to earth and she refuses to feel sorry for herself, and do what she wanted to do the light of what others would suffer if she did. Her devoted love to Rochester was touching. When she discovered his sad secret, she did not follow her own fleshly desires, but left for the good of her lover, heartbroken, yet triuphant in knowing that she'd done what was right. Charlotte Bronte book is the best I've ever or ever will read. Those who rate this book 1 star need to reread it.:)"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"This is a quality literal book book set in the 19th century and has a great storyline.

She begins off as an orphanted plain not very pretty, bright and shy girl. Then turns around completely.

So she's a governess, whoopie! Nah, the job outlook of this great classic is one that we can leave out of prints, but her relationships with that brash flirtatious old man is one I have always enjoyed.

Read it NOW!!!!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"A story from another time and place, rich in words, emotion, and narrative detail, fitting the romantic period of English history. Prepare yourself to go slowly at first to absorb the heroic character of Jane Eyre as she survives the not-to-be-gotten-around class system of 19th C England. By today's standards, she is not only fiercely independent and incredibly intelligent; she is morally superior. Suspense builds and delivers even if you have seen the movie. What a love story! Charlotte Bronte would have scored a perfect 800 on the Verbal SAT. Indeed, it probably would not have challenged her!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Because people who don't like this book are stupid poopheads. It's just that simple. Jane Eyre is a classic, not only of Victorian literature, but of all time. You must love it; and if you can't, there's something clearly wrong with you."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I have already written a review for this book. Actually, I wrote it several months ago. However, I found one review that disturbed me. The reviewer said, and I quote, &quot;Thank the gods for Jane Austen, I say. At least her heroines were role models well worthy of attention by impressionbale female readers.&quot;Okay, now here is my opinion on that statement. I have read Jane Austen and I absolutely adore all of her novels (Mansfield Park I cannot speak for, I have never read it.) However, I find that her heroines are not to be admired. Take for instance, Anne Elliot in Persuasion who spends 8 years in a state of depression and makes her self ugly because she made a mistake. Or Elizabeth Bennett in Pride and Prejudice, who is much to prejudiced to even hear Mr. Darcy's side of the story. And don't forget Catherine Morland in Northanger Abbey who almost scares herself to death romantizing every little detail in an old house just because she has read too much. Then there is Marianne Dashwood in Sense and Sensibility who is so concerned with dying for love that she can't see that the man of her dreams is right in front of her face and she falls in love with some jerk. And last, but not least, Elinor Dashwood, Marianne's elder sister, who closes up her emotions inside and because of that eventually snaps. Jane Eyre, on the other hand is a heroine to be admired, for she shows us all that even in the worst situations of life (which she experienced) you can still be strong. Jane Austen's characters may live the fairytale &quot;happily ever after&quot; life, but they do not prove as strong as Jane Eyre in the least."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"This is my absolute favorite book!

I had to read it for a school project and I truely enjoyed it. This book was easy to read and very easy to follow. I thought that Charlotte Bronte put her heart and soul into this novel. I really enjoyed and think that everyone should read it."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"This is a good book because it is a good example of romance and also, has a flare for life. It is creatively written. I think that some characters, like Mr. John Rivers, are not what the author describes of Jane's liking. I can't make myself like his character. However, although the pace in this book certainly does slow down at times, it is usually fast. And exciting. With a touch of suspense. I've only read it recently and I've probably already read it like, 6 times. In about 3 weeks. Everytime I read it, I find something new in it. I like books like that because it gives the reader something new to learnn each time. I strongly recommand reading the book! ;)"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"What kind of attitude should we hold to face the events in our lives. Jane is a girl with determination.

I have read it five times and ask you to read it."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I picked up a copy of Jane Eyre at a used book store. I have a collection of old books. I buy them for the age and cover art and then read them. I've heard of Jane Eyre, but have never read it. Its an amazing book. I read it in two days and have been thinking about it every day for the last three weeks.Reading other people's reviews is interesting, but if I hear it's a \\"woman power\\" feminist book one more time I'm going to scream! I'm sorry, I think it's way more advanced and classy than the tired old 1960s woman's movement stuff. If Jane Eyre was a modern feminist, she'd be spending her time trying to knock Mr.Rochester out!If you enjoy Jane Eyre, you should also read 'First Violin' and 'Forever Amber'. They aren't well known, but feature similar gut-wrenching romance."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I confess it. I bought this copy of Jane Eyre for the cover art.I have always loved the story of Jane Eyre since I was a teen. Everything interested me - the gothic atmosphere, the dark and brooding Mr. Rochester, the mystery of what exactly was locked away in Thornfield...Most of all, I loved Jane as a character. She's not blessed with beauty or wealth, but she is determined to be independant and live her own life. She overcomes hardships, abuse, and grief to live on her own terms. Best of all, she finally does find love. Naturally, that road doesn't run smoothly, but the ending is as it should be.Yes, I have loved Jane Eyre from the very first reading, but never managed to hold on to my own copy. Finally, I decided that I needed to add it to my shelves and started to search for a copy to call my own. One thing that did irriate me were all the various covers of this book. Yes, Jane Eyre is a classic, but I really think all the portraits of women in period garb was overkill. What happened to giving the novel a regular, uncomplicated cover? Honestly, this book is too good to have people turn away because of the \\"classic\\" look. Let's face it - people do judge books based on the covers. Honestly, all the covers I saw of other editions of this novel just flat out annoyed me.I saw this cover and loved it instantly. Superficial? Sure. However, this edition is worth the extra money in my mind. I often loan books to friends and they never want to read the \\"classics\\" because the covers look too old fashioned. If it is old, no one really wants to give the book a chance. Jane Eyre stands the test of time. Not everyone can overcome the sight that is on the surface, so this edition works. (And since the popularity of the Twilight series, other classics have been reprinted with pretty coveres with lovely flowers to draw in younger readers - i.e. Pride and Prejudice and Romeo and Juliet - It is only fair that Jane Eyre gets an upgrade too!)The cover is beautiful and captures the eye. I already know and love the story, but I hope this cover will draw in new readers and create new fans of Bronte's work.I realize many may not really agree with my opinion, but I do get pretty bored of all the classics having to have certain covers that commiunicate the fact that they were written in times past. If a novel stands the test of time, why does that cover art have to be stuck in the past? This particular cover isn't overly modern, but not too period in appearance.I saw the cover, thought it was a beautiful fit for Jane Eyre and had to have it. Now I will concentrate on enjoying re-reading this classic over and over again."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I wanted to read Jane Eyre since a long time but couldn't make myself do it. Firstly, because I find classics really difficult to read. Secondly, it's too long. The 490 pages copy I have has very small font and everything is kind of crowded with the next chapter starting on the same page the previous one ends.So when I picked up the book to read I was expecting a very difficult read. But the first 100 pages were a breeze.*contains spoilers*Jane Eyre is an orphan who is living with her aunt, who is not a very compassionate woman, nor are her cousins. She suffers a lot in that house. Jane is a spirited girl, she believes she should be treated fairly and even knows there is injustice in the way her Aunt and her cousins treat her. She also believes in speaking her mind.The Aunt gets tired of her and sends her to an orphanage school at the age of 10 where she spends the next 8 years of her life.' I loved the life she described in the school. This section I found very similar to Anne of green gables. Not that there was anything similar in their circumstances but I found their natures quite similar.\\"A great deal: you are good to those who are good to you. It is all I ever desire to be. If people were always kind and obedient to those who are cruel and unjust, the wicked people would have it all their own way: they would never feel afraid, and so they would never alter, but would grow worse and worse. When we are struck at without a reason, we should strike back again very hard; I am sure we should--so hard as to teach the person who struck us never to do it again.\\"Jane works for 2 years as a teacher in the same school before she gets bored with the monotony and decides to explore something else. She applies for the post of a governess and gets a letter from Mrs. Fairfax. When Jane reaches there she finds out that Adele, her pupil is Mr. Rochester's ward and Mrs. Fairfax is the housekeeper.Mr. Rochester is the hero of course. As romance builds up, Rochester proposes to her and on the day of their marriage she finds out that he is already married, albeit to a lunatic. She leaves the house the same night without informing anyone and loses touch with him. She builds a life for herself as a village school teacher and in the end returns to find Rochester blind and his wife dead.What I really liked about the book was that the author seemed to talk to the readers directly. She addresses the readers pulling them into the story very quickly.I found the book a little too descriptive and the language, although very beautiful, very tedious a times.At the very end, when Jane learns of Rochester's ill fate from the manager of the Inn, she decides to go and meet him. I was so excited at this point, I could hardly stay still. I wanted to find out what happened instantly. But again, there were so many descriptions of the path and of the house, I was really irritated.I proceeded: at last my way opened, the trees thinned a little; presently I beheld a railing, then the house--scarce, by this dim light, distinguishable from the trees; so dank and green were its decaying walls. Entering a portal, fastened only by a latch, I stood amidst a space of enclosed ground, from which the wood swept away in a semicircle. There were no flowers, no garden-beds; only a broad gravel-walk girdling a grass-plat, and this set in the heavy frame of the forest. The house presented two pointed gables in its front; the windows were latticed and narrow: the front door was narrow too, one step led up to it.I mean hello? At this point I wasn't really interested in reading about whether there were flowers in the path or not. I was way too impatient and I admit I skipped a lot from that chapter.*****end spoiler******And Rochester? I think he spoke too much. At one point I wanted to say, \`Oh stop talking already'. I thought he was selfish and manipulative. I realized that I will love the book more when I read it for the second time. As I already know the story I won't skip anything and I am sure I will appreciate the language even more.Although I loved the book and although it's supposed to be one of the greatest love stories, Pride and Prejudice is still on top of my list. And Darcy is still the yummiest of all the literary heroes."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"These clothbound Penguin classics are even more beautiful in person!

It is no wonder this tale has been dubbed a classic and remains in popular demand today. It is a wonder to be taken back to a time where people actually stood for their morals and what was right, although this lends to the most frustrating element of the story. The plot between Jane and Mr. Rochester, at its core, is one that subsequent love stories of our time try to emulate (dare I say even the Twilight series borrow from Jane Eyre's sorrow, struggle, and passion). As an avid book reader, this one is placed at the top of my list and in my heart!A true must read for all women!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"This book is currently my favorite novel. I suggest it to anyone and everyone. Jane Eyre was always so interesting and absolutely never boring. Each part of the novel was so enjoyable to read because I got to experience Jane's experiences and adventures with her simultaneously. The whole novel was so youthful and vivacious. I always was yearning for more. And the characters in the novel were so complex, yet identical to the complexity that each individual possesses. This novel is definitely a classic that is entertaining and well-written. Bronte exhibits a sense of expertise with her writing. I adored her writing stylistically. All of her words flowed so fluidly, which I think was conducive to my strong liking for this novel. In the end, I think that anyone would really find this book as an incredible read. I STRONGLY suggest that this novel is read immediately!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"The story is the same, but Dame Darcy's gothic illustrations provide a unique perspective on the characters and scenes, making another read through the timeless Bronte novel a must. If you're a Bronte fan, a gothic fan, or simply a fan of the classics, this book won't disappoint."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"It's true this book, Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte, is extremely boring for the first fifty to seventy pages, but the plot line needs that much set up because it is so difficult. Once one has made it past those pages, hold on for the ride of a lifetime because it is a complicated and complete novel. Charlotte Bront&egrave; is an extremely effective writer. Her explicit detail is apparent after the first page. She carries this aspect of writing throughout the novel in describing both her surroundings and the people she meets. Because of her writing style, one learns more about the characters in this novel than in most modern novels, this enhances the enjoyment and knowledge gained from this book. The detail used in this novel helps make it easier to relate to the main character Jane Eyre. Since this book is written in the first person, it is very important that one is able to connect with the main character who is also the narrator.This novel's plot is so complex that one almost never wants to put it down after those first fifty pages. The setup, though boring, is completely necessary to the rest of the novel and the rest of the plot. The most important parts of the plot are often right after a slow spot in the book. I believe this is just to emphasis these points. Included in a way such as that is the portion near the beginning where Jane stands up to her aunt who she is living with. This part is the beginning of Jane's strong headed and straightforward attitude, which was very uncharacteristic of a woman at the time this novel was written.Also, the time at Lowood Academy when Jane's friend Helen dies of consumption is one of the points in which the novel starts to slow down and an important item is introduced. Jane goes through many changes in atmosphere throughout the novel, some by choice, some not. This gives us more opportunity to relate to her because throughout our lives we all will have to deal with changes in location, surroundings, and relationships. The ways in which Jane reacts to her changes will in one way or another affect us for the rest of our lives. The plot has many different places where it is so entangled both by Jane's feelings and the actions of the other characters. This is to represent the times in our lives where things seem complicated.It is easy to relate to the main character, Jane Eyre, which makes it a good novel to represent our life and take advice from. This is a classic because it has survived the trials and tribulations of time and is still considered an excellent book to take advice from and to learn about what has happened in the live of people of the past. Each of us can step into Jane's shoes at one point or another and see things as she sees them. It makes one feel connected to the novel and understand what is going on much better than a novel which does not have the first person interpretation and emotions in it. Because the narrator is a young girl growing up it is harder for males, such as me, to relate to portions of the novel, though it is just as easy to relate to other portions. Also, because of the difference in time periods, it is harder to relate to exact problems, though the problems can be generalized so as to be more relevant.Overall, this novel is a great work in which many people can receive hours of enjoyment and thought. I would recommend this novel to anyone who is thought to be \\"mature\\" enough to read it with full comprehension because it is a novel that has bearing on many issues both of the mind and of the world."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"The day after I watched the 1983 BBC Version of Jane Eyre on video, I went to the library and borrowed the book.

Jane Eyre is the perfect example of love emitting from internal thoughts and experiences rather than exterior imagery. One would think the story to be a simple one, but it is so much more than the ordinary love story! Yes, Jane Eyre and Mr Rochester, the wealthy employer, do fall in love. However, it is the dramatic turn in the story that touches the reader most. What does happen in the end to these oh-so-real characters? At times, it seems very unpredictable. The story is worth the time of reading the book. It is unlike any other!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Few people probably need an introduction to this novel, given its popular appeal and long circulation. But some words are needed to explain its importance.At a simple level, the novel is the archetypal 'soap opera'; indeed, one can see virtually every plot found in 'Days of Our Lives' or something similar flowing through this work. But Charlotte Bronte's genius makes this wonderful work so much better than a mere one dimensional soap opera.The protagonist displays a keen intellect, a penetrating psychological understanding of those around her, and amazing powers of description. Whether it is the depressing institution of Lowood, or the passing away of Jane Eyre's childhood friend before her eyes, the scenery, the atmosphere, the emotional power, and the raw beauty of the language shine through.Bronte also makes use of the 'Gothic' element in her novel, particularly in the mysterious, mad wife of Edward Rochester, 'Bertha Mason', a sinister figure who is mad and tries to kill Rochester at every opportunity. The atmosphere in the novel is dark, spooky, and has a strong hint of the supernatural; Eyre's descriptions of the Moon often come into this.The characters themselves (apart from the caricature of Bertha Mason) are also psychologically and morally complex. Eyre pursues her career as a governess and eventually Rochester himself often using dubious means, and Rochester himself is far from a heroic figure. Who is good, or evil? Even the end offers no resolution of this (though Jean Rhys's Wide Sargasso Sea suggests Rochester is the nasty one).Although Gothic romances are not my favorite literary genre, this book is worth recommending simply for the sheer genius of the author.Charlotte Bronte, one of the finest novelists in the 19th century realist tradition,"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"When I first read Jane Eyre, I (and I think many others) was taken in by the odd combination of romance and ominous overtones that makes Jane Eyre such a unique book. Of course, the Victorian-era writing and social commentary also made an impression.But upon reflection, underneath all of this is a story of people with difficult lives learning to find and accept each other and hopefully coming to peace and happiness despite long odds. Maybe my second reading just comes from a twenty-first century mind reading things into a nineteenth century book that just aren't there. But to me, the book does have the feel of a modern story of hardship as well as a Victorian story of people trying to overcome their backgrounds to find love.Jane Eyre tells the life story of an orphaned girl sent away to a harsh boarding school by a cruel aunt. Despite the harsh nature of the school, Jane thrived at the school since she is finally out from her aunt's crushing dislike for her. She graduated and took a job as a governess for a girl in the care of a mysterious man who spent much of his time traveling abroad, Mr. Rochester.At first, the two do not like each other. This is compounded by the fact that Jane thinks she is plain looking and not worthy of his company. But the two develop a peculiar friendship, and there are many signs that their feelings are deeper. But Mr. Rochester is busy courting other ladies at the time. Mr. Rochester also seems to have a secret that he will not divulge to Jane but may have serious consequences for her.Jane's job as a governess and the friendship that develops make it seem that the book will quickly become a Jane Austen book (which of course, would not have been a bad thing) in which the man and woman from different classes find love with one another, but from the point of the friendship blooming, Jane Eyre takes a few remarkable twists and turns that I had not expected and that make for real page-turning.But it is as much the quiet desperation of both Jane and Mr. Rochester and their struggle to find each other despite this that makes Jane Eyre a book truly worth reading and treasuring."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I read this in order to compare it with JENNA STARBORN, and there's no doubt but that this is the true classic with its Gothic overtones and its portrayal of a strong and independent woman in times not supportive of such strength and independence in women.Many will have difficulty with this book, because it's rich in detail and rich in mood. Today's readers may need patience and understanding to enjoy this. If one relaxes and accepts the book as a portrait of the thinking of the era in which it was written, one can relate it with today's society.Basically, this is the story of a woman guided by her inner values. As such, it's not really a book for guys. On the other hand, it tells of a style of life far from that led by today's high school girls, and therefore takes careful reading.It's classic, and if accepted as a Gothic romance that reveals the thinking and attitudes of the time when written, it's a timeless story that speaks to all."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I first listened to this audio version of Jane Eyre -- one of my all-time favorite books -- by checking it out from the library.

And it's all wrapped in the misty, haunting atmosphere of a true gothic story -- madwoman in the attic and all.Jane Eyre was an orphan, abused and neglected first by relatives, then by a boarding school run by a tyrannical, hypocritical minister. But Jane refuses to let anyone shove her down -- even when her saintly best friend dies from the wretched conditions.But many years later, Jane moves on by applying to Thornfield Hall for a governess position, and gets the job. She soon becomes the teacher and friend to the sprightly French girl Adele, but is struck by the dark, almost haunted feeling of her new home.Then she runs into a rather surly horseman -- who turns out to be her employer, Mr. Rochester, a cynical, embittered man who spends little time at Thornfield. They are slowly drawn together into a powerful love, despite their different social stations -- and Rochester's apparent attentions to a shallow, snotty aristocrat who wants his wealth and status.But strange things are happening at Thornfield -- stabbings, fires, and mysterious laughter. Jane and Rochester finally confess their feelings to each other, but their wedding is interrupted when Rochester's dark past comes to light. Jane flees into the arms of long-lost family members, and is offered a new life -- but her love for Rochester is not so easily forgotten...\\"Jane Eyre\\" is one of those books that transcends the labels of genre. Charlotte Bronte spun a haunting gothic romance around her semi-autobiographical heroine and Byronic anti-hero, filling it with brilliant writing and solid plot. It has everything all the other gothic romances of the time had... but Bronte gave it depth and intensity without resorting to melodrama.Bronte wrote in the usual stately prose of the time, but it has a sensual, lush quality, even in the dank early chapters at Lowood. At Thornfield, the book acquires an overhanging atmosphere of foreboding, until the clouds clear near the end. And she wove some tough questions into Jane's perspective -- that of a woman's independence and strength in a man's world, of extreme religion, and of the clash between morals and passion.And Bronte also avoided any tinges of drippy sentimentality (Mrs. Reed dies still spewing venom) while injecting some hauntingly nightmarish moments (\\"She sucked the blood: she said she'd drain my heart\\"). She even manages to include some funny stuff, such as Rochester disguising himself as an old gypsy woman.The story does slow down after the abortive wedding, when Jane flees Thornfield and briefly considers marrying a repressed clergyman who wants to go die preaching in India. It's rather boring to hear the self-consciously saintly St. John prattling about himself, instead of Rochester's barbed wit. But when Jane departs again, the plot speeds up into a nice, mellow little finale.Bronte did a brilliant job of bringing her heroine to life -- as a defiant little girl who is condemned for being \\"passionate,\\" as an independent young lady, and as a woman torn between love and principle. Jane's strong personality and wits overwhelm the basic fact that she's not unusually pretty. And Rochester is a brilliantly sexy Byronic anti-hero with a prickly, mercurial wit.This particular edition is illustrated by Dame Darcy (who looks pretty interesting if the back cover is any indicator), and it's definitely a good supplement to the book -- dark, a little creepy, yet also vaguely quirky in a childlike way.Of Charlotte Bronte's few novels, \\"Jane Eyre\\" is undoubtedly the most brilliant -- passionate, dark and hauntingly eerie.

Charlotte Bronte has a way of writing descriptions of characters and dialogue with humor. It's also nice to read a book and to be able to say it was worth reading. It doesn't have unpleasant surprises or unnecessary details of violence. It doesn't dwell on violence, either. Though Jane has a rather depressing time in her early life, she doesn't dwell on being unhappy (She kind of reminds me of Cinderella).

How many of them do you actually remember? Well, if Jane Eyre was one of those long-forgotten books, pick up a copy. To read it as an adult is a joy: it's a sweeping, disturbing, intense, thrilling, very romantic gothic love story, written in the voice of a very intense, almost claustrophobically self-aware young heroine. Jane is no Ophelia - she's a complicated, remarkable character, and a very strong female character in a genre that usually draws women as beautiful victims at best.There's something for everyone in this book: Windswept castles, difficult and neurotic family members, dark secrets about tragic former lovers, good triumphing over evil, all that good juicy stuff that makes a great romantic story. What elevates Jane Eyre is Bronte's remarkable style & skill and her sharp and complex characterizations.Trust me on this: If you don't remember it from your teens, you should give it a try now. Here is one novel that more than lives up to it's 'classic' status."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I first read \\"Jane Eyre\\" in eighth grade and have read it every few years since. It is one of my favorite novels, and so much more than a gothic romance to me, although that's how I probably would have defined it at age 13. I have always been struck, haunted in a way, by the characters - Jane and Mr. Rochester. They take on new depth every time I meet them...and their's is a love story for the ages.Charlotte Bronte's first published novel, and her most noted work, is a semi-autobiographical coming-of-age story. Jane is plain, poor, alone and unprotected, but due to her fierce independence and strong will she grows and is able to defy society's expectations of her. This is definitely feminist literature, published in 1847, way before the beginning of any feminist movement. Perhaps this is one of the reasons why the novel has had such a wide following since it first came on the market. It is also one of the first gothic romances published and defines the genre.Jane Eyre, who is our narrator, was born into a poor family. Her parents died when she was a small child and the little girl was sent to live with her Uncle and Aunt Reed at Gateshead. Jane's Uncle truly cared for her and showed his affection openly, but Mrs. Reed seemed to hate the orphan, and neglected her while she pampered and spoiled her own children. This unfair treatment emphasized Jane's status as an unwanted outsider. She was often punished harshly. On one occasion her nasty cousin Jack picked a fight with her. Jane tried to defend herself and was locked in the terrifying \\"Red Room\\" as a result. Jane's Uncle Reed had died in this room a little while before, and Mrs. Reed knew how frightened she was of the chamber. Since Jane is the narrator, the reader is given a first-hand impression of the child's feelings, her heightened emotional state at being imprisoned. Indeed, she seems almost like an hysterical child, filled with terror and rage. She repeatedly calls her condition in life \\"unjust\\" and is filled with bitterness. Looking into the mirror Jane sees a distorted image of herself. She views her reflection and sees a \\"strange little figure,\\" or \\"tiny phantom.\\" Jane has not learned yet to subordinate her passions to her reason. Her passions still erupt unchecked. Her isolation in the Red Room is a presentiment of her later isolation from almost every society and community. This powerful, beautifully written scene never fails to move me.Mrs. Reed decided to send Jane away to the Lowood School, a poor institution run by Mr. Brocklehurst, who believed that suffering made grand people. All the children there were neglected, except to receive harsh punishment when any mistake was made. At Lowood, Jane met Helen Burns, a young woman a little older than Jane, who guided her with vision, light and love for the rest of her life. Jane's need for love was so great. It really becomes obvious in this first friendship. Helen later died from fever, in Jane's arms. Her illness and death could have been avoided if more attention had been paid to the youths. Jane stayed at Lowood for ten years, eight as a student and two as a teacher. Tired and depressed by her surroundings, Jane applied for the position of governess and found employment at Thornfield. The mansion is owned by a gentleman named Edward Fairfax Rochester. Her job there was to teach his ward, an adorable little French girl, Adele. Over a long period the moody, inscrutable Rochester confides in Jane and she in him. The two form an unlikely friendship and eventually fall in love. Again, Jane's need for love comes to the fore, as does her passionate nature. She blooms. A dark, gothic figure, Rochester also has a heart filled with the hope of true love and future happiness with Jane. Ironically, he has brought all his misery, past and future, on himself.All is not as it seems at Thornfield. There is a strange, ominous woman servant, Grace Poole, who lives and works in an attic room. She keeps to herself and is rarely seen. From the first, however, Jane has sensed bizarre happenings at night, when everyone is asleep .There are wild cries along with violent attempts on Rochester's life by a seemingly unknown person. Jane wonders why no one investigates Mrs. Poole. Then a strange man visits Thornfield and mysteriously disappears with Mr. Rochester. Late that night Jane is asked to sit with the man while the lord of the house seeks a doctor's help. The man has been seriously wounded and is weak from loss of blood. He leaves by coach, in a sorry state, first thing in the morning. Jane's questions are not answered directly. This visit will have dire consequences on all involved. An explosive secret revealed will destroy all the joyful plans that Jane and Rochester have made. Jane, once more will face poverty and isolation.Charlotte Bronte's heroine Jane Eyre, may not have been graced with beauty or money, but she had a spirit of fire and was filled with integrity and a sense of independence - character traits that never waned in spite of all the oppression she encountered in life. Ms. Bronte brings to the fore in \\"Jane Eyre\\" such issues as: the relations between men and women in the mid-19 century, women's equality, the treatment of children and of women, religious faith and hypocrisy (and the difference between the two), the realization of selfhood, and the nature of love and passion. This is a powerhouse of a novel filled with romance, mystery and passions. It is at once startlingly fresh and a portrait of the times. Ms. Bronte will make your heart beat faster, your pulse race and your eyes fill with tears. The Best!!JANA"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Jane Eyre is about as unprepossessing a heroine as one could hope to find. Not only is she an orphan, she's extremely plain, her manners are stilted, and her relatives hate and bully her. Jane's one chance at freedom is the charity school her aunt sends her to. After buckling down, she finally manages to scrape up enough accomplishments to take on a position as a governess. What she finds as governess, though, is a mysterious manor and its even more mysterious owner, Mr. Rochester, who takes a strange fancy to her. Will Jane find love at last? Or will the secrets she reveals destroy all hope of happiness?\\"Jane Eyre\\" is one of the most well known gothic romance classics, and for good reason. This book enchanted me as a teenager and introduced me to the genre as a whole. A must-read for anyone who likes romance or mysteries. Bella and Edward are pale shadows of Jane and Mr. Rochester."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Don't get me wrong, Jane Eyre is one of my favorite books. However, this version of Jane Eyre has millions of footnotes so you are forced to constantly flip back and forth to see if the footnotes are saying anything useful.When the character Adele is speaking paragraphs of French, they don't bother translating it for you but they will gleefully tell you what's going to happen one-hundred pages later in the book.Reading this version of Jane Eyre is like watching a movie with an over-enthusiatic friend who keeps talking through the whole movie and telling you what's going to happen. If you're going to read Jane Eyre, I would reccomend different version"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"There is so much to be said for this novel that it's difficult to know where to begin. It is a superb evocation of a time and place; it is a complex, detailed character study; it has a believable and compelling plot; and, more than anything else, it is a magnificent love story.Of course, love stories are the common denominator of human existence and have been the subject of literature since mankind first put charcoal to rock, so the fact that Jane Eyre is a love story is nothing terribly significant. No, what makes this novel so special is the thoughtfulness with which its narrator, Jane Eyre herself, documents her love affair. She is extremely intelligent, she carefully analyzes her feelings and actions, and she is scrupulously honest with both herself and her reader. This is what sets it apart: it is the depth of these thoughts and feelings that make the novel interesting. Beyond that, though, it is the character of Jane, slowly revealed, that makes the novel a delight.The plot is Jane's story. Orphaned, she is sent to live with her cruel aunt and cousins. At the age of ten she is sent away for good to a charity school, at which she gets her education, but which is run in such a miserly fashion that many of the students there actually die of disease and starvation. Jane survives, and at the age of eighteen, is able to secure a position as a governess to a child in a great house of England: Thornfield Hall. It is owned by Edward Rochester, the man who will become the centerpiece of her life.How the two begin to slowly realize their affection for one another, how they then cautiously begin to act on their feelings, and how they must then surmount the obstacles in their path--both societal and self-inflicted--are what make up the bulk of the novel. There are at least a few surprises along the way. The strong-willed Jane's moral code requires that she respond to these difficulties in certain ways. It is to the novel's and the author's great credit that these decisions are never simply made; Jane agonizes over them in heart-wrenching fashion. As in life, the standards one chooses to live by can be difficult to maintain.This defining tension is what drives the novel, but that it is delivered in such a skillful and assured way is what raises it to its lofty status. The dialogue, particularly, is fantastic. It is the stuff of an actor's dream: much of it can be interpreted in several different ways. Jane describes Rochester as being moody and tempestuous, and he often is, but at the same time--particularly after Jane agrees to marry him--he is hilariously wry and bemused. Jane comes across as being earnest and pleading, but she can be very playful and is often flirtatious. As mentioned above, these are deep, achingly human characters.The setting is also very evocative. The English countryside, class system and moral understanding were obviously familiar to those who read the book in Ms. Bronte's day, and probably familiar to many of us in this day and age. Nevertheless, Ms. Bronte took the time to document these things carefully. The descriptions of Rochester's home, the lanes in front if it and its orchards and fields; the destitute and grimly cold school for girls; and the small country town where Jane makes the acquaintance of a small group of benefactors towards the end of the novel are all a testament to life as it existed at this distant time and age.The novel is looked upon as a classic and should be. Ms. Bronte not only created a beautiful piece having to do with the nature of love--personal to her but universal in nature--but did so in such a spectacular way that she actually makes the reader feel this love, both for her creation, and for her."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"This turned out to be an exceptional book though I didn't think so in the beginning. By what seems the hundredth page, I had decided it was a feminine version of David Copperfield but not as interesting. By the hundred and fiftieth page, I was completely discouraged and was sure it had turned into the very romantic mush I detest (a lot of what she feels about him and what he feels about her, and so on). Somewhere soon after that, I fell in and was absorbed. It became a tremendously good book with a fantastic plot and a good pace. I read for hours and hours at a sitting enjoying every single minute of it and only stopped when something absolutely forced me. Excellent, excellent!Jane Eyre is an orphaned child under the guardianship of her maternal aunt. Not liked by her aunt and not able to get along with her cousins, Jane is sent to Lowood School for the children of the poor (it is a charity school) to be taught the fundamentals and, more importantly, to be conditioned for a life of poor expectations. Lowood changes the strong willed, impetuous Jane into a woman of uncommon restraint. When she accepts a post as governess to Adele at Thornfield Hall, she attracts the attention of Mr. Rochester, the master of the house, who has the desire to reclaim himself from a sordid past. He comes to believe that Jane has the power to transform him and help him to realize himself in the better light that he has not heretofore been able to achieve on his own. But his secrets are not far away and peculiar events at Thornfield make the reader question his advances. Sworn not to ask about who or what is in the room on the third floor, Jane's iron resolve begins to falter with the dreamlike romance and the reader begins to trepiditiously hope for her happiness. When Mr. Rochester is unable to keep his past under wraps, however, Jane is forced onto a path that will require all of her internal resources to survive but will ultimately put her in the position to make choices for herself rather than just choose among available options. The question is, with her conditioning, can she lead with her heart instead of her head?My only legitimate greivance, and given only in the vein of humour, is that is seems like Jane would have taught Adele some English. The child speaks only in French and myself not being able to read French, I did not understand anything the child ever said. Luckily, her exuberance and intent still comes through and the reader can develop a softness for the child without understanding her dialogue."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I will agree that this performance is given with sensitivity to the voice of Jane Eyre and of Charlotte Bronte, but alas it's an abridged version. The above listing does not give any indication of this, consequently I was very disappointed when it arrived. I personally have no use for abridged books. When I pick up a book (print or audio) I want to experience the entire book. Abridged books always leave me feeling cheated, wondering what did I miss?"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I first read this book when I was ten and reread it every decade as a special treat to myself. It is one of the great classics of English literature. It is, essentially, a Cinderella story, and I STRONGLY recommend it as an andidote to the Woman-Hear-Me-Roar (or is it &quot;Girl Power&quot;?) stuff being pushed on young ladies nowadays as a means to making the sex strong. The story begins when the heroine, Jane Eyre, is a young orphan of about nine, and follows her through school and her career as a governess in a wealthy but mysterious man's home. She falls in love, learns of an impediment to her immediate gratification, does the right thing and suffers for her pains, but in the end is rewarded for her suffering. Very irrelevant to the late twentieth century, obviously. Charlotte Bronte (the author) is frquently encountered around the same time in life one encounters Dickens--youth--but, like Dickens, she most definitely wrote for adults. Therefore, the book is probably a difficult read for all but the most tenacious middle schooler, but as it begins from the very real, very painful point of view of a powerless child, it has a good hook to draw in the young reader. Its literary style is Romantic, with the liberal use of semi-colons, inverted sentences, and detailed descriptions. This book is a MUST for all well-educated young ladies--the next step after Little Women and before the Jane Austen novels. And sorry for the gender stereotyping; I'm sure there are boys and men out there who read this book and loved it, but I never met one."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I recently saw a preview for a Jane Eyre movie soon to come out... and after having just gotten a Kindle, I thought I would read the book before I see the movie. A wonderful bonus... when I went to download it, it was free!Don't let the title of my review discourage you from reading it... This is a wonderful story--- more about overcoming horrible tribulations and finding peace and love through perseverance.The first page or two kind of threw me, as this novel was written in the mid 1800's. I was worried the language would make it too difficult to comprehend, but I was wrong. By the third page I was hooked, and hardly put it down the next 3 days until I finished it. This book grabs you from the beginning and doesn't let you go, even after you've finished it. It is definitely one of those novels that leaves you wanting more of these people. It is so well written, you feel submersed into their world-- and can picture every detail with great clarity, and feel every emotion.My only regret with this book is that I never read it till now.

I thought this movie tie-in edition would be worth picking up, since it's suppose to have a ton of extras including the story behind the story, John Maynard on Jane's sexual awakening, John G. Peters on Jane's otherness etc(Which I found listed in the table of contents on bn.com). The extras and the nice cover were my only reasons for buying it, seeing as I already own a copy of the Barnes & Noble classics version of the book.Now to my surprise and disappointment all the extras that I looked forward to reading seemed to be jam packed into two pages and not really all that interesting.But there is hope,if you buy the ebook version you get a copy of the screenplay by Moira Buffini(Which is why it gets 4 stars). In my opinion after reading the screenplay it is worth the $6.36 and a nice treat for those of us who are impatiently awaiting the release for this bold new vision on Jane."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"This book stinks.

It is a bit old fashioned, which adds to its charm."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"No one reads JANE EYRE for the plot or for the fine sense of irony that her sister Emily Bronte showed. They do read Charlotte Bronte for how she overcomes an admitted use of heavy-handed Gothic romanticism that includes all the traditional trappings of gloomy castles, Byronic satanic heroes, crazed prisoners, and even a shrieking telepathic message. If JANE EYRE had no more than these Gothic trappings, then it is not likely that I, or anyone else for that matter, would be discussing its literary merits. What sets Jane EYRE apart for its earlier and more heavy-handed predecessors was a sense of palpable realism that rings true with events that harken back to Charlotte Bronte's life that ran parallel with that of Jane Eyre's. This realism stems from experiences that Charlotte had in a school that was perilously close to Dickens' school in NICHOLAS NICKLEBY and Jane's school in Lowood. Further, the mistreatment that Jane underwent at Gateshead Hall must have originated from similar such savageries in her early youth. It is a tribute to Charlotte Bronte's realism that she could make her readers feel the pathos and sentimentalism of an outraged childhood.When we first see Jane as a child in the opening pages, we see her as one who is orphaned and left to the not so tender mercies of an aunt who for want of a better term is just plain mean. Jane is made to feel like an outcast by the very ones, who because of their consanguinity should have blessed her with love and affection. As she matures, she is at first pictured as one who must balance precariously between being an obnoxious little brat and one who deserves our sympathy for her state. In the school to which she is sent, first as a student then a teacher, Jane is seen in terms of such purely perceived sensibility that we do not doubt for a moment her own reality, even if we doubt the validity of her external reality. It is this successful ability to create a sharply defined subjective heroine that paves the way for us to equally accept the existence and credibility of the wild, moody, and totally Byronic Rochester. We do not see him as what he truly is: a flat character whose only purpose in the novel is to dash about on a horse and hide crazy women in his dank castle. We see him as Jane does; that is as Charlotte Bronte does, as a real life man from her own days of fantasizing about a teacher who was, to Charlotte at least, the very personification of manliness and virility.Charlotte Bronte also included a number of sociological subtexts that probably ring just as much true today as they did in her day. She presents in chilling detail the child abuse that was rampant simply because not enough people took the trouble to take notice and petition the government for redress. She addresses the male patriarchal attitude that did not allow a young woman to make her way alone in the world except in the accepted role of governess. She also exposes the unwanted issue of what to do about the rights of the mentally ill. As we read JANY EYRE today, we notice the melodrama and the sociological subtexts, but we do not pay them much attention, which is probably just as well. Instead, what we take away from JANE EYRE is the ability of Charlotte Bronte to make us feel the pain of a cruel world, even if we, or Jane herself, can do little about it except to remain as human as we can."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Jane Eyre is a powerful story of struggle and of love. Jane lives a difficult early life, and struggles to find a place just right for her to settle down. She starts out living with an emotionally abusive aunt and cousins who do not understand her. From there she is shipped to boarding school, where she is a student and later becomes a teacher. Here she is always hungry, and living conditions are not the best. Jane then becomes a governess for a little girl in a home called Thornfield Hall. It is here where she begins a somewhat strange and unconventional relationship with the master of her house, Mr. Rochester. The love that develops between them goes against all of the conventions of their time, and is almost lost. The last part of the book is beautiful and well fitting with the rest of the story.Charlotte Bronte uses amazing, flowing language that in itself makes the book terrific. Her story is full of a wide range of emotions. It is not a difficult read, but really gets your mind thinking. This is a classic, timeless novel that will have people engaged for ages. Have your pen ready to mark some of Bronte's beautiful passages that will be unforgettable!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"This summer, as I was searching for a free-choice book to read, I stumbled upon Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte. I chose this book because I was curious to see if it was anything like Wuthering Heights (a book I rather enjoyed) writen by the other Bronte sister.Jane Eyre is a conflicted love story. It follows the life of, surprisingly, a woman named Jane. She lives a harsh childhood, first in the hands of an unloving aunt and her abusive son and then later in the confines of the deteriorating Lowood school. She resides at the school for 8 years and realizes that she wants to experience more of the world outside of the Lowood school. Jane then works as a nanny at a place called Thornfield where she falls in love with her master, Mr. Rochester.This love story is complicated and conflicted in that the love between Mr. Rochester and Jane is forbidden on more than one level.Jane Eyre was much more than I had expected. Although I enjoyed Wuthering Heights, I found Jane Eyre to be much more engaging. At many times, while reading this novel, I found myself completely frustrated yet intrigued and eager to continue at the same time. Bronte evokes such emotion in this novel, from the harsh realities of Jane's childhood to the whirlwind romance between her and her master. I found Mr. Rochester's courtship of Jane to be the most entertaining. I found Jane's confusion and reluctance to be frustrating, yet thought-provoking. And I found the separation of the two to be vexing and upsetting. Ironically, I found the ending to be strange, yet fitting in a story of constant ups and downs. It was an overall great read!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I never thought myself the type to write a review for a book, but Jane Eyre presents itself as an exception.

I was 11 when I read Jane Eyre for a school book report of our choosing and was the first \\"real\\" book I ever read. It is the book that changed my gaze from the television screen to the written page. To this day, I prefer a book over a TV show any day, and I am 19.

I figured, oh just another boring book. WOW! was I completely mistaken. ALthough long, Jane Eyre could have been 1,000 pages and I still would have read every page, with joy. The growth Jane Eyre, the novels main character and Protagonist, goes through throughout the novel is amazing. Born into an unloving world, with rejection and anger at every corner, Jane is forced to keep herself company and therefore, her only friend is herself. Adopted by her uncle, who soon dies, Jane is forced to live with her aunt Reed. I dont want to summarize about all this stuff, I am going to get down to the nitty-gritty. The novel mainly centers around Jane and her love for Rochester. When Jane becomes eighteen, she is hired to govern at the mansion of Rochesters, and to guide and teach his daughter, Adele. The marvelous love story between Jane and Rochester is as intense as anything you will ever read. At times while reading the novel, I would have to put the novel down and take in what I was reading. The passion and heart exhibited by these two characters was at times unbearable. If you want to read a true novel, full of power and emotion, read Jane Eyre- the best novel ever written. :-)"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I chose to read this novel over my spring break and it turned out that reading it was about the only thing I could do. Upon picking up the gargantuan book I was a bit wary of the read, but after reading the first paragraph I was enchanted and further lured on. Bronte did a wonderful - no - fascinating job of creating such a strong, honest, and demanding character as Jane Eyre. Even as an orphaned child, in the care of her abhored aunt Reed, Jane displays such an immense amount of passion and creativity. These characteristics are further refined and blended with a touch of integrity as Jane suffers through the ill-treatment and neglect that she receives at Lowood, a charity school that Mrs. Reed sends her to so to be corrected of her faults. After having spent nearly eight years enduring the ghastly conditions of Lowood, Jane leaves her old life behind so to fill the position of governess at Thornfield Hall. During here stay at the mansion, she is confronted by something she has been completely ignorant of before - love. Her dark and strong, though not handsome, master, Mr. Rochester, causes a hearty seed to implant itself within the unmoving foundation of her soul. This seed of love flourishes and intertwines Jane's emotion's with those of beloved Mr. Rochester. Though love is said to withstand and conquer all, a mysterious and horrifying obstacle challenges the bond that has developed between Jane and Mr.Rochester. As the battle is carried out, Jane's soul and destiny are both tried and tested, thus forming a truly moving and unforgetable novel. Charlotte Bronte's writing is one of intense passion - not just the violent emotion of love, but that of faithfulness and devotion to ones' self and to others. As you travel from page to page of Jane Eyre's life, you will be forced to take into consideration your own character and moral values. Although it was a rather extented read, I do not regret for one moment the time I spent indulging myself in this enticing piece of profound literature. I sincerely believe that all who take on the task of reading this novel will benefit by it in one aspect of their life or another."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"It's hard to imagine a better gothic romance than \\"Jane Eyre\\" -- gloomy vast houses, mysterious secrets, and a brooding haunted man with a dark past.In fact, Charlotte Bronte's classic novel has pretty much everything going for it -- beautiful settings, a passionate romance tempered by iron-clad morals, and a heroine whose poverty and lack of beauty only let her brains and courage shine brighter. And it's all wrapped in the misty, haunting atmosphere of a true gothic story -- madwoman in the attic and all.Jane Eyre was an orphan, abused and neglected first by relatives, then by a boarding school run by a tyrannical, hypocritical minister. But Jane refuses to let anyone shove her down -- even when her saintly best friend dies from the wretched conditions.But many years later, Jane moves on by applying to Thornfield Hall for a governess position, and gets the job. She soon becomes the teacher and friend to the sprightly French girl Adele, but is struck by the dark, almost haunted feeling of her new home.Then she runs into a rather surly horseman -- who turns out to be her employer, Mr. Rochester, a cynical, embittered man who spends little time at Thornfield. They are slowly drawn together into a powerful love, despite their different social stations -- and Rochester's apparent attentions to a shallow, snotty aristocrat who wants his wealth and status.But strange things are happening at Thornfield -- stabbings, fires, and mysterious laughter. Jane and Rochester finally confess their feelings to each other, but their wedding is interrupted when Rochester's dark past comes to light. Jane flees into the arms of long-lost family members, and is offered a new life -- but her love for Rochester is not so easily forgotten...\\"Jane Eyre\\" is one of those books that transcends the labels of genre. Charlotte Bronte spun a haunting gothic romance around her semi-autobiographical heroine and Byronic anti-hero, filling it with brilliant writing and solid plot. It has everything all the other gothic romances of the time had... but Bronte gave it depth and intensity without resorting to melodrama.Bronte wrote in the usual stately prose of the time, but it has a sensual, lush quality, even in the dank early chapters at Lowood. At Thornfield, the book acquires an overhanging atmosphere of foreboding, until the clouds clear near the end. And she wove some tough questions into Jane's perspective -- that of a woman's independence and strength in a man's world, of extreme religion, and of the clash between morals and passion.And Bronte also avoided any tinges of drippy sentimentality (Mrs. Reed dies still spewing venom) while injecting some hauntingly nightmarish moments (\\"She sucked the blood: she said she'd drain my heart\\"). She even manages to include some funny stuff, such as Rochester disguising himself as an old gypsy woman.The story does slow down after the abortive wedding, when Jane flees Thornfield and briefly considers marrying a repressed clergyman who wants to go die preaching in India. It's rather boring to hear the self-consciously saintly St. John prattling about himself, instead of Rochester's barbed wit. But when Jane departs again, the plot speeds up into a nice, mellow little finale.Bronte did a brilliant job of bringing her heroine to life -- as a defiant little girl who is condemned for being \\"passionate,\\" as an independent young lady, and as a woman torn between love and principle. Jane's strong personality and wits overwhelm the basic fact that she's not unusually pretty. And Rochester is a brilliantly sexy Byronic anti-hero with a prickly, mercurial wit.Of Charlotte Bronte's few novels, \\"Jane Eyre\\" is undoubtedly the most brilliant -- passionate, dark and hauntingly eerie. Definitely a must-read."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I cringe as I read the reviews here that were written by children who were forced to read this in school. I can imagine feeling similarly if I had to trudge through this very long, mature novel with its outdated language and flowery descriptions as a teenager. However, as an adult, I loved the book. I do think it is overly long and could have done without some of the passages that describe the scenery. The best parts of this book are in Jane's elaborate, vivid thoughts and her interactions with the various people she meets. In a book that is less good, I would've taken away a star for the excessive scenic descriptions, but the best things about this book make up for that.Since there are already hundreds of reviews up here that go into what the story is about, I won't bother. What I will say is I am not generally a sentimental nor easily moved person, but I found this story very moving. I don't know if I'd recommend it to many men, and I'd probably not recommend it to anyone under 24. As an adult woman who spends much of her time lost in thought and doesn't always follow the most obvious path, I found it to be an excellent, engaging, and emotional read and am very glad I stuck with it until the end."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"There are many excellent books written about the human heart, but few writers master the artistry needed to combine both thought and dialog into a free flowing story that, filled with mystery and torment, capture the imagination as does Charlotte Bronte's tale of love and desire struggling upstream against the elements of life station, society's pressure, and mistakes made in youth that never lie in peace no matter how much time passes.Such is the novel Jane Eyre. I knew it was a Classic, and acknowledged it; I had seen several versions of the movies made of it, but did not recall having ever read the book as an adult. Written in 1847, it seemed something to watch on film, but not explore in the written word, as many such novels are difficult to read. Nothing could have been farther from the truth, and I was given an extraordinary literary experience once again by chance. It is particularly interesting given that this book was written by a woman at a time when license was thin; she managed not only to pull it off, but gave up nothing in the process while taking the reader to the smoldering destiny of what she intended to deliver.Jane Eyre is a hauntingly beautiful tale of a plain but highly mature and intelligent girl, shunned and unwanted by her family in her youth, much like the fairy tale of Cinderella. The reason for this travesty is finally delivered in the epilogue, yet it's integral importance yields completely to the unlikely romance that she finds as a result of it.She, frightened and alone but possessed of a courage and confidence that she will somehow prevail against her odds, is arranged a position as a governess for a mysterious, often absent gentleman of means who needs a tutor for his little girl. Upon arriving, she immediately senses there is a sinister intrigue surrounding the big house and it's inhabitants, but is too conscious of her place to be too inquisitive; beyond that, her sense of honor and integrity prevents any covert investigation on her part. But it is a place to flee from on occasion, and one night she leaves to send a letter out in the next town, which is a long walk through a dusky, cold winter's evening. There, on a lonely bridle path, she unwittingly meets the owner of the Estate, Edward Rochester - as he returns homeward, although in no glamorous way to be sure, as he has fallen off his horse and sprained his leg, all within her immediate vision. She come to his aid, helps him to his feet; and the first of the fateful encounters between a world-weary yet vital man and a much younger, guileless, yet very capable woman has come to be.The author waxes splendid in her descriptive paragraphs of the countryside and surroundings; of the morning mist shrouding the walks under the cherry trees in the old gardens surrounding the mansion; of moonlight shining in windows at night adding visuals as if by magic. But that's the periphery; the undercurrent of something else is running dark and deep. There is a secret hidden on the upper story, one that is closely guarded, yet threatens to expose itself continually, with the potential to destroy not only Mr. Rochester himself, but any chance for happiness he may decide to take.Rochester senses something out of the ordinary in the governess he has inherited by chance to educate and care for his child. The flighty little girl is the irritating and very tangible link to his past that brings him continual reminders of his \\"error\\" - yet has somehow been the vessel that brings about his emotional emancipation - through the hiring of Jane. And as Jane becomes acquainted with her benefactor, she realizes that despite his eccentricities, he is above other men in many, many ways, for even in her protected environment she has noticed his encouragement of equality for her; encouragement to speak her mind and reveal her thoughts to him. She is reluctant to do so, because she is wary of the differences in station between them, and realizes he has ultimate and enduring power over her. He cleverly attempts to seek out and determine ahead of time each of his moves toward his desires so that he may emerge to the next level unscathed.The idea flow is exquisite; articulate without a misstep anywhere in connecting her intricate plot with the characters and the moments that filter unerringly down to create the mood and the sensuality between the two unlikely lovers that are caught up in the vortex. The night the Gypsy arrives unbidden to the big house is a perfect example.The scene Jane endures with the \\"gypsy\\" in the parlor is truly one of a kind; I don't believe I have ever read anything quite it's equal for astonishing originality. The depth of emotional insight, passion, and fear of rejection and/or discovery is intensely woven into this particular part of the story in an unforgettable exchange of dialog and mental dueling; a subtle, ingenious breaking of barriers, of discovery without risk.Turn charlotte Bronte loose with word software on a computer with the literary license of today and one can't help but wonder just what form it would have taken. For certain though, it could not have been more masterfully written than was the \\"original.\\""},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I've seen meritorious film adaptations of JANE EYRE but never got around to actually reading the book until now. What I found was a strong-willed story that moves like a high-speed freight-train even in some long-winded passages. In the tradition of the best 19th century English fiction, the book possesses a sharp social eye, tinkers with narrative technique for great effect, endows settings with a character all their own, and deploys verbal and dramatic irony with abandon. It tells a whopper of a romance between two extraordinary people from the perspective of the title character, who survives every kind of hardship life has to throw her way but who never loses herself, even when she falls for Mr. Wrong-and-Right-at-the-same-time.This book must have knocked the socks off early Victorian England. Our heroine goes to great lengths to establish that she and Mr. Wrong/Right do not conform to the beauty standards of their world, and yet they are most attractive characters. Jane insists on being the captain of her fate, no subserviance to men, not even the one she loves. Mr. Wrong/Right who is no angel is still sympathetic. Probably the most startling theme Bronte sounds countermands her generation's zeigeist: don't marry for money, security and respectability, go for the soulmate no matter the cost. This is pretty bold stuff for the daughter of a clergyman.I won't get into the plot because the danger of spoilers lies in every twist. I will say that one of its climatic points bequeathed me a nightmare, such is the writer's spell. The film adaptations by their very nature cannot convey the written voice and by necessity they must conflate some characters and events to accommodate the flow of action. Watch the Orson Welles or the recent PBS version, both of which are nifty, but don't substitute them for the book, especially if you have to write a book report or pass a test on it."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I love how Jane is a character that I could relate to.

Some may compare that kind of behavior with today's much more open and free male/fremale relations and not understand the impediments to verbal and physical demonstration of your love back in those days. However, I think that added so deliciously to the sexual tension.Mostly, I find this to be about a particular female who has an incredibly admirable personality. Independent, clever, modest yet feisty, she sets a great example for true feminism to come. We need to pay attention to the hardships she faced, and the ways in which she handled them. It sets an example for us to be better people and to face our own modern day challenges with ethics and fortitude.The characters were clearly delineated and we would have no trouble identifying them if they were to come to life. Bronte handled the English language in a most eloquent fashion, which I enjoyed very much. It is fascinating to see how a language grows and changes over time. It reflects the society it is expressing information about.

I do remember reading Wuthering Heights ~~ but that was in college. Jane Eyre is much more romantic than Wuthering Heights ~~ it is a Cinderella Tale with a happy ending too!Jane was orphaned at a very young age and was raised by a cold-hearted aunt and terrible cousins before being shipped off to an institution. Jane makes the best of her lowly lot in life and decided to take a chance of living life to the fullest by taking a governess job for Mr. Rochester. Little does she know how much life would change because of that decision!The trials and tribulations that beset Jane are those that every woman can identify with. The joy and fear of falling in love with Mr. Rochester (Edward) is inspiring. The tragic secret that Edward failed to disclose to Jane ~~ sending her away is so sad. Jane finds herself again in a town many miles away from her beloved ~~ and finds her family after all these years. Only the unrequited love for Edward was the mar on the beautiful paradise she has found. She does find love again and grows into this splendid woman who is strong and independent ~~ and yet, still very feminine.I strongly believe that everyone should read this classic as Charlotte Bronte wrote a thought-provoking novel filled with description and conversations. It is a moral book ~~ designed to make the reader think of what is right and what is wrong. Jane stood up for her belief at the cost of her love ~~ though it was one of the hardest decisions she has ever had to make. And love finds her again.This is a book that makes you believe that if you have faith, things will come right and true for you. Even if it wasn't already a classic, it should be. How many books have withstood the test of time? This one is a golden treasure to add to your library!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"The free Kindle version is fine if you aren't reading the book for study purposes and if you know a tiny hint of French. In fact, I'm of the opinion that reading 160+ year old books on Kindle has the distinct advantage of access to the built-in English dictionary. You can look up archaic words immediately without losing your page, thanks to the 'back' button. I didn't mind the fact that there were no page breaks between chapters as one previous reviewer did. In fact the novel was so gripping and compelling that the very fact that there were even chapters to break it up left me feeling somewhat impatient!The reason I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 probably has more to do with Kindle books in general rather than this book in particular. It reads as easily as any other book I've read on Kindle. But it's the kind of novel where you want to flip back to a certain section and re-read a portion just because of what is currently being said by the characters, and there is no way to do that. As for the French passages I had mentioned earlier, they are really very few in number and even if you don't know any French, don't let it stop you from reading this novel. They're all things said by one character or another, often repeated in English. (Thank you, Charlotte Bront)! None of it is important to the plot or to the characters themselves.Charlotte Bront shows herself to be an incredibly masterful writer in \\"Jane Eyre.\\" There were times when I just stopped to admire the style with which she conveyed something and the techniques she used. She is also incredibly insightful into human nature. The main character is an introverted person and all of her thoughts, beautifully laid out, make her into one of the most compelling characters in literature. Although it may be difficult to see this, I do think that the author was showing her feminist colors, such as they were in those days, when she conjured up Jane Eyre.Thanks for making these classic books available for free on Kindle!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"As much as I know this is a classic, and I feel a review a tad redundant, I've just read the magnificent Jane Eyre for the first time, and I'm so utterly enamoured, I simply must wax poetic about it a while!Where to start. I've just finished reading Charlotte Bront's Gothic masterpiece for the first time, and I feel a mixture of breathless and speechless.Chronicling the life of the orphaned Jane Eyre, the novel begins with a truly upsetting account of what can only be called horrific child abuse. We encounter Jane as she strikes back at her childhood tormentor--her cousin John--for the first time, after quietly enduring teasing, beating, and the hatred of her only family (her dead uncle's wife, and her 3 cousins) for the whole of her short 10 years. As punishment, she is confined to the 'Red Room', the room in which her uncle died. As the sun sets, and she's left in darkness, the terrified child has a panic attack, and her aunt advantageously uses the event to have Jane sent away to Lowood School--a change of scene to save her nerves.We watch Jane grow into a passionate young woman, develop self-respect, a distaste for injustice, and her own strong sense of right and wrong. After completing her education, and working two years at Lowood as a teacher, Jane hungers for a new situation in life, so advertises in the paper, and is invited to take up a post as governess for a child, at a wealthy, private residence. Here we experience part spooky mystery, part love story, and see the world of Thornfield Manor through fiery and fascinating Jane's eyes.Jane Eyre is many things--a journey of self discovery, a love story, and a surprisingly progressive tale for its day. It holds some strongly feminist ideas, or perhaps more than feminist, ideas about justice, class systems, and equality. It's Jane, a relative 'commoner' who shows more backbone and self-respect than many of her high-bred 'superiors'. Social standing, graces, and superficial manners all come second to intelligence, self-respect, actually having character, and one's own mind.It's mentioned--and constantly reiterated that neither Jane, nor her suitor, are physically much to look at. The idea of true beauty coming from within, and beauty being in the eye of the beholder is another strong theme here. Jane as a character is in strong contrast with others, such as the beautiful, yet shallow and capricious Georgiana Reed, or cruel and superficial Blanche Ingram. Where these women are admired in the highest regard in their upper class society, despite their lack of character, Jane is despised, but she is the better human being. I love that she KNOWS it, also.We're also presented with a wonderful array of unique and colourful characters, very few of whom seem black and white. Rochester, most obviously, struggling to justify his actions before God and society, every bit as much as to his own self; wanting to be good, wanting to be a better man, but really--let's be honest--failing. He's resigned to the fact he can't be better without outside influence. We have a role reversal here: rather than our male hero being a knight in shining armour to a damsel in distress, Rochester views Jane as his saviour. Then characters like Bessie: sweet, but with a temper that will turn as quickly as the wind. She's neither good, nor bad. The adorable, but admittedly vapid, Mademoiselle Ad&egrave;le, and above all Jane, who lives by her own rules and sense of morality, rather than those of society... and really, who's are better, here?. There are still clich&eacute;s here, though. The lunatic wife, the wicked stepmother and stepsisters (In the shape of aunt and cousins)... But at the time, were these clich&eacute;s at the time this was written?Amidst all the romance and wonderful characters, it's easy to forget the wonderful gothic thriller/mystery at the heart of Thornfield, and for anyone new to the story, its heartbreaking conclusion. And the romantic tension between Jane and Rochester? It's as palpable--if not more so--than any modern romance I've read (here's looking at you Twilight), but for once we're dealing with a girl with backbone. This is nothing like a Jane Austen love story. We're not dealing with manners and moving within the bounds of acceptable society--this is unrequited love, people.On an aside, for those who've readA Room of One's Own (Annotated), and Wolfe's criticism of both Charlotte Bront and Jane Eyre, it's interesting to see parallels between the two works: that a woman doesn't need a man to define her; that having one's own means is essential for any woman who wants to create (or maintain an independent mind); that it's the value of human being's heart and mind--not outward appearances--that is what gives them value (I'm thinking about Judith and William Shakespeare, here). Jane is every bit as good as Mrs and the Misses Reeds, the Ingrams, and indeed, a number of the men of this book. She is the intellectual equal of Rochester, and perhaps superior of St John, regardless of her sex.Despite the time since it was written, Jane Eyre is not hard to read. I often struggle with older novel but it's far easier than Dracula, which was an effort for me, though not necessarily a good comparison. It's hugely entertaining, in parts absolutely heartbreaking, and there is a good reason why it remains popular, and a 'classic' over a hundred years later. It's an extraordinary work of fiction, beautifully written, and with just as much to enjoy now as it did when it was first published."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Jane Eyre, a girl of no importance and the daughter of an unapproved match, lives a troubled life for her first ten years under her aunt's roof. Her parents died when she was a baby and she was left as Aunt Reed's charge with no other living relatives that she knew of. When her aunt can no longer stand Jane any more, she sends her to a boarding school where the rules are strict and the headmaster is every bit the tyrant Aunt Reed was. But Jane conquers, becomes a teacher, and then wishes to become a private tutor. After her ad is received and her application accepted, Jane finds herself in the home of a mysterious and strange man, Mr. Rochester, who has put his ward, Adele, under Jane's tutelage. But then Jane finds herself falling deeply in love with Mr. Rochester, who she could not imagine would love her in return. This, and the strange happenings in Thornfield Hall, give Jane cause to doubt her future. And when Mr. Rochester's dark secret reveals itself, Jane must question her love and discover what she must do with her life before she can find the happiness she never had.____________________________________This is one of those \\"Can words describe?\\" books. And while I feel there aren't very many words that do an adequate job, I will try my best.Can you believe that I haven't read this book yet? I can't. For years, people have been telling me, \\"Sierra, you have to read this book.\\" \\"Sierra, this is one of the best books I've ever read.\\" \\"Oh my GOSH! You haven't read Jane Eyre?!\\" \\"What are you waiting for, you, the reader, of all people?\\"So here I am, having read (devoured) the long awaited book that has been loved, cried and giggled over by hordes. And I'm here to tell you people who have not yet read this book - \\"What. In the world. Are. You. Waiting for?!\\" (I know...I'm one to talk...but now I know how everyone else feels! haha!)Throughout the course of the book, I got choked up. But there was too much ahead to slow down, stop, and actually cry. However...when I got to the last chapter, I lost it. Tears came and the two-year-old little boy I was babysitting put down his yogurt and stared at me, head cocked to the side, probably completely confused as to why I was smiling and crying at the same time. After all the heartache and sadness, and even the little bits of joy in between, the happiness of the end just overwhelmed me. It was just too beautiful to not feel that way - there was so much emotion in my heart that I felt it would almost burst.Jane is a character I look up to - I want to be like her. Her decisiveness, her courage, her resolution, her faith...it amazed me, and amazes me still, even after the book has been set back on the shelf. She knew what she had to do and she did it - no matter the cost. And the way she loved everyone so unconditionally - especially Mr. Rochester - continually surprised me. Her kind heart, her gentle but firm manner, and her intense love... Wow. I also loved her close study of human nature and how she described and saw people - why she was intrigued by them.Mr. Rochester himself is quite a character. Going into this story, I was NOT expecting him to be the least like he was - physically ugly and mentally independent. He was strange, but yet so perfect for the story. In all my travels through literature, I've never met a character like him, and I doubt I ever will again. That character will always be embodied by Mr. Rochester alone. I easily fell for him as Jane did; her love for him was pure; she never once judged him for his faults; she loved him all the more for them. The reader cannot help but feeling the same. I loved seeing his pride break down, slowly but surely, and the way he described the experience after. It was just amazing.As far as the story line and the writing... Both were equally magnificent. The story captured me from the first, especially when I expected the novel to begin when she was older. But I loved every bit of it - every second was glorious, and painful and lovely. I cared for Jane so much that it didn't matter what she was doing - I wanted to read about her. And Mr. Rochester and St. John and Adele and everyone else. The writing was incredible, down to the very last word. I loved how she wrote most of the time in past tense, and then sometimes slipped smoothly into present tense, showing the reader exactly what it felt like, to be doing instead of remembering. I'm actually not a huge fan of present tense, but this was so perfect I just couldn't resist liking it.Favorite character: Mr. Rochester because of his originality...and how much I loved his character within the first few pages of his introduction.Favorite aspect: DUH! The love story, of course! Totally intriguing the way it was played out, the intensity of Mr. Rochester's secret hanging over it part of the time, the rest being Jane's own doubts about Mr. Rochester's nature or her sadness over him being engaged to a woman who would not and could not love him - and who he had no passion for either. Oh my gosh this story had me in its clutches and didn't let me go!!!There are no single words to describe this book. Magnificent and heart-pounding and gut-wrenching are about the best I can do. They are true - as true as true can be - but there is something about the book that can only be felt and understood by reading it yourself. It's not anything that can be described - it's an experience. One that I can't wait to relive again and again and again!!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I remember watching the movie as a young girl and how the story never really left me.

Strange....but other than that a truely great read!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"*** This is a review of the Penguin Classic version with Rebecca Solomon's \\"The Governess\\" on the cover, with introduction and notes by Michael Mason ****** SPOILER ALERT ***First, the book. I'd give it 3.5 stars. I think it is a well written autobiography of a poor, plain but fiercely independent girl. You do feel sympathy for that girl and her moral and emotional struggle. However, there are some elements in this book that I do not like:1. The author's constant addressing of the \\"reader\\" is just peculiar. Most part of the book is written in first person voice, but every now and then she felt the urge to pause and remind the \\"reader\\" (thus switching to second person), this rather takes the reader out of the flow of the narrative. I personally do not like this.2. The two main male characters are wholly unlikable, even repulsive. Rochester comes across as a rude, sullen, selfish, deceptive and manipulative character. On the last point, I am referring to the episode of him, in order to arouse Jane's jealousy, pretending to have fallen in love with another prettier girl. And of course much can be said about his deceptiveness and selfishness. It is indeed hard to understand why Jane would fall for this guy, except that he is really the very first male person she encounters in the real world. As to St. John Rivers, he is simply a religious nutcase, all he talks about is his missionary work, showing no human compassion to even his own sisters. Yet, although Jane eventually rejects him, the author pains him in a saintly aura.3. The constant references to scripture is really irksome.Nonetheless, I do think the personality of the main character is believable and depicted vividly, that's why I would give it 3.5 stars (good but not great).Now on the introduction and notes by Michael Mason, I think they are atrocious. First in the introduction he arrogantly suggests that the general reader cannot \\"get\\" serious literature, only professional critics like him holds the canonical interpretation (I paraphrase). Here's news to Mr. Mason: we have a brain and we can think for ourselves too, thank you very much. But if the introduction is mildly annoying, the notes are just ridiculous. There are chunks of conversation in the book in French, but he never bothers to translate them; however he *constantly* FORWARD-references plot elements. For example, before we find out who Rochester's maniac wife is, he already mentions her name and what she's going to the next day; at another point when Jane had a dream about Thornfield on fire, he says something like \\"considering what happened next, this is so accurate that it is like a 'second vision'\\" (I paraphrase again). This is called \\"RUINING THE BOOK\\", as some other reviewer said (I believe he or she was referring to Mason's notes), this is like an annoying friend constantly telling you what's going to happen next when you watch a movie. This is so frustrating at times I wish Mr. Mason was standing next to me so I can whack him with the book (and shove his \\"canonical view\\" of serious literature down his throat)."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre, the subject of many AP required reading lists, perhaps strikes discontent to those who read the novel in high school. A better appreciation for this classic will probably be gained reading it later in life.Bronte seemed to have modeled the character and conditions of Jane Eyre around her own life, so the novel has some biographical elements. Jane Eyre, after a difficult childhood quite Dickensesque in nature, eventually lands a job as a governess of Thornfield Hall as she approaches adulthood. Jane works here for awhile, and begins to adapt to her new station in life. Her employer, Mr. Rochester, comes and goes from Thornfield, but eventually news comes back that he is to marry the beautiful but snobbish Miss Ingram. As time wears on, however, there is an indication that Rochester marrying Miss Ingram might only be a ruse for him to actually find the secrets of Jane's heart. Jane struggles back and forth between her feelings for Rochester as her employer, and him as a man. Eventually Rochester asks Jane to marry him, but he has some baggage in his past that he is able to keep from Jane until the moment they are to be married. Jane then discovers the truth: Rochester is married to a woman named Bertha, who is insane and resides locked in the basement of Thornfield. Jane knows she cannot marry now, and leaves Thornfield to pursue a new life. Romanticized in nature, events suggest that this is not the end of Rochester and Jane, and that they will cross paths sometime later. How and under what circumstances you discover in the book's second half.One theme Bronte explores is the importance of equality within backgrounds and classes. Jane changes her station by beginning in poverty and living as a governess only to eventually be able to gain a sense of independence. Jane, despite struggles, is often conscientious and fair to others, which is juxtaposed by Miss Ingram and her family, who loathe the site of governesses, thinking them to be unintelligent and worthless.There is also a sense that Jane, although first seeing herself as lower to others, builds self-confidence and understands herself as equal to others, especially Rochester: \\"I was an equal--one with whom I might argue--one whom, if I saw good, I might resist.\\" When she discovers and matures, this gives dimension and depth to her character.Perhaps Jane Eyre has as much to do with illustrating a heroine's ability to be a free thinker, independent, and even a bit brash at points, which could be viewed as atypical of female protagonists during this time. We experience Jane's introspective outlook on all things by the first person narration, and Jane displays a depth to her character, especially when she is skeptical about Rochester's first proposal of marriage, which seems too \\"fairy tale\\" to be true. She doesn't give in because it seems like the proper thing to do, or the easiest. She refuses to marry Rochester earlier in the novel out of principle, and despite his pleas, she sticks to her guns, even though she knows it will be a rough go in life for both her and Rochester.Character depth is illustrated in both Jane and Rochester's change from beginning to end. Rochester has moments of \\"blindness\\" in the novel. First, he is \\"blind\\" to humility and life responsibilities in the first half of the book at Thornfield Hall. Later in the novel, he is physically blind after the tragic accident that leaves Thornfield a ruin, but, has learned a sense of sympathy and humility that he didn't have earlier. Jane also undergoes a transition from her outlook on life: she believes and knows by novel's end that she is equals to her peers.While a bit overly romanticized at points, Bronte's novel has fantastic character development. The scene when Jane battles with her conscience while leaving Thornfield is epically captured by Bronte: \\"He who is taken out to pass through a fair scene to the scaffold, thinks not of the flowers that smile on his road, but of the block and axe-edge..\\" Although Jane feels a sense of tragedy at this moment, she is not afraid to stick to what her intuition tells her is right, and she uses her faith as her instrument to guide her fate.Over all, Bronte captures a powerful and moving story of a \\"plain\\" girl who overcomes difficult moments to find faith and healing in life. I felt that it was a strong story, but tended to drag during Jane's stay at St. John's after leaving Thornfield. The story seems to get \\"stuck in the mud\\", and many moments of Jane's narration become repetitive. However, it doesn't detract from an otherwise powerful, impressive classic."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Jane Eyre is book #6 on theThe Well-Educated Mind's list of must-read novels, and it immediately draws comparison to the two prior selections,Pride and PrejudiceandOliver Twist. Both Pride and Prejudice and Jane Eyre were written by female authors and feature strong female protagonists. Elizabeth Bennett and Jane Eyre are both very feisty and committed to finding romantic love in a time when that wasn't always the basis for marriages. The major difference between the two books, though, is that Pride and Prejudice is far more subtle, with the \\"action\\" taking place largely within the lead character's thoughts and emotions, while a whole lot of exciting, external action happens in Jane Eyre. That's not to say one is better than the other, only that they are different in this way while being somewhat similar in overall theme.Like Oliver Twist, Jane Eyre is an orphan. \\"Luckily\\" for her, though, she wasn't abandoned to a work house but adopted by a well-to-do uncle. I say \\"luckily\\" in quotes because the uncle dies when she's one (this isn't a spoiler, I promise) and she's then left in the care of her hateful aunt, who shows her no love or mercy for the ten years Jane lives with her. Jane is the victim of vicious beatings at the hands of her older cousin John, too. But the difference between her and Oliver Twist is that she fights back -- she's spunky, not just a miserable sad sack like Oliver (I hated that character and the entire book). When her aunt says that Jane is unfit to associate with her cousins, Jane shots back \\"They're unfit to associate with me!\\" When asked by a preacher what she needs to do to avoid going to Hell, Jane says, \\"I must keep in good health, and not die.\\"The level of abuse young Jane suffers is far less onerous than that of Oliver, and therefore more believable. She inhabits a world of realistic characters, not stereotypes. I felt bad for Jane; I just rolled my eyes and said \\"Oh brother\\" whenever Oliver was absurdly mistreated.But Jane doesn't stay a child in the story for long -- soon enough she's an adult young woman with new kinds of problems. And of course, she falls in love... The love-story component of this book is probably the best I've ever read, and there are a few chapters composed solely of dialog between two lovers that are absolutely beautiful to read. This IS, however, an action-oriented story, and the plot is both believable and engaging. The story is well-paced, too: Twice when I felt things were just beginning to get a bit tedious there were abrupt changes of scenery that kept me tuned in. I loved this book! While not quite as good asGulliver's Travelsor Pride and Prejudice, this might just be the third best novel I've ever read."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"i thoroughly enjoyed this book. i must admit they have some pretty BIG words! but it aint nothing a dictionary cant fix. i never did use a dictionary though and i got by well.the story in this book is just amazing! i have NEVER read a book like this before and i have read a lot of books. if u read this book u will not be disappointed!in fact you'll probably want to read it again. after i was through i basically read it again just looking and comparing stuff. its so beautifully written. i've never read any other charlotte bronte books but im planning on it.if u get this book u will definitely enjoy it!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Published in 1847 under the pseudonym Currier Bell, Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre has definitely become a timeless classic. Even now, over 150 years after its debut, Jane Eyre's popularity amongst scholars and avid readers has not wavered. However, nowadays, its use of old language and portrayal of a time long past has made it less appealing to the general public.Jane Eyre, the protagonist of the story, is an orphan cared by her aunt, whose whole family views her as an onerous responsibility pushed upon them at her uncle's deathbed. After a few incidents with her taunting cousins, Jane is shipped off to Lowood, a school run by a hypocritical minister. Despite the hardships she had to endure at Lowood, Jane graduates and eventually leaves Lowood to become a governess. At Thornhill, she meets and falls in love with her master, the cold and mysterious Mr. Rochester. However, when it seems that happiness is finally within reach, Jane discovers Mr. Rochester's dark secret that puts a halt to their relationship. But of course, due to her high morals and strong determination to stick to them, all ends well for Jane and Mr. Rochester.While this piece is a story of finding love and happiness, Bronte utilizes Jane's experiences (which are based partly off her experiences in school and as a governess) to criticize the inferiority with which women were viewed at the time. Although Jane is more educated, well-mannered, and morally superior to her master, her status is still considered far beneath his. The Rivers sisters is also representation of how Bronte feels women should be: poised, knowledgeable, and talented.It is no wonder that Charlotte Bronte is known for her ability to make characters and situations come alive. Bronte's vivid and lively narration makes Jane a loveable and relatable character. Through the details of her narration and the fitting syntax structure, her readers are able to clearly grasp the struggles, decisions, and dilemmas that Jane faces constantly. When Jane fought hunger and the cold at Lowood, when she choose to leave behind her ticket to \\"happiness,\\" when she came into inheritance at the Rivers's home and returned to Thornhill, Bronte took us with her. The imagery is also plenty and a great aid in visualizing the setting, especially the mysterious Thornhill.I thoroughly enjoyed reading Jane Eyre. Maybe it is because I am just a sucker for romances or maybe it is because I generally love historical fiction, but I did not agree with my peers when they said that the story was boring. I admit, the plot does become a bit dragged on at some points, like Jane's time at Lowood and her stay with the Rivers. Overall though, I still say that Jane Eyre is definitely one of my more favorite ones that I read last year.If you don't mind historical fiction and can get your head around the archaic diction, then I highly recommend Jane Eyre. Especially if you are a sucker for romances like me."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I loved the movie but this gave so much more to the story than the movie and a deeper explanation of Rochester's character. I liked the prose better than Bronte's Villette even though I enjoyed that story as well. It was bit easier to read. Too much French in Villette."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I recently saw the movie Jane Eyre and was tempted to read the book. The movie was beautifully done, but did leave out some very important events that were described in the book. Overall it was a bittersweet love story... A tale of burning down walls figuratively and literally; of allowing ones self to accept truth and love regardless of station; and of knowing ones self above all. Though Bronte does get a bit wordy in her writing (I'm more partial to Emily's writing vs. Charlotte) this is a rewarding story of strength of heart and perseverance of the spirit."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I enjoyed the book and would recommend it. It seemed to be based on historical events. It definitely held my interest."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Jane could be any modern woman's friend.

The older I get, the more I like it. A real classic. Everyone should read, or 're-read it."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"The first time I was introduced to this book was in college. Back then, I had the attention span of a gnat, so rather than give Jane Eyre a try, I opted for Cliffs Notes. (Yeah, I know ... sacrilege)Anyway, fast forward to now. I finally read it, and my God, what a beautiful piece of literature! The first part outlining young Jane's struggles had me flipping the pages till one in the morning. Then when she got to Thornfield Hall and Mr. Rochester, the page turning didn't stop till at least 3 A.M. I savored every paragraph, every word. It was like crack to me. lolI was so enthralled with this story that I wrote a post on it when I hadn't even finished reading the book! I'd reached a section that moved me so much I had to write about it because of its beauty. It showed the core of just who Jane was as a heroine. Here's a snippet:WARNING .... SPOILERS.........Last night, I read something that really moved me, so much that I must've re-read it three times. It was an introspective passage that poignantly demonstrated the beauty and complexity of Jane's mind. Oh, how I wish my heroines were this self-aware and confident!In discussing her opinion of Blanche Ingram (the gold-digging skank who Mr. Rochester is using to make Jane jealous), our heroine goes into great detail about why she cannot bring herself to be jealous of Miss Ingram. Jane isn't a character in denial. She's a strong, logical, thoughtful and methodical woman, one who knows her own mind. After reading this passage, I realized that although I was over halfway through the novel, I never really knew Jane until that moment.Anyway, while this may be a long excerpt, it's well-worth the read:---------------------------\\"I have told you, reader, that I had learnt to love Mr. Rochester: I could not unlove him now, merely because I found that he had ceased to notice me-because I might pass hours in his presence, and he would never once turn his eyes in my direction-because I saw all his attentions appropriated by a great lady, who scorned to touch me with the hem of her robes as she passed; who, if ever her dark and imperious eye fell on me by chance, would withdraw it instantly as from an object too mean to merit observation. I could not unlove him, because I felt sure he would soon marry this very lady-because I read daily in her a proud security in his intentions respecting her-because I witnessed hourly in him a style of courtship which, if careless and choosing rather to be sought than to seek, was yet, in its very carelessness, captivating, and in its very pride, irresistible.\\"There was nothing to cool or banish love in these circumstances, though much to create despair. Much too, you will think, reader, to engender jealousy: if a woman, in my position, could presume to be jealous of a woman in Miss Ingram's. But I was not jealous: or very rarely;-the nature of the pain I suffered could not be explained by that word. Miss Ingram was a mark beneath jealousy: she was too inferior to excite the feeling. Pardon the seeming paradox; I mean what I say. She was very showy, but she was not genuine: she had a fine person, many brilliant attainments; but her mind was poor, her heart barren by nature: nothing bloomed spontaneously on that soil; no unforced natural fruit delighted by its freshness. She was not good; she was not original: she used to repeat sounding phrases from books: she never offered, nor had, an opinion of her own. She advocated a high tone of sentiment; but she did not know the sensations of sympathy and pity; tenderness and truth were not in her.\\"Too often she betrayed this, by the undue vent she gave to a spiteful antipathy she had conceived against little Adele: pushing her away with some contumelious epithet if she happened to approach her; sometimes ordering her from the room, and always treating her with coldness and acrimony. Other eyes besides mine watched these manifestations of character-watched them closely, keenly, shrewdly. Yes; the future bridegroom, Mr. Rochester himself, exercised over his intended a ceaseless surveillance; and it was from this sagacity-this guardedness of his-this perfect, clear consciousness of his fair one's defects-this obvious absence of passion in his sentiments towards her, that my ever- torturing pain arose.\\"---------------------------.....Jane's pain came not from any imagined self-deficiency ... because as far as she was concerned, the pretty Miss Ingram was an empty satin dress---not worthy of jealousy or anything else. Least of all Mr. Rochester. Hence Jane's pain. The mere fact that he would go for a vapid boob like Miss Ingram was the root of Jane's torment.Hard to be jealous of someone you feel is intellectually and spiritually beneath both you and the man you love. This is why I love Jane as a heroine! While not a raving beauty, she has a quiet and unshakable confidence that's very appealing. No wonder Mr. Rochester fell for her.Writers, if you want to see how to create a compelling heroine, look no further. The lesson is in this book!Suffice it to say, Jane Eyre is my all time favorite heroine."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I have loved this book every since I first read it back in high school.

Anyone who has ever read it should be able to clearly notice it's underlying message about redemption and second chances. I personally love that Jane is not some beautiful, perfect heroine, but is flawed and considered &#34;plain&#34; by her peers. Her personality and attitude are what entices Mr. Rochester to fall in love with her, not what she looks like. Their love overcomes so many obstacles, it's ridiculous.

Family, love, relationship, friendship, on one hand; and on the other, backstabbing, scheming, rivalry, heartbreaks etc. All such things apparently do not lose their meaning and value over time, unlike technology, social establishments, cultural distinctions and class differentiation, to name but a few. The author masterly describes human nature in its various negative and positive aspects, thus subtly inferring the moral of the story, filled with action, tregady, drama, struggle, romance, affection and ultimate achievement. The main characters, who eventually fall in love through loads of trouble, are heroic in their development, however, realistic, emerging and aspiring, unselfish and memorable; whereas being quite natural modest and sincere since the very beginning.Overall, there is a lot of wisdom and sense in this lovely book. Something for anyone who is truly interested in personal improvement, good manners, real feelings and emotional intelligence, and last but not least, immaculate language and style."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"It was incredible to have access to a novel our children are required to read.

Plus the fact that along with this ability, these old classics are available for free (at least for the most part).(Spoiler alert)I would say that with a few of the old english titles now under my belt, the authors of the time leave a lot to incredibility in order to advance their plots. In the case of Jane Eyre, this came up with a majorly coincidental meeting of a man and a letter in the town of Maderia (or some such spelling). Also, of a rather psychic lament being heard by the story's protagonist. Also of a chance meeting of the protagonist, on the verge of dying of starvation and privations; finding herself on the doorstep of some long lost relatives.Guess they had a lot of faith back then that God's will, will out.

I have to agree- Jane Eyre is my number one of her novels, by far.We all know the story by this point. A governess falls in love with her employer to find out he has a dark secret...dun dun dun! It's very much a Romantic as well as romantic novel. It's very different from anything Jane Austen ever wrote, that's for sure! (Charlotte was not a fan of dear Jane, by the way).The first time I read this book, as a freshman in high school, I didn't get into it until after Jane got to Thornfield. I found the parts with Jane as a child draggy. Now I get sucked into the story right from the beginning. Young Jane is a fiery, passionate creature who's not afraid to speak her mind. Lowood makes her take on a more controlled, reserved front but she never loses her inner passions. I find Jane so strong and still a realistic character- I just love her.It's not a totally perfect book but it's close. It's only little nitpicks that bug me- like all the coincidences. Rochester isn't exactly my favorite character but I totally get the connection and the love between them and on a literary level I do like him. On a personal level, I don't- but it works in a book.

As if to add on to this little personal hell, my teacher made us mark and annotate every single page in this book and I knew that this was going to make me hate this book even more. However, I was pleasantly surprised by this book, I love it! Without a doubt it was my favorite book of the year and I would even consider it the best book of my high school career. As with most novels, it took a bit of time to get into, especially with this book as it is so long. I wouldn't necessarily describe this novel as a \\"quick read\\" but that only adds to the magnificent effect of the novel.

I like watching the movies but reading it is the best."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Jane Eyre is a classical literary work that encompasses a variety of genres from mystery to romance. The novel is told from the perspective of Jane Eyre, a young woman orphaned as a child, who struggles to find her place in the world. Traveling among many occupations, Jane finds herself as a governess and begins to develop feelings for her employer, the rude mannered Mr. Rochester. However, Jane discovers that his country estate holds frightening secrets among a mysterious past.This Gothic romance encompasses many themes that are relevant to society today which not only makes the novel relatable, but also intriguing. The reader becomes wrapped in Bronte's descriptions as the story unfolds and takes unexpected turns and twists. From the beginning, Jane struggles to find those who love and accept her as a human being. Throughout her life Jane is oppressed by others who tell her that she is not good enough and is constantly put down even when she tries to change her situation. She is told that she is too ugly, too poor, and ultimately too powerless to overcome obstacles, but she tries regardless. In every situation presented, Bront touches on relationships with people. As human beings ourselves, we are able to relate to these struggles and the ways which we attempt to survive difficult moments within life.Jane Eyre represents these themes and continues to affect readers even today. This novel presents the emotions and desires of everyday people while also including an exciting, thought provoking plot. Jane Eyre is one of those novels that will travel with you over time. Personally, rereading the book at different points in my life has allowed me to read with a different perspective which I may not have considered before.I would also recommend reading Wide Sargasso Sea if you enjoyed Jane Eyre. This other novel written by Jean Rhys tells the story of Bertha and defends some of the judgments that could be made of Bertha in Jane Eyre. The novel also questions whether Bertha's mental state was altered before even arriving at Rochester's estate.

It is arranged for Jane to be sent to Lowood School, a boarding school fifty miles away. At Lowood, the food is scarce, living conditions are poor, and they have no coats or mittens to keep them warm. Typhus plagues the school, killing Jane's only true friend, Helen. Jane's academics thrive, and after six years she takes the place of a teacher. Two years later Jane places an ad in the Herald, which is answered by a single letter. Jane travels 16 miles to find that she is the new teacher to Edward Rochester's foster child. By the second month she is there, Jane comes to be quite fond of her pupil, Adele Varens, and she is beginning to be aware of how she cares for Mr. Rochester. As she spends more time at Thornfield, Jane's affection for Rochester deepens, as he pursues Blanche Ingram. Jane leaves Thornfield shortly to visit Mrs. Reed, her dying aunt. Mrs. Reed confesses that John Eyre, Jane's uncle has been trying to locate her, but Mrs. Reed discouraged him. She then dies, unloved by even her daughters. Jane returns to Thornfield and is immediately proposed to by Rochester. During their wedding ceremony, Mr. Briggs stands up and proclaims that Mr. Rochester is already married. Jane is then shown to the third floor of Thornfield, where Bertha Mason Rochester, Rochester's wife is locked away. Jane flees Thornfield and uses all her money for transportation. She finds herself reduced to begging and is invited into the home of St. John Rivers, a minister. She recuperates from the trauma in her life under the care of him and his two sisters Mary and Diana. Jane accepts a job as a teacher in a local school. She soon discovers that John Eyre has left her with 20,000 pounds, which she openly shares with St. John and his sisters. St. John proposes to her but Jane repeatedly refuses; she does not love him. In turning down St. John she realizes she is still in love with Rochester. She gets news that Bertha Rochester jumped off the roof and killed herself during a fire that blinded her husband. Jane heads to Ferndean, Rochesters present home, and they reunite and plan to marry. The next time we hear from Jane again is ten years later. Rochester has regained sight in one eye and they have a newborn son. This book ends on a happy note with Jane telling us how contented she is with her present life.I found this book to be extremely thought- provoking. We see the trials and tribulations of a young girl who goes through so many hardships yet comes out a better person each time. I gave this book a five star rating because it expressed the life of a truly amazing young woman in a truly amazing way."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I was shocked to see that many of the people who reveiwed this book gave it one star. It took me two days to read this book. I could'nt put it down! Jane is so down to earth and she refuses to feel sorry for herself, and do what she wanted to do the light of what others would suffer if she did. Her devoted love to Rochester was touching. When she discovered his sad secret, she did not follow her own fleshly desires, but left for the good of her lover, heartbroken, yet triuphant in knowing that she'd done what was right. Charlotte Bronte book is the best I've ever or ever will read. Those who rate this book 1 star need to reread it.:)"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I am a young teen and although I have not lived long I have read some particularly muture books. When I decided to read Jane Eyre I thought it would be like all the others who have the same basic plot with immoral characters that make the same selfish decisions. But, I soon found out that I was wrong. Jane Eyre will awaken your senses and will leave you feeling like you know the characters. Unlike other books Jane Eyre is a book about intelligent decision making and moral. I feel that this book deserves another look at I hope that others will enjoy reading it as much as I do. By Heather Beers"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Jane Eyre is one of the most beloved books ever written. Before I had read it, I attributed this to the many movies made of the plot, because I did not think a novel written in formal style by an author often paired with Jane Austen would appeal to the general public. I read it. It was as formal as expected, but different. There was imagination here, like a butterfly on a string, and the contents were Truth. Real Truth is interesting and thought-provoking no matter how presented. The style is a lot like Jane herself: a passionate, creative, romantic young woman, though shy and refined, introspective, rather plain, well brought-up and having strict, if select, morals. This may be in part due to the fact that the novel is written in first person, with Jane narrating. Jane is an incredible character; every word, every action, every thought makes sense, enhances and makes more real her being. All of the characters in Jane Eyre are this detailed, and all are completely different from the others, lending comparison essential to the reader's opinion of each, and of what Jane should do. Although some find the dialogue a bit improbable and fancy -- that no one speaks that way in real life -- I only had problems with that when acting it out. Admittedly, dialogue is at times long and too polished to be spontaneous, but the content of the spoken words makes up for it, and this type of dialogue does not dominate the entire book. Rapid, witty exchanges are just as common.The plot is original and dramatic; keep in mind that Jane Eyre in Ms. Bronte's day might be like Stephen King or Danielle Steel in our day. Jane Eyre is, essentially, a masterpiece soap opera, though a very elegant and refined one. It is a story of characters afflicted and tortured by the rules of society and the self-deprivations of morality and piousness. It is melodramatic and emotional, but not to the point of sogginess; crisper, tenser parts balance the sentimentalism. Suspense begins right away, but continues with something of a snowball effect, reaching its height near the end -- but this is only my opinion; many disagree with me. The one fault with the plot (I had no complaint, but it is my way to accept everything in a good book as Law) may be the frequent coincidences. Giving examples would spoil it for those who haven't read the book, but all contribute majorly to the plot, and all just cross the line between probability and unlikeliness. Critics have softened their accusations with the fact the Ms. Bronte believed in her coincidences, and had likely seen them happen.As a writer, Ms. Bronte is an virtuoso. She uses nearly every tool of the trade: extensive foreshadowing, including prophetic dreams, false suspects, symbolism, effective tense shifting, character analysis from a single point of view, and so much more. It is no surprise that the manuscript of Jane Eyre was accepted and published overnight, and became an immediate success. It is still a success a century and a half later, and as fresh and tangible as it always was. Reading Jane Eyre is an experience you cannot deprive yourself of. I would begin today."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Jane Eyre is a beautifully written masterpiece! Bronte uses eloquent language to convey a timeless love story. The book was moving and profound, and I thouroughly loved it. I suggest it to everyone. It is a book not to be missed."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I carried this book around with me after I finished readingit convincing others to read it as well. I wanted everyone Iknew to experience the joy I felt while reading this trueclassic. It is a lush, romantic, facinating mystery that younever want to end! If you say &quot;I read that in high school&quot;I urge you to read it again - this time by choice - and Iassure you, you'll be as swept away as I was!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"At first glance, this book seems like the story of a lower class woman winning the heart of a rich and of a higher tier man. However, there is much more to the book than just a passionate romance. In addition it has been linked to have influenced Henry James, the author of The Turn of the Screw, also about a governess falling in love, but with some messed up consequences... sorry for the tangent. Anyways, Jane Eyre really is good, as Charlotte Bronte mixes Gothic elements with romance and focuses on a dynamic character who undergoes a bildungsroman and matures at the end of the book.Set in London, England, a stereotypical place for love, Charlotte does well in establishing the imagery of the fire between Mr. Rochester and Jane. She constantly uses colors to set the mood and uses it to set off feelings. Mainly, she appeals to our sense of cold and hot, to paint Jane's emotions, it is wonderfully aesthetic and should be a good read to those who enjoys language.Not only is her plot above average, and her literary devices superior, she is able to meld the two together flawlessly for those who love to read for storyline and those who enjoy a good analysis on what they read. By now one should get the tone from me that Jane Eyre is not your average romance novel. It is more than that. It also speaks of moral responsibility. This centers around the two protagonists love, as Rochester is still married, and kept it hidden. When Jane finds out, she is caught in a dilemma between her principles and her feelings. Unable to figure out a compromise she runs away. Only when Rochester redeems himself by trying to rescue his wife from a fire is he then able to prove to Jane that he has changed and is a candidate for her love. Conveniently, his wife dies in the fire, and Rochester is left crippled, but not permanently. This represents his forgiveness; he has repented for his sins and is now able to be married. The story ends with their marriage and Jane Eyre's epilogue.Charlotte Bronte is a very good author, able to appeal to both kinds of readers. With her brilliant use of figurative language, making Jane's decisions seem ever more desperate, and diction, which contributes to the overall gothic mood of terror, most readers will be enchanted by her work. However, it is also this aspect that makes the book lack it's wow factor, because it appeals to both, it does has to divide it's attention between plot and device.I would recommend this to anyone who has not read the book yet, so what are you waiting for?

Everything was going well until she fell in love with her employer, Mr. Rochester.Jane Eyre is one of my absolute favorite books. I just really love all the characters and the dramatic plot twists. A lot of people who read this book just think it's a romance novel. While it is true that Romance plays a large part, the book is much more than just your run of the mill romance. People who are able to get the \`just a romance novel' idea out of their heads will see that the book is more about a woman trying to find a better life against great odds."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Jane Eyre may seem at first to be a boring 19th century novel, but in truth it is a fantastically rich book. There are so many great aspects in the novel. The characters are developed very well. Even though the author was limited in her knowledge because as a woman she was limited with education, each of the characters is portrayed well enough that he/she becomes real in the reader's mind. Interestingly, but not surprisingly, the women characters are more developed and are more various than the men characters. The men in the book are shown to use women and they are not as diverse, but they are still interesting and realistic. Another great aspect is how well the author intertwined themes of social and financial classes, feminism, and faith and philosophy. Some of the ideas are easy to see without having to think about them, such as how money creates the biggest separation of classes. However, some of the philosophical ideas in the book are much deeper and harder to see and comprehend. The ideas are also not from our time period and are, therefore, harder for us to understand than they were for the readers of the author's time period. For example, the idea of how nature protects us and watches over us to make sure the right things happen to us at the right time is a intricate and remarkable concept.Jane Eyre does have one major flaw, though, and that is the plot. It is an interesting plot and easy to understand, but it is too much like a fairytale. Everything works out almost too perfectly, and seems to be coincidental. The plot helps the theme of how nature makes sure things happen, but it is too planned out. One almost expects to see the all too typical line, \\"And they lived happily ever after\\" at the end of the book. This flaw with the plot would only be seen by readers of our time because we are use to reading books with multifaceted plots, whereas in the time the book was written, people were happy just to read such a developed novel. Even with this flaw, still, it is a great book. While Jane Eyre won't go on my favorites list to read again and again, it was definitely a novel worth reading."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Set in England of the 1600's Jane Eyre's life story is told through her own perspective, aging throughout the novel. Her thoughts and feelings from early childhood through where she is in life writing the book are told with a grace that comes only from life experience. Jane Eyre is from the time of her earliest memories an orphan. In this book she finds love, acceptance, and herself. Charlotte Bronte's talent for bringing out all sides of a character is shown well in this book, she leaves nothing to be desired as far as rounding out her characters. Such characters as Mr. Rochester who first shows Jane true love, Mrs. Fairfax who helps her to understand her equality to others, and Adele Varens who helps her remember childlike wonder as she goes through her life changing experiences, all play a part in Jane coming into herself. This book is an inspiration and I would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good story.Attention was drawn to the dramatic separation of the classes during the time the book was set it. Jane Eyre is an orphan, and therefore frowned upon by all as a dependent and a burden, almost no one expects her to do anything valuable with her life. This remearkable young woman pushed for the right to be sent to school, then ater her graduation stayed on as a teacher, after a mentor and only tie to the school left she advertised herself out as a governess. This was by no uncertain terms a grand achievement for someone born of such a position in the world. Although a governess was not the highest position during her time, she made due with the job and eventually found another window of opportunity. She fell in love with the master of the house and was asked for her hand in marriage. Certain events delay this already unseemly arrangement before true happiness is found.Many readers and critics alike have compared this story very closely to Cinderella. The plots are similar, however, they are not quite the same. Jane Eyre, born an orphan, falls in love with her version of &quot;Prince Charming,&quot; coming to her in the form of an employer. This idea of romance found in hte most unlikely of places with the most unattainable of people is a common thread through many modern works. This kind of fairy tale is appealing to a broad audience and almost any age. However, the level of reading that Jane Eyre is written for would suggest an age group of 12 through adults.This novel left me both uplifted and very impressed with the style of writing that Chalotte Bronte has. The novel's use of separation in social classes to cause a stir and engage the reader's attention to the romance of Jane Eyre and Mr. Rochester is brilliant. Most people would say that the book is a basic take off of the age old tale of Cinderella, but in all actuality it is a beautifully mastered knowledge of the romantic ideals of many young women. I would remcommend this book to the age group of 12 through adults, this novel is also geared mainly towards women, although it would be a wonderful read for those men in the world who have a taste for this genre. Over all the book was a success, a literary masterpiece that has forever more left it's mark on our society as a classic."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I've never been a reader but I joined a book club and this was the book of the month. I was very sure that I would never be able to read one of the classics and that I would be bored to tears. To my delight and surprise, this novel far surpassed any expectations I ever had. I was hooked from the beginning and looked for any opportunity to get away to read the book. It is not a fast read as the language was a big difficult at times but I learned to overlook the things that weren't so important to me and get on with the story. I have read two more classics since this novel and although Jane Eyre was my favorite, I am now a full fledged reading junkie."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Jane Austen wrote the romantic stories. Dickens did the rags-to-riches heartwarmers. Mary Shelley added the supernatural, haunting yet human Frankenstein. Bronte's Jane Eyre pulls elements from all of these works and ends up... something entirely, refreshingly different.What's really great about this book is that it is so rich. The plot moves and moves well, making it an enjoyable and propelling read. While it is mostly romantic-love interest based, it is not as sappy or predictable as, say, Pride and Prejudice. Jane's journey to marital bliss is a bit more pock-marked -- and even drawn into question -- than in most romantic comedies. I enjoyed the fact that, indeed, she questions whether she even wants to marry or should marry -- and refuses to marry, not once but twice, because doing so would compromise who she is.Which brings me to the real reason I like this book and consider it a cut above most. Jane herself is so interesting. She is a very complex character, and the author has clearly taken much time and energy to draw in fine detail the map of her psychosis. This book is re-readable because there is so much to contemplate and reflect on within this finely drawn character. Is she afraid of happiness? Tied to duty? Was it right, or misguided, to leave Mr. Rochester? If it was right, were here intentions right? Was it right to return to him? What changes that allows her to refuse St. John, and return to Rochester?I think Ms. Bronte did us a great favor with this book. She took familiar ground and tweaked it -- taking the romantic comedy formula, so mastered by Austen and Thackeray, in which the tension entirely surrounds marriage, the meeting and mating of two people, and the point of the novel is resolved when the marriage(s) occur. Working within that framework, Bronte brings us a character novel -- in which the tension is only resolved once the character has found a way to be fully who she is, and thus happy and fulfilled. Surely this work broke ground for some of my very favorite works, in which plot becomes a somewhat secondary consideration and the eccentricities of character, the stuff of humans, becomes the focus and point of the novel.

Charlotte Bronte makes ghosts seem dull and spirits and fairies positively mind-numbing. All of Jane Eyre's encounters are couched in a style thats drier and staler than moldy bread. Fire? Murder? wild spirits? its all here. But none of it is the least bit worthwhile to read.In the end, we have a heroine that has wandered from place to place and eventually settles down ith her past love, Rochester, once he has 'redeemed' himself by his courage in trying to save his mad wife (in the attempt he loses his sight and an arm).In typically fairy tale fashion, Rochester gains his sight back. I have a suspicion that he would have grown another arm if we gave hima few more years.The book that Jane Eyre reminds me most of is 'The Scarlet Letter'. If anything, this is more boring.This dull, mind-numbing book is about as entertaining as watching fungus grow. The fact that its riddled with 'deep symbology' makes it not one bit more interesting."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Excuse me?

She could use some serious formal training. Perhaps she was attempting to capture some type of gothic element in her illustrations, but these poor, poor drawings do not enhance (in fact they serve as a detriment to) the beautiful language of charlotte bronte's work. They really are quite terrible, heavy-handed drawings; Darcy really should bruch up on her pen work.Perhaps they were executed under serious time constraints? Perhaps all she had access to were cheap bic pens and a half used crayola water color set? Perhaps Penguin books was looking for an illustrator to do these illustrations for dirt cheap and she?

Even though this was written so long ago - you can see how Jane is an equal match for modern women, who do not think that they need others to take care of them. The prose are beautifully written and even though I have seen three of the films, many times, the book is even better. The story takes you through Mr Rochester and on to her finding herself.

This novel was one of the finest of its time and what made it all the more incredible was that it was written by a woman. Charlotte Bronte and her sisters, the Brontes, were British women who grew up in Yorkshire, the English countryside. To kill time when they were bored in the domestic and boarding-school ambiance, they wrote great works of literature. It's a must read for young women, but also for men and young males (preferably in the high school or college level) Jane Eyre is ultimately a literary novel and only a literary-minded intellectual can truly enjoy it for the masterpiece that it is. It ranks among the greatest works of English fiction, taking its place with the other male greats- Shakespeare and Charles Dickens. Curl up, warm up some tea or coffee, put on some mood music and read this incredibly engaging book. In this edition, we get commentary and preface by noted scholars.Jane Eyre has been scrutinized time and again. It is understood by many that the heroine Jane is Charlotte Bronte herself. It's partially autobiographical in some portions- Charlotte Bronte did grow up in lowly conditions and was in boarding school that was cold and freezing. Charlotte did love a married man who was older than her, though nothing came of it of course. Jane Eyre, a feisty, spirited young orphan, is taken away from her home where her wicked aunt and cousins mistreat her. She is taken to a boarding school for girls until she comes of age. She lands a job as a governess for the eccentric and mysterious Mr. Rochester, who is hardly ever at home and takes care of his daughter Adele, teaching her to read and write, etc. But the mystery surrounding Mr. Rochester's past becomes a present reality in Jane Eyre's own life. Furthermore, Mr. Rochester and Jane Eyre fall in love. A novel that is inspired by Gothic fiction, it is strewn with Gothic, supernatural and suspenseful atmosphere and symbolism. The tree that is struck by lightning is a warning for Jane Eyre to leave Mr. Rochester's mansion, the strange cries in the attic later turn out to be Mr. Rochester's first wife, the crazed Bertha. A fire destroys the mansion and Mr. Rochester ends up diabled and blind. Bittersweet though the ending is, Jane Eyre and the blind Mr. Rochester marry and live happily, after much water under the bridge. This novel is a long read and should take up at least a whole summer, but it's very worth reading. It's a classic. Time and again, it will appear on the list of reading material for high school and college courses. And a bit of advice- dont' just read it to pass a class, get into the story. You will score even more points."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"The novel is about a cheap gal called Jane Air who is out looking for the perfect guy to marry, one with a tonne of cash. Sure, it set's a great example for what girls should achieve in life, so why not, get all the cash you can! I don't know about you, but for those who have read the sequal of the novel, I found it facinating, however.... it's up to u to make up ur mind about it!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Mrs. Taylor's honors senior literature class was carefully chosen to read Jane Eyre. I truly enjoyed reading this novel because it allowed me to realize that it is not necessary to have the love of your family members or a man to depend upon. If you are confident in yourself and your abilities, then you will succeed in carrying out a happy and successful life much like Jane Eyre. She did not need beauty in order to be content with herself. This novel not only taught me many life's lessons, but also encouraged me to focus more on true happiness, not the typical worldly view of happiness."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Someone gave me an old copy of it, that originally sold for 32 cents. It's a good, interesting tale of romance, with all the right elements: innocent young girl, roguish older man, a little girl, villainy, scandal, and of course, the happy ending. She'd have made a popular Harlequin writer if she lived nowadays."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"i thought this book was really boring. it was sad in the end, but it took so long to get to that part"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I know this book is one of the classics, and that it shouldn't be missed as a piece of literature from the period. I have tried to finish it on multiple occasions, but every time I read about Mr. Rochester keeping his first wife locked in the attic and trying to marry Jane without telling her about the wife in the attic, I want to throw the book across the room. Jane herself isn't a terrible character, and I found myself growing to like her during her early years. It's just Rochester that I absolutely cannot stand."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"This novel was quite a bit better than I expected. I usually prefer adventures (\\"manly\\" literature) but quite frankly, this book didn't disappoint me. I don't give it 5 stars for the convoluted way that Jane and Rochester get back together. The \\"I heard your voice in the wind\\" stuff is a little hard to swallow. (Sorry if that was a spoiler! Still read the book because there are some true heart-pounding moments!) Jane Eyre was actually quite enjoyable to read and I'm glad that I took the time to read it. I like her character: She's not beautiful, but she's a solid and determined woman and I like that her inner beauty overcomes her physical plainness. She's a role model for young girls! She overcomes adversity with strength and determination and has an accurate moral compass. She follows her inner voice and she's rewarded for it. Great female literary character of the 19th century!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Sweet words, precious story of love and romance.

A very clear narrative of eighteen-nineteen century England where miss Bronte takes care of every detail."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I had never actually read this book, thinking that the drama might be too frustrating for me. However, after recently viewing two different Hollywood adaptations, I decided I needed to read the book and I was not disappointed. Its a great story that doesn't go too heavily on the gothic elements. Jane Eyre is a great character."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I have reread this book countless times, starting after I first discovered it as a teen. It is a masterful piece of storytelling and the classic romance novel. I hope purists aren't offended by that classification, but Bronte's novel has all the traditional elements of a romance novel -- the meet, the attraction, the obstacles, the Black Moment, the reunion, the HEA (happily ever after) -- wrapped in beautiful writing and characterizations.Although this book has been popular through the ages, it seems to fall in the shadow of the other Jane today. That is, the author Jane Austen, whose works are told and retold in every conceivable way. I sometimes wonder if Austen gets a lot of glory today because she is perceived as a more intellectual read while EYRE is a big, fat, juicy Gothic romance. So unfair if that is true. Bronte's story is clever and intelligent, but also passionate and emotional.If anyone's interested, I've written a book inspired by JANE EYRE but set in old Hollywood.

I really enjoyed reading this book. This book is about a girl who suffered a lot in her life. She was an orphan. Her parents died when she was small.

I know that whoever reads this book will definitely enjoy it like I did.- Review by Johanna"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"A story that never grows old despite being firmly set in Victorian England. Jane is a wonderful character, an ordinary plain girl/woman with spirit and dignity. The elements of self-sacrifice and duty seem far removed from modern society but seen in the likes of Jane, her friend Helen Burns, Miss Templeton and others seems very noble. Just love it, great story."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Even though feminist criticism is very important to this work, I think it is really stupid that so many people stick it into that peg and never think about it again.Jane's journey is also highly spiritual, and it makes me mad that people miss this. This book shows a wide range of human experience. I do not think that Jane has to prove anything simply because she is &#34;plain&#34;. I also don't think that Charlotte Bronte had anything to prove. She was a woman who earned her merit as a writer because she was good at it. I wish that I could write like this."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Got it to give as a valentines gift, but ended up keeping it! Very beautiful.

It resonated so well with me when I first read it as a teenager. How to be true to yourself, independent, and make the best of your life no matter the circumstances. And of course, the romance between Mr. Rochester and Jane was so beautiful. I wanted someone to love me like that one day!I love how she was able to stand up for herself to Mrs. Reed her cruel aunt, the evil Mr. Brocklehurst, her self-righteous and controlling cousin St. John, and even her beloved Mr. Rochester when he would have her go against her moral fiber.It was wonderful to learn more about Charlotte and her life and how much shows up in her novel. It made this reread even better!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"This is the first time that I have been through this story. I'm sorry it took so long for me to get to it. Susan Ericksen narrates the audio book and the listening experience was something I looked forward to on my daily commute. The narrator had an excellent speaking voice and sounded just like what I would have expected from Jane Eyre. Her characterizations of the other characters were not as dramatic as I would have liked, though she did a good job with the \`master'. I'm getting used to good characterizations since it makes it easier to follow who is speaking. Overall, I would rate the audio book at 4.5 stars instead of 5 due to the characterization issue.The story itself is wonderful. The main characters are very likeable despite their flaws. It's fun to see the main characters be rather homely instead of amazingly good looking as is common in many novels. It is a beautiful love story and shows strong integrity in Jane. In these days it is good to see this type of values in the heroines and heroes of the story.I highly recommend this audio book. It cannot disappoint."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"It's been nearly 27 years since I was forced to read a classic. This year I decided I wanted to read one.

Eventually, she leaves this school and is employed by the mysterious Mr. Rochester, to care for his ward, Adele. Jane finds herself growing more fond of the man...and more curious about the mysterious circumstances surrounding his home.I have just finished listening to this audiobook, and I am still trying to pick my jaw up from the floor. WOW, just WOW. This was a positively amazing experience, a thrill and a joy, a pleasure from beginning to end. I haven't had this enjoyable a time listening to a historical/classic/romance novel since...well, \\"Gone with the Wind\\"! From characters to plot to story to setting, everything was a joy to unfold, and while I knew somewhat how the story would go, I was still thrown for loops and wondered if Jane would ever get her happily ever after.From the beginning, I knew Jane was interesting and different. She may have been plain, but she was relatively well behaved, curious, and intelligent. Throughout the entire book, Jane grows and develops as a person. She pushes for her own destiny and does not let others tell her what to do--and in her day and age, that is remarkable. She puts up with her cousins until self-respect tells her not to. She begs to be put into school away from her relatives. She deals with the hardships of school, knowing things would be worse in her adoptive home. She is studious, becoming a teacher, and when she learns she can make more money being a governess, she leaves her job. While working for Mr. Rochester, she never forgets her pupil, she remains cordial and appropriate in front of Mr. Rochester, and when she is called back to her aunt's side, she gives the dying woman forgiveness. When Jane learns of Mr. Rochester's secret, she doesn't succumb to what she sees as sin, but leaves even though it could mean starvation and hard work. When Rev. Rivers tries to coerce her into going with him to India, she refuses to accept his temrs and presents her own. Time and again, Jane proves to be independent, smart, and moral--something many a modern protagonist that supposedly is these things could take a lesson in.Our secondary characters are painted with equal care and detail. Jane's aunt and cousins are horrible, and they grow up to be horrible people (well, sort of). I grieved when Helen died; I fell in love with Mr. Rochester alongside Jane; I was devastated at his secret; I loved being with Mary and Diana; I bristled at Rev. Rivers' cold attitude. All in all, the cast is well-crafted and enjoyable.I knew the big secret of the story before hand, but I didn't know how or if Jane ever got to be with her beloved Mr. Rochester. I was kept on the edge of my seat the entire time, wondering how Bronte would pull it off. I was shocked at what happened to Mr. Rochester's manor AND Mr. Rochester. Most authors nowadays wouldn't DARE damage their major characters so permanently and so obviously!The descriptions are long and sometimes laborious, though it paints Jane's surroundings beautifully. I also found myself getting bored in the last third (where Jane hangs out with Diana and Mary) and found some of the circumstances of that part to be a bit hokey (no spoilers!). Also, apologies in advance, but the narrator (Josephine Bailey) was particularly bland and almost sounded like those automated computer voices you get when calling your bank or Fedex or some other big business. Her voice was clear and precise, but had almost no emotion and was very dry. A few hours of listening to that voice drained me.This book is excellent, much better, in my opinion, than Charlotte's sister's book, \\"Wuthering Heights\\", which seemed more of a study on how not to fall in love . This is a real, true romance story with real, true obstacles populated with real, true characters. I definitely enjoyed it and recommend it highly.Brought to you by:*C.S. Light*"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I loved Jane Eyre in high school and I still do now.The heaviness of the Victoria description, while way too heavy for me in books such as The Scarlett Letter, were much more comprehensible and approachable in Jane Eyre. I loved the character development in the book. And the story line of course, from rags to riches, had you rooting for Jane all the way. Adversity turns aside and she lives out her life in happiness and love. A wonderful story!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I received this copy of the classic JANE EYRE very promptly.

I guess it wasn't a requirement in my school. Anyway, I loved it and couldn't put it down. I usually read mysteries and wasn't sure if I would enjoy this type of book. But the story never got boring throughout her entire life. I was so intrigued with this girl's life and wanted to know what was going to happen to her so I just kept reading every night.

I finally decided to read it out of curiosity. And I was not disappointed.This is a wonderful book. I was delightfully surprised by how much I enjoyed it. My only complaint would be that sometimes the book dragged in parts. However, it was still a pleasure to read. Jane is a admirable heroine and I loved everything about her. I truly cared about what happened to her which I haven't been able to do with books I've read. Rochester's and Jane's love was deep and pure and I loved watching them go through the process of falling in love. It wasn't an OMG-I-don't-know-anything-about-you-but-I-love-you-like-crazy thing that I've been reading lately. It was slow but sure and so very sweet. Their difference in age was strange to me at first, but as time went on I found myself not caring. Love really knows no bounds.I love this book. It is definitely near the top of my favorite books. The story, dialogue, and cast of characters all went together. Every character in this story has depth. They're not stale, cardboard cut-outs.Anyway, I definitely recommend this book. It's one of my favorites."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Bronte was so descriptive that I had no problems picturing what she described. I loved the complexities of the relationships. I never knew what was going to happen next."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Jane Eyre is Charlotte Bronte's first novel, published under the pen name of Currer Bell. Jane Eyre, orphaned at a very young age, suffers at the hands of her aunt and cousins when her maternal uncle dies. At the age of ten, she is sent to a charity boarding school, where her life is also filled with privation until an outbreak of typhus exposes the austere measures imposed by the manager of the school. At the age of eighteen, she leaves the school to become a governess to Mr Edward Fairfax Rochester's ward, Ad&egrave;le. Here, Jane seems to find happiness: beneath Mr Rochester's moody exterior, there appears to be kindness and perhaps even love? But further events may destroy her chance at happiness.The use of words that seem to be nowadays obsolete, such as: unclose (doors etc); undraw (curtains); undeceive; benignant; show how much can change in a language in a mere 200 years. Described as a classic, it is easy to see why Jane Eyre is one of the most unforgettable of English novels."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Loved the language and thought.

The book, extremely unique in style, speaks across all time and place - THAT is why it is a classic. One of my favorite tools that Bronte uses is the way she adresses the reader as 'reader.' It gives the uniquivocal sense that you are sitting in the room with her as she tells this tale to you of a little orphan girl (or could be boy) who seeks out her destiny in fortune, misfortune and fate. The only fault that she perhaps could have avoided is in editing. There are a few strange grammatical quirks and there are many lines that could have been shortened or cut out entirely. However, I highly recommend it to any reader of any age with an open mind to start and finish a true CLASSIC."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Jane Erye, by Charlotte Bronte, is an excelente book. The characters are very well developed. Jane, for example, expounded upon the world her naivity and youthfullness. Her character was that of a dew-kissed lilly-- clean, pure, and forthright. Mr. Rochester was very similar to a bull dog. He had a surreptious character that leaves you wondering about his motives. His growling countenance intimidates and frightens the reader. This book contains numerous metaphors for life-- hardly ostentatious, so the reader must infer to discover these valuable lessons to life. A classical must read, Jane Eyre is not a dustcollector for any bookshelf. You will read it multiple times, appreciating it more as you get older._________________________________________________________________*Note: There is a slight part which may put the reader to sleep.

It is marked by an intelligent pessimism as opposed to a silly optimism which is also a marked point in most of Thomas Hardy's work. You go through the psychological struggles of Jane Eyre, an orphan first with the oppressive regime at the Lowood School and later with her employer Mr. Rochester and her cousin St.John Rivers. It is strong in the depiction of the environment in which the novel takes place and it also succeeds in making an argument about colonialism and psychology. Strongly recommended."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I put off reading this book for years - it was sitting on the dusty shelf in my schoolroom, by the Austens, Dickens and Shakespeare and looked like the driest book in the world. However, like those other books, Jane Eyre has stood the test of time, and there's a good reason for that. So 10 years after I left school I finally went ahead and read it, and was delighted to find that it is one of the best written and romantic stories you will ever read. Jane is orphaned at an early age, has a sad and lonely childhood, finds a job and a chance at romance, only to have it all dashed away and she is apparently left destitute....but it's not over yet. Treat yourself to this book, curl up and enjoy the wonderful descriptive prose and you won't regret it!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"This is probably one of my top ten fave books of all time. The love story in it was (in my opinion) very intense a lot of the time (the part where she comes back just kills me every time). I can understand how you would not like this book if you don't like cheesy love stories (and, trust me, the ending is VERY cheesy) but it's just a wonderful book in all. The parts where Jane is not with Rochester can be tedious sometimes but, fortunately, since I've read it, I can skip those parts and just read the good ones. When Jane leaves Rochester, Bronte describes it in such a way that it makes the reader feel as if they were leaveng their one true love. The only thing that gets me is the age difference between Rochester and Jane but I don't stress over it. I recommend this book to anyone who needs a good romantic pick-me-up."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Jane Eyre - Illustrated novel by Charlotte BronteThis ebook is a golden treasure to add to your library.

Written in the first person, the excellent writing of the author Charlotte Bronte is both beautiful to read and gripping in its story telling power.What I found of particular interest was the moral character of Ms Eyre. There is a sense of absolute honesty about her, an honesty both to herself and in her sense towards other people that makes her truly stand out. For instance, Jane went through extreme hardships to do what she thought was morally a right thing to do, including relinquishing her lover. And then, when she has barely come out of extreme poverty, she finds out that her rich Uncle has left her a lot of money. She shows her character here by willingly sharing her inheritance with her newly discovered cousins.And the way that she loves Rochester is simply too beautiful for me to describe here in words.

It is beautiful. We begin with a young Jane who lives with a cruel aunt and vile cousins. Soon she is sent to live at a school for children who have lost one or both parents.When she is grown, she becomes a governess for a fan with a mysterious secret and they fall in love. After discovering a dark secret on their wedding day, however, she is forced to flee.This book about love overcoming all obstacles. Genuine love, not infatuation."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"OK, so this is not Wuthering Heights, all drama and stormy characters. So what? Jane Eyre is still a very good book. Its main attraction is the superb description of Jane's problematic life and the character's in the book. A good story must draw the readers into it, making them feel like they're witnessing the action firsthand, and Jane Eyre does it beautifully. I didn't like much the main character at first, until she proved to be smarter then she had appeared first. This is a classic everyone should read."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Jane Eyre is wonderful-there is simply no other word for it. From the very beginning, the story sweeps you up and holds you captive. On the first page, Jane is sure to win you over, and keep you on her side throughout the entire book. Told in elegant English, the story feels real and the characters seem to leap out of the pages. When I read Jane Eyre, I felt the lonely misery of her childhood, endured the sufferings of Lowood School, and shivered in the dark as strange noises issued from the attic of Mr. Rochester's house. I too rejoiced at the prospect of marriage to Mr. Rochester, and was filled with dark despair when the secret of the locked third story room was revealed. This book is truly a masterpiece that I would encourage everyone, even teenagers and young adults to read. You won't regret it if you do."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I enjoyed Jane Eyre immensely and would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a good book to become completely immersed in."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"This unwavering literary classic brings to life one of the most endearing heroines ever conjured from the written word! Jane Eyre and the mysterious Mr. Rochester have fates that are interminably conjoined and torn asunder all throughout the course of this enduring masterpiece. In my eyes, this is the undoubted star of all the brilliant novels by the Bronte' sisters."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"We find, it's an interesting book. We read it in the in the English lesson. Sometimes it was hard to understand, because English is a foreign language for us. Jane is a courageous person and we could understand some of her emotions, because it's the reality and some of us know some of her feelings. We think it is a good book for young and romantic people, because the story tells of love and problems between men and women.

All what she had passed in her live, turned us on to make thoughts. We find it very force from her that she had returned to Mr Rochester after all that happened and after his great change. We both found or find it still a very good book, and we can recommend it all people who have a sense for true love and dramatic.

The reader is usually wondered what will happen later. But the story isn't very realistic. Sometimes it is like in a fairy tale, so we can sink into clouds of dreaming. And it's relaxing to read it. All in all we would recommend it everybody. Erika and Drusilla"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Jane Eyre- a book with a story of live. I first saw the film, and that was good for understanding the book better. The book was like the film, natural, sad and a bit romantic. All this experiences whitch Jane had had in her live are written in this book very honest. I think that the writer of this book is a person who knows and understand the problems of people who have a special live. The end and the beginning of this book were very hard and difficult to understand for a normal person. I think the film was better then this book, but it wasn't bad."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Jane Eyre was a very well written book. The book is written by Charlotte Bronte. The book is written in the third person and the author's style is wonderful. Jane is a girl in the beginning and is about five years old. The book explains all about Jane and all of the good and bad events throughout her life. When she becomes a woman, her life gets very exciting and full of adventures.I don't want to give away anything more about the book. I highly recommend Jane Eyre to any young person who has a large vocabulary or has very good dictionary skills, or any adult, so they can understand it. This is certainly a reading challenge, but if you ask anyone who read it, they'll say they loved it!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Jane Eyre has always been my favorite story. The relationship between Jane and Mr. Rochester is the most intensely moving love relationship I have ever read in a novel. I doubt I will ever come across any as lovely and meaningful again.Jane is an inspiration to many a modern day woman and I would recommend this book be read in high school and it's messages be studied as to their relevance to today.So wonderful a story- so many lessons. I have seen several of the movie versions- my favorite being the A &amp; E version from 1997. The actor who played Mr. Rochester caught his essence perfectly."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Why I waited until I was middle-aged to start reading the classics, I'll never know, but I'm glad that I did. When I received my new Kindle Fire a few weeks ago, I downloaded some free books to test it out and among them was Jane Eyre. I enjoyed the eloquent language and writing used. I went between applauding Jane's high morals and commitment to yelling at her for being such a doormat.As I was reading the story, I asked my husband, \\"Was it really like this in Europe back then? Super rich people and super poor people and no in between?\\" It makes for a good story of a girl thrown into a charitable facility/orphanage, going out on her own, falling in love, and staying true to her feelings. The ending was warm and fuzzy.The gist of the story is girl gets abused, sent to an orphanage, succeeds as a teacher and when she turns 18 ventures out to be a governess, falls in love, is gilted, ventures out again, finds relatives, and then . . . well, I don't want to spoil it for you, but it's a good read."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I decided to read the book after seeing the 1996 movie version. I heard that the 2011 rendition was great and I wanted to have more insight before reading it. After seeing the movie and loving it, I didn't think the book could get any better.The book starts out with Jane Eyre in her youth. She lives with her aunt and cousins. Unlike families should be, they mistreat her and are abusive to her. Her aunt, claiming that she is a wicked child, sends her to a catholic school. If you thought things were going to get better, you thought wrong. She is still mistreated and shunned by the residents of the school. Jane Eyre grows to be a woman of strong opinions and independence. In adulthood she does not grow to be a woman that is handsome, in fact she is very plain. But she believes that intellect and personality are what really make a person. When she advertises as a governess, she is immediately answered. She arrives at her place of occupation and begins well enough. There are strange things that occur in the house however, for instance, strange laughing and disappearance of objects. It's troubling, but she hardly minds it. After some time, Jane begins to become closer to the master of the house, Mr. Rochester. He's mysterious and different. But in the end, will it be for nothing?The narration and the way the character conducts herself is what really makes this such an incredible read. It's a very unique style in which the book is written. The words are very fluid and it wasn't at all a difficult read. I was stunned with the beauty of the book and how much I loved the book. I have no criticisms for it. I very rarely have no criticisms for a book, but this is truly a masterpiece."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"When I was in high school I did anything possible to keep from reading the \\"classics\\" even though my Mom loves the Bronte sisters books.

Jane's character is inspiring and refreshing in today's world where strong female role models are scant. I so enjoyed following Jane's journey into adulthood, and took away much from her self-reliance and integrity. This is now easily one of my favorite books, because of the wonderful characters and the eloquent writing (The Fountainhead by Ayn Rand is another of my favorite books, for the same reasons)."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"This book is a classic for a reason. It is still studied in schools across the world for a reason. Because it's a true work of genius. I cannot say anything about it which hasn't been said already. I just wish when kids read it for the first time, they would truly grasp how very ahead of their time Jane Eyre (and Charlotte Bronte) were. The romantic in me was just spellbound by the intensity of Rochester and Jane's love for one another. A thought that repeatedly crossed my mind was \\"Has anyone ever loved anybody the way Rochester loves Jane?\\" If you read it as a teen, go back and read it with adult eyes. I found I appreciated it in a whole new way. I cannot recommend it highly enough and would heartily give it 10 stars if I could. I am off to find the movie version now..."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"AS I said in my title this book has almost been reviewed to its extent and its a wonderful read for any age.

Now in my 40's, I've been going back and reading many of the classics that i was too \\"busy\\" (read - Partying) to bother with. I just finished Jane Eyre last night, and was sad it ended. I'd seen the movie not long ago with Cirran Hinds and it was really good. Although, now that I've read the book, the movie doesn't do it justice, they left out much of Jane's experience at the school and at Gateshead. This is a MUST read for all classic literature lovers!!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"It was my first time reading this classic and truly loved this book. The first quarter of the book was a little slow to get into. Afterwards, I could not put the book down. Jane and Mr. Rochester's love story is one of the best from the classics. The climax and the final reveal are certainly worth the hundreds of pages. We can learn from Jane's journey from an orphan girl to an independent woman even today in the 21st century. Definitely not a Cinderella story but that's probably what makes it so great to read. Highly recommended to all readers!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Had a hard day at school? Read Jane Eyre. Boss a little cranky? Read Jane Eyre. Life confusing? Read Jane Eyre. Want to explore the weird noises on the third floor...uh...read Jane Eyre. There is not a better book out there. I love modern thrillers, courtroom stuff and chick lit. I love old meloramas, spy novels and Hemingway but this is the best--EVER.Jane and Mr. Rochester and Adele and Pilot and Mrs Fairfax and Bertha and Helen are all so very amazing and still so wonderfully penned. This book doesnt fade, the magic doesnt get dated, the story is never old, and oh my goodness--I STILL hate her aunt and Mr. Brocklehurst."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"\\"I need not sell my soul to buy bliss\\"Jane Eyre is an orphan, raised by her aunt, until one day, she is sent to a horrible school. Eventually, she leaves this school and is employed by the mysterious Mr. Rochester, to care for his ward, Adele. Jane finds herself growing more fond of the man...and more curious about the mysterious circumstances surrounding his home.I have just finished listening to this audiobook, and I am still trying to pick my jaw up from the floor. WOW, just WOW. This was a positively amazing experience, a thrill and a joy, a pleasure from beginning to end. I haven't had this enjoyable a time listening to a historical/classic/romance novel since...well, \\"Gone with the Wind\\"! From characters to plot to story to setting, everything was a joy to unfold, and while I knew somewhat how the story would go, I was still thrown for loops and wondered if Jane would ever get her happily ever after.From the beginning, I knew Jane was interesting and different. She may have been plain, but she was relatively well behaved, curious, and intelligent. Throughout the entire book, Jane grows and develops as a person. She pushes for her own destiny and does not let others tell her what to do--and in her day and age, that is remarkable. She puts up with her cousins until self-respect tells her not to. She begs to be put into school away from her relatives. She deals with the hardships of school, knowing things would be worse in her adoptive home. She is studious, becoming a teacher, and when she learns she can make more money being a governess, she leaves her job. While working for Mr. Rochester, she never forgets her pupil, she remains cordial and appropriate in front of Mr. Rochester, and when she is called back to her aunt's side, she gives the dying woman forgiveness. When Jane learns of Mr. Rochester's secret, she doesn't succumb to what she sees as sin, but leaves even though it could mean starvation and hard work. When Rev. Rivers tries to coerce her into going with him to India, she refuses to accept his temrs and presents her own. Time and again, Jane proves to be independent, smart, and moral--something many a modern protagonist that supposedly is these things could take a lesson in.Our secondary characters are painted with equal care and detail. Jane's aunt and cousins are horrible, and they grow up to be horrible people (well, sort of). I grieved when Helen died; I fell in love with Mr. Rochester alongside Jane; I was devastated at his secret; I loved being with Mary and Diana; I bristled at Rev. Rivers' cold attitude. All in all, the cast is well-crafted and enjoyable.I knew the big secret of the story before hand, but I didn't know how or if Jane ever got to be with her beloved Mr. Rochester. I was kept on the edge of my seat the entire time, wondering how Bronte would pull it off. I was shocked at what happened to Mr. Rochester's manor AND Mr. Rochester. Most authors nowadays wouldn't DARE damage their major characters so permanently and so obviously!The descriptions are long and sometimes laborious, though it paints Jane's surroundings beautifully. I also found myself getting bored in the last third (where Jane hangs out with Diana and Mary) and found some of the circumstances of that part to be a bit hokey (no spoilers!). Also, apologies in advance, but the narrator was particularly bland and almost sounded like those automated computer voices you get when calling your bank or Fedex or some other big business. Her voice was clear and precise, but had almost no emotion and was very dry. A few hours of listening to that voice drained me.This book is excellent, much better, in my opinion, than Charlotte's sister's book, \\"Wuthering Heights\\", which seemed more of a study on how not to fall in love . This is a real, true romance story with real, true obstacles populated with real, true characters. I definitely enjoyed it and recommend it highly.Brought to you by:*C.S.

This book is a nice mix of romance and classic liturature and I recomend it to anyone who loves to read."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I've never read a piece of work by the Brontes' till I stumbled on this book. I looked at the beautiful cover and said, this looks interesting. I know you are not suppose to judge a book by its cover, so before I got it, I read the first chapter. I was instantly in a world of my own which only inhabited a young girl named, Jane Eyre. I got it out as fast as I could and started to get far away from the world, in this book. I read it constantly, not wanting to put it down. I was surrounded by mystery and passion and thrills all at the same time. The characters were so life-like that I felt like I was standing right next to them, observing them from every angle. It was the most, thrilling experience I've ever had from a book besides 'Little Women.' The writing, it's so creative and follows the rules of realism and describation and the beautiful flow of language. I just couldn't believe that the whole story was fiction and was made up in the author's mind. It seems that it actually happened. This book is a classic and if you haven't read it yet, you are just missing out. I would like anyone who wants to be inspired to write read Ms. Charlotte Bronte's words. Since I'm a writer, it has helped me so much. But, if you are not a writer, I would still recommend it to readers who like to be immersed in books. Everyone should read this!!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"While I do admit that I did not read this book of my own free will (It was on my summer reading list), I really liked this book. When I started reading it I found it more than a little boring and wanted to throw in the towel. But, as I got to the heart of the novel I found myself in a thrilling love story with a strange twist. It really wasn't that hard to understand once I got used to the language. This book may be more appealing to females than males due to the female heroine. I honestly couldn't put it down and breezed through it in less than a week. I even read it twice! It is a great mixture of romance and horor and I recomend it."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"This book is amaizing.

Homely girl entices rich man with innocence and natural beaty. Rich man dumps blond for homely girl. I'm not going to pretend that every word in this book kept you wanting more, it actually took me close to 200 pages to get interested, but its well worth the wait!!!! Jane is sent from her aunts house to live at a boarding school. She is brave and outspoken after living with her aunt after her mothers death and is not quite welcomed with open arms at her new home.

Reading it the second time not only helped me to understand it more, but to like even more. Jane Eyre is a wonderful book that comes from out of the blue. To me when I first heard I had to read it as a freshman, it was just another one of those classics that they made you read. However, as the stroy progressed I really enjoyed learning about how Jane delt with everything. Not only did I begin to dislike the people that Jane disliked, but I began to start looking at everyday situation and wonder how she might handle them. Overall, it was a wonderfully written book."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I am a 15 year old freshman who was required to read this book for an honors class. At first I was annoyed at the lengh and appearence of &quot;another boring classic&quot; that I would hate. Once I started to read Jane Eyre I was immediatly drawn in. The descriptions of seens, though long and tedious, were magnificent. The story line itself realy touched me. I found myself dislikeing all the characters that Jane disliked and having a grudge against all the characters who were unjust to Jane. I found jane to be a kind of idol. Her courage to speak up for herself and never let anyone walk all over her was really encouraging to me. By the end of the book I was in love with Mr. Rochester and felt my own ties with Thornfeild, Mrs. Fairfax, Adele, and all the others. I encourage people to read this book! What I thought was going to be a boring assignment turned into a pleasure. Me, a person who really dislikes reading, found myself reading every night. I hope kids and adults alike read this book and enjoy it. It was somewhat of a challenge for me, but it was well worth it!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Charolette Bronte never seces to amaze me. she seems to bring her characters to life, as they jump off the page and into you head. After reading Jane Eyer, you will find yourself constantly wondering how she is doing. This book will follow you wherever you go, and unconcesly haunt you mind. It is an ultimate classic that everyone must read! What makes this book so great? Charolette Brontes wonderful skill, of making the characters so real, is what makes this book a classic. She describes Jane in such a way, that everyone can find a bit of themselves in her, and often can relate to her thoughts, and her feelings. Her inocence, just seems to surround her. She has such a pure love, a pure want, and yet she is so inocent, that we long to be like her. Her inteligence and pride, add to her, and make her a prominent figure in our minds. With out Charolette Bronte's wonderful depiction of Jane, this book would not be near as powerful as it is now. The romance in this novel, makes you wan to reach out and hug Jane. You wan tto tell her that everything will be all right, and with the hard life that she had suffered through, when she finds love, you want to cry for her. As the Climax of the book arrives, you find yourself reading, with a tear sliding slowly down you cheek. You feel you eyes fill up as you want to weep with her. YOu want her to know you are there. with out the romance, that touches your heart, this book could not be the same, and would not touch the heart in the same way. The simplicity of theh plot, helps to make the book a hit. If this book were not simple and plain, it would become a bore, but it is nothing more than a young girls life, as she grows, her terrible treatment from her aunt, her schooling, and her first love. This book is so simple that it is almost amazing.Clearly this book is wondeful. You will find your self reading it over and over again! I suggest it to all of those who enjoy a good romance, with lots of love and hope!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"It's hard to imagine a better gothic romance than \\"Jane Eyre\\" -- gloomy vast houses, mysterious secrets, and a brooding haunted man with a dark past.In fact, Charlotte Bronte's classic novel has pretty much everything going for it -- beautiful settings, a passionate romance tempered by iron-clad morals, and a heroine whose poverty and lack of beauty only let her brains and courage shine brighter. And it's all wrapped in the misty, haunting atmosphere of a true gothic story -- madwoman in the attic and all.Jane Eyre was an orphan, abused and neglected first by relatives, then by a boarding school run by a tyrannical, hypocritical minister. But Jane refuses to let anyone shove her down -- even when her saintly best friend dies from the wretched conditions.But many years later, Jane moves on by applying to Thornfield Hall for a governess position, and gets the job. She soon becomes the teacher and friend to the sprightly French girl Adele, but is struck by the dark, almost haunted feeling of her new home.Then she runs into a rather surly horseman -- who turns out to be her employer, Mr. Rochester, a cynical, embittered man who spends little time at Thornfield. They are slowly drawn together into a powerful love, despite their different social stations -- and Rochester's apparent attentions to a shallow, snotty aristocrat who wants his wealth and status.But strange things are happening at Thornfield -- stabbings, fires, and mysterious laughter. Jane and Rochester finally confess their feelings to each other, but their wedding is interrupted when Rochester's dark past comes to light. Jane flees into the arms of long-lost family members, and is offered a new life -- but her love for Rochester is not so easily forgotten...\\"Jane Eyre\\" is one of those books that transcends the labels of genre. Charlotte Bronte spun a haunting gothic romance around her semi-autobiographical heroine and Byronic anti-hero, filling it with brilliant writing and solid plot. It has everything all the other gothic romances of the time had... but Bronte gave it depth and intensity without resorting to melodrama.Bronte wrote in the usual stately prose of the time, but it has a sensual, lush quality, even in the dank early chapters at Lowood. At Thornfield, the book acquires an overhanging atmosphere of foreboding, until the clouds clear near the end. And she wove some tough questions into Jane's perspective -- that of a woman's independence and strength in a man's world, of extreme religion, and of the clash between morals and passion.And Bronte also avoided any tinges of drippy sentimentality (Mrs. Reed dies still spewing venom) while injecting some hauntingly nightmarish moments (\\"She sucked the blood: she said she'd drain my heart\\"). She even manages to include some funny stuff, such as Rochester disguising himself as an old gypsy woman.The story does slow down after the abortive wedding, when Jane flees Thornfield and briefly considers marrying a repressed clergyman who wants to go die preaching in India. It's rather boring to hear the self-consciously saintly St. John prattling about himself, instead of Rochester's barbed wit. But when Jane departs again, the plot speeds up into a nice, mellow little finale.Bronte did a brilliant job of bringing her heroine to life -- as a defiant little girl who is condemned for being \\"passionate,\\" as an independent young lady, and as a woman torn between love and principle. Jane's strong personality and wits overwhelm the basic fact that she's not unusually pretty. And Rochester is a brilliantly sexy Byronic anti-hero with a prickly, mercurial wit.Of Charlotte Bronte's few novels, \\"Jane Eyre\\" is undoubtedly the most brilliant -- passionate, dark and hauntingly eerie.

This is the cloth bound version or the book with the lovely attached ribbon bookmark. This is a very lovely version of this book."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Jane Eyre is the story of a young girl who grows up and is forever contrary to her society. The book foreshadows the penalties that society gives for such opposition, but Jane still remains opposed to the role society wants her to have. In Jane Eyre, Charlotte Bronte uses foreshadowing, symbolism, and conflict to show her society how a woman can overcome the conventions of her society to live a happy and full life.An example of foreshadowing comes during Jane's engagement. First there is the splitting of the chestnut tree (page 226), soon after Rochester and Jane become engaged: \\"Before I left my bed in the morning, little Adele came running in to tell me that the great horse-chestnut at the bottom of the orchard had been struck by lightning in the night, and half of it split away.\\" This event foreshadows how the upcoming wedding between Jane and Rochester will divide the two, sending one away, because they are not ready for marriage. It is not until Jane and Rochester both overcome the conventions of their society that they can have a happy marriage.The most dramatic example of foreshadowing comes right after Jane's dreams. After waking from her disturbing dreams, Jane sees a light in her room and finds a grotesque female figure standing over her (250). The figure is Bertha Mason, who came to terrify Jane out of marriage. After rending Jane's veil in two, Bertha leaves and Jane collapses. The rending of the veil foreshadows the obstacle still in front of Jane's upcoming marriage, and it is not until this obstacle is dealt with that Jane can marry.Aside from foreshadowing, Charlotte Bronte uses symbolism, mostly of birds, to show how Jane's society confines her. For example, Jane's surname comes from the word for a bird's nest, aerie. Rochester gives an additional example of the bird symbolism on page 232 when he says \\"Jane, be still, don't struggle so, like a wild frantic bird that is rending its own plumage in its desperation.\\" Rochester says this when he is trying to convince Jane that they can be married. At this time Jane is struggling with the barriers that her society places on their union. Jane is the bird that society traps in a cage, keeping her away from the man she wants to marry. Eventually, Jane does find a way to overcome her cage and obtain happiness with Rochester.Bronte also uses people to symbolize certain aspects of her society. Mr. Brocklehurst, for example, is the epitome of hypocrisy, as shown during his inspection of Lowood. While surveying the girls in the school, Mr. Brocklehurst condemns one for having naturally curly hair, a vanity of the world in his opinion, and yet Brocklehurst goes so far as to buy curled wigs for his wife and daughters. In addition to this, Brocklehurst manages the funds of Lowood and never allocates enough money to keep the girls sufficiently warm or well fed. Instead of teaching the girls to live pious and frugal lives, he leaves them weakened in front of the onslaught of winter illnesses. These characteristics of Mr. Brocklehurst make him a symbol of the typical man from Jane's society. Jane's ability to overcome the wrongs he does to her shows her society how to rise above society and obtain a happy life.Throughout this book, Jane clashes with the conventions of her society until she rises above them. The greatest example of Jane's opposition to her society is in her successful marriage to Rochester. \\"Reader, I married him,\\" Jane says on page 397. Jane does not say that they were married, or that Rochester proposed to her again. Instead, she states that she took the active role and married Rochester. Such assertion from a woman went against the standard role of women in Bronte's time. Jane opposes the role that society has established for her and rises above it, obtaining the thing that truly made her happy.Charlotte Bronte focuses on overcoming the conventions of her society by having Jane Eyre oppose and surmount them. Foreshadowing shows how society will react to such opposition, such as when Jane and Rochester are initially engaged. Symbolism also helps to illustrate the confines of convention; they cage Jane just like a bird. And the various clashes between Jane and other characters, even her society, further illustrated the limitations of conventionality. But opposing and overcoming the conventionality of society can lead to true and lasting happiness."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Charlotte Bronte discusses one the most important issues we face today in our society--namely a girl's struggle to be loved but also to be socially and mentally independent. Jane Eyre is a lonely, miserable child, who finally becomes a happy, satisfied wife. She does so only after struggling and suffering as a child and later as a young woman. Although the content is very interesting for most, I believe that Bronte could have fitted it in 280 instead of 480 pages.Jane initially maintains her romantic relationships superficial since, according to her, they will result in her lack of independence. Jane's romances with Rochester and St. John are not essentially based on true love, and thus, do not flourish. Rochester is interested in Jane because of her intelligence and piano skills; however, Jane believes that the great social differences between her and Rochester make her unworthy of this relation. A marriage would mean abiding by a husband's orders and the household's chores, which definitely is not her connotation of love. Jane's undeveloped romantic relationships fortify her desire for independence and romance simultaneously.Only by becoming socially and economically equal to Rochester does Jane finally seek a deep, lasting romantic relationship, fulfilling Bronte's assertion that a rational balance between emotions and desires is required to become happy. Jane's acquaintance with her cousins provides her the emotional support she seeks throughout the novel. An added support is Jane's inheritance of her wealthy uncle, which makes her not only socially but also economically equal to Rochester. Now that Jane is economically, socially, and emotionally autonomous, she can accept Rochester's proposal.In Jane Eyre, Jane discovers the secret of having a happy life through rationally balancing her desires for independence and her emotions towards Rochester and St. John. Nowadays, many young women struggle to achieve this balance. Therefore, I greatly encourage any who face that same problem to read this book. Maybe you will find your solution in one of the pages."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"This is a pretty good book, as far as it captures Jane's character and tells a decent story of romance. Although i have to say that the plot isn't really the tightest, the righting and foreshadowing is very fine, and the play between the narrator describing herself and others.Like Jane herself says, she is not really an angel, and really is more of a woman's woman than otherwise, just by the way the plot turns out. On the one hand she defends her virtue, and her \\"station\\", in a reasonable sort of way, but the narrator of course is the character, and she gets a bit self-righteous and indignant at times without much good cause. The \\"idea\\" of love kind of turns out to be just what will make the best story. Of course a good story is hard to write, but this is why I say it has the feel of an indignant biography.Other than that I wouldn't knock this book too much. The opening 10 chapters and Helen Burns are very touching and you'll see the character, try to survive and lose all of the sweetness that a Helen Burns has over time, which is kind of sad in a way. The book is good though b/c it shows the reasons for her emotional decline from Helen's sort of pure beautiful spirituality into a real sort of adult. I'm not a historian of this period or anything, but it seems like this book is pretty good."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I read it for the first time when I was studing english and loved the book.

Defenseless. Powerless. This is the reality of Jane Eyre, a young orphan girl forced to cope with the callous world around her as a child. After the death of her parents, Jane is forced to reside with her cruel aunt, Mrs. Reed, who despises her, and consequently sends Jane away to Lowood, a boarding school with little resources and poor housing conditions. Despite malnutrition and a harsh atmosphere, Jane strives to make her mark at the school, eventually becoming a teacher. Before she realizes it, Jane tries to escape from her old life and embarks on a new journey as a governess under the employment of a secretive and guarded gentleman. As Jane falls in love with her mysterious employer, she struggles to safeguard the little confidentiality she has left to protect herself from the secrecy and ill-will of others. Although Jane cautiously guards her heart instead of exposing her soul, a revelation of truth eventually catches up to her, causing more harm than the wrath of the deepest secrets. Jane finds herself trapped between truth and lies as she faces her past, her situation, and herself in a world where all odds are against her. Jane Eyre has remained a classic in literature because Bront illustrates the necessity of secrets in life, therefore supporting the tendency of human nature to occasionally slip in a guilt-free secret or two into one's life."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"From the novels of this type (the romantic classics) that I have read, I would say this is one of the better ones. Her other book Wuthering Heights (that I read few years before this), left me baffled at the notion that that was a love story. Jane Eyre, however, is a true love story. It is beautifully written, and Bronte does a wonderful job in developing the character: Jane. By the end I felt I knew her.The book is quite lengthy, which is its only fault. There are many places in the book that could have been shortened. I tried to read the book a second time, but I managed to get only a third way through.It is a lovely story. I recommend it if you hunger for a love story. It is lengthy, so some patience is needed at times, but it is well worth it."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"This is an absolutely awesome book. I didn't really think I would like it all that much when I started it, but it turned out to be one of my all-time favorite books. I recommend it highly."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I read this book in junior high school and, like so many other girls, fell head over heels in love with Mr. Rochester; after all this time, the book is still a terrific read. The first part is classic Cinderella with an interesting twist. Jane is an orphan who is abused and mistreated by her rich and evil stepmother and her nasty cousins; unlike Cinderella, Jane stands up age age 10 and fights back. She is promptly shunted off to a school for girls from poor families, where she spends the next eight years. Needing a change of scene and environment, she answers an advertisement for a governess and enters the household of Mr. Rochester. Rochester, however, is no Prince Charming; he's 17 or 18 years older than Jane, hard, bitter, cynical, selfish, and, unknown to all but a few, encumbered with a wife who is the prototype of the \\"mad wife in the attic\\". Rochester is a romantic at heart, however; he is captivated by Jane's innocence and simplicity.Many years' distance from junior high school has led me to re-think the entire creation of Mr. Rochester. When all is said and done, he's a very curious romantic hero. In fact, this guy is a world-class jerk. What kind of \\"hero\\" would deliberately try to trap an innocent young girl into a sham marriage? He makes all kinds of rationalizations to himself that his Maker will understand and approve of what he's doing, but come on, now, who is he kidding? Imagine an alternative plot line midway through the book: Jane doesn't write to her uncle in Madeira, so he remains ignorant of the planned wedding. He doesn't send anyone to England to prevent it, so the wedding goes off as scheduled. Five years and two or three children later, Jane finds out about Rochester's first marriage. Can you imagine how she would feel? Her marriage is a sham and her children are illegitimate. What would she say? How would she react? And how would Mr. Rochester feel knowing he had brought this calamity on her by his own selfishness? I don't know about war, but all is definitely not fair in love. Mr. Rochester is a selfish ess-oh-bee.Anyway, the alternative never happened an we all know how the book really comes out so there is no sense in rehashing the plot; suffice to say that Bronte is a marvelous storyteller. The one problem I really have with Jane Eyre is the same that arises in Bronte's other books, and that is her stifling insularity; she seems unable to find value in anything that outside her own narrow, English Protestant frame of reference. However, this is a small caveat in this book. \\"Jane Eyre\\" is a classic romantic novel that has entranced generations of readers and looks good for generations to come, flawed hero and all.Judy Lind"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I first read &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; when I was entering my sophomore year in high school. I was so fascinated by the beautiful language, expressing the love between Jane and Edward Rochester. I love Edward so much, because he is human. He is depressed with his life, and wishes for another. He searched for another, taking any and every risk he needs to...even adultery or bigamy. His love for Jane is deep and real, as is her love for him. This classic hasn't lost it's details, details about hope, love, and dreams, in the some 150 years since it's been published. I still enjoy it, even after reading it about 100 times!!~ I consider it the greatest love story ever written.....a story that defies the stuffy rules and regulations of 19th century England. It just shows that love can be more powerful than anything. With that, I give this story 5 stars....only wishing I could give it all the stars in the world. Why? Because it deserves that!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Come along all you romance readers and enjoy the best love story by the greatest writer of all time.

But when I got older, and could read at my own pace and place, the book is one of the best mysteries ever written. I can't imagine going to a horrible school like Lowood, but perhaps that was preferable to living with her Aunt Reed, a most disagreeable person even unto her death. I cried when she and Mr. Rochester could not get married because of the 'house secret'. She seemed to have such a hard life anyway, that was icing on the cake, or de-icing if you will. The book flowed smoothly and I even managed to get past the 'true English'. I've always had trouble reading English writers, but Charlotte Bronte is an exceptional writer. I like when she addresses her audience, &#34;Reader, you would not believe this but...&#34;, etc. As I said it's a great mystery, and autobiography, but I don't want to say more to spoil the story! Chance it to say, if you've only read the book because, 'you had to', read it again in a new light. I'm taking all of the books I read in my English classes that were 'necessary to read', and giving them a second go-round.

This was the very first classic novel that I ever read in English. As I needed that for an exam, and didn't have enough knowledge for reading the original I was supposed to read an abridged version. And so I did. And I loved the book.Years later, I decided to read the real thing, the original novel. Much to my surprised it turned out to be highly accessible, and as entertaining and a nice read as the abridged version. Moreover, in the original book I could find all the details, and were able to savor Charlotte Bront's language.Written more than 150 years ago, \`Jane Eyre' reads as fresh as a XXI Century novel. Bront's use of language is vivid and remarkable. Her descriptions bring the book into life. We cannot forget that the book is the social portrait of the women in the writer's society. It shows how they struggled --and failed most of the time-- to reach a respectable position in the society.Jane didn't have any attractive that was required in her time. She wasn't rich or even beautiful, although smart. But smartness wasn't a good thing for a woman in those days. She is even punished for having brains. She ends up being a governess, and end up having a humiliating experience, being forced to change places and even name. Ms Eyre is only noticed when she receives a heritage and becomes rich. And she does not let all she has suffered affect her.\`Jane Eyre' is a novel ahead its time. This book is about feminism much before the term was created. When Jane speaks to her aunt about her rights --can you imagine a girl speaking about her rights in that time-- she is doing what other women would do years later. Charlotte Bront has managed to creat a strong and sad girl, who is trying to find her place in the world. With that, the writer made a book that will be read for generations to come --even if they read an abridged version before reading the unabridged book."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"This book, like my title says, was hard for me to put down. I just became so inthralled in the book and its characters.You become, early on, compassionate to Jane's pain, hopeful with Jane's encounter with Mr. Rochester, afraid for her when she meets with a ghastly face, and so on and so forth.At times I almost didn't want Jane with Mr. Rochester, but in the end he won me over. Their love is unique, it was very nurturing and longing, but love nonetheless.I recommend this book to anyone who likes a good love story with a little suspense all throughout."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"I have read this book several times, on differentoccasions, and ech time I've enjoyed it immensely.This is one of those classic stories that will stay with youforever. It appears simple on the surface, but underneath itare well-thought out passages.Bronte is a superb artist, weaving her two main characters, each suffering in their life, into a tapestry of love. Each so different from each other, yet each needing the otherdesparately.I recommend this book highly."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"First of all, I would just like to say that Jane Eyre is most likely a good book for all those bookworms out there. I am postive that you will not be disappointed with this book if you like classical and dramatic novels. Yes, the novel may seem to be a little long, but it keeps you interested and guessing to the very end. Don't get me wrong, it is not some book that is a mystery. Although, the end is very unpredictable and I had no idea which path Jane Eyre was going to take.When I opened the first few pages of this book, I must admit that I was questioning whether or not this was going to bea dull and drab story. It seemed as though this might be a challenging book to be able to finish. Although, after some questioning, the plot took a turn for the better. The story really started to pick up as I began to enter the life of the orphan, Jane Eyre. The uninteresting beginning was well worth reading because the story was really good.This story begins with Jane Eyre living with her mean Aunt Reed and cruel cousins. She goes through awful torments like being locked up in a dark room all night. The beginning of the story kind of reminded me of the enchanting story of Cinderella. Jane is then sent off to school all alone in the world to become a well-educated lady. She thinks she begins to find happiness there, but some awful things happened. She then goes to Thornfield Hall to try to be a teacher. She actually ends up falling in love with her master, Mr. Rochester. Jane once again begins to feel that everything is going well and that she actually might have found true happiness. Jane and Mr. Rochester are then about to be married when an awful secret is revealed about Mr. Rochester. Jane then has to figure out whether to stay with her one and only true love or just move on to a different life and forget that all of this happened. Jane then does take a small journey away from Thornfield to find out where to go from there.I found that this book contained mystery, drama, romance, andeverything else a person could ask for in a book. This book is the type of book that you would want to take and curl up in bed and just keeping reading it to the very end. There was great detail about the life that Jane Eyre and all the feeling she felt were revealed to the reader. I seemed to really be part of the story and sometimes forgot where I was. There were also some amazing twists in the story that kept me guessing about who did that or why is that women so suspicious. There was also many characters that kept the story alive and interesting. Although, once and awhile it did seem as though the story was confusing. Things were being said and I was not quite sure who was saying them and places I was not quite sure what was going on. Although, with some of this negativism, everything else made up for it. All and all, it was a really good book. For me, it seems to reflect back on today's life. All Jane was doing was trying to find acceptence, love, and happiness. It seems at this day an age, that all people are trying to do is find true love and someone to be there. For this reason, I think that many of you would really love this book and read it. The novel is well worth the reading. I am sure that once you began the story that you will just want to keep reading it to find out if Jane really does find what she is looking for and if she finds true happiness. Now it is you turn to go to your library and check out this great classical novel that you are just going to love.The grade I would give this book would be about a low grade A because sometimes it was confusing. Highly recommended for people who like drama and romance."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"Reading Jane Eyre for the first time, I was engulfed in the novel itself: the characters, the plot, and the setting completely draw the reader's attention and make it difficult to put down. The second time, I read it slower, paying special attention to the characterization, something Charlotte Bronte is terrific at, and the various details that I may have overlooked originally, but which add to the general enjoyment of the novel. The third time, I read Jane Eyre for the language - Bronte's style is captivating: every word, every sentence has a beauty within it that a reader wouldn't want to miss. I read it, again and again, because her words made everything seem new and exciting no matter how often I read them. The explicit descriptions, the prolonged narration, the time she takes to develop the charaters - everything creates a novel that one can read over and over.

Mr. Rochester, a sardonic, bitter man, accepts Jane as governess to his ward; from there their feelings begin to develop for each other. Mr. Rochester is not the conventional hero (one might even imagine him to be an ugly man), which makes the tale more believable (and thankfully steers it away from bodice-ripping romantic territory).All in all, this is a great book with the usual plot twists, reversals, and character revelations one would expect from its genre."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (New Windmill)","review":"After reading this story, I feel safe and sound, a large genuine feeling.

I later read 'The Constitution of Society,'which is where one should go for Giddens's full statement of 'structuration theory,' but I'm especially fond of this work, which really is a collection of articles treating different concepts (power, structure, domination, contradiction, conflict, etc.). Giddens discusses a vast range of authors in an attempt to synthesize them into a coherent framework of social theory; sometimes, I think he indulges in displaying his erudition, but I think overall it's invigorating to see so many different figures brought into a synoptic vision. I don't think the synthesis always works - structuration theory impressed me less and less after thinking about it over the years - but this book felt like a series of fascinating puzzles that motivated me to read further into rather than turn away from sociology and social theory."},{"Title":"Central Problems in Social Theory: Action, Structure, and Contradiction in Social Analysis","review":"Giddens' approach to theory takes functional-structuralism and gives it a diachronic facelift. One of the greatest flaws in structuralism (sorry LS) is that it does not address problems related to social change in context of time and place. Giddens' attempts to do this, albeit with a few flaws, but all in all is a sound theoretical base from which to pull from when creating models.Kind of repetitive at times, considering it is a collection of articles rather than one manuscript."},{"Title":"Central Problems in Social Theory: Action, Structure, and Contradiction in Social Analysis","review":"It seems unneccessarily complicated riddle to solve to us, sociologists. actually Giddens's writing style in this title is not that easy to grasp judging from sociological convention. and worse he cited too many names like Saussure, Hegel, Levi-Strauss, Heidegger, Husserl and even Derrida and Wittgenstein! those that makes readers wandering around jargons from philosophy. because this book stem from the controversial atmosphere of 70s when French Structuralism prevailed over intellectural map. Giddens wanted to conter their assertions. we can see he was right at 80s when structurism collapsed into trendy postmodernist jargons. Anyway I recommend to read this title if u read 'The Constitution of Society'. which title is not that hostile to reader like this title. but something lacks on it. You can find what miss in later masterpiece. This title is somewhat earlier endeavor to clarify his theory of structuration. so thorems were not that clearly founded. it makes it the way to hostility to readers but sometimes this kind of imperfection is more valuable to portray one's image of theory."},{"Title":"The Millionaire's Proposition (Silhouette Romance No. 1413)","review":"Ironically, the reviewer below who said this book was like the movie A TOUCH OF MINK actually got me to set aside the rest of my TBR pile and read this book!

Chafer is clearly orthodox and conservative concerning all of protestant doctrinal points, which positions, it is worth noting, are always sustained and supported by the Scriptures. He doesn't base his account on scholarship, which comes into play only sporadically and oftenly to serve as an example of some trend of thought.Chafer employs Scripture's passages extensively, what makes the study rich and slow at the same time if one intends to check on every quote of the Bible. It is true that some of the passages evoked not always seem to corroborate to his point clearly, though always somewhat related to the issue, but that's the price one pays for fulfilling barely every page with intended Scripture's proof.Conservative points of view are evident, as well as the criticism towards liberal theology, what grants that sometimes we have dogmatic assertions and scarce problematization on the question. Not always are we presented to the suposed \\"proofs\\" of the \\"enemy\\", only to their arguments, to which a steady refutation follows right away.The volumes are definitely thorough, comprising every tradicional division of Systematic Theology and adding to it some new aspects the author finds proper to depict. Volume 8 is an index one, a tremendous aid for searching especific topics through the set. It should not surprise that there is an author index however lacking a systematized bibliography: that's due to the emphasis on biblical passages rather than scholarship authorities.Curiously,it is a vast work although not a properly deep one. It brings lots of quotes from the Bible, but it is not the pourpose to discuss exegetically or hermeneutically some questions. To that, specific books are required, though a very good indication of the problem is offered in Chafer's presentation.It is a recommended work, worthy of high complements and, naturally, some critics also."},{"Title":"Systematic Theology(8 Vol. Set)","review":"THE AD SAYS 4 VOLUMES, 2 VOLUMES IN EACH BOOK; I WAS SHIPED 1 VOLUME IN 1 BOOK...

Just finished Vol.1 of 8-Vol. set. Final judgment pending.2. Appears to work with limited set of expositors and theologians. Pending further review.3. Very readable. Certainly good for laymen.4. Quotes biblical texts for facility without flipping back and forth through Bible.5. Still examining the Church/Israel distinction, the &quot;one-people of God&quot; versus &quot;two-people of God&quot; view. Entrenched in former, but attempting to give Chafer fair hearing.6. He makes a few outrageous statements about &quot;spiritualizing&quot; OT texts, as if reformed people somehow do that, willy nilly, subjectivistically, without guidance. Not so. Read Hodge, Vol.3. There is, within didactic sections of scripture, allowances for such. Reformed people are not &quot;spiritualizers&quot; and &quot;allegorists&quot;, e.g. Origen, but, like Calvin, adhere to &quot;sensus naturalis&quot;. Hence, utmost caution is required in reading Chafer.7. I note that B.B. Warfield had very serious issues with Chafer. Stated that Warfield had Calvinistic outer garments with Semi-Pelagian and Arminian undergarments. His work on divine decrees was solid, however, in treatment of Holy Spirit at a few points, it appears that Warfield may be correct. This also cannot be assessed apart from the Keswick movement. Judgment pending.8. It is somewhat redemptive to me that Lewis invited Anglican scholar and former Principal of Wycliffe Hall, Oxford, W.H.Griffith Thomas to be a professor of systematic theology at Dallas Seminary in 1924. Before the seminary opened in 1924, unfortunately, Griff died that summer. One wonders had he taught there, if a stronger ecclesiology and stronger confessionalism would have emerged. After all, Griff was a Prayer Book man and wrote a most solid &quot;Introduction to Theology&quot;, a credible, evangelical commentary on the Thirty-nine Articles. At this point, Dallas Seminary is a-confessional, non-confessional, baptistic, independentistic, and, unlike the NT church, non-connectional.9. Another problem noted at the beginning. Lewis tells us he will essentially leave historical matters out of his purview as he &quot;gathers the facts&quot; (note Baconianism) from the Bible &quot;inductively&quot;. Leaving historical connnections out is most unwise. As George Orwell noted, &quot;He who controls the present, controls the past&quot;. Systematics may not be done without &quot;exegesis&quot; nor without historical sensitivity. This was a major fault here. Griff, noted above, would never have travelled down that standard evangelical, American path....historical amnesia and individualism, as if the Holy Spirit just began his &quot;indwelling ministry&quot; 10 years ago. Heavily faulted here for this.10. Having noted the above, Lewis shon brilliantly in Christology. I likened his orthodox collation and comments on Christological texts to the &quot;burning bush&quot; of Exodus 3. This dear, but deceased brother (yes, am a covenantal Calvinist who dearly loves this brother, who is in the &quot;Jeruslem above&quot; among millions praising his Savior), lit a fire in this home as he, though dead, preached over in the corner. I will never forget Lewis' presentation of the excellencies of Christ.11. Also, his opening section on the place, position, content, and authority of infallible Scripture and the necessity of systematic theology was inspiring. Would that all Dallas seminarians had his passion for systematics. From our observation, it appears that has been lost among modern Dallas grads.12. Again, judgement pending. Starting Volume 2 this morning, 23 April 2004. For new readers, enjoy. He loved his Lord and he will show you His face.

Too many rely on a systematic theology instead of studying scripture and taking the time to get the tools necessary for that task. Chafer is of the old school dispensationalism (Scofield, Larkin, and C. H. Mackintosh) and not the more recent progressive dispensationalism school of thought."},{"Title":"Systematic Theology(8 Vol. Set)","review":"This work is Sunday schoolish and dated. But, what most people do not understand about Chafer is his advocacy for two theologies that were novel in his day and led to horrible consequences. They are, 1)No Lordship required for salvation, and, 2)Dispensationalist. His position on the non-lordship teaching has spawned an untold number of false professing believers hopelessly deceived they are saved because they stated a prayer but never surrendered to Christ as Lord, something Chafer thought was works. Read John MacArthur's \\"The Gospel According to Jesus\\" to see a skillful refutation of this devilish teaching. Chafer founded the Dallas Theol. Seminary, the wellspring for easy-believism, and the \\"carnal Christian\\" distortion. If someone wanted to destroy Christianity, I could not think of a better way to do it, than to tell people they can be saved without repenting. It's unbelievable the church bought into this cheap grace doctrine which probably includes some of your favorite radio teachers like Chuck Swindoll. Don't misunderstand, Swindoll and others like him are outstanding evangelicals and communicators, but listen carefully when they call people to Christ. Not a word about repentance since they falsely believe there are two kinds of Christians. Two levels. Those who have accepted Christ as Savior, and those who have Him as their Lord. Chafer's hyper-dispensational bent also denied the Gospel material as not applicable for Gentile believers today. In an amazing statement Chafer says the Sermon on the Mount is Law and not part of the gospel. This is sheer heresy, and most dispensationalists (progressive)deny or shy away from this distortion today. Dispensational teaching is new (historically speaking) and changing everyday. Read Wayne Grudemn's systematic instead. Much smaller, a hundred times better, more understandable, up to date, and even handed."},{"Title":"Systematic Theology(8 Vol. Set)","review":"Even though I believe almost everything written in this set of books, the presentation is dismal.

However, I was surprised at reading one review which makes a comparison to Monty Python. That reviewer also suggested that Chafer's approach was for a believer to check their mind at the door of a church before entering.I must admit, I have no idea where this person is coming from. Chafer has one of the most careful, logical and systematic approaches to theology that I have ever read (and I have a huge library). I know of several pastors whose ministry was changed profoundly because of this one book. There is nothing anti-intellectual about Chafer's approach; there is nothing which is dumbed-down. Bear in mind, this is a 4 volume set. My abridged version is about 1000 pages. In particular, Chafer's approach to the Angelic Conflict is exemplary.I have only one criticism, and that is with the abridged version: somethimes, a point will be made which is true, but the Scripture quoted is not directly on point. I do not know if that is the fault of Chafer or the fault of the abridged text.My recommendation is, if you are going to own just one book (or set of books) which cover nearly the entire realm of doctrine, this should be it."},{"Title":"Systematic Theology(8 Vol. Set)","review":"Chafer's eight volume Systematic Theology is skillfully written from a premillinnial, dispensational view. He not only beautilfully covers all the disciplines from Theology Proper to Eschatology, but also the various uses of the word &quot;theology&quot; as well as the eight Biblical Covenants and the Dispensations. It is a comprehensive work on each topic but not written in a lofty manner which would be tedious for the reader. Chafer has made the study of Systematic Theology alive and exciting."},{"Title":"Systematic Theology(8 Vol. Set)","review":"Chafer's Systematic Theology is truly a monumental and deeply thorough treatment of theology in the field of systematics. I began reading this work about three years ago and have benefitted so much from it. I would have to agree with the previous Dallas grad, that though Chafer's work is still the 'Dispensational Standard' it does have its moments of sheer brilliance and some of eisegesis. Like all works of such depth and length, there are major high points and low points in the work. Briefly, I will speak a little about both.The best areas are found in the study of Prolegomena (Study Prior to the Task of Theology), Angelology (Angels), Harmartiology (Sin), and, yes, Eschatology (End Times). His Prolegomena is simply superb, I love his thorough treatment and he quotes quite often from another giant in the field during his time, B.B. Warfield. It is clear that though he and Warfield disagreed on the Doctrines of Grace (somewhat), and the Sanctification of the Christian, they most definitely did not disagree on Bibliology and all that it means to the Evangelical community.His treatment of Angelology has more depth than the normal Systematic Theology gives, excellent treatment here. His excellent work is also shown in his book 'Satan' from a much earlier period in his life, a preparation period in his thinking on the subject. His Doctrine of Sin is very good and works closely with that of the Reformed views on depravity. One must be honest that His explanation of 'depravity' does not mean that a person is a spiritually immovable 'rock' that has no spiritual sensitivity. The charges of Arminianism and 'Semi-Pelagianism' are unwarranted and irresponsible. Chafer, throughout his systematic work, distances himself from both of these positions. It has become all too common for the Reformed to label people like this instead of express clearly the man's views. If one must 'label' him, we would say he is 'Semi-Augustinian' not 'Semi-Pelagian' (in accord with the Synod of Orange, 529 AD) and deeply orthodox. Chafer simply believed there was a genuiness to the call to believe in the Savior, though He holds to the work of 'irresistible grace' in some manner. He stresses more the side of the human response of faith, with the background/foundation in the work of God's grace, than the Reformed community would like here. This is a more honest treatment of Chafer, both in the Doctrine of Sin and His Doctrines on Salvation.Lastly, Eschatology is strong not because of its common applications to the End Times from the Dispensational Hermeneutic (Historical-Grammatical), but because of the place Chafer gives it in his overall Systematic Theology. In his Prolegomena, Chafer explains how (during his time) there is a great lack of focus on the study of eschatology. Chafer meant to remedy this and the movement he so popularized and systematized (Dispensationalism) has done so, much to the disdain of many. Though I believe Chafer's views to be somewhat dated (at times), as well as problematic in expression in part, I believe given the historical context of his life Chafer's work in Eschatology is of dire importance. Historical setting is everything to truly capture a man's theology and voice.Chafer (and many others with his sympathies) lived in a time where the Reformed community did not have a multitude of great proponents and expositors of the progressiveness of God's revelation in human history. They lacked focus on the earthliness/materialness of God's promises and were weak (and commonly have always been) in 'Biblical Theology' as opposed to Systematic/Dogmatic Theology. Chafer came at a time when the Church needed a man to refocus it gaze upon the immanency of Christ's return and the focus of God's social/political promises to Israel. This is captured fully in his work, though it does have its problems. For this section alone, Chafer needs to be read. However, after Chafer's death (1952), many within and outside the Reformed community came to recognize the growing need for a reworking of Reformed expression and a refocus on the earthly/material elements of God's promises and the progressiveness of revelation in human history. Men such as Geerhardus Vos had already been moving this direction at the time of Chafer and set the stage for this reformation of focus within the Reformed community which lead to later greats within the Reformed tradition, such as Herman Ridderbos and Anthony Hoekema, who gave important contributions to areas where Reformed theology has historically been weaker. Areas such as 'Reformed Biblical Theology' (Vos/Ridderbos) and a reworking on the earthly character of the New Heavens and New Earth in Reformed Eschatology (Hoekema).Chafer's weaker areas: Ecclesiology, Soteriology (I hesitate here, but it is so at times) which includes the spiritual walk of the Christian, and a few other subjective areas to watch for in his references (Vol. 7 in the Old Ed., Part I of Vol. 4 in the 1993 Ed.). I think the weakest part of the Bible Church Movement (and notice I did not say Dispensationalism, for they are not the same essentially) is its lack of confessionalism and unity. The 'Free Church/Independent Church' movement has done much good, but overall it weakens the confession of the church to a lost world, it breaks unity/fellowship in many areas of the overall life of the church, and creates an almost exclusivity. I have grown up and been a part of the bible church movement for 25 years now and have recognized the movement is lacking in so many ways; it truly is a disservice to the Body of Christ. Notice I did not say Dispensational views 'on the Church', but the practices of the Bible Church movement which Chafer, though a Presbyterian/Congregationalist, popularized. I think much of what he said about the program of the church within the overall outworking of God's plan is very beneficial to the Church and gives us a clear view of discontinuity with God's program for the Church (though too much at times).Soteriology is very strong on many areas (Forensic Justification, Imputation, Positional Righteousness, Glorification, Propitiation, Expiation) but I find Chafer wanting on the area of sanctification. Understand that my sympathies are not with the Reformed view essentially, but because Chafer, in his reaction against the 'Oxford Movement' and others of its kind during his time, seems to overemphasize sometimes the positional/objective truths of scripture. I say this hesitantly because I know Chafer held to subjective assurance (Rom. 8:16, Jas. 2, 1 Pet. 1:5-11) as well. Occasionally, Chafer does seem to overemphasize the first truth too much which allows people to charge him with 'Antinomianism' like a previous reviewer. I think that charge is also unwarranted since Chafer clearly held (as the majority of Dispensationalists do) to the 'Law of Christ' as rule for this Dispensation. There is no Antinomianism in that, there never has been. This argument is a straw man and should be left behind. A more careful analysis of Chafer's views on the Christian life needs to be set forth.Though I do slightly disagree with his 'emphasis' on objective/positional truths, which to a degree takes away from the essential command to 'Follow Jesus', I do understand what he was combating at the time. I'm not sure what he would say today given the current climate of the Evangelical tension between 'Lordship/Free Grace'. Previous reviewers like to call him 'no-lordship', once again, another straw man. I've worked for and with ministries of Zane Hodges, and to be sure, Chafer would not be a FG'er to the expression of Hodges or others of His ilk. He would be somewhere in the middle like the majority of people today, yet probably sympathetic to the FG view. I believe the area most problematic in Chafer's Soteriology is around his filled/not filled view of walking in the Spirit, a view I held for a while. It's incorrect, plain and simple. The filling of the Holy Spirit does not come when you simply confess sin (1 Jn. 1:9) and have fellowship with God (1 Jn. 1:1-5), then you are not filled when you knowingly sin, thus losing fellowship. The filling of the Spirit is not an 'On/Off' button. The Filling of the Spirit is an active, growing obedience to the things of God by the power of the H.S. I thank God Charles Ryrie corrected this problem in His work, 'The Holy Spirit'. This is a much more accurate treatment on the subject of walking/living by the Spirit and being filled in Him.In conclusion, Chafer held a few different (some even unorthodox) views on a couple secondary issues. He does hold to some form of Gap Theory (between Gen. 1:1, 2), which was very popular back in his time. What seemed heretical was his quotation of E.W. Bullinger in his references section on the 'Immediate State'. Bullinger is an annihilationist and doesn't fully hold to human consciousness after death. Chafer quotes Bullinger in this section and he clearly sympathizes somewhat with his view. Clearly unfortunate.Overall, Chafer's 'Systematics' is an excellent work. He is very conservative, evangelical, orthodox, Dispensational, and has written a very thorough treatment on the essential doctrines of the Christian Faith. It is also a work that is well-written and easy to follow for the layperson. Every person in or thinking about ministry should have his work. Chafer truly was a great systematizer and writer; this is most ably shown in his Magnum Opus, his Systematic Theology."},{"Title":"Systematic Theology(8 Vol. Set)","review":"Bought the set in about the third year I was a Christian.

While dispensationalism existed before Chafer, and though it has been refined sense his day (much to the chagrin of some!), this work is a must-read for anyone who wants to interact honestly with the position.Positively, it is very well written. It is elegant, and the language at times is exalted. Chafer's passion for his subject drips from the pages, as does his distain for views he deems heretical. Further, it is thorough. Even today nothing has been written to match its scope and depth, and for this one thing alone, the books are worth their price. Finally, it is an excellent presentation of dispensationalism as a whole. There is little by way of \\"sloganeering\\" and still fewer unexplained assumptions. Thus, at the end of any given discussion, one can assess whether he agrees or disagrees with Chafer and be able to explain why, if he so chooses.The negative is not enough to warrant the loss of the fifth star, and it is only this: Chafer perhaps holds the discipline of systematic theology slightly higher than it deserves. By this, I mean that he is willing to submit the text to his theology, which can quickly lead to eisogesis. I am a firm believer that exegesis comes before theology, and on this point, Chafer may find himself in error. But any such examples of this are rare indeed; the only example that immediately comes to mind is his discussion on Eph. 2:8-10 and election. Read Kaiser's _Toward an Exegetical Theology_ for a more solid approach on this.So, all in all, I highly recommend this to anyone who wants to better understand dispensationalism. There are fewer clearer articulations, and certainly none more influential. Consider this a primary source!(Note: I consider myself a little more dispensational that Chafer himself in that I take several passages more literally than does he, and likewise, more \\"free grace\\"--a la Bing, Hixon, Hodges, etc.--so while I have a deep apprecation for Chafer and recognize my roots there, I am not in full agreement with all of his work.)"},{"Title":"Systematic Theology(8 Vol. Set)","review":"Clearly Chafer documented a good systemization of Dispensational Theology.

He does hold to an aspect of the Gap theory -- not uncommon for those of his era.I recommend it be included in any good personal library. It is an excellent resource for Biblical positions based on literal interpretation of scripture. (This literal hermeneutic leads to the Dispensational position. Mixing alagorical interpretation leaves the interpreter as the ultimate authority, choosing when God meant exactly what He said, and when to alagorize and as such determining what God really meant. This literal non-literal hermeneutic leads to the Covenant position.)For me this set was the text book for a 3-year series of theology courses."},{"Title":"Systematic Theology(8 Vol. Set)","review":"Lewis Sperry Chafer (1871-1952) was the first president of Dallas Theological Seminary, and one of the giants of dispensational theology.

Demons are depicted as the appointed tormentors of lost, human souls, who gladly prance around the realm of outer darkness \\"seeking whom they may devour.\\" This is an absurd concept, to say the least. According to the Bible, the lake of fire has been prepared as a place of final condmenation and judgment for both the devil and fallen angels.

After the day of final judgment, then Hell receives its population.Revelation 20:12-15\\"And I saw the dead, small and great, standing before God, and books were opened. And another book was opened, which is the Book of Life. And the dead were judged according to their works, by the things which were written in the books. The sea gave up the dead who were in it, and Death and Hades (*See note below) delivered up the dead who were in them. And they were judged, each one according to his works. Then Death and Hades were cast into the lake of fire (Hell). This is the second death. And anyone not found written in the Book of Life was cast into the lake of fire (Hell).* Hades\\"This is not the ultimate hell (Greek: gehenna) nor the same as the \\"lake of fire\\"(Hell) (Revelation 20:15).

David was left in the place of the dead, and his body saw corruption. Not so with Christ. According to ancient prophecy (Ps. 30:3) he was recalled to life.\\"In Christ's parable in Luke 16:23, he said \\"And being in torments in Hades, he [the rich man] lifted up his eyes and saw Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom\\" (NKJV).\\"Although the two compartments [of Hades] were impassable and separate from each other, they were within the range of mutual sight and sound.

Morris, The Defenders Study Bible).\\"The keys of hell\\" (hades) (Rev. 1:18)\\"Philosophers and occult religionists are always searching for the keys to life and death, but only Christ has them. \`Hell' [in the King James Version of Rev. 1:18] is mistranslated and is actually \`Hades,' the abode of departed souls... .

Remember folks, we're talking about the rest of your life - FOREVER ! That's a long time. Our lives so far have been a mere vapor (seconds)to what lies ahead.

Then,they push back momentarily before they fall into the pit for eternity.I was one of these people.

In doing so, I find the readers/reviewers of Wiese's book place Mr. Wiese in one of three categories: 1. He is telling the truth and is giving a valid divinely-inspired message from God to fear Hell; 2. He is a liar and false minister who is deceiving people with a false doctrine of Hell; or 3. He is involved in a New Age mystic cult leading people astray (violating doctrines of scripture and adopting a mystical interpretation of scripture). Obviously all three interpretations cannot be correct, and I leave it to reader to decide for themselves where Mr. Wiese and his book rest.Rather than place myself in any one of these camps, I instead choose to review the book's central message: to fear Hell as a real place of torment.Mr. Wiese claims he had an out of body experience where he was cast into Hell for 23 minutes, \\"rescued\\" by Christ, and then reentered his body again. During the 23 minutes away from his body, he experienced a prison cell in Hell, viewed a Lake of Fire, and also saw pits of fire with individual souls in them. Initially he did not know what to make of his experience, but was convinced that the Lord wanted him to tell others about the reality of Hell and the salvation grace offered through the person of Jesus Christ. And so, inspired and compelled by his visiou experience, Mr. Wiese began telling others about his visit to Hell, and as he did, he was invited to speak at churches near and far as his message spread. In 2006 he wrote his book detailing his visit to Hell.The book is not a literary masterpiece with flowery language and excellent prose. Rather, it is a simply written book, written perhaps at the 7th or 8th grade level, and the central message is quite simple to understand. There are numerous citations that refer to scriptural references that support Mr. Wiese's vision of Hell, and I invite the careful reader to refer to these citations in scripture as one reads the book. The message, plain and simple, is that because of sin and our breaking of the Law of God, our eternal destiny is Hell. Hell is a literal real place in the center of the earth, initially created and reserved for Satan and his rebellious demons, but is also the end-place for unrepentant sinners. However, through the redemptive work of Christ on the Cross, we can escape an eternity in Hell. Mr. Wiese cites John 14:6 as scriptural proof that Christ alone is the only way of salvation. Further, Christ does not send us to Hell, but we ourselves \\"choose\\" Hell as our eternal abode by not accepting Christ as our Saviour and faithfully obeying his teachings. Mr. Wiese sees his mission to warn people of the reality of Hell, and to turn from their sins and accept Christ as their Savior.The controversy surrounding this book stems from the skepticism of whether God would allow Mr. Wiese to experience such a hellish vision when we already have the final revelation of Christ and the Bible at hand. Skeptics take Mr. Wiese to task for \\"adding to\\" the Scriptures with his details of Hell and descriptions of demons. They especially are critical of his description of demons (reptillian), and his ending conversation with Jesus, claiming that Wiese is a heretic for going beyond the Scriptures (adding to scripture).I choose not to join the debate as to whether Mr. Wiese's experience was real or not. Again, since Wiese's central message is one of repentance and salvation through Jesus the Christ, and the avoidance of Hell, I find this doctrine valid. Christ Himself warned people of the reality of Hell, and multiple scriptures refer to demons chained in the Abyss of Hell awaiting their final torment in the Lake of Fire. Peter writes that Christ preached to these demons after his death on the cross to show them his final triumph over sin. Therefore, I believe Hell is a real place, has demons awaiting punishment in it, and will be the eventual eternity for Satan, his demons, and all of mankind who refuse to repent of sin and refuse the sacrifice of Jesus to atone for sin.Today's preachers for the most part do not preach on the subject of Hell. Perhaps it is too judgemental, or perhaps too negative, too supernatural, or too controversial a subject. Perhaps we are too \\"sofisticated\\" and \\"cultured\\" to believe in a literal Hell or even the person of Satan. This aside, Hell (and Satan) ARE biblical realities, and preachers of the Gospel have an obligation to tell their flock of the reality of both.Taken on the merits of its central message, I have no problem with this book. In fact, I believe it is the obligation of preachers of the Word to warn of the realities of Hell. And while converts to Christianity should do so with the ultimate purpose to bring service and glory to their Creator, if the fear of Hell is a starting point in one's salvation, and it leads to conviction and repentance of sin, then this book serves its purpose well.Jim Koenig"},{"Title":"23 Minutes In Hell: One Man's Story About What He Saw, Heard, and Felt in that Place of Torment","review":"I've had lunch with Bill Wiese, and he is the \\"real deal\\": humble, sincere, not self-seeking, and has a great story.

That said, most people, myself included, do better with a carrot and a stick approach to things. In this case, that means that there are truly tremendous benefits of living a Christian life (certainly many challenges as well) but there are also consequences for not being a Christian as well, and this book does a tremendous job of illustrating that. Regardless of what your spiritual beliefs are, this book provides a vivid picture of what the author's experience with hell was and, as such, might be an eye opening read for you. If you are a Christian, then you already believe there is a hell and this book will help you to re-affirm that belief and might even serve as a catalyst to re-commit your spiritual life to Christ.

A couple of these books comment that they saw no children in hell and that no children or people without the mental faculties to choose between right and wrong were in hell. One says that children appeared in Heaven to be about 10 years old.I am suspicious of anyone who dies and comes back with a political story to tell that perfectly fits some modern day political paradigm and other fantasy sounding stories. The books above do the best job of sticking to the experience itself.You can not expect persons who have had an extreme experience such as an NDE to leave out all religious comments relating to their past so you have to put up with some religious comment. After all, dying and seeing \\"the other side\\", is inherently religious whether anyone likes it or not.The writers appear to be Christian but I have no proof of that other than the words in the books themselves.

The balance of the book answers some very important questions that the average person would have after hearing the author's testimony. I feel that every Christian should read this book. You can't remain the same after reading about the author's experience. My husband is a Pastor, so we encounter questions regarding eternity frequently.

Now, if that's your goal in life, to warn others of the fiery pits of hell, fine. That's your path to walk... what bothered me was when I got to Page 61- \\"An Answer to a Prayer.\\" In this section the author speaks at a Russian CHURCH in California. Fine. Said that it was an Orthodox Church and many had been in the concentration camps in Germany. He focuses on one individual, a Russian JEW, who had been tossed into an oven in a prisoner camp and was later rescued and revived by a friend. According to the author, this Jewish man had died and was taken to hell. This man was now a devout Christian, and dedicated to serving the Lord. I'm not quite sure where the author is going with this. Is he saying Jews go to hell? And until you convert to Christianity you are taken to hell? As a person of the Jewish faith, and knowing that the Jewish people are God's chosen people, and in fact Jesus Christ HIMSELF was a Jew... this is highly disturbing to me on so many levels. The book lost all credibility to me at that point."},{"Title":"23 Minutes In Hell: One Man's Story About What He Saw, Heard, and Felt in that Place of Torment","review":"I appreciate the author for writing this book. All the experiences we can accrue in the body of human knowledge guide us closer to understanding truth.My biggest problem with this book is that I don't think the author understands the full nature of out-of-body experiences. I have had out-of-body experiences. I have had conversations and visceral experiences in our real world with the one we know as Christ.Just because one experiences something out-of-body does not mean it is a literal place. Often times they are used to teach us lessons for where we personally are in our own journey to enlightenment. I have witnessed, for example, UFO space stations at the bottom of well-mapped bodies of water in OBE experiences. Does that mean there's a space station down there? Probably not. Could there be one in another dimension? Maybe, maybe not. I don't know. The author does not seem to realize that our experiences in the spiritual realm are clouded by our journey in the physical.The author has been a fundamentalist Christian since 1970. He was committed to a belief in the \\"fire and brimstone\\" Hell decades before this occurrence. Showing him what he believes is more akin to the quantum physics principle of choosing one possibility out of infinite. In near-death studies, people who temporarily experience the tortures of a \\"Hell\\" tend to be those who believed in it to begin with and were afraid of it on some level. Those who never thought much about it, regardless of their spiritual tradition or lack thereof, have overwhelmingly positive experiences.At the end, I can't recommend this book for this reason, though it is important for the sake of psychology and neurological studies.

I didn't want to pay for it, or give Bill Wiese any money. The man is either a lying charlatan or a mentally unstable individual. Let me also say that the book's title may be a better description of my reading experience than anything that happened to him. The man cannot write at all. If you don't believe in Hell anyway, and are looking for a work of fiction, turn elsewhere. This is garbage.Now, on to the main review, which will focus on the warped theology rather than the quality(or lack of same) of the writing. The author claims that he was lying in bed one night, when suddenly, he was lifted up and dropped in a dark cell, where he was attacked by physical manifestations of evil and terror.Then, he began to explore, and took a self-guided tour of the Inferno. After twenty-three minutes, he was carried out of the place by Jesus, who explained what had happened and told him to tell the world about the reality of \\"hell\\".Truth be told, I don't know whether he's lying or simply delusional. However, the Bible says that \\"the dead know not anything.\\"(Ecc 9:5) Dead people are conscious of nothing. Bill Wiese claims to believe the Bible, but obviously, if the dead are unconscious, they're not being tortured in hell.Before I continue, I'm going to open myself up to a great deal of vehement criticism by laying my cards on the table and stating that I am a Christian Universalist. I believe that the word \\"all\\" in 1 Tim 4:10, 1 Cor 15:22, 1 Tim 2:4, Rom 11:32, Rev 5:13, etc. really means \\"all\\", everyone, the whole world, and that God has both the power and the desire to save all men, and so will do it.The concept of \\"hell\\" comes from Greek mythology, imported into Christianity by the Roman Catholic Church. It has been strongly supported by another idea imported by Catholicism from Greek myth, and especially also from Platonism, the \\"immortal soul\\".In truth, the Bible knows nothing of an \\"immortal soul\\". If you find the word \\"soul\\" in your Bible, it probably means either \\"life\\", \\"breath\\", or \\"person\\". See Gen 1:7, 35:18, etc.The Bible also knows nothing of eternal punishment in \\"hell\\". \\"For ever\\", \\"eternal\\", and \\"everlasting\\" are usually mistranslations of words meaning \\"age-long\\" or \\"of the age/ages\\". See Jude 6 and Jonah 2:6 KJV.Bill Wiese claims that Jonah was in \\"hell\\", according to the Bible, and that this substantiates his claim to have been there.(Jonah 2:2) The truth is, Jonah said he was in \\"Sheol\\". This is a Hebrew word meaning \\"the place of the dead\\" or \\"the grave\\", and many scholars believe that it comes from a root meaning \\"unseen\\" or \\"hidden\\". If so, this is probably what Jonah meant. Alternately, he could have been metaphorically speaking of himself as \\"in the grave\\", as if to say he was \\"as good as dead\\". In any case, there is no evidence that Jonah visited a place of fiery punishment for dead people. I would recommend that Mr. Wiese pick up a reasonable Bible translation or two and not rely blindly on the error-laden King James.To say that the salvation God gives is limited by human choices, and cannot overcome a simple \\"no thanks\\" from a mortal, is close to blasphemy. It is also nonsense. Mankind is spiritually dead(Eph 2:1, 4:18). As such, he cannot choose God, or even say that Jesus is Lord, without the quickening of the Holy Spirit.(1 Cor 12:3) Faith is a gift of God(Eph 2:8) EDIT: Greek grammar does not support faith as gift in Eph 2:8, as I have discovered. I maintain, however, that faith is a gift based on 1 Cor 12:3, John 6:44, etc., and those who don't have it don't have it either because they've abandoned it(these are erring brethren whom it is the job of the church to restore) or because God hasn't given it to them.Since God wants everyone saved(1 Tim 2:4, 2 Pet 3:9), it stands to reason that all will eventually receive this gift of faith, and will confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father(Rev 5:13). When they do, they will be saved(Rom 10:9). Tell, me, Mr. Wiese. Is it true that we are by nature spiritually dead? When Jesus stood at the tomb of Lazarus, did He say, \\"Let me show you the way out of this tomb, Lazarus?\\" Of course not. Did He say, \\"Lazarus, I will deliver you from this tomb, but not against your will. Please, ask Me into your heart so that I can resurrect you.\\" NO! Did He say, \\"Behold, I stand at the door and knock.\\"? No.(That appeal is directed to those who are already believers.) No, Christ said, \\"Lazarus, come forth.\\" This was not a request. It was a command! Jesus didn't let Lazarus choose whether to be resurrected.(He never could have made that choice anyway; he was dead.) He resurrected him!Jesus said to His disciples, \\"Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you.\\"(John 15:16) This has always been God's pattern. Ultimately, He will redeem everyone. But in the meantime, He chooses some to prepare them for their special role in the age to come.(Matt 20:16, 1 Cor 6:2-4, 1 Pet 2:9, Rom 8:17) I would like to challenge the Arminian to tell me why God had a chosen people in the Old Testament and not the New, for the above Scriptures seem to indicate that He had a chosen people in both.In short, \\"23 Minutes in Hell\\" is a poorly written work of nonsense, by either a liar or a lunatic.(I will let you judge which.) It does not line up with the Scripture it claims to reinforce, and spreads the Terror Gospel which has plagued the church for 1500 years. It is, whether the author knows it or not, a work of blasphemy which impugns the character and sovereignty of God.But, no doubt, despite the utter lack of Scriptural support for \\"hell\\", despite the overwhelming list of verses that indicate that God will redeem all mankind, most Christians will continue to fall for this nonsense. Why? Because, as we all know, \\"Hell sells\\".--S. Starrett"},{"Title":"23 Minutes In Hell: One Man's Story About What He Saw, Heard, and Felt in that Place of Torment","review":"QUESTION FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO SAY HE'S LYING ABOUT HIS EXPERIENCE:What would it take for you to believe there IS a HELL and that you WILL spend ETERNITY in Heaven OR Hell? Are you bashing him because you think the idea of hell existing is utterly ridiculous? Or that you think he made it up? Which is it? Is it:This guy made up the story, so therefore, there is no hell.ORI (the reader) believe in hell but I think this guy is lying.ORI don't believe there is a Hell AND this guy is lying.And does it really matter if the fear of hell is used to bring people to God? Would you not be grateful after you died and went to heaven to realize that there indeed was a hell and you just escaped it? Wouldn't you just be so relieved and glad that you made the decision to accept Jesus as Lord and Savior? I'm sure most people don't like to mention hell when trying to witness to someone but when everything else fails, it's time to resort to mentioning hell, as unpleasant as it is. It would be a disservice to omit that aspect when all else fails. I know I would be angry if no one warned me about it and I found myself in hell only to find it's too late to go back.If not the fear of hell, then how should Christians try to win over others? Making it to heaven is by trusting Jesus as their Lord and Savior, there is no other way. Even people who have heard nothing about hell will still not respond to the message that God loves them and wants to give eternal life because they want to live however they want, believing there will be no consequences after death and everyone will just \\"go into the light.\\" Living the Christian life is not easy and I believe that's part of a big reason why people don't want to follow God or believe there is a hell. They know if they do, they shouldn't indulge in things like pre-marital sex, having to go to church on Sundays, stealing (company time, taxes). But it's quite a gamble on our lives for a fleeting moment of earthly pleasure, which is very temporary compared to eternity in heaven.So for those of you complaining that Bill is using fear to get people to accept Jesus: what else and how else should he have done to \\"win\\" you over to Jesus? Should one just sugarcoat everything about Jesus and if that doesn't work, what then? Would you not sternly warn your own kids about the dangers of playing with matches because you didn't want to use fear, or negativity as the method? I think you understand the point I'm getting at.Like Bill says, don't take your eternal destination so lightly. It's the most important decision you'll ever make. Don't delude yourself into thinking there is no hell or that everyone goes to Heaven without making Jesus your Savior. Living a life of discipline would be in vain if there were no consequences and conversely, rewards for the life hereafter.It'll be very sad but too late to change your mind once you actually do find yourself in hell and you'll have to live with that regret for eternity. I hate the mention of hell like most people but I doubt there is a Heaven without a Hell."},{"Title":"23 Minutes In Hell: One Man's Story About What He Saw, Heard, and Felt in that Place of Torment","review":"It is a huge understatement to say that Dante this guy ain't. I can't figure out whether Wiese had a real bad dream, or if he's just lying for Christ.Supposedly, for no particular reason, an ordinary realtor goes to bed and wakes up in Hell. The cryptic description he gives of his twenty-three minutes include information he could not have possibly perceived if his story were true. He says he felt heat that was so intense he knew nothing could live in such heat. p. xvi. It would be impossible to know that, as he has never, in his life, experienced such heat. He says that he \\"sensed [Hell] to be approximately thirty seven hundred miles deep.\\" P. 107. No human sense would allow him to make such a determination. He somehow manages to determine that there are degrees of punishment in Hell, although none of his observations actually support that. He tells of a Russian man who also went to hell, supposedly also writing a book about it. We are told that the man said that Wiese's description of Hell matched his. This would be a good-not compelling but good-opportunity for comparison and confirmation. But who is the author and what is the book? He seems to have forgotten to mention it. He also tells a number of possible but improbable tales-that he and some friends were victims of a shark attack (an extremely rare phenomenon). He discusses scholars who speak improbably large numbers of languages (one allegedly speaks 45). He says Jesus told him to go tell people about his experience, but he clams up for three weeks for no discernible reason other than that he didn't want to tell anyone what happened.Incredibly, Wiese also recounts that the next day he wasn't sure if his experience was real so he asked God to allow him to look in again (p. 56). God obliges, as twenty-three minutes of torture too horrible to comprehend obviously wasn't good enough for Wiese. Understandably, this vision he has asked for is frighteningly real. Yet he still remains silent about the experience for weeks.There's no attempt to explain why some random real estate agent got selected to drop in on Hell. Theologically the whole idea is a mess. There's no principled scriptural reason that Wiese is entitled to the experience that guarantees his salvation, while the rest of us are not. Supposedly the message is that Jesus wants us to know Hell is bad (I think he may have already mentioned that) and that he's coming soon (he's been telling us that for two thousand years). This is symptomatic of the content-free nondenominational theology that dominates American Protestantism. The strongest opposition to this book should come from dedicated theologians, not skeptics. Skeptics will rightly view this book as vain and empty threats which seek to make up for their lack of substantialness by their severity.I won't even get into the pointless attempts to exculpate God for his creation of Hell and his condemnation of people to it. Having accused his deity of monstrous inhumanity, he seeks to shift the guilt to the victims.Wiese relies on severe and extreme descriptions of just how bad Hell really is. To know just how unconvincing these threats truly are, consider the threats the Qu'ran has for Christians for daring to believe that God had a son. Are Christians scared out of their Christianity? Amazingly they are not, even though the Qu'ranic Hell is even more profoundly unpleasant than the Biblical one.This book is profoundly unconvincing. I hope he's better at selling houses."},{"Title":"23 Minutes In Hell: One Man's Story About What He Saw, Heard, and Felt in that Place of Torment","review":"This is urgent!

The only problem with all of this is that he prefaced all of his experiences with the Bible verse, and they were written verbatum. The author's style leaves each encounter to be questioned.

If you want to know what this is than you can read on. There is an area in the book where he says that Jesus told him to tell them that he is coming very very soon. The problem with this is that the Bible says that no one knows when Jesus is coming not even Jesus himself knows. Only God knows when Jesus is coming.

The author of this book either has a vivid imagination, fantastic dreams (nightmares) or just wants to make money selling books.

You'd probably think that, but you'd be wrong.This book has a number of problems. And the audio book has even more.As far as the book goes, my main comment is that whoever served as editor of this book should lose his job immediately. The portion of the book that actually discusses Hell is incredibly short and the description is very vague. The language is elementary and the tone doesn't provoke any feeling, which is pathetic since it's clear he's trying to get his feelings of fear and misery across. The organization is terrible as well; the story is interspersed with scriptures to \\"prove\\" his vision correlates to the Bible, which might sound understandable, but they definitely mess up the flow of the book. Also, some (many) of the scriptures are sort of a stretch from their original context to the vision itself. I can understand why you'd include scripture, but I think perhaps a better layout would have been to tell the story and include scriptures in an appendix or as endnotes. Lastly, there are quotes from other individuals peppered throughout, but they never indicate who these people are, and I only knew a few of them automatically.For the audio book, my only advice is, for goodness sake, don't get it. If you must experience the book, just read it. The narrator is so bad that I can only assume that he offered to do the job for free and they wanted to save money. His monotone voice and unnatural cadence make it fairly boring, and he mispronounces words throughout (epitome as \\"eppi-toam\\"). Finally, the entire CD has annoying and constant music playing throughout, which as times sounds like a discarded soundtrack from Tron.If you are looking for an inspiring book, getMurdered Heiress: Living Witness.

Was he rushed to a hospital to investigate a near death experience? No. Was he taken to a doctor to see if he had a medical condition that could cause collpase and hullucinations ?

Brian's Sister Jane decided to play it right away. Usually my prodigal son would make a quick exit, but this time he sat down with us to listen it. Brian was saved at an early age, but in his early teens he became involved with the wrong crowd & drugs, alcohol, hard rock music, etc. An overall ungodly lifestyle. For over 20 years he rebelled against God, and he was in & out of jails and hospitals. There was trouble & heartache at every turn.We were amazed that he sat with us to hear this shocking CD. When it came time for the Salvation Prayer, Brian began to repeat the prayer, asking Jesus to come into his heart. At the end of this CD, he said very excitedly, \\"Mom how can I make this Public, I must make this public!\\" He was so intent about this that I told him he could share it in church on Sunday. Later he phoned a buddy who was still taking drugs, but he was not home. He wanted him to hear this CD also! Then he called his former Sunday School teacher & shared this all with him. He said he couldn't hardly wait till Sunday to come so he could make this Public at Church.He went to bed with that Hope, never to realize that he would die in his sleep at age 39. Amidst our grief & shock of losing Brian so suddenly, we have that Joy of knowing he is present with the Lord! Before the funeral, our neighbor asked if she could listen to that CD. At Brian's service, she re-dedicated her life to the Lord.This was just the beginning of how Bill Wiese's testimony \\"23 Minutes in Hell\\" is impacting lives all over the country. It has been been aired over shortwave twice, which goes all over the World. We have been continuing to give out Audio CD's as well as Mary Baxter Books on Hell & Heaven. May God Bless Bill Wiese for being obedient to the Lord & sharing this shocking vision of Hell. I pray multitudes will hear his testimony or read Bill's book on Hell, and be affected as greatly as my son Brian was, I pray this in the precious name of Jesus.By Darleen Murphy (Brian's Mother)(p.s. you can burn your own cd at Spiritlessons . com)-------------------------------------------------------From Robert Brownell...Every Christian must read this. Yes Jesus still reveals Himself to people, and is giving people a final warning of Hell. Of all the preaching about Hell that I've heard, finally one of first hand experience. It goes so far beyond what I though hell was like. The phrase we use \\"seperation from God\\" just doesn't do justice to the absolute terror of Hell. Once you read it, you'll have a much better understanding of why Jesus died for us. Don't believe the critics, who doubted this testimony even before they read it. The Lord has revealed to me, and to many others that this testimony is valid. I have heard many testimonies of people's lives being changed after hearing the MP3 version of this online. My best friend called me up after a year of backsliding, and repented in tears for what he did, after he heard this testimony along with Mary K. Baxter's. It will wake up the Lukewarm, it will convict the Backslidden, it will put a fear of God into those who practice wickedness, and it will motivate everyone to share that Gospel. GET THE BOOK!"},{"Title":"23 Minutes In Hell: One Man's Story About What He Saw, Heard, and Felt in that Place of Torment","review":"This book caught my attention today while in a local bookstore. I read the first couple pages with cautiousness thinking it was likely written by someone using religon to make a quick buck. However, the further I read, I noticed the author, Bill Wiese, provided a lot of scripture backing up his experience of hell, including quotes from well-known Christian authors such as John MacArcher and Charles Stanley. Still, I thought maybe Mr. Wiese had performed an exhaustive study of the topic of hell throughout scripture and other books in order to come up with a story of his own and sell some books. My curiosity continued and after an hour and a half, I had read the entire book.On my drive home, I decided to do a little research on the book. A quick Google search led me to a Google video at http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=3557441432446312669, where Mr. Wiese speaks at a local church about his experience, shedding some light on Mr. Wiese's personality. My perception from the video is that he is humble, genuine, loves his wife very much, and most importantly, feels a sense of urgency about telling people about the realities of hell. Mr. Wiese does not appear to be completely comfortable with public speaking, which also leads me to believe that his accounts in hell are true. I really do not believe he would be doing all the public speaking for his health...or his own financial gain (the video was actually taken a few years before this book was published).Many Christians attempt to convert people to Christianity using the threat to \\"turn or burn\\", which usually results in turning people away from the Christian faith even more than they were before. I strongly believe God is using Mr. Wiese and this book to communicate this same message, but in a way that people know hell is for real, and we shouldn't wait to ask Christ into our heart until we find ouselves there.Overall, the book is very well presented and an easy read. I am planning on purchasing several copies to give to friends and loved ones."},{"Title":"23 Minutes In Hell: One Man's Story About What He Saw, Heard, and Felt in that Place of Torment","review":"Prior to reading this book I was a bit skeptical when I saw the title.

God sends NO ONE to hell.

I do not believe that Jesus Christ would ever \\"take\\" a Christian to hell, and let them experience the absence of His presence and comfort, as this author claims happened to him. A small portion of the book is about what hell was like, and the rest is self-glorifying about what great work he did \\"scaring people\\" into the arms of Jesus. As a Christian, who has read too many verses saying nothing can separate us from the love of Christ as believers, and a skeptic, who sees how about 2/3 of this book is self congratualatory about the author's wonderful ministry - not to mention the fact that he never died, claims he was a Christian when he went to hell, and the Bible speaks of a man who wanted to warn his family about hell that was there, and God forbid him to do so, I find this book unscriptural, unChristian, and more of a horror tale based on reality than any \\"true life experience\\". I find it shameful and embarrassing. I believe hell is a very real place, but I do not believe this author experienced anything other than a delusion or a dream, based on his own description of his experience. I would recommend Christians denounce this book, IF they bother to read it, and if they do, I suggest they check it out from the library and do not waste their money on lies, when there are plenty of accurate stories of non-Christians who actually died, and were brought back to life, and saved from hell by Jesus Christ, the only Savior - who would never allow any of His children to experience these horrors as a \\"warning\\" to others - there are plenty of them in the Bible, and as I said in other, non fiction, non monetarily goaled books out there. John Ankerberg has a very good video of a cardiologist who helped bring a dying patient back from death and descending into hell by calling out to Jesus for help and salvation. THAT is a true story. THIS IS A SHAM. Please do not waste your money in support of his lie."},{"Title":"23 Minutes In Hell: One Man's Story About What He Saw, Heard, and Felt in that Place of Torment","review":"Written by Bill Wiese, '23 Minutes In Hell' purports to be his story of the author's brief visit to hell.Admittedly, I was skeptical about the book before I started reading it. That only intensified as I read Wiese's book. Essentially, he claims that he was taken from his house, transported to hell, tortured, observed all kinds of demonic activity, and then was brought back by Jesus personally and had a conversation with Him.Obviously, no one except Wiese and God know the truth for sure. Here are some things that we can consider. In the story of the rich man and Lazarus, the rich man died and was buried. He then had a conversation with Abraham and asked to have Lazarus go and warn his brothers about hell. He wanted them to avoid his fate. Abraham replied: 'If they do not listen to Moses and the Prophets, they will not be convinced even if someone rises from the dead.' Are we to think that although we are told that unbelievers will not believe even if someone rises from the dead, they will take the word of a California realtor?In the book, Wiese claims that Jesus made it so that he would not remember he was a Christian during his trip to hell. One wonders how that correlates with Titus 1:2 which indicates that God does not lie.Another claim made by Wiese is that in his converation with Jesus, he was told that he was taken to hell so that he would spread the message that He would be returning 'very soon' - that time was running out. Wiese says that he should have asked Jesus how long. The Scriptures tell us clearly that only the Father knows the time of his return.Another consideration is that the whole point of Mr. Wiese's 'testimony' is his claim of a special revelation from God. This implies that the general revelation of God's word is insufficient. One might ponder how that fits with Revelation 22:18-19 which clearly warns not to add or take away from the words of 'this book of prophecy'. It gives very clear consequences for such action.My advice for Christians would be to avoid this book like the plague and certainly not recommend it to others."},{"Title":"23 Minutes In Hell: One Man's Story About What He Saw, Heard, and Felt in that Place of Torment","review":"Recently, I saw Bill Wiese on TV on the It's Supernatural TV show and he told his story of being taken into hell. His story was very believable and I ordered the book. His testimony in the book is such that once you begin to read it, it is very hard to put down. It just captures your attention and you find that you are almost in his place feeling the torments for yourself. All you have to do is think of the most horrible thing that you have ever experienced and multiply it a million times and that is just the tip of the iceberg of what hell is like. It is never ending torment with all hope taken away. You will never see your loved ones again or anyone who is friendly or who can give you advice or hope. All you see are horrible creatures that hate you with an everlasting hatred because you are created in God's image. After reading this book, I began ordering extra copies to give away to friends and family members. Actually part of my tithe is to purchase these books as an evengelistic tool. Some people may not respond to the message of God's love but they may respond to this type of message that will literally scare them straight."},{"Title":"23 Minutes In Hell: One Man's Story About What He Saw, Heard, and Felt in that Place of Torment","review":"This is an awesome read.

It is a travesty to see a man who claims to be a christian seemingly make up such garbage to fill the minds of men and scare them into submission. Jesus never forced his opinions on other people or tried to scare them into listening. He simply taught those who would listen.It would appear to me that Bill Wiese has made a lucrative business off of fear mongering. It is also sad that Christians would take much of the Bible's symbolic nature and turn it into literal \\"truths\\". There is ABSOLUTELY no purpose for an eternal torture of souls. This is just more perversions of the symbolism in the bible. Clearly Christian's today have no understanding of how people thought in antiquity. It is historical fact that there was no concept of hell as we know it today until Dante wrote his Inferno. It is also fact that the word hell never existed in the original text.

Listen to what Bill Wiese claims...I found myself in the cell, and these 4 creatures were in the cell with me. I didn't know they were demons at the time, because I went there as an unsaved person. God took it out of my mind that I was a Christian. I didn't understand why, but He explained it to me on the way back. These creatures, I didn't realize that they were demons, but they were enormous. They were about 12 or 13 feet tall, one you will see in the video. One of the people that gives their testimony, he saw the same demon that I did. So you will see what one actually looks like. There is a really good picture of it in the video where one guy was drug up to the bars of Hell. It's Kenneth Hagan's testimony. -SOURCEMr. Wiese states... \\"God took it out of my mind that I was a Christian.\\" What? This is deception! Why would God do such a thing and violate His own Word? The Bible declares in Titus 1:2 that God cannot lie. Eternal life is a free gift from God (Romans 5:15; 6:23). Why would Jesus Christ even pretend to take away the gift of eternal life from one which He has saved? Jesus would never pretend to be a liar. Listen to the precious words of Jesus in John 10:28, \\"And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand.\\" Bill Wiese would lead us to believe that God pretended to send him to Hell, breaking His promise of eternal life. Mr. Wiese claims he didn't know why he was being tormented until afterwards. Remember, Bill Wiese claims this was no dream; but an actual experience which he encountered. Is God a liar? No Mr. Wiese, you are the liar, not God!!! God has promised eternal life to all who believe upon Jesus (the Manifestation of God). God would never forsake us, making us believe that He had abandoned us, not even for one second (Hebrews 13:5.To no surprise, the same website advertising Bill Wiese's visions is also promoting the false prophet Kenneth Hagin, who also claims to have been to Hell and back...In April 1933 during a dramatic conversion experience, he reported dying three times in 10 minutes, each time seeing the horrors.\\" Now he is a wealthy evangelist because of the negative, fear loving masses who do not know God or Jesus and worship Bill and others big money evangelicals of his yoke who turn out garbage like this to launch their careers among the fundamentalists and uneducated masses."},{"Title":"23 Minutes In Hell: One Man's Story About What He Saw, Heard, and Felt in that Place of Torment","review":"How did the author know he spent exactly 23 minutes in Hell?

If there were no punishment for not following him, why would you? It's like if you go into a bank with a glock handgun and hold it up to the teller and demand money. Now she will give you money because she doesn't want any bodily harm. Try going into the bank and demanding money without any weapons.

Now, this book is complete trash, that's true, but I'm afraid that I place no more or less believability in it than the Bible itself. After all, they are both just a story, and nobody REALLY knows if they are true or not, until they die. I guess it's just silly to me when people say this book is patently false because it conflicts with the Bible, another book!

I wished the author would of just told his story of what he experienced instead of adding \\"preaching\\" along the way or stories he's heard to compare to what he was going through. Also, adding scripture and quotes in the middle of his experience just makes it seem like his story is created or made up according to Bible quotes. Don't get me wrong, I believe what the Bible says but feel it could have been added in the end of the Chapter so the story is more fluid and not broken up. I think Hell is something alot of people have not taken alot of time to think about or believe it is actually real, this book does make you think and I certainly want to take every measure to not end up there.Not sure if I believe this happened but that doesn't really matter, what does matter is believing in God and living to His Word."},{"Title":"23 Minutes In Hell: One Man's Story About What He Saw, Heard, and Felt in that Place of Torment","review":"Many of us talk about \\"hell\\".....but, do we really know about \\"hell\\"?

Most near death experiences do not confirm this depiction of Hell. The Journal of Near Death Experiences has people seeing Buddha, Jesus, Muhammad and so forth as a Being of Light based upon their cultural and religious backgrounds! So I ask any fair and impartial reader of these experiences (reported by Cardiologists at the bedside of these patients from different world religion backgrounds) which these near death experience is correct and which are false? Does that tell you anything? Then you have the wide variance in afterlife visions among and between Christians, mostly being positive experiences. Hence, although it was real to the author, it had to be in my view, influenced by Bills exposure to Hell, Fire and Brimstone stories growing up. God is totally just but not mean. His literal interpretation smacks of fundamentalism but not what Jesus or God had instructed. It not only does a disservice to Jesus but is simply a well constructed lie. Hell is a spiritual condition of being cut off from God. His book has sold alot of copies, that was his intent, I have absolutely no doubt whatsoever that is the case.

I've read the Bible and have more than one, so I don't need to know what it says. I can always look it up if I want to.The single thing that bothers me the most is that Wiesse doesn't tell how he GOT there in the first place. If my understanding of God is correct (and I'm not sure) then He wouldn't take one of his \\"children\\" there just on a whim. Wiesse never tells you that. At one point in the book he does mention being on the floor holding his head, but that's all he says about it.Another thing that bugs me is: Is there really a \\"heaven\\" and a Hell\\"? Just because the bible says so does that really MAKE it so?That's a question I've been trying to explain for a long time.Seems to me he must have had a near-death experience. I wouldn't think that a loving God would just pluck you out of your life and send you to this place, if there is a hell. He talks about whether \\"good\\" people or \\"bad\\" people go to heaven or hell. I find the concept completely ridiculous, probably because I really don't believe there are those places.Another thing that bugs me is that if you're dead (assusming Wiesse was, at least for a small amount of time) how could you feel all the things he did? I mean, one would have to assume that you have a \\"soul\\" and that \\"soul\\" can still feel, hear, drink, etc. That doesn't make sense to me. If you're dead, then you're dead. How would you know where you were? Are we supposed to believe that you can feel things in hell? Do we still have our bodies? My understanding is that you may have your soul, but no body, so how could we feel, sense or smell anything? This book does nothing to answer those questions. All it is is one Bible quote after another and meetings with this, that, and the other person.

This \\"story\\" sounds like a fairy tale at best, and blasphemy at worst because this man is claiming that God gave him a special out of body experience, something that only people from the bible, Saints, and cult starters have claimed. I too am a born-again Christian and believe in hell. However, what it appears like here is that a person went to his bed at 3:00am, had a bad dream, sleep walked and arose at 3:23am on the couch in his living room at best. At worst, it sounds like a get rich quick scheme from he and his wife who were both in the real estate business and doing well at first, but then when that business started to go down, they switched to the book business instead. Not saying this was intentional, maybe they just did it unconsciously. It is disturbing to me that in their website they state that God wants his servants to do well financially so that they can give back. I see that model in the Old Testament, but not in the N.T. where Jesus, all of the disciples, apostles and other believers, consistently model giving away their riches to meet the needs of those in the believing community and to help the poor, which is a great gospel tool. Paul worked as a tent-maker and NEVER asked anyone for money, despite the fact that he is credited with greatly spreading the gospel in the N.T. There are examples of money being given to help meet expenses, but not anything more than specific NEEDS, NEVER SALARIES OR DESIRES. The believers were asked to give on the first day of the week for those needs and to help the poor, not for buildings or salaried staff. And they were never asked to give 10% in the N.T. either or to buy books or trinkets. The gospel is God's love story to humankind. The great commission is for us to share the gospel, in love, deed and word, which costs nothing and should never cost anything. Anything else is simply Satan's way of trapping us into loving money more than God, which Jesus said is the root of all evil. We need to listen to Jesus, not men who speak things against Jesus's teaching. Jesus said that it is possible for us to even call Him Lord and still go to hell: Matt 25:42-46. Why? Because those people were just interested in attending a church club and playing the church games that are often played. They were never \\"born again\\" or regenerated in spirit which is manifested by compassion. Compassion is what the \\"Christians\\" in Matt 25:42-46 lacked and why they were not found giving drink, food, clothes, or visiting the jails. When you have true compassion for others, you give of yourself, not seek to be rich as that only causes us to trust money instead of God. We need to be careful as we are living in the last days when people are self-seeking and seeking riches instead of a true relationship with Jesus."},{"Title":"23 Minutes In Hell: One Man's Story About What He Saw, Heard, and Felt in that Place of Torment","review":"I assumed the writer would have had a more detailed account of his journey through hell.

This leads to ideas like hell is actually in the center of the earth and there's trap door somewhere on the earth's surface that people can fall into. He said he was literally kept in a prison cell while down in hell. This isn't too intelligent really.Christian philosophy took a wrong turning when they threw out the idea of reincarnation. I think St. Augustine tried to get the Church to accept some of the ideas from Plato's philosophy but he apparently wasn't successful.The idea that we live once, are judged by God, and then go to heaven or hell has created a lot of misunderstanding about the true nature of human existence. Who knows how this mistaken belief affects peoples' feelings about the death penalty and many other things. Who knows what people may have felt or done based on their mistaken belief that they would never have an opportunity to return to this physical world.It's hard to know what the true motivation might be for writing a book like this.To me the main reason seemed to be that he wanted to tell people how beautiful his wife is and how much he loves her.

People can subtely deceive themself into believing that they are doing something based on the noblest of intentions. But somewhere in the back of their mind there's the book deals, the speaking engagements, etc..So far the only book I've found that seems to describe an actual trip into hell is Howard Storm's \\"My Descent Into Death\\":My Descent into Death: And the Message of Love Which Brought Me BackHoward's experience sounds like the real deal.If anyone knows of others please send me an email.

I cried because so many people will go to this place because they don't believe in it or in God! I definitely believe this man went through this experience because God is desperately trying to reach a Christ rejecting world with His Truth and Love. He sent His Son to die for us but we just turn our backs on Him, taking Him out of our government, out of our schools, out of our courthouses... denying His very existence.

Rather, it's the Lord's rebuke against cheap grace, presumption, and ingratitude in the Body of Christ.We moan and complain to God, accuse Him of not loving us enough, when the slightest little ripple rocks our boat. \\"I just got fired! If God really loved me, this wouldn't have happened.\\" Oh, really? Well, it sure beats Hell, as Mark Lowry sang.Sin is serious, and because we tend to think otherwise, we necessarily cheapen grace and have less appreciation for the incredible price Jesus had to pay to redeem us. Weise was there for just 23 minutes; Jesus was there for at least three hours. What He endured on the cross physically was NOTHING compared to what He endured for us spiritually.But we moan and complain or, worse, participate in \\"worship\\" services that are more like rock concerts, trivializing sin, salvation, the Law, and the God Who Is. Christianity has become just another flavor of pop psychology. We've forgotten what we have been saved from: eternity in a place so awful that Bill Weise's presentation is inadequate to describe it.This may be one of our last wake-up calls. I believe God is calling us to revival, and when you stand outside an American church on a Sunday morning and see people emerge from the service in tears, you will know that we're finally starting to get the message. But as long as we deceive ourselves by thinking that sin isn't serious, the price of redemption wasn't really that high, and Jesus' job is to serve us and keep us comfortable, safe, happy and rich ...This book is a call to repentance. Abandon the rock 'n' roll Christianity, seek the Lord, meditate on His Law, and live for His good pleasure.Scripture says (Psalm 9:17): \\"The wicked shall be turned into hell, and all the nations that forget God.\\" This nation seems to have forgotten God, and the plunge into disbelief is being led by those who claim to be Christians.

The argument \\"just because you don't believe in it doesn't mean it's not real\\" is not supported Biblically/Scripturally, but is a carnal human argument. \\"Hell\\", as preached by modern Churchianity (which I will refer to as the \\"BCS\\" or \\"Babylon Church System\\") is actually the Old English word \\"hele\\" meaning \\"hole\\" (thus, \\"hidden place\\"). Farmers in parts of rural England still talk about burying something \\"in hell\\" or \\"in a hole\\". The belief preached by the BCS is that at the moment of death, one goes either to eternal torment in \\"hell\\" or goes to be \\"with the Lord\\" in heaven (excuse me while I attempt to contain my laughter.....ahem.....I'm fine now). Both are false, and HAVE to be, or else the very notion of a resurrection and then judgement is for nothing. The BCS does NOT know the Scriptures, despite all puerile attempts at trying to \\"prove\\" that it does. Most of the BCS's arguments concerning ANYTHING should not be believed, as they are essentially based upon the apologists' own opinion and NOT upon a serious study of Scripture. John 3:13 will prove the BCS wrong once and for all, and universal reconciliation correct once and for all. The BCS is WRONG.

My passion in life is studying and applying what is learned about the afterlife. The only people who really seem to focus on hell are many of the people who think of themselves as Christians. People from other faiths, as well as atheistic or agnostic or open-minded folks who aren't so zealous about a particular dogma, don't mention this kind of biblical hell. It seems like something that Christians want to believe, and due to how the Universe works, they tend to strongly create it in their imagination, and subsequently receive all kinds of visions and ideas about it. If they would instead focus on other things, they would receive those other things more.Yes, I'm not a Christian, and I've never written a review for a Christian book before. But a coworker told me about this book, and he considers himself very Christian. He said this book is so important, and that I should read it. He gave it to me to read for a while and though I've started to, I'm so turned off about it that I wanted to say something in case it can help anyone free themselves from fear-based religion.Why is it that the most zealous Christians are so intent on preaching this fire and brimstone, fear-based religion? Why is that other people, millions of them, who've had profound NDEs, have talked about the importance of love, and how we are all connected, and that fear is what holds us back and causes dysfunction in our lives and the world? They don't say that we need to turn to Jesus, because he is our only hope for being saved from hell. Do we still need this belief in a scary, frightening place, to keep us in line, even when it goes against our heart and true feelings?The number of children who are damaged by fear-based beliefs instilled in them such as this is huge. Christian boarding schools churn out a lot of Atheists who are so turned off by religion, that they completely disregard anything spiritual later in their lives. Our society could be so much healthier and intelligent if outdated beliefs like this were let go of.Mediums as well, talk about the importance of love. They say what comes through from our loved ones already on the other side, is that we should enjoy life. Letting go of all of these uptight, rigid beliefs that keep us repressed and dysfunctional. Listening to our hearts and following them, rather than the mind, which tries to rigidly follow fearful beliefs like this, and which goes against our hearts.So many people take the Bible as an infallible truth. But it's been edited so many times over history. Meetings over the centuries where leaders of the churches decided to remove parts or edit them to suit their political needs. Why limit ourselves to such narrow and political beliefs? We don't need them. There is truth in our hearts and in nature. We are a part of nature. We are not above it or against it, as many Christians seem to think.And which church is the right one? Say you go to a Presbyterian one. Are the folks down the street who go the Baptist church going to burn in hell forever? For picking the wrong church? Are the Protestants and Greek Orthodox followers doomed? And the billions of people who aren't Christians at all across the rest of the world, they might as well not even have been born. Why did God create them just to die and suffer forever in hell?There is so much increasing evidence that these beliefs are not what people who die and come back report. I have not seen a real medium who told the person they were reading that their uncle on the other side says to turn to Jesus, or else. Christian people trying to pretend to be mediums or hear divine guidance, maybe. Christians seems to be only people obsessed with this idea of \\"Jesus, or else.\\"For those who question their faith, or who feel something is not right with having such limited beliefs, there is much information out there about NDEs. It does seem that some people who've had NDEs have seen Jesus, or Mary, or other Christian symbology, but often they or their family were steeped in those beliefs to begin with. And it's always a positive, uplifting experience. Even for those who took a wrong turn in life and were into crime, or drugs. The powerful unconditional love of the Jesus or Mary or God they see just melts their need for these bad habits away. They are transformed by the love, not by fear. And I have not seen an NDE that seemed to be legitimate (and not a Christian-biased one who tries to get people to turn to Christianity exclusively) where the person ever said that we must turn to Jesus, or else. Messages like that come from fear and not love. God only loves us unconditionally. Why would there be a condition then that we must love Jesus or we are punished?"},{"Title":"23 Minutes In Hell: One Man's Story About What He Saw, Heard, and Felt in that Place of Torment","review":"This book succeeds in doing what it is supposed to do - scare the hell out of you!

Listening to a person who might have been in hell maight seem like a fire insurance policy message more then the scriptural usage of love of God to provoke humans to Christ as a follower unto salvation. We all need to take hell way more seriously though! It isn't a joke and we all face it without true repentance. Is this author real? The reason to go to God shouldn't be for the wrong type of fear of hell but that we want to freely serve Christ. I do not see this book as a manipulation but a warning of \\"look at the word of God\\" and know hell is real but own the seriousness of the matter. If someone can find a biblical principle that would refute a man going to hell in this capacity and then expressing scriptures to warn us and point to the word of God then I will gladly learn something.

I could not put this book down. I am an avid reader and found this book to be extremely interesting and informative. I have shared this book with others, I was a Christian before reading it, I have used it as a tool to spread the word, too many people try to leave out \\"Hell\\" because it is a scary thing, BUT people need to wake up to what the Bible says....Many people have given a poor review, stating that \\"demons are tortured in hell, and cannot be the ones doing the torturing\\" HOWEVER, it is my understanding that the Devil, (Lucifer) and his demons have not yet been thrown \\"into\\" the pit, and are currently free to tempt us etc., just like they did Eve, Jesus, Mary Magdeline, etc. They will get thrown into the pit when Jesus is ready, but until that time, unfortunately we cannot just assume that they are not there, on the contrary, scripture says that the Devil is working all the time to try to win people over to his side, he's angry that he has been cast out of Heaven, and does not want to go alone, he is evil, he is the deceiver, he will masquerade as an \\"Angel of Light\\" a \\"Wolf in sheep's clothing\\" wake up and look at all the people in your lives that are currently being deceived....pretty scary.

I really like the author's love for the Word of God (The Holy Bible). My eyes were opened up to so many more references in the Bible concerning Hell that I had never seen before up to the time of reading this book back in 2007. That's what really makes this book stand out. It's more than just a man's personal experience.WHY EVERY CHRISTIAN NEEDS THIS BOOK:There is a movement in the earth today that teaches Hell does not really exist, or that at the most, is just a temporary place.Many people do not have a revelation on the perfection and holiness of God and His eternal Word.2 Timothy 4:3-4 (KJV)3 For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears;4 And they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables.This verse explains why other teachers and their books that oppose the Word of God have become so popular among the masses.Strengthen your faith in the Word of Truth and consider adding this book to your library.I also recommend another book Bill Wiese wrote entitled \\"Hell\\". It explains in more detail some of the content in \\"23 Minutes In Hell\\" and additional commentary on what the Bible has to say concerning the subject of hell.Another book you may be interested in is by Mary K. Baxter, \\"A Divine Revelation of Hell\\".God is trying to confirm to His people the reality and gravity of hell.

Now that I've finished this book I must admit that I'm a little disappointed. I wasn't expecting a lot of references that I already read for myself. I was expecting more descriptive content.

I believe that God hid from him the fact that he was a Chrisitan and that knew God so he could feel the hopelessness of everyone who has died and gone there.People cannot be apathetic about this. People misunderstand. They think how can a good God send people to Hell? God doesn't send anyone to Hell. Hell is the DEFAULT because of Adam's sin and the subsequent fallen, sinful, separated state of Mankind. God loves His creation SO much that He came to the Earth among His own as the Man, Jesus Christ, to die for His creation so they would never have to be sent to Hell, a place of torment meant for satan and his demons. Jesus said, \\"I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me.\\" John 14:6Don't wait until Eternity to find out that this is all true. Jesus Christ says \\"Behold, I stand at the door and knock.

Though this book is not an account of a near death experience (NDE), it led to me discovering that many more people than I ever imagined seem to have actually had NDE's and lived to tell about them. Some went to \\"heaven\\" (perhaps more accurately Paradise) and others went to \\"hell\\" (prehaps more accurately hades).So, I'd recommend this book as a springboard for further research. Sure, this \\"hell and back\\" story could have been fabricated, but are they all?Oh yeah, the impact this book has had on my life was to get me to do research, and the research has led me to worry about only one thing in life, and that's not going to hades when it is over.

I'm not going to waste time clearing up the plethora of strange, incorrect and downright nonsense statements in the book. I will say a few things that, if true, should cause any half-brained believer to toss this book out the window.I'm not saying that Bill didn't experience some sort of vision like he records in the book. I'm also not saying that he didn't experience what he even claims he did. Bill possibly had an amazing experience and saw amazing things.I am definitely claiming that his interpretation of what happened to him is utterly, demonstrably, inescapably, untrue for the following reasons:1. Bill claims to have gone to Hell and seen demons working there, maintaining prison cells and whatnot.Several Problems:a. Demons don't rule, or even work, in \\"Hell\\". Revelation 20:10 says that the Devil, the beast and the false prophet (and therefore the Devil's lesser co-workers), will be thrown into \\"Hell\\". It's not a place of demonic employment, but a place of demonic suffering. The Devil doesn't rule in \\"Hell\\"; this idea is from movies and Greek mythology, not the Bible. Matthew 8:29 suggests that the demons know they're going to a place of suffering...not a new job in a celestial prison.b. \\"Hell\\" is only ever described as a place of fiery torment, and Gehenna is a lake of fire. There's never mention of prison cells, or organization of any sort. Again, this idea of \\"Hell\\" comes from popular media and culture and is nowhere to be found in the Bible at all.2. Bill Wiese claims to have gone to \\"Hell\\", where he saw wicked people.One major problem:The judgment hasn't happened yet and the wicked aren't in \\"Hell\\". Rev. 20:11-15 suggests, RATHER strongly, that if Bill could have possibly have gone to \\"Hell\\", it would have been empty. The final judgment hasn't occurred yet and the place of eternal torment doesn't have a single person in it...yet.Now, the astute reader has noticed that I've put the word 'Hell' in quotations, and for good reason. The Bible distinguishes between \\"Hell\\" and \\"the lake of fire\\", and they're not the same thing at all. I definitely didn't get the sense that Bill Wiese knows that at all; he talked like he was talking about being in the place of eternal torment, not the place of temporary holding before the final judgment. I suspect that Bill Wiese doesn't have the theological sophistication to recognize the difference between the two. He doesn't make any differentiation between the holding place of the wicked and final suffering place of the wicked. When Bill talks about \\"Hell\\", he's talking about where the wicked are for eternity. That place isn't even called \\"Hell\\".3. Bill Wiese claims to have come back from Hell.Epic theological problem.If Bill Wiese is a Christian, and Hell is the place of God's unmitigated wrath against sinners, then there's no possible way for him to go to Hell, let alone come back. 1 Thess. 1:10 says that Jesus rescues Christians from God's coming wrath; that wrath is eternal torment in Hell. 1 Thess. 5:9 suggests that Christians are not appointed to suffer wrath, and if Bill claims to have suffered the unmitigated wrath of God against sin in Hell (which is the ONLY thing that occurs there) even for a second, God is a liar.Bill Wiese went SOMEWHERE and saw SOMETHING, but he didn't go to Hell.God's word is so clear about these things that the only realistic options are:a. Bill Wiese has been demonically deceived (unknowingly)b. Bill Wiese has been mislead by his pastor/spiritual influence in his life to claim these lies.b. Bill Wiese is a knowing false teacher and will realize one day, far too late, how terribly \\"off\\" his vision was.This book rings the theological gong with both hands.Read at your own risk."},{"Title":"23 Minutes In Hell: One Man's Story About What He Saw, Heard, and Felt in that Place of Torment","review":"A book everyone needs to read.

I could not put this book down. It captivated me from start to finish. I was startled,I was sick to my stomach, I am very much aware that there is a hell. As soon as I finished reading his book, I knew it had to be passed on. So I lent it out to my sister and my niece read it in a day and passed it on. The book is circulating and when I get it back I'll pass it on again. He depicted what hell is like and if you haven't excepted Jesus as your Lord and savior you need to think again after reading Mr. Wiese book.

However, in reality, Jesus (who is considered both human and divine) taught more about hell than anyone else in the Bible. He described it as a place of eternal fire (Matthew 25:41), eternal punishment (Matthew 25:46), and as a place of torment, fire and agony (Luke 16:23-24). Jesus taught specifically about hell many times in His ministry (Matthew 5:22, 29-30; 10:28; 18:9; 23:15,33; Mark 9:43-47; Luke 12:6; 16:23). Is this because Jesus and Christians are unloving? Of course not! He is a God of love but also a God of justice. We even have a justice system(albeit imperfect) in our society; and those who commit serious crimes go to a place of punishment called prison.Jesus is like a good doctor who diagnosed your cancer and offered a cure. Would you accuse your own doctor of fear mongering and lying if he diagnosed you with cancer or some other serious illness? I hope not. Some reviewers claim the author is trying to scare people and convince readers to buy into his supposedly narrow beliefs. It's true that no one can truly verify as whether the author really went to hell or whether his experiences were 100% real. Whether they are or not though is irrelevant as to whether hell is real or not. Read the Bible and read Jesus' own words then to get 100% truth. Only He has the \\"cure\\" from eternal death!\\"You can enter God's Kingdom only through the narrow gate. The highway to hell is broad, and its gate is wide for the many who choose that way.\\" Matthew 7:13 (NLT)"},{"Title":"23 Minutes In Hell: One Man's Story About What He Saw, Heard, and Felt in that Place of Torment","review":"If you read this book and and do not come away w/ a profound sense of awe, then it obviously didn't work for you.

The first two or three chapters of this book read like a Dungeons and Dragons game or a bad remake of the Eragon saga. All these fanciful creatures and what not made me wonder how many different forms of peyote the guy had taken before he laid down to rest that night.First impressions, however, don't always last and I have to say that the remainder of the book convinced me of the sincerity and honesty of this author. Of the depth of his conviction and the bluntness with which he tackles his written warning to the world.Hell is a real place. One I NEVER want to visit if it's even remotely like what he describes here.

I had the privilege to hear Bill Wiese live at our Church yesterday. He most certainly delivered a horrific story about Hell and how you can be saved.He said it took him 7 years to actually write this book. Before that he was going place to place and telling people his story on his dollar. He never allowed people to pay his way. Then a publisher approached him to tell the story to the world and after much reservation he did.These people who gave this book one star... well let me just say it's hard to come forward. Many people persecute for coming forward, for believing in God & Jesus Christ. He was a successful Real Estate broker and to hear him on stage, he is a quiet man. He did an outstanding job to deliver the Word of God, but he is very soft spoken. He is, as our Pastor Jerry Dirmann at the Rock in Anaheim said, \\"He is a walking Bible\\" He quoted so many verses I had problems taking notes.Believe Bill or not.. that is not his concern. He wants you to have a relationship with Jesus Christ and for you to read your Bible. He is simply a messenger as all of should be. Imagine your friend standing in a puddle of gasoline and he is about to light a match, would you warn him/ her? Of course you would, so why do many of us avoid telling others about Jesus Christ? How to be Saved? Why? Because we don't want to be persecuted. Now Imagine you are a successful business person earning a very good living and the Lord calls upon you to send a message to the world, not just a few friends. Most of are scared to share the news to people we know, but still people give him one star.The presentation at our church has left a stamp on my brain. He had a video of a woman in a ambulance who died. She woke up to find herself in Hell. Her mouth was tied with barbwire and her body wrapped so she couldn't move. She was in a dark and dirty place, people screaming around her. A skeleton with his/her skin melting off his/her bones and still \\"alive\\" crying out \\"please help me!\\", there were creatures slithering around her. She laid there helpless unable to do anything. Moments later a creature grabbed her, put her on this moving tray, opened up a huge fiery oven and started to push her inside. She was squirming to push herself away from the oven, but it was no use, there was no hope. The creature pushed her in and closed the door and she woke up in the ambulance screaming and her eyes were in terror. Imagine you or someone you love going through that torment and simply all we had to do is share what we know about Jesus.Many of us are so critical. Oh yes, Bill is making major money for all his book sales. Well... he had a successful life before. Ask yourself would you do what the Lord called you to do if it meant to change your entire successful life and do something where most people would judge you, you would lose friends who didn't believe you and you could never go back to your old life?Thank God for Bill Wiese and his story. He changed a lot of lives at the Church yesterday. I would say over 300 people stepped up to be saved. I was one of them. I already accepted Jesus before but sometimes I feel that I am just not good enough and wanted to go up again. This time I made a declaration and walked with the rest of the followers.God Bless you all!"},{"Title":"23 Minutes In Hell: One Man's Story About What He Saw, Heard, and Felt in that Place of Torment","review":"I read this book in about one day. The imagery of hell was so real. He describes hell as putrid and smells of sulfur and old rotten garbage. After reading it I tried to get my athiest father to accept Christ as his savior. It did not work, i hope one day he will. Here is my testimony a sign from God that this book is real. I was sitting on the couch one week after reading this book. I looked over at the book shelf and out of all the books i commented outloud regarding this one and said \\"i dont know if i believe that guys story\\", i believe hell exists, but it seemed a little far fetched. After stating that my fiance and I started talking about how hell exists and we should try to live the best life we can on earth and look foward to heaven. My fiance is a route drive for a uniform company and his customer called during our conversation about heaven. The name that appeared on the caller id \\"JESUS IS LORD MINISISTIRES\\". i was like how ironic ur customer is calling on your day off right in the middle of a heaven conversation. Well he got the billing issue cleared up over the phone and I told my fiance \\"tell him about what we were just talking about\\". My fiance vaguely told him we were speaking about heaven , he made no mention of this book 23 minutes in hell. The pastor told my fiance to go to a website called [...]. So after he got off the phone with this man we went into the kitchen jumped on the computer and typed it in. Low and behold this book was on the website and i bursted in to tears. i truly believe that this was a sign from the lord. I am no longer skeptical of this book after that incident. i believe hell is real and so is this mans story. you dont have to believe my story, but i wanted to share it for any skeptics of this book.

I have been a Christian for many years and this is the first time I have heard Hell described so thoroughly. I, personally, have no doubts that the author truly experienced Hell but that is not the stated purpose of the book. I have read the Bible and what it has to say about Hell but I have always felt that this along with church teachings fell short in bringing the understanding that I needed. I do believe that God allows everyday people to experience extraordinary things in order to drive home the reality of the afterlife and our free will here on Earth and to make it personal for us in this modern age. This is such a book. I believe it to be the Divine work of our Lord."},{"Title":"23 Minutes In Hell: One Man's Story About What He Saw, Heard, and Felt in that Place of Torment","review":"Jesus talked about the torment in Hell to warn us.

Most people go through life not thinking about what will happen after you die. Bill was quite adept in describing what one would experience should they enter this realm. The smells, sights, evil demons, and most of all, the feeling of helplessness. Even then as he had stated, the torment is beyond conception. The book also done an excellent job in linking scriptures from the Bible with his experiences. Weise's book may very well have an eternal impact upon many readers."},{"Title":"23 Minutes In Hell: One Man's Story About What He Saw, Heard, and Felt in that Place of Torment","review":"One critic of Bill Wiese's 23 Minutes in Hell quoted Luke 16:27-31, saying, \\"No one can come back from Hell and warn others; they have the prophets and the [Law of Moses]--let them believe them.\\" This is a good observation, but when Jesus told that story, it was before His Resurrection. But after Christ's Resurrection, He acquired the Keys of Hell (Rev. 1:18c). And even so, Jonah, the OT prophet, went to Hell and back (2:2). Therefore, the passage in Luke applied to the rich man, but not to all people at all times. Also, in light of Luke 16:31, we learn that only Bible-Believers have the ability to believe in Extra-Biblical Revelations, such as Wiese's and Mary K. Baxter's A Divine Revelation of Hell. Other critics quote Hebrews 13:5 in light of the fact that Baxter's and Wiese's stories involve God leaving them alone in Hell for periods of time. But we must also consider Psalm 139:8, and that Baxter and Wiese are alive and well today, and that God did not abandon them--that is, they never really were forsaken, but only appeared to be. God was watching them the whole time."},{"Title":"23 Minutes In Hell: One Man's Story About What He Saw, Heard, and Felt in that Place of Torment","review":"SOME PROBLEMS WITH THIS STORY: 1) NO ONE BUT THE AUTHOR AND HIS WIFE WITNESSED THIS EXPERIENCE, THERE WAS NO NEAR DEATH OR EVEN COMA LIKE EVENT AND NO INDEPENDENT CORROBORATION 2) HE HAS NEVER SUBMITTED TO A LIE DETECTOR TEST AS TO WHETHER IT ACTUALLY HAPPENED 3) EVEN NDES (NEAR DEATH EXPERIENCERS) HAVE NEVER REPORTED SUCH AN EXTENDED PERIOD ON THE OTHER SIDE 4)HOW DOES THE AUTHOR KNOW IT WAS EXACTLY 23 MINUTES? 5) WHY DID HE SOON START A VERY PROFITABLE BOOK AND SPEAKING CAREER AND MINISTRY AFTER THIS EVENT?"},{"Title":"23 Minutes In Hell: One Man's Story About What He Saw, Heard, and Felt in that Place of Torment","review":"Whether you are a Christian or not, it does not matter.

That Mr. Wiese is making money off of this book of lies. I don't doubt that he was in hell, it's not my place to say if this part is true or not. But since he is obviously a \\"Christian\\" he feels that everyone just accepts his story as \\"truth\\". Why would a Judge risk his reputation by \\"judging\\" his own daughter? Isn't that a conflict of interest? Isn't that immoral? Isn't that illegal? But yet the author want's me to believe that the Judge passed sentence and paid the fine so his daughter would not go to jail. What an insult to my and everyone else's intelligence. Just because he can quote Bible text(which by the way so can I) does that mean his stories are truthful? I wish the Author told of his own life of sin (because we are all sinner's) and how he overcame this through the help of Jesus. VERY DISAPPOINTING!! I wish I saved my money. By the way, I wonder just what the Author is doing with the money he is making with the sale of this book? I guess that will be between him and the Lord when the time comes."},{"Title":"23 Minutes In Hell: One Man's Story About What He Saw, Heard, and Felt in that Place of Torment","review":"This book gives a total insight to what God intends hell to be for those who choose a different path than Jesus. The Bible confirms what is written in this book. I don't know for sure that Bill Wiese really went to Hell or had a very vivid dream. But the truth is, it really doesn't matter. The scriptures tell us this is how hell is going to be whether people want to believe it or not. I would suggest we believe the scriptures instead of doubters who don't believe God's word. I know many have an issue with a God that would send people to hell. But the truth is people willfully make the choice to go to hell."},{"Title":"23 Minutes In Hell: One Man's Story About What He Saw, Heard, and Felt in that Place of Torment","review":"cant beleive i had 2pay 4 this rubbish typical religious robber ppl again no doubt youll burn in hell weise"},{"Title":"23 Minutes In Hell: One Man's Story About What He Saw, Heard, and Felt in that Place of Torment","review":"I am a Bible-believing, born again, Spirit-filled Christian and have been for over 20 years. I read this book a few years before the Lord took me through a sudden and extremely painful experience where I was overwhelmed with the smoke of hell for a period of time and felt terrified as though I was standing on the edge of the pit of hell. Whilst my own experience was less intense than Bill's, nevertheless I can completely relate to what Bill is saying in his book. God is God, and if He chooses to take someone into a situation to reveal something that He wants believers and unbelievers to WAKE UP about, then God has the right to do so, regardless of how us human beings may respond to His revelation through an ordinary person. Let's face it...Hell IS REAL, Satan and his demons are real; that much is VERY clear in Scripture! The final lake of fire is reserved for satan and his demons, but in the mean time hell is where they exist. It is the kingdom of darkness where satan cracks his whip at his 'underlings'(demons), and they do his bidding. This is an eye-opening account that we should NOT just dismiss or ignore. Throughout the New Testament Jesus repeatedly warned us that hell is real, and He says we are to be witnesses throughout the earth. We are to do what Jesus did and that is to preach the ENTIRETY of the Word of God, not just the bits that are 'pleasant to our ears'. Heaven is real, but so is hell.

However, book is short on details concerning the visual images of Hell. If you are looking for a book that describes the domain of Hell better and in more detail - \\"A Land Unknown Hell's Dominion,\\" is a better book with classic imagery. Bill Wiese should get together with the Author of this book and compare notes, as they both describe the same place and both note the existence of Cells.However, 23 Minutes in Hell, excels in providing a great source for what the bible teaches on Hell by giving abundant footnotes and as well in the Appendix's section ample references about judgment and hell. It is well worth the price for these.The author starts out describing a cell and goes on describing Hell and demons. It is interesting how the author B. W. Melvin in his Christian book \\"A Land Unknown Hell's Dominion,\\" describes the same place and the demonic host there. I was left with the impression that they both saw the same place and verify each other. However, when one reads these styles of books - one must take the proverbial grain of salt and match judge by the bible what they seen.Overall, a great read and worth adding to your personal library."},{"Title":"23 Minutes In Hell: One Man's Story About What He Saw, Heard, and Felt in that Place of Torment","review":"I suppose it was inevitable that, with a bestselling book describing an author's \\"90 Minutes in Heaven,\\" one would soon follow detailing a journey to hell. Sure enough, Bill Wiese follows Don Piper's 90 Minutes in Heaven with his own 23 Minutes in Hell.Wiese's story is simple. One night, while sleeping, he was transported to hell. There God showed him hell in all its horror and terror. He was thrown into a barred cell, he was abused by demons, he was shown lakes of fire, and he saw people suffering torment. After a brief visit with Jesus, he was transported back to earth in order to tell people that Jesus is returning soon and to assure them that hell is a real place (and one that exists in the center of the earth, apparently). Wiese's hell seems to be equally influenced by the works of Ray Comfort, Mary Baxter and Gary Larson. That is to say it is at times biblically accurate, at times patently unbiblical, and at times near-comical.There are many things that can be said about this book from the perspectives of literature and theology. I will focus on just one under each heading. In terms of literature, there is little that can be said. This book is just plain bad. It is poorly written and seems cobbled together. It is something of a chore to read, though it is blessedly short and, unlike hell, the punishment does not last for long. I have read worse, of course, but there is no doubt that this is not a well-written book.My foremost concern involves theology. And here I want to point to the error that also plagued Don Piper's 90 Minutes in Heaven. It regards the necessity of such visitations. Don Piper travels the world now under the banner of \\"The Minister of Hope.\\" He brings hope by telling people that he has been to heaven and can attest that it is a real place. Bill Wiese now shares his message that hell is also real and is a real place (a really bad place). Yet in the Bible I find no reason to believe that God would want or need people to carry this kind of message based on their own experiences. God has given us the Bible precisely so we do not need such people! When a man travels around carrying a message like this one, he implicitly denies that the Bible is warning enough; his ministry indicates that he feels we need something more than \\"merely\\" the Bible in order to warn people of the joy to come to those who believe and the wrath to come for those who do not. These messengers, perhaps inadvertently, deny the uniqueness and the sufficiency of the Bible. If people will not believe the words of God as given in Scripture, why should or would they believe the fanciful words of a mere man?All this is not to say that 23 Minutes in Hell does not have any redeeming qualities. The author shares many things about hell that are true. He often quotes excellent teachers (and ones who would be less than thrilled, I'm sure, to see their names printed inside this book!). He does not downplay the horrific nature of hell or, as do so many today, attempt to deny its reality. However, one thing that is conspicuous by its absence is any mention of hell being the presence of God in His wrath. Wiese describes it as a place where people are punished for not believing in Jesus; yet the punishments are inflicted by demons and fire rather than by God Himself. From the Bible it seems clear that God is the one who is active in hell and that He punishes both humans and demons. If Wiese does downplay the awfulness of hell, it would be right here.Like 90 Minutes in Heaven, this book is plagued with theological errors and, also like Piper's effort, it does not deserve a place in anyone's library. Take a pass on it!"},{"Title":"23 Minutes In Hell: One Man's Story About What He Saw, Heard, and Felt in that Place of Torment","review":"When a person states, \\"Thus Says The Lord\\", they need to be ready to be scrutinized thoroughly to make sure their testimony matches with God's revealed word, in Scripture, already says. Unfortunately, Wiese's account of his \\"visit\\" to Hell does not pass this review. Wiese's story is that he was asleep, went to Hell for 23 minutes, Christ told him he came to Hell so he could tell others that Hell is real and that Christ does not want anyone to end up in Hell. There is really nothing new in this message, as the Bible is clear that Hell exists and that it is the place of ultimate punishment for the Devil, demons and those who do not turn to Christ. So it is hard to see why God would choose to take someone to Hell to describe what has already been described. Wiese tries to back up his story with an abundance of Scripture verses describing Hell. Unfortunately, most of the verses used are not referring to Hell at all. Examples include the mental state of people in Hell (Isaiah 57:21 which talks about the enemy of Israel while on earth), talking about how thirsty he was in Hell (John 4:13-14 which refers to Christ dealing with the woman at the well) and claiming that Hell is a literal burning place (Psalm 37:20 which states the wicked will vanish like smoke - very different from eternal fire). The most obvious error made by Wiese is his description of demons in Hell. There are some demons who are chained and in torment, but there are also a group of demons who are doing God's bidding in Hell. These demons rough up newcomers and guard the perimeter of the Lake of Fire to make sure nobody is able to get out. It also appears that these demons enjoy their job tormenting people in Hell. Really? First, Hell was made for Satan and his demons. No demon wants to go to Hell because it will be a place of eternal punishment for them, not an eternal schoolyard where they are the big bullies. Second, what demon does the bidding of God? Demons are in the business of fighting against God, not carrying out God's commands. This is a huge miss for Wiese and tells me that what he experienced was not from God but was rather something from his own imagination. I do not doubt that Wiese had some type of experience, but I do doubt that it was physical and that it was from God. Do not waste your time on this book."},{"Title":"23 Minutes In Hell: One Man's Story About What He Saw, Heard, and Felt in that Place of Torment","review":"Before reading this book I had never given much thought to what Hell would be like. This book opened my eyes to what could happen if someone didn't accept Jesus. In this story Wiese doesn't only talk about what his experience in Hell was like, but he also provides many scriptures to confirm what he saw or to let you simply make your own decisions about what Hell is like. This book made me want to help others to know Jesus Christ so they don't have to go through anything like what Bill Wiese has gone through. This was a good book and an easy read.

Half of the book is made up of the author's \\"descent into hell\\", the second half is made up of personal stories of how God enabled him to share his experience with others followed by some basic descriptions of the Biblical material about Hell.It is a short book, you can probably read it in less than 23 minutes, but even if it leaves you asking for more details it also gives you a feeling \\"what if...?\\"Mainly due to my missionary friends in South America I believe strongly in present day demon activity. They see it often and vividly. Here in the West the devil works differently. Not many truly believe and live as if demons existed. This book serves as a potent antidote to the laxity of our culture and its denial of Hell. Many philosophers (that's not a curse word) deny the actual flames and \\"brimstone\\" of Hell, pointing to the fact that there are worse things than physcial pain thus these flames represent suffering in general.I don't particularly like when authors pick Scripture verses out of context to prove a point. It makes him look \\"Biblical\\" while he MAY be the furtherst thing from it. Also, don't base your belief in Hell on this author's experience or preference of Scripture verses. Instead, use his experience as found in this book and add it to your own study of the Scripture as well as the historical Church. Find out what the Church has believed through the ages. One man, or even a dozen men, is not enough to base your belief on, just as no serious person should believe that authors LaHaye and Jenkins has nailed down how the end while come about.I am not convinced either way, but this description of Hell certainly made me think that \\"what if it is like this?\\" And in my study I have found that he does line up with the historical church on many issues. Indeed, Hell is real; it is painful; it is eternal; and it is without God. Then again, if people are without God now they shouldn't expect anything else. They will sing \\"I did it my way\\" all eternity long.

Last time I checked, you can get the New Testament for free!"},{"Title":"23 Minutes In Hell: One Man's Story About What He Saw, Heard, and Felt in that Place of Torment","review":"The book's account of the author's visit to Hell appears to be a fabrication, one based upon some forced interpretations of OT and NT passages.Why? The author's supporting Biblical quotations are most always taken without consideration of the larger passage they occur in, one that obviously undermines his interpretations. Yet the author claims to have read the Bible. Frequently. Carefully. For many, many years. The conclusion is clear: If an author has the audacity to blatantly distort his reports of a public text (here, the Bible) in making his case, he surely cannot be trusted when he reports his private experiences. We can conclude the author is a charlatan. I do not necessarily welcome this conclusion--it is a sad and regrettable one considering the emotional suffering the book has no doubt caused in many decent, trusting, uncritical readers--but logic presents it as quite certain.The author's abuse of Biblical quotation is apparent at many points in the book (a poorly written one, with a number of grammatical errors) but a quick look at chapter 8 (\\"Important Facts About Hell\\") will suffice.In order to establish that \\"...hell is a literal, burning place\\" the author cites John 15:6. He excerpts this single line,6 If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is withered; and men gather them, and cast them into the fire, and they are burned.And leaves out any mention of the fact that Jesus is building a parable with the way vineyard workers dispose of old vine branches. Parables are by definition non-literal, and are explicitly presented as non-literal by Jesus himself. But this is the very opposite of what the author is trying to show, that \\"...hell is a literal, burning place\\". The actual passage,John 151 I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman.2 Every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away: and every branch that beareth fruit, he purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit.3 Now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you.4 Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide in me.5 I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing.6 If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is withered; and men gather them, and cast them into the fire, and they are burned.7 If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you.8 Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; so shall ye be my disciples.9 As the Father hath loved me, so have I loved you: continue ye in my love.10 If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father's commandments, and abide in his love.11 These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy might remain in you, and that your joy might be full.12 This is my commandment, That ye love one another, as I have loved you.Clearly, this is not a passage that is trying to describe the author's Hell. It is the parable of the vine. It is about thriving in following Jesus, and not thriving--being destroyed, even--in not following Jesus. The burning of vine branches is part of the parable. It is not a literal claim, anymore than Jesus wishes us to believe he is literally a grape vine. Only by ignoring the actual passage can the author use 6 as Biblical evidence that \\"...hell is a literal, burning place\\". The abuse is so obvious here it is hard to know what else to say.Still, it gets worse. He also cites Malachi, 4:1,1 For, behold, the day cometh, that shall burn as an oven; and all the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble: and the day that cometh shall burn them up, saith the LORD of hosts, that it shall leave them neither root nor branch.But again, let's look at the whole passage,Malachi 41 For, behold, the day cometh, that shall burn as an oven; and all the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble: and the day that cometh shall burn them up, saith the LORD of hosts, that it shall leave them neither root nor branch.2 But unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of righteousness arise with healing in his wings; and ye shall go forth, and grow up as calves of the stall.3 And ye shall tread down the wicked; for they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet in the day that I shall do this, saith the LORD of hosts.4 Remember ye the law of Moses my servant, which I commanded unto him in Horeb for all Israel, with the statutes and judgments.5 Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the LORD:6 And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers, lest I come and smite the earth with a curse.Here we discover this \\"burning\\" is an event that takes place at a particular time--the great and dreadful day--and on Earth. The meaning is clear, God will destroy the wicked at this time--they will be reduced to \\"ashes under your [the survivors'] feet\\". Again, this has nothing to do with the hell the author tells us he visited. In that hell, the wicked do not turn into ashes, they are not walked on by the righteous, and they endure forever. Again, the context drains his quotation of any force. This is clear to anyone who reads the passage. So it is not a simple mistake by the author, it can only be an intentional attempt to mislead the reader. A shameless one, so easily is it discovered.The same thing happens when the author cites Psalm 37:20,\\"20 But the wicked shall perish, and the enemies of the LORD shall be as the fat of lambs: they shall consume; into smoke shall they consume away.\\"But now let's put this remark in its Biblical context. The 37th Psalm denounces the \\"wicked\\" in numerous ways, just prior to 20,14 The wicked have drawn out the sword, and have bent their bow, to cast down the poor and needy, and to slay such as be of upright conversation.15 Their sword shall enter into their own heart, and their bows shall be broken.and just after,21 The wicked borroweth, and payeth not again: but the righteous sheweth mercy, and giveth.22 For such as be blessed of him shall inherit the earth; and they that be cursed of him shall be cut off.and in its opening passage,1 Fret not thyself because of evildoers, neither be thou envious against the workers of iniquity.2 For they shall soon be cut down like the grass, and wither as the green herb.These condemnations are general and concern the fate of the wicked in this life. They will, at some point in the future, be killed by God. The righteous will survive. There is nothing in this passage to indicate the afterlife is involved. And look at what the comparison in 20 says, \\"...the enemies of the LORD shall be as [a comparison] the fat of lambs: they shall consume; into smoke shall they consume away.\\" So fat burns into smoke, and vanishes away. This is not what the author asserts he saw happening in hell. There, the \\"fat\\" [the wicked] is never consumed, it burns forever, it is not \\"consumed away\\". Moreover, \\"cut grass\\" dies, and \\"withered herb\\" is dead. Again, the context of the larger passage drains the author's quotation of any support for his vision of Hell. This Biblical passage is not describing the hell of \\"23 minutes\\". This is clear to anyone who reads it. So, again, it is no mistake by the author, it can only be an intentional attempt to deceive his readers.This sad tactic continues throughout the book.The point of all this is not to determine whether the Bible teaches the literal existence of hell, the point is that the author of \\"23 Minutes in Hell\\" frequently uses passages to prove it does that no honest person could understand that way when actually reading them in the Bible. So this is not about the Bible, this is about the author's willingness to abuse it in obvious ways. I conclude his deceitful character is established by his own words. Therefore we should conclude that his story about visiting Hell is equally deceitful.Whether this is ultimately a misfortune, or not, I leave to the reader."},{"Title":"23 Minutes In Hell: One Man's Story About What He Saw, Heard, and Felt in that Place of Torment","review":"Should everybody read this book?Probably.Why?It's not beautifully written, instead it's \\"just the facts, ma'am\\" style story telling.

I read a few pages and knew that I had to read it, as what he said was right on about what I had experienced - I now knew that what I experienced wasn't a ghost, but pure evil, and that what Bill said about satan and his demons utterly hating humanity that I finally understood what I had experienced, and it was not a ghost, but an evil presence."},{"Title":"23 Minutes In Hell: One Man's Story About What He Saw, Heard, and Felt in that Place of Torment","review":"I thought the book and the author's purported experience to be helpful for many.

Bill's experience is real and what an honor to have been chosen for God's purpose in letting all know that hell is a real place! Bill identified with the skepticism I had. He explained of his conservative nature and how he would have never chosen to be associated with something like this (his wife's trustworthy account included). This is the scariest book I have ever read (up until that point) I know I was meant to read it & pass it on. It's scary because it's REAL and worse than any horror movie I have ever seen (although I don't watch them anymore). Thanks Bill & Annette for your honest accts. Bill's story lit a fire under this Christian's tail. I don't want anyone I know or don't know to go to hell and neither does God. It's hard to believe ppl still choose to die without God & Jesus! None of God's children are \\"sent\\" to hell, they choose hell! Why??? Please read this book & come to accept before it's too late!

Just knock!If you're a skeptic needing proof that God really exists read \\"The Case for Faith\\" and \\"The Case for Christ\\" by former atheist Lee Strobel. Follow along with a Bible. You will find astounding scientific and historical evidence for the existence of God. Heaven and hell do exist! Why play games with eternity? The Lord is knocking and the hour is late, Only through God's gift in Jesus Christ can we enter into Heaven. So read this eye-opening book & pass it on!!!

There are people who actually believe this stuff? Here's a few things to think about:Author says more than once that the demons were deformed. By what standard? The demons were a thousand times stronger and faster than humans. Sounds like the devil is a better engineer than God and the demons are especially well formed. Were the dinosaurs deformed? Are snakes deformed? Are sharks? How can any beast who's master within his ecology be considered deformed?Author says there are six foot spiders or something. Exoskeletons don't work for creatures that big.Author says there isn't a drop of water within all of hell. Human bodies are mostly water, sorry. The demons were made of flesh too, again, water. And since the flesh of the demons perpetually rot and fall off the bones, there must be a great deal of moisture in the air. Things don't rot without moisture.Then there was the blackhole that sucked in all the light - good one.Finally, the reviewers are saying that it doesn't matter at all if this experience really happened because the message is true and backed up by scripture. Even the author suggests this. Yet, according to his book, Jesus had to let this happen to him to impress upon him the reality of the hell situation so to get the message out. But if it didn't need to happen at all, then why didn't Jesus just tell him to write a book about hell and give him a list of resources to quote from? So either Jesus is into unnecessary torture, or the actuality of the account absolutely matters.Finally, the author knows \\"intuitively\\" (he's always saying he doesn't know how he knows this or that fact, he just does) all kinds of trivia about hell. The demons are 1000 times stronger than humans etc. Let me unravel the mystery for you Mr. Wiess.

That sheep mentality is dangerous, that's why there's so many cults, same exact naive mindset. God doesn't want you to be naive (if he/she/it exists). People have and commonly do lie about thigns like this (why not believe the guy from south America claiming to be Jesus? The evidence is the same, some guy's words that could mesh with the Bible depending on how you look at it do any of you people actually have any standards for your beliefs?). They either do it to get attention/publicity, money, or because they're half crazy. Not everyone with a fantastic story like this is telling the truth, newsflash, people lie even claimed Christians, face reality here. I've even had pastors tell me that these claimed experiences are usually BS.The multiple accounts of hell this guy gives in his book are all different from his (he gives many examples from other people), including ones that make hell out to be a place devoid of any fire or heat. The first thing that makes it clearly BS is the fact that he \\"experiences\\" this in the middle of the night after going to sleep, huh, interesting, you know I've had dreams that seemed pretty real too, even felt sensations in a way, even experienced what I'm pretty sure was what my mind thought of hell was, difference between me and Wiese is that I know that dreams aren't visions from a supernatural world, I actually use my modern intellect. People hallucinate this sort of thing as well. Yet almost nobody who gave a review considered those possibilities, they do happen, so why not in this case? Can anyone answer me that? Don't be afraid to question. Blind faith (in people or god's) is not a good thign or a sign of being a more mature Christian it just means youv'e turned off your rational side. And just because it mostly matches scripture doesn't make it true, what's to stop somebody from reading Biblical accoutns of hell and creatign a BS story based on that and selling it as a personal experience?

This book is Wiese's reported experience of God having given him a \\"show and tell\\"--actually being in hell for 23 minutes--to let him know first hand how horrible hell really is so he could go back and spread the word in order to save as many people as possible from eternal damnation in literal hell fire. Wiese, in 2008 wrote his sequel, Hell, which is a proof-text study of the Bible to find verses to substantiate his perceived experience of hell. Based on his literal interpretation of the Bible, he, of course, found such verses.Wiese stated that just as the physical descriptions of heaven, such as the pearly gates and streets of gold, are literal so, likewise, the physical descriptions of the fire of hell must also be literal. The truth is that neither the physical descriptions of heaven nor hell are literal. It is all symbolic language to describe realities in the spiritual world of which words are inadequate to express. Jesus' symbolic words, \\"salted with fire\\" (Mk. 9:49), are IMPOSSIBLE to be literal. Someone or something can be salted with salt or burned with fire, but no one or anything can be salted with fire. This is a mixed metaphor which, beyond any doubt whatsoever, symbolizes purification. Jesus, beyond the shadow of a doubt, deliberately mixed these two Biblical symbols for purification in order to try to prevent literalist from literally interpreting this beautiful, timeless, cross-cultural symbolism for purification. But, literalists being who literalists are and doing what literalists do, interpret \\"salted with fire\\" literally anyway or, in the case of Wiese, he says that even if fire is not literal it symbolizes something worse than literal fire. This contention is absolute nonsense! If \\"worse than literal fire\\" is to the human spirit what literal fire is to the human body, it cannot be worse! Thanks be to God, it symbolizes something infinitely better--purification!Ironically, in a perverse way, Wiese argues for metaphorical fire in that he contends that hell is deep in the earth (core 12,000 degrees) and God will intensify this heat of literal fire in order to make hell even more torturous for the vast majority of the world whom will be condemned to the eternal fire. This even includes the billions of people (including infants, all of whom are guilty of original sin, per the late John Gerstner in his book, Repent or Perish) who died without ever having heard about salvation in Christ who is the only way to heaven. But, according to Wiese, God is very saddened by having to condemn so many people to eternal damnation EVEN THOUGH HE LOVES THEM. If God tortures people forever in hell fire, what difference does it make if He loves them? God might as well hate them; the result would be no different!Wiese's \\"reasoning\\" that sinners make God punish them in hell fire forever is a good example of spiritual schizophrenia. Kirby Godsey wrote an excellent book in favor of Christian Universalism, \\"When We Talk About God...Let's Be Honest.\\" So let's be honest in talking about God. To say that sinners force God to torture them forever in fire which is even hotter than literal fire, is a pathetic excuse for God doing something so unbelievably sadistic! Wiese clearly believes in a God who is a spiritual schizophrenic. That is, God desires all people to be saved, but even though God is omniscient, He cannot figure out a way to bring sinners around to doing His will without violating their free will.The solution to that theological problem, of God's sovereignty vs. human free will, is called, \\"irresistible grace,\\" which means that though God's saving grace can be resisted indefinitely, it was not be resisted forever. Since God is also omnipotent, He has the power as well as unconditional love to out last and out love sinners until the last prodigal son or daughter comes home to heaven where there will be great rejoicing! Since God is a \\"consuming fire,\\" He does not torture sinners forever; He, as fire, consumes sin, thereby, purifying sinners. This reveals Christian Universalism to be the Biblical truth and exposes the doctrine of eternal punishment for the big lie, from the pit of hell, which it is.The late, great Christian writer, George MacDonald, the \\"master\\" of C.S. Lewis, who believed in Christian Universalism, said that if people of the world believed in eternal damnation, in hell fire, half of the world would be insane and the other half would be atheists! Of literalists belief in eternal/literal hell fire, it can be said with certainty that their version of Christianity is spiritual insanity, and their god is criminally insane! Those who believe it are at risk of mental as well as spiritual insanity. It is child abuse and is often the basis of (no divorce at all or only for adultery) spousal abuse. Such terroristic theology, which frightens people into accepting Christ as their Savior, also locks them into a state of permanent spiritual infancy.Yes, the Bible says in Proverbs that fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom. But, notice that such fear is only the \\"beginning.\\" The Bible says in the New Testament that the one who fears is not perfected in love because fear involves torment; perfect love casts out fear. Biblical fear means a reverence for or a sense of awe about God, not morbid fear. The Apostle Paul admonished new believers to grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. But believers can never grow spiritually in an atmosphere of fear. In order for Christians to grow spiritually, if they have been scared into accepting Christ, that initial fear must be transformed in a love relationship which will happen when they come to understood God's unconditional love, amazing grace, infinite mercy, and perfect justice.For Christianity without insanity, read good books which expose the false doctrine of eternal torment as spiritual terrorism and Christian Universalism as the glorious truth which it certainly is! This totally-positive conception of God elicits love of God, enhances worship of God, and promotes altruistic service for God in addition to optimizing emotional, mental, spiritual, and even physical health!Boyd C.

Highly recommended."},{"Title":"23 Minutes In Hell: One Man's Story About What He Saw, Heard, and Felt in that Place of Torment","review":"I am at a catch 22 here. In my researching and writing about past life regressions, near death experiences, hallucinogenic drugs, the works...I usually have to take a story with a grain of salt unless it can be proven. For example, in \\"Looking for Carroll Beckwith\\", Robert Snow, a heavy skeptic of past life regression, went through a past life regression and found himself painting a portrait. He had taped the regression and found 28 facts that could be proven or disproved. Eventually it turns out that he found the painting, but could not have some how just remembered it from a previous event in his life because that painting hadn't been seen in public since 1912, and no copies were ever made. Upon getting hold of the 17,000 page diaries of Carroll Beckwith, he was able to confirm the 28 provable or disprovable facts. It was things like Beckwith's mother having a stroke and dieing, him ordering a glass of wine, he needing a cane to walk, etc. All 28 facts were proven to be true out of what scientists call a \\"fantasy\\" of the mind, hypnotic regression. There is no way that Snow could have known all of this because he had never even HEARD the name Carroll Beckwith.Cases like this can be made with near death experiences and hallucinogenic drugs. With that, I believe that all three (regression, drugs, and NDE's) all have a factor of truth behind them because of the provable things people report after coming out of these events. Having gathered up quite a large collection of these, I am left with a decision.On one hand I can call Bill Weise' experience a made up story to convert people into Christianity, hence Weise winning souls to Christ. We all know that Christians more than any other people do some crazy things. On the other hand, I have to take his story, much like the three factions mentioned previously, with a grain of realism. I look for things that can either be proven or disproved.A lot of what Weise talks about can be found in the scriptures of the Bible, yet every year more and more evidence seems to point to the conclusion that the Bible was really just a misinterpretation for extra terrestrials coming to Earth. The dead sea scrolls, for example, talk of Jesus believing in reincarnation and teaching such things. Then we have to look at events like the Council of Nicea. These were the people who are infamous for changing the Bible into what it is today. Next we see people like Constantine getting their mitts on the gospels and changing it to rule over his people with fear and God's wrath.The origins of the Bible date back to Sumeria (Mesopotamia), but Jews and Christians think that it is from the Hebrew texts, which is a common misconception that people like Weise seem to overlook. The crazy thing is, though, that the Sumerian religion is filled with a polytheistic view. There were 12 gods rather than 1 god. This can even be seen in one of the first parts of the Bible: Genesis 1:26 \\"Then God said, 'Let us make man in our image, in our likeness...'\\". We can see here that God says \\"us\\" rather than \\"my image\\". Angels were supposedly not around at that time, so the only person God could be talking to is himself...but he is not an \\"our\\" or \\"us\\".The word \\"God\\" in Jewish texts is Elohim, but once again the owners of the Bible want you to believe in something not true. Elohim is plural, meaning multiple deities. Eloah is the singular version of Elohim. Why isn't God called \\"Eloah\\"? Rabbi's tell us that is because God is everything, but they fail to see that it is too coincidental that Judaism comes from Sumeria, which had a polytheistic religion.This being the case, how can we take Heaven and Hell seriously? They were definitely used to control people for not hundreds but close to two thousand years! Then we have provable cases in hypnotic regression, near death experiences, and hallucinations (which allow us to talk to beings on the other side and have information carried back into our minds like where grandmother hid her jewelery before she died, for example, and then they actually dig the jewelry up and find out that the being on the other side of their hallucination under hallucinogenic drugs had some truth to it) which all specifically point to reincarnation if you look at the cases even in a lazy way.Do I believe in Heaven and Hell? No. Do I believe Weise story? I believe his spirit guides were showing him what hell would be like to try and scare him into being a good person. Spirit guides come to us as the leaders of our religion. For example, if I believe in Christianity, spirit guides wouldn't talk to me in the form of Buddha or Allah, but rather as Jesus, because they are not here to change our beliefs. Notice how when a regression or Near death experience happens, it always involves a loving being on the other side, whether it is \\"Jesus\\" or \\"Buddha\\" or \\"Allah\\" or \\"God\\". That is because in the afterlife there is love rather than a Heaven and Hell.In Graham Hancocks book \\"Supernatural\\", he finds that 2% of the population of the Earth have the ability to trigger hallucinations (which is just an overload of a chemical in your brain called DMT)either on accident or spontaneously. In the book 23 Minutes in Hell, Weise has this point where for a few seconds he asks God to show him hell again, and for 10 seconds \\"God\\" does. I think it is obvious that he has the ability to produce DMT when he concentrates on such a thing, though he does not know it.Some people might think that DMT is just a hallucinogenic part of the brain, and thats why he had a \\"trip\\" to hell, but what ever chemical you have in your brain in more abundance than being stable gives you different results. Too much alcohol gives you a drunk effect, which is an alternate view of reality, and DMT gives you an alternate view of reality that is more radical than alcohol, so read \\"Supernatural\\" to see how that works if you wish.In the end, I think the story here is that being all knowledgeable, Weise' spirit guides recreated his belief in the Bible (as he uses very loose translations from the Bible to back up his experience) and send him through a trip to basically say \\"don't forget about your sins. Be a good person\\", which is an honorable message.Being nonhypocritical, I will let others believe what they want. I shall shut up now! :)4/5John McAdam: Author of \\"Were Ancient Gods From Other Planets?\\""},{"Title":"23 Minutes In Hell: One Man's Story About What He Saw, Heard, and Felt in that Place of Torment","review":"Want to know what the devil has in store for the unbeliever in Christ?

They go to sleep. Around 3am, Bill is yanked from his bed and thrown into a dark, foreboding cell. Creatures are in there with him, and they start tearing him apart. Somehow, he crawls out of there, only to encounter a literal lake of burning fire. The pain and torment is unrelenting. But off in the distance, he sees Christ, who pulls him out of there and lifts him high above the earth so that he can see his house, then he drops him back into bed. A 23 minute trip by our time standards, but seemingly much longer to him.After a brief discussion of the aftermath of the experience, Wiese concludes that God allowed him to experience what being hell is like so that he can warn others. The rest of the book is a discussion of what hell is like according to Scripture.A couple of concerns that I had with the book: a. Many of the Old Testament verses used to describe literal realities in hell are probably metaphorical descriptions of God's wrath, as hell as a place of fiery torment was not really described until the intertestamental period.b. If God has not appointed us to suffer wrath (1 Thessalonians 5:9), then why would God appoint Wiese to suffer wrath, even for 23 of our clock minutes? Isn't the reality of hell terrible enough from what we read in Scripture to warrant us warning people of the wrath to come?Despite these questions, I still found the book frightening and worthy of reading and a reminder that \\"you don't want to go there.\\""},{"Title":"23 Minutes In Hell: One Man's Story About What He Saw, Heard, and Felt in that Place of Torment","review":"i could not put this book down.

I am really having a hard time reconciling the Jesus in these two books with the Jesus of my youth and youth adulthood. The Jesus I was brought up to believe in is supposedly a billion times more understanding, forgiving, loving and generous than we (mortals) could ever be. If I as a human being can HONESTLY say that I would eventually forgive a person who did great harm to one of my loved ones, then how could Jesus not.In the Mary Kay book she comes across as more compassionate than our Lord? Don't think so. Would I want to see anyone or thing tormented for ever and ever....NO............to me that is demonic.One part of her book has a woman who was Hindu going to hell because she ........was Hindu? HUH?

I believe he experienced what he says he experienced and I also believe that Jesus spoke to him and told him he was given this experience to warn others. However... What I'm not buying is the second half of the book where he uses the bible to give answers on hell, death and sin. Basically the second half of the book is the author trying to make sense of what happened and warn us all that if we don't open our hearts to Jesus we will burn for eternity. His warnings are incredibly biased towards Christianity and the reality is Jesus never actually said anything to him about this stuff. My recollection is that Jesus only spoke two sentences to him. So I feel like his upbringing, faith and religious practice drives this book, not actual conversation with Jesus himself. An interesting read but very traditional in the sense of 'You're either on board with Christianity or your going to burn in hell'.

What was funny though is how much he reminded the reader that his observations are nothing compared to the Word. He even says he's no expert on Hell.Let me get this straight. The man can describe physically being there, having his flesh torn and pierced by demons, and meeting Jesus, yet he is not an expert? As compared to who, the writers of the Bible? Does he not realize that he has just written the most current, first, and only modern 'Christian' testament? Even the Mormon prophets don't dare, not since the early days of Joseph Smith. Is there anyone denouncing him yet as a false prophet? Why or why not?What is wrong with this picture? Christianity and the end of days are big business. BIG. Ever seen the size of Joel Osteen's Stadium/Forum? I found my copy not at B&N; (although the girl knew where to look and what the cover looked like), but at Walmart. Mainstream baby.Besides an instant moneymaker, this book is one big fear tactic. For anyone who's had a bad dream or heard one too many scary stories about demonic possession, this book is like crack. The Rapture groupies must be drooling. But what's really frightening is how this message is shared with children. Page 66 included a quote from a sobbing 7 year old girl, \\"We have to tell our neighbors about Jesus, because they are going to hell!\\" I'm sure she will have a healthy relationship with them and all the other ignorant sinners she meets. Ever seen the DVD, 'Jesus Camp'?Hell is the greatest selling point for Christianity. A scare tactic for conversion. And why is conversion important? Money and power. I'm thinking Vatican and all the cathedrals and stadium sized churches ever built. Praise the Lord. You did see how the Mormon church influenced the Prop. 8 vote?I believe the book is a work of fiction, or else a record of a most vivid waking dream resulting from a life focused on Christian myths. I don't know which is sadder, the deliberate manipulation of vulnerable minds for money, or psychological damage that can lead to such dreams, and how that damaging myth is now spreading itself (like a virus) to those who are willing to pay $12.00 for a booster infection.Books and stories like this just serve to strengthen my opinion that the Bible is having a negative impact on the health of society, be it mentally, population-wise, or conservation-wise (due to rapture induced short-timers disease).When 7 years olds are taught that God and demons exist before they are taught or develop critical thinking skills, you get people who read the Bible for the first time through the eyes of a believer, not in the context of the Bible, or of anything else. When the going in argument is that God exists and that the Bible is His Holy Word you are on a path of unauthentic faith. Not chosen faith, but embedded faith. Where's the free will in that?"},{"Title":"23 Minutes In Hell: One Man's Story About What He Saw, Heard, and Felt in that Place of Torment","review":"Obviously because he says that he went to hell in an out-of-body experience makes it absolutely true despite the fact that nobody can confirm or deny that it actually happened."},{"Title":"23 Minutes In Hell: One Man's Story About What He Saw, Heard, and Felt in that Place of Torment","review":"Although I am no Bible scholar or theologian after only reading the first few pages of this book I could tell it was one of the most Biblicaly inaccurate books ever published.

Please click through my profile name to see that I buy many books from Amazon and I also read them.As I mentioned, a friend of mine lent me this book as she had talked about it and I became interested. What I read was a very literal interpretation of hell as lived out during a dream. The dream started at 3am (The witching hour)and lasted a total of 23 minutes. The author speaks of monsters, fire, degradation, humiliation, suffering, wailing and walks us through everything that we have heard about hell.I feel the author is a very fundamental believer in the bible and takes every word literally and legally. Had the author been born in the middle of a jungle in Burma and never read the bible I don't think he would have had the same dream.The book is poorly written and biblical passages and references are liberally spattered throughout the text which does not so much support his case but tends to break your reading stride. These references should have been footnotes.I honestly can not believe this book received so much hype. The writing style is one of a child with an almost \\"and then ..... and then .... and then....\\" tone to it as if there's a child before you recounting his day at school. The content is straight out of \\"What's hell like 101\\" and I'm torn between accepting this as the dream of a sane man or the ramblings of a slightly deranged man.The fundamentalists amongst us will love it as excitedly, they will learn hell is exactly what they believe, the serious believers will most likely be scared if they believe this book to be true but the fence straddlers and none believers will find it \\"tongue in cheek\\" and discount it quickly."},{"Title":"23 Minutes In Hell: One Man's Story About What He Saw, Heard, and Felt in that Place of Torment","review":"Hell is real. I know because my husband's spirit and soul were sent there during a cardiac arrest. He was clinically dead for twenty minutes. I saw him die and was there in the hospital when he awoke after three hours of unconciousness. During those three hours the doctors asked him many questions but could not get a response from him. All he would say was \\"I died, I went to hell, It was horrible\\" over and over again while tears streamed down his face. After he awoke he told me of his experience with demons and hell. He also told me that Jesus brought his spirit and soul out of hell and returned them to his physical body in order to live again. He remembered what it felt like to die and how it felt when his spirit and soul departed his body. His name is Charles R Tidwell and he just finished publishing a book about all his encounters with death and Hell, demons and angels, visions and God-sent dreams.

This is a side of eternity that we don't give much thought to and we tend to shrug off and say \\"we'll deal with it when the time comes\\". Its a harsh reality that we are unworthy to inherit heaven apart from Christ, and apart from Christ we deserve hell. We deserve this experience in this book for eternity if we live up to \\"good standards\\" we set amongst ourselves. We deserve hell for rejecting the standards of Christ, being adopted as children through repentance, being born again. Because of this book I have come to know the Lord and I have been walking with the Lord now for two years, tomorrow.

I'd say there was only really about 1/2 of the book is the \\"story\\", while the rest being appendix data you can use if you want to do more research.This book does leave a burden on your heart for the lost. Hell is a real place of eternal torment, not something that you can go to sleep at night knowing people will die there eternally.Just the event itself leaves questions in my mind about God if he did allow Wiese to go to hell. Why would God send one of his own children to the worst place in all heaven and earth?

The Lord spoke of it many, many times and you cannnot hand pick the parts of Christianity you like and deny the rest. Jesus said it and I believe it, although some may not. This book is both fascinating and heartbreaking to believe anyone goes to this place. It fills you with a sense of urgency to warn others. The only question I have refers to scripture when the man in hell wanted to warn his brothers of what was to come and God did not allow it; however I reconcile it with the times we are living in. These are the end times and there will be those who have dreams and visions.

I appreciated the personal testimony section about the aftermath of his experience. I also appreciate the Wieses for their bravery in standing up and obeying God.

If we are to take the author's account at face value, we must conclude that he was given a special revelation from God. (I use \\"special revelation\\" as a theological term of art, in contrast to general revelation, which is accessible to everyone, believer or not. For example, the apparent order found in natural things, our innate sense of right and wrong, good and evil. Or, to quote Kant: what amazed him were \\"the starry heavens above, and the moral law within.\\") If, however, we conclude that he did have a special revelation, then a cardinal principle of Protestant Christianity goes by the board: that of \\"sola scriptura.\\" Special revelation is complete with the Scriptures; there is no need for anything else. Scripture itself warns us: \\"All scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness, that the man of God may be competent, equipped for every good work.\\" (2 Timothy 3: 16-17.) Note: \\"EVERY good work.\\" Needless to say, the author has anticipated this objection. He deftly litters the text with biblical quotes, which, remarkably, coincide with his own narrative of his experience. The problem here is logical. Either his account, or scripture, is redundant. If scripture tells us everything he's telling us, then we don't need his account. If he's telling us more, and his revelation is authentic, then scripture is insufficient.I would put his \\"experience\\" in the same category as any mystical experience. A bible-based Christianity has little use for mystics or their accounts; and for the same reason. Either they're adding to Scripture, or they're not. If not, then we don't need them. If they are, then we should listen to them and not bother with scripture. (After all, what is more convincing that a \\"direct experience?\\" Nowadays, this is the central theme of most alternative religion.) In the history of Christianity, mystics have caused much more trouble than they're worth. A good example is Joan of Arc; how many people had to die, because a hysterical person was hearing voices?However \\"real\\" the author's experience may have seemed to him, if it can be explained in a way that doesn't compromise sound theology, then we should prefer that explanation. My sense is that the author is mad, or at least was mad at the time of his experience. His experience was hallucinatory, no more, no less. His description of hell and its inhabitants was just too much like what a Christian's speculative imagination would produce, if he or she tried to imagine what hell is like. If I were writing a novel on this subject, I would surely try to be more original. And, unfortunately, he neglected to bring back a souvenir to show us.Another question which this story raises is this: if the author wasn't dead yet, what was he doing in hell? (He himself insists that his suffering was real, and that he had conveniently forgotten that he was already saved. I myself wouldn't trust God, if I thought he could play such perverse mind games with me.) Other authors--one in particular who claims to have seen heaven--claim that they were dead, but were miraculously restored to life. As far as I know (and I know only what Scripture tells me) only Jesus Himself, or those whom He raised from the dead, have ever died and come back to tell about it. The author's claim of an \\"out-of-body\\" experience is just sounds to much like New Age cant. The idea, expressed by the author, that the body is \\"not me,\\" but only a vehicle that gets us around, comes dangerously close to the Gnostic view of the relation of spirit to body. And too, if he left his body behind, then what was he doing with a body in hell? There is no Scriptural warrant whatever for the idea that we die, get a second, temporary body, and then get yet another one at the last judgment.Bible oriented Christians would do themselves a favor by not reading this book. If God takes His revealed word seriously, He will surely not blame them for refusing to be distracted by alternate revelations, whatever form they may take.Aidan McDowell"},{"Title":"23 Minutes In Hell: One Man's Story About What He Saw, Heard, and Felt in that Place of Torment","review":"Excellent...but you have to read the first 3 chapters or you won't be able to sleep!

It was a very good book. The only part of this book that I didn't agree with was when he said that children do not go to hell when they die. The scriptures he referred to did not literally mean people in childrens' bodies...it meant you must have 'child like faith' in order to enter into the Kingdom of God. In the bible it clearly states that God is NOT a respector of persons...meaning - in this case - that a child can go to hell if they die and neither one of their parents are saved. It says in Gods word that one saved person in a house can save the entire house....meaning if a man and woman are married and one of their children die when they are under the age of accountability - if one of those parents are saved (accepted the Lord Jesus Christ as their personal savior) then that child will go to heaven. On the other hand if neither of the parents are saved then that child will go to hell when they die period. There was only one innocent child born on this earth and that was Jesus Christ. He was innocent because He was and is the Son of the Living God, born and lived without sin.This is a very good book and I do believe that this man did experience what he said he experienced. A lot of people have experienced similar or the same thing he did. It really doesn't matter if a person 'chooses' to believe him or not..or even if they believe in hell or not; but Gods truth is what it is...the TRUTH! A lot of people - due to their ignorance - will not accept Gods' Truth no matter what and when they die they will go straight to hell. They will suffer. This man did what the Lord told him to do. He did his part now it's up to the reader and the listener if they choose to accept Jesus Christ as their personal savior and change their wicked ways! Repent! Jesus is coming back very soon!I was happy when the Lord said unto me come into my house! I'm so happy that I accepted Jesus Christ as my personal savior when I was a very little girl!

Now before going into my review on this book, I'll tell you I'm not a gullible individual. And no, I am not a religious zealot. However, I am a Christian who is well-versed in Bible passages. Granted, there are those who abuse Bible teachings for personal gain. However, after watching this man's testimony, and then reading his book, I personally have no doubt that he's being truthful in carrying God's message to the world. Further more, as disturbing as his revelation might be, the story is of extreme importance to where many will be (*are*) spending their eternity. For those of you who have openly mocked this testimony and the existance of a virtual hell, then all my prayers are with you. For all the nay sayers, just take a moment to think that perhaps, just perhaps mind you, that hell is as real a place as Our Lord Himself, Jesus decribed it to be, then what shall become of you when your time on earth has ended? I, for one, believe not only in what the author tells us here, but also believe what The Bible teaches about this infernal place. I was baptized as a baby. However, at the end of this month I shall receive baptism once more as an adult in reverance to Jesus Christ. I have copied CDs of this man's testimony, passing it along to family,friends and even enemies. I suggest you yourselves pass it along as well.

Even if you were not a Christian, this book gives you some insight as to what hell will be like. I think people do not actually have any concept of how awful hell is and that eternal is forever. There will be no second chances. Once you die and have not accepted Christ as your Personal Savior, you are doomed to a life that will never end of torment worse than most of us can imagine. If you are a Christian you will enjoy this book and it will reinforce all that you have thought and more, if you are not a Christian, but are an intelligent person, then head straight to the Bible, read it and ask God to come live in your heart and give you eternal life in a place just the opposite, more wonderful than we can imagine."},{"Title":"23 Minutes In Hell: One Man's Story About What He Saw, Heard, and Felt in that Place of Torment","review":"I believe the author--that he was given the experience of hell (by God) in order for him to come back and tell us what he saw, felt, smelled and heard in that God-forsaken place.

It is interesting that all the author had to say in his book was also in scripture. Granted, the author had it in-your-face in an instant, whereas scripture gives you little glimpses and one-liners here and there. The idea is that one must search scripture for truth, that seems to have escaped many. But, for the sake of argument, if you are one who trusts the Bible, there is no way you could not take this book to heart. I have read the reviews and it seems most of them are not inclined to trust the Word as that of the Creator - but they took the time to read this book anyway. It certainly gives you a reason to fear for those whose pride in themselves negates the possibility or reality of a supreme being who is interested in us, directs us and is willing to punish those that totally reject Him.

I found the experience from the first few chapters in 23 Minutes in Hell riveting, and I re-read them after completing the book. I noted the author was careful to put more emphasis on the scriptural references to hell, but the fact that he did not read those until after his experience, and that I recently read an account of St. Teresa of Avila that had many similarities to Weise's, leads me to give good credibility to his account. St. Teresa also described going down a tunnel with reptilian demons on the walls, and large, massive demons that tortured her flesh, reveled in her terror and suffering, and the after-terror that she had upon returning from her vision. Wiese's book also inspires a good zeal on the part of the reader. If you are convicted that this is the truth, then you are compelled to witness. In the book Wiese says that if you saw a pool drained 50% and replaced with acid by bad guys, that if you saw a board tossed in and dissolved, and then you saw children running to go swimming in the pool, you would certainly want to do everything to prevent them from entering the pool. Well hell is real, and for every athiest or agnostic that says there is no compelling reason to believe in God, the reality of hell is a compelling reason, even if they have other interference preventing them from recognizing the revelation of God's love, in the sacrifice of his Son, Our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To some complaining about the writing, throughout history God chooses unlikely candidates to do his work, and not all of them are Rhode Scholars or Harvard trained! The writing was fine. It was a down to earth style, and not unlike having a good conversation with a fellow pilgrim in a local breakfast restaurant. To the reviewer that thinks Hell is empty right now--there are two judgments, \\"the particular judgment\\" that occurs immediately upon a person's death, and then \\"the last judgment\\" at the end of time. Hell has occupants now. Why would Jesus have told the story in Luke 16:19-31, if there was no rich man in torment in flames, craving a drop of water on the tip of Lazarus's finger. Souls are not sleeping somewhere awaiting the final judgment. Although I am sure they would have preferred to just be sleeping or gone into non-existance rather than be suffering eternal torment. Why are they in hell? How does one avoid hell? These are the questions this book poses and answers. The scripture verses are spot on. We cannot be united with God unless we freely chose to love him, and unless we believe in Jesus Christ, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sins of the world, and unless we take care of the least of his brothers. (Matthew 25:31-46) For those that dismiss this book, and reviews similar to mine, and all other attempts by God that they not suffer eternal damnation, please read and ponder this verse, \\"If they do not listen to Moses and the prophets, they will not be convinced even if one should rise from the dead.\\" (Luke 16:31) Happy Easter!"},{"Title":"23 Minutes In Hell: One Man's Story About What He Saw, Heard, and Felt in that Place of Torment","review":"I, like the person under me, also finished this book in two sittings.

I am familar with Mary Baxter and Dr. Richard Ebys account of Hell from years past. Bill Wiese is another credible witness to the reality of Hell based on the truth of the Bible. God is faithful to provide witnesses so that all will be without excuse. Having read the SCRIPTURES I was already convinced about the REALITY of HELL and the necessity of Jesus Christ as the ANSWER. WHO are all those people in Hell someone asked? UNREPENTANT sinners, SCOFFERS, Haters of what is Good; calling good evil and evil good. People who prefer to believe in UFO'S and the tales spun by various cults and those who do not read or believe the Bible. They follow fables and the imaginations of their hearts and lying signs and wonders. The Bible says that \\"ALL have sinned and fall short of the glory of God\\". The Bible warns that Satan appears as a \\"angel of light\\", and there are \\"Doctrines of Demons\\", lies to lull people in thinking they are ok, when they are not. All these other accounts of \\"light\\", near death experiences that are Christless, \\"you're ok whatever you believe\\", are false as they do not line up with the Scripture These deny Jesus as the Savior- and thats the rule to judge truth by as He is the Way, the Truth and the Life. The message of this book is believe the Bible- turn to Jesus for forgiveness of your sins. (\\"Born-again\\" doubters can you show how Bill Weise is in error?) I am grateful to Jesus Christ, for He paid the price for our sins and He will not cast out any who come to HIM. Many are offended by this message.

Most preachers and pastors of today shy away from the fearful topic of Hell; but the Lord Jesus Christ while on earth referred to it more often than he did of heaven as a final abode for unbelievers.When asked the question,\\"Why did you send me to this awful place?\\", the response to Bill by Jesus was simply,\\"Because many people do not believe that Hell is real\\".The sad reality is that most individuals feel that they are good enough to gain entrance into heaven but certainly not bad enough to go to Hell. That is perhaps Satan's greatest delusion.Bill Wiese's book should be widely hearlded for what it is: The strongest and most powerful personal encounter to date of the terrible ravishes and torment of an eternal Hell that awaits those whom the Scriptures reveal \\" shall be cast into outer darkness where there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth \\"."},{"Title":"23 Minutes In Hell: One Man's Story About What He Saw, Heard, and Felt in that Place of Torment","review":"I couldn't stop reading this ebook.

It definitely impacted my attitude to the point that hell is a place to avoid at all cost.The author's account of \\"hell\\" wasn't that lengthy. In fact, it was quite short.

I think the last time I heard one was when my father preached about it and he passed away in 1986. I've heard a lot of people ask \\"Why would God send someone to hell and bring him back?\\" My question is \\"Why wouldn't He?\\" So many churches have decided that hell does not exist so he sent the author to prove otherwise. In Luke 16:19-31 is the story of the Lazarus and the rich man.

I know I have made that comment numerous times over the years. After reading the book, 23 Minutes in Hell, and interviewing the author, Bill Wiese, I am never going to use that euphemism again.23 Minutes in Hell chronicles 1380 seconds that Wiese actually experienced in November of 1998 when he was thrust into the depths of Satan's dominion.It was not a dream. It was not a nightmare. It was real.In 23 Minutes in Hell, Bill recounts the anguish, misery, agony, and torment awaiting those who turn their backs on their Creator. The fire, brimstones, and burning heat are there, along with monsters and evil demonic beings.Why did Bill Wiese go to hell and how did he get there?Since 1970, Bill has been a dedicated, practicing Christian who is active in his non-denominational church. For over thirty years he was a successful real estate broker in Orange County and is happily married to his beautiful wife Annette. He is a soft-spoken humble man not given over to theatrics and hysteria. Yet, at 3:00 am on the morning of November 23rd, 1998, he found himself hurled into the abyss of fury, imprisoned in a totally dark cell guarded by intimidating gigantic beasts, grotesque in form, and foul in temper. Bill had never known such fear or hopelessness. For the next twenty-three minutes, which felt like an eternity, he experienced unearthly destruction and devastation amongst the living dead. Finally a light so brilliant, pure and white filled the tunnel. He found himself at the feet of Jesus, where peace and love replaced the terror and hatred.Throughout the book, Bill cites passages to biblical references to hell. He makes it clear that he did not have a near-death experience, but instead, he was witness to a vision. He believes he was sent to hell in order to return and tell others that this everlasting inferno really does exist. Since that ordeal, Bill and Annette have been traveling the globe sharing the message that hell exists and the book has become a New York Times best seller empowering readers without a publicity campaign.Whether you believe in heaven or hell is your own personal prerogative. Read 23 Minutes in Hell to gain insight on the warning vision given to Bill by God. As a companion reference, read his other book and watch the DVD 23 Questions about Hell. Bill's mission to help you help yourself is sincere and heartfelt. Make your own decisions on how you plan on living this life. Bill states, \\"It doesn't matter if you believe my experience.

Good intentions aside, I do not recommned this book."},{"Title":"23 Minutes In Hell: One Man's Story About What He Saw, Heard, and Felt in that Place of Torment","review":"With a heavy heart, I must give an honest review of this book. Before I begin, I want to start off by stating upfront that I am a born-again Christian, and I do believe that unbelievers who die without Christ will suffer eternal torment in Hell. However, with this said, I must say that I do not believe Bill Wiese' account.I had heard about this book for quite some time before I had actually read it. At first I thought this was going to be a story about a man who wasn't a Christian, clinically died and went to Hell, came back to life and is now a Christian. Instead, I was surprised to find out that not only was Wiese already supposed to have been a Christian, but he didn't even die. Instead, he just went to bed at 3:00a.m. one night, fell into a pit and ended up in literal Hell. In this Hell he was tormented by demons, heat so intense that he should have been dead, and he witnessed a pit of fire where souls were being tormented. During his time in Hell, Wiese claims that he didn't know about God and had \\"forgotten\\" he was a Christian. He later supposedly gets rescued by Jesus and is told that he was purposely made to forget that he was a Christian. The entire reasoning behind this experience is so that Wiese can know that Hell exists and he can now tell others about it. He wakes back up in his living room where he fell asleep at 3:23a.m.Right away, one would think that Wiese just had a nightmare, but Wiese is convinced that he had an out-of-body experience where his soul literally descended into Hell. Wiese insists that this wasn't just a dream.This is all told in the first three chapters of the book, and the rest of the book is simply accounts of Wiese' evangelistic testimonies and answering a few questions about Hell. But the first three chapters are really the \\"highlight\\" of the book. In fact, I found myself getting bored after the third chapter, because the rest of it becomes testimonies of Wiese being invited to speak about his experience, and then the book going into answering standard philosophical questions about Hell that can be found in many other books.The main problem I have with Bill Wiese' story is that it just simply isn't consistent with what the Bible teaches about how God operates.In Luke 16:19-31 Jesus tells a story about a rich man who dies and ends up in Hell. The rich man becomes concerned that his family might end up in Hell too. So he asks Abraham (who is in paradise but is able to communicate with the rich man) if he can go and tell his family about Hell. And Abraham responds with, \\"If they do not listen to Moses and the Prophets, they will not be persuaded even if someone rises from the dead\\" (v. 31). So, knowing that Jesus told this story of the rich man, and the Bible teaches that if someone isn't persuaded by the Scriptures, then they will not be persuaded by someone returning from the dead, why would Jesus send Wiese to Hell to basically do what Abraham says won't persuade unbelievers anymore than the Scriptures will? The simple answer is, Jesus wouldn't do that.There is also the issue with the demons that supposedly tortured Wiese. Jesus said that Hell is prepared for Satan and his demons. They will be eternally punished in Hell (Matt 25:41). Yet, Wiese claims that demons are in Hell feeling pleasure from torturing him and the more they tortured him, the more pleasure they felt. This doesn't make sense if the Bible teaches that Hell was created to punish the demons. In fact, Wiese makes it sound like the demons have a nice playground in Hell and are the ones administering the punishments rather than being punished themselves.Another problem I have with Wiese's account is that Jesus said that anyone who believes in him will not see death (John 8:51).After reading the book, I must admit that I am really disappointed. And while I am a born-again Christian who believes in the existence of Hell (and by that I mean eternal punishment, not annihilation), I must tell the truth of what I believe about this book. I had thought about not writing a review at all, but Christians need to stand on biblical truths, not lies. I'm still not even sure why Wiese is so convinced that he didn't just have a really bad dream... which is what I think he had if he's not just making this whole thing up."},{"Title":"23 Minutes In Hell: One Man's Story About What He Saw, Heard, and Felt in that Place of Torment","review":"Whether or not the author really did go to hell is immaterial. What matters more is that what he said about the existence of hell and its horrors are found in scripture. The first part of the book deals with his own testimony, and what he claims happened to him in hell. The second part of the book is a citation of scripture on hell.I found the second-half to be heart-convicting. According to the author, there are about 150 verses on hell in the Bible. Many are listed down in the book. I checked the verses in his book against those in the Bible. All tallied. And then the reality sinks in: hell is really a place. It is not to be trifled with. There is no good thing there, no flower, or leaf, or even mercy, because God is not there. And all good things are from God. But the starkest and saddest truth is this: it was never meant to be a place for people, whom God created for eternal fellowship with Him. Such a horrible place was only meant for Satan and his fallen angels. Yet, so many souls are there, people who never heard about God, or who turned their backs to God. What this book did for me was point me back to the importance of evangelism - in God's loving plan, no one, not a single soul, should have to go to hell."},{"Title":"23 Minutes In Hell: One Man's Story About What He Saw, Heard, and Felt in that Place of Torment","review":"I was surprised at the diferent viewpoints I have read concerning this book. However I have learned when it comes to Hell.....well things can indeed get hot. The author to me is upfront and honest in his testimony of what happened to him. And also to me, it is not surprising that people are experiencing visions of Hell, after all, we are in the endtimes and God is doing all He can to sound the alarm. And even if we were not, no one is promised tomorrow so why take the chance of ending up in this dreadful place?This testimony clearly shows that Hell is a place of torment, absent from God, love or any kind of goodness. It is a place of pain and suffering, sorrow and hate. I can't even imagine how difficult it was for the author to relive such an experience and I thank him for sharing it with a world that needs to hear the truth. I have seen this man on TV share his experience and believe me he is truly telling what he saw and felt and he is screaming to all that will listen, \\"Please, do not go there. You have a choice.\\" Great book! Serious Warning! A read that should awaken some serious thought as to where we will spend eternity."},{"Title":"23 Minutes In Hell: One Man's Story About What He Saw, Heard, and Felt in that Place of Torment","review":"For the naysayers who believe that God is only a cuddly teddy bear and that no one will experience a hell, then you have missed much of what the Bible has to say concerning it. Bill Wiese brings this out in this page turner of a book. No, Bill Weiss is not a theologian, but then neither were the Apostles that Jesus chose to lead the early church. 12 ordinary men with no special religious backgrounds. Bill Weiss also doesn't need to be an Apostle to have and experience such as this and write about it.To the one reviewer who talked about Lazarus, I will tell you that the Lazarus mentioned in Luke who was in the bosom of Abraham and the one Jesus raised from the dead were two different individuals who just happened to have the same name.I highly recommend this book. Even if it were fiction, which I do not believe it is, I would still recommend it because it is scripturally based.Rev.

I was half way through it before being aware of the time. I've read several testimonies of (and about) men and women that have departed this life and found themselves in that Great Abyss called HELL and returned to tell about it. The author's experience is different in that he places the reader along side himself experiencing it as well. Needless to say, I didn't sleep very well that night. Not for myself as I'm a Christian but for all the people I come in contact with everyday who I know... haven't made Jesus as their Lord.This book will wake up the Dead. I know because I've left it to where anybody could read it and for those that did, their reading experience was similar. A great witnessing tool.I gave it 5 stars just for that reason."},{"Title":"23 Minutes In Hell: One Man's Story About What He Saw, Heard, and Felt in that Place of Torment","review":"As a child I saw many movies about hell and decided it was not a place I ever wanted to be in for eternity. Bill Wiese claims he not only saw images of hell, but that he experienced it physically and emotionally for 23 minutes.Can you go to hell and live to tell about it?Do children go to hell?Will good people only go to heaven?Are there demons in hell?Is hell a real place with real fire?Will you remember your life on earth while in hell?Bill Wiese answers all these questions and also backs up his own experience with biblical references. His story is convincing and told from the perspective of someone who was placed in a position of extreme stress and vulnerability. He describes his 23 minutes in detail and in a very convincing manner. Dreams can be very vivid and so at the start you have to either believe this is true or decide it isn't something you are willing to believe.In the first third of the book he explains his horrifying experience of being in hell and then in the second section he talks about near death experiences and why there is hope for anyone who wants to avoid going to hell after they die. In the third section he focuses on verses from the Bible to give a more complete view of hell.The thoughts in this book are somewhat sobering and the idea of spending eternity in a state of emotional distress and physical pain is more than enough motivation to try to find a way not to duplicate Bill Wiese's experience. Fortunately he does provide a message of hope and explains how Jesus Christ is the answer and the Savior of the soul.If you are interested in more on Jesus Christ, I can highlyrecommendThe Gospel According to Jesus~The Rebecca Review"},{"Title":"23 Minutes In Hell: One Man's Story About What He Saw, Heard, and Felt in that Place of Torment","review":"This book is pure dreck. I don't know if the author had a bad nightmare or just concocted the whole thing out of his imagination, but in having this published he's preying on the fears of naive and simple minds. Shameful."},{"Title":"23 Minutes In Hell: One Man's Story About What He Saw, Heard, and Felt in that Place of Torment","review":"No, this title isn't about Weise's appointment with the IRS. The author claims to have visited the actual Sheol, or Hell, in an out-of-body experience in 1998. Not in a dream; not in a vision; yet in a lifeless version of his own body he says he actually went there and was brought back by Jesus Himself.Many readers will see a few red flags surrounding this book: Wiese lives in southern California, not exaclty the bastion of Christianity. The title is similar to other books such as \\"90 Minutes in Heaven,\\" making it less original. Wiese is not a theologian.The first part of this book--the visit to Hell itself--is littered with Scripture quotations and marks for chapter end notes which interrupt the flow of the dialogue. I think this part would have been much improved if Wiese had simply shared his experience in his own words, without pausing to support every detail with a Scripture quote. A very thorough appendix included with the book serves that purpose nicely for those who wish to consider everything Wiese says and judge it against the Bible. Personally, I have an aversion to books (and there are many) which sprinkle in snippets of Scripture, often out of context, like fertilizer pellets on a lawn. One can read everything in the Bible in its proper context by... reading a Bible.From a literary standpoint, Wiese's descriptions of what he saw in Hell didn't add anything to what I already know through the Bible or visualized reading Dante's \\"Inferno.\\"The reading becomes better by the middle of \\"23 Minutes,\\" however, as Wiese begins telling how the Lord led him by miracles to spread the word about Hell. I guess you couldn't call it \\"good news.\\" Non-believers will write these off as good luck, while believers will credit the Devine purpose. Either way, they are believable. One thing I did find disturbing was Wiese says he met other people who wrote books about their visits to Hell, but he does not identify these authors. I assume they are among those listed in the appendix, but it would seem natural to me to name the author and the title of those books as they are mentioned, especially if Wiese had space to put in all of those other references.Later chapters address the questions of what makes one bound for Hell, what demons are and do, and what physical parts make up Hell.Obviously the main question is: Did Bill Wiese really go to Hell for 23 minutes? Only he and his Maker know the answer to that. Does it really matter? What matters is what each of us plans to do with our eternity, if we are granted that. In my opinion, the book doesn't pack the punch needed to convert people to Christ on its own merits, although it seems Wiese has been able to do so through personal encounters.This book did leave me with at least one profound thought: the reason Christ gave Bill Wiese this experience. It does not matter whether it was a dream, a vision, or physically real. \\"...time is getting short,\\" Wiese says, \\"and there are some unusual things God is doing in the earth today to help people awaken to the truth. He is imploring people to listen to His Word.\\" I won't argue with that.-Byron C. Justice, author of \\"Violent Night\\""},{"Title":"23 Minutes In Hell: One Man's Story About What He Saw, Heard, and Felt in that Place of Torment","review":"First I will say that I am not a church-goer, though I do have strong convictions spiritually, they are really not strictly delineated biblically. Also, I am extremely interested in the paranormal and come from the school of thought dictating that man's understanding of truth is a grain of sand held next to a million universes.This book, a very simply written, and expressly self-important work, might as well be from the hand of an eigth grader. The constant drone of his being chosen to carry the message brings the first questions and, I believe, points clearly to an egomaniacal personality. Why is God,as presented in the author's estimation, using \\"Bill Weise\\" as a vessel to carry the warning about damnation to all of humanity? 6 Billion people on earth and an omnipotent God. Why not send 1 million from every religion on the same trip at the same time? Imagine the impact? However, the omnipotent omnipresent creator of all has put his trust in one real estate agent from South Carolina, who subsequently put it in book form with a price tag of 12.99. Well, at least God is using the free market.Next- Weiss mentions the fear and pain of hell in tableaus of seemingly arbitrary exponents. The demon was \\"1000\\" times stonger, the pan was \\"500\\" worse, etc. However, throughout the unbearable pain, Wiese seems remarkably level-headed and lucid. He says in the prologue \\"How could I survive in such intense heat? My flesh should disentegrate fom my body at any moment.\\" Wouldn't a more likely thought be \\"AAGGGGHHHHHH AAAAGGGGHHHHHHH!!!!\\" This type of silly presentation riddles the book. He mightas well be saying \\"Saaayyyyyy this pain, 1000 times worse than anything on earth, is really bogus! I wonder what my wife will say when I tell her that, right now, I feel like all of my flesh is on fire and I'm being flayed alive?\\"At one time, geo-centrism was the paradigm. Then heliocentrism, which is only specific to a solar system. Newton's laws of motion, set a paradigm until relativity revealed that our reality is incumbent on where we are sitting at any given time. Space and Time are bending before our eyes and the future hints at discoveries which will time and again change the landscape of perception. The ultimate truths, may be unattainable to human consciousness.

Now, don't get me wrong--I believe that God is still alive, and I believe in visions and visitations. I've had them. However...we are warned in Scripture to test the spirits, and I don't think the author did this. His depictions of hell do not line up with the Scriptures. Pointy demons that torture simply aren't there. Demons don't torment in hell, they are tormented in hell; and in fact, in II Peter 2:4 we're told that most of the demons are in a different part of hell. So, I don't know. I only got a third of the way through it and then threw it. My opinion--if you want to know what hell is like, go to the pages of Scripture.

I agree with the author in that you don't have to believe his story. He states it is not whether you believe his story but do you KNOW for certain what will happen to you when you die. Having said that, I found the story haunting. Not because I don't know where I will be for eternity, I do know I will be in heaven as a born again Christian. What has stayed with me is what am I doing to help others make an eternal choice. The description in this book is not for the faint of heart especially if you are a Christian. If you are not, you may find it simply entertaining. But, one day, you will remember what you read and your agony will be fourfold as a result.

The author is down to earth and simply sharing his experience. I read this book slowly and carefully as he described the pains felt in hell, which really helped me to more fully appreciate what being there might be like.Although it's a relatively short book and not a terribly long description of hell itself, it's informative nonetheless and helped me to appreciate the phrase \\"I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy\\"."},{"Title":"23 Minutes In Hell: One Man's Story About What He Saw, Heard, and Felt in that Place of Torment","review":"The first half of the book, he tells of his experience.

But, what I can affirm is some of his wording when he talks with God and how God answers him. I know this to be true. God answers before we get the question completely out. This man's claim sounds enough far fetched that it could be from God, for he works in ways in the bible that sounds illogical. One instance the walls falling down with sounds and yelling, and the walls drive themselves down into the earth instead of falling over. I think the unsaved should listen closely and repent, as for the church goers who lacks belief, I hope you're saved as well, for if one reads the bible they will find records of this man's account closely rendered as the same or close parallels."},{"Title":"23 Minutes In Hell: One Man's Story About What He Saw, Heard, and Felt in that Place of Torment","review":"23 minutes in hell is Bill wiese\`s terrifying experience and serious warning message to unbelievers and sinning christians about the reality of hell and repenting of your sins and coming to jesus christ for forgiveness and salvation.On November 22,1998 Bill wiese went to sleep after going to a prayer meeting.He woke up and went to get a drink of water ,then he fell down on the ground and his spirit was catapulted from his body and was falling down to a prison cell in hell.In the prison cell he met demons that were 12 and 13ft tall that weren\`t of this natural world that were cursing and blaspheming GOD and had a hatred for mankind.Bill wiese\`s friend pastor raul has an ability to detect demonic influence in people\`s lives. They directed their hatred and vengeance toward Bill and were trying to torture and tear his body apart.These demons must be the spirits of the nephilim(giant humanoids)that lived on the earth at the time of Noah more than 10,000 years ago that came as the result of the fallen angels that were interbreeding with human women.These demons looked reptilian and had strength a 1,000 times stronger than an ordinary man.People who are 7ft.tall or 8ft.tall and die and go to hell will know what a real giant is.The demons bill wiese saw were small compared to the giant nephilim that could be upto 450ft.tall. A muslim guy who had a near death experience and was going down to hell saw demonic creatures simliar to bill wiese and mary k.baxter\`s accounts.The muslim guy found out he was going to hell because he rejected Jesus Christ as his savior and he had to pay for his own sins.Bill wiese\`s book and other people\`s supernatural experiences convince me that The Bible IS THE TRUTH and HEAVEN and hell are real and Jesus Christ is Almighty God and the only way to HEAVEN."},{"Title":"23 Minutes In Hell: One Man's Story About What He Saw, Heard, and Felt in that Place of Torment","review":"I devoured 23 Minutes in Hell, and now I'm plugging my way thru Bill Wiese's follow-up book,Hell: Separate Truth from Fiction and Get Your Toughest Questions Answered.23 Minutes in Hell should be made into a movie so even more souls can see the vision -- but hopefully only on the big screen, not in actuality!I think Bill Maher should play Bill Wiese, and God can save Maher during the making of the film..."},{"Title":"23 Minutes In Hell: One Man's Story About What He Saw, Heard, and Felt in that Place of Torment","review":"This is a convincing story of a man who was showed the horrors of Hell by God Himself. 23 Minutes in Hell by Bill Wiese takes you on a journey into Hell and explains all the frightfulness he experienced.

In only 169 pages including notes and bibliography author Bill Wiese chronicles an out-of-body experience in which he spent twenty-three terrifying minutes in hell. The result is a graphic, yet scripturally accurate account of a place no human was ever intended to see, let alone go.Wiese describes the sights, the terrifying screams of the damned, the nauseating stench, the all-encompassing darkness, and the horror of the merciless demons whose only joy was tormenting those made in the image of the God they hated. He talks about the \\"bottomless pit\\" described in scripture. It's real; not the stuff of Halloween movies! Worst of all was the knowledge that theirs was an eternal sentence; not a popular theme in a nation where a \\"life\\" prison sentence is often twenty years or less. Finally, he is made to feel, for just a moment, the agony felt by Almighty God as he watches untold multitudes of his children march into this dreadful place. It all ends with a warning from Christ himself: \\"Tell them I am coming very, very soon!\\" Time is short!!Some discount Wiese's book as a mere nightmare. Others say no man can see hell and live. Still others say simply, Wiese is lying. One thing is sure: Since this vision and the evangelical efforts it inspired untold numbers of people have confessed Jesus Christ as Savior and Lord.

Alot of critism towards the author and why our Lord would pick him for such a job. All wonderful question. But we should stop and think about the overall message. Our Lord left a book of instructions and conquences of what will happen if we don't follow it, the Bible. The Bible has been around a long time, yet we still have people who don't believe in it or in Heaven or Hell. Our Lord uses his people to give his message and I believe that is what he did with Mr. Weise. Its not whether you believe him, its whether you believe in God and the messege that if we don't repent we will go to Hell. Hell is real place, its not fiction. Where do think the idea of fiction came from. God is real, the Devil is real. So read this book whether you believe Mr. Weise or not believe the message that our Lord is tring to give us, he is comming and if we are not ready there is only one place we will go.

If you pick this book up, you will not be able to put it down.Why?Because the guy who wrote this book went. to. hell. As in, his soul literally left his body and he experienced twenty-three minutes in hell. Now, I used to be what some would call naive. But after a few [painful] life experiences, I am just about the opposite of naive. I don't believe everything I read, and I test what I hear almost to the point of cynicism at times. And still, I really believe the guy who wrote this book is not lying.I want everyone to read this book, and not only read it but accept it as truth. It's an arrow that points to THE Book, the Bible. Everyone needs to know that hell is real. It's a literal place and Jesus paid a real price so that none of us would ever have to be there for even a minute, let alone an eternity. Hell is a place that was created for the angels who revolted against God, and was never intended to house human souls. When Jesus saw how successful satan was at convincing people that they didn't need God, didn't need repentence- His heart breaking with each soul lost- He was compelled to atone for our sins by not only suffering a horrible death on the cross, but also by descending into hell for three days. For us. He did this for us. So that we would never have to do that.One of the great lies of the devil is to convince people that a loving God would never \\"send\\" people to hell, which leads to confusion that often causes people to doubt that any of it really exists, God or hell. The truth is that not only does He not send anyone to hell, but it grieves Him incredibly when people literally chose to go there. If you had any idea how horrible hell was, or how wonderful it is to live a life in Jesus, the choice would be obvious. Humans are bombarded by deceit to get us off the track of truth; the devil simply does not want us to accept Truth. He wants us instead to believe that God isn't real, that our complex beings somehow resulted from a big bang in the universe, that we don't go to hell but float around on the earth as ghosts, that \\"good\\" people go to Heaven and sin isn't real, that it's not intelligent to believe in what we can't see or prove scientifically. These are all ways that satan pummels us with lies so that we'll believe anything but truth. And he does this not so much because he hates us, but because he hates God. The only way he can hurt God is by hurting God's creation.Hell is real, it is surpassingly worse than you think it is, and you do not have to go there.God states clearly in His Word that all a person must do to be forgiven of their sins is to repent and accept that Jesus is their Savior. That's it. A simple acknowledgment that we are not our own gods, that truth is not relative to whatever we feel is right for us, that sin is disobeying how God tells us to live in His Word. If we believe this and then chose to live it, not only will our lives be a thousand times more blessed and purposeful than they were, but we will also never have to know an eternity of unimaginable torment.\\"For God did not appoint us to suffer wrath but to receive salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ. He died for us so that, whether we are awake or asleep, we may live together with Him.\\" 1 Thessalonians 5:10"},{"Title":"23 Minutes In Hell: One Man's Story About What He Saw, Heard, and Felt in that Place of Torment","review":"I went to a farmers market in our town and saw a stand that had jewelry on it and at the end was a sketched drawing of Jesus. I asked the man the reason for the picture at his booth and he told me he was there because he knew he was supposed to talk to someone about the Lord. He also had a book under the picture and the book was titled \\"23 Minutes in Hell\\". Now I am not the type of person to put much stock in a statement like the one the man made but for some reason the book intrigued me. I wished him well and went on my way. Weeks later, I was at church and my Mother had a book in her arm and I noticed its title...can you guess? Yes, it was 23 Minutes in Hell. I asked her why she chose it and she said she just saw it and picked it up even though she had a lot of other books she was reading. I asked her if I could read it first. I read this book daily, as it was so hard to put down. I can't tell you the impact it had on my life. It laid so many doubts I had to rest...it was like the book went from simple letters on pages to life...I will never question the reality of hell and I urge you to read this book.

AMAZING..."},{"Title":"23 Minutes In Hell: One Man's Story About What He Saw, Heard, and Felt in that Place of Torment","review":"23 Minutes in Hell is Bill Wiese's account of his claimed trip to Hell, followed by attempts at explaining what he saw and the presentation of the Gospel message. His fundamental point is this: that Christians have a duty to witness to others. My review is that of a Christian scholar, and so presupposes the existence of God, Jesus, and afterlife.The fundamental problem with 23 Minutes in Hell is Wiese's absolute lack of hermeneutical knowledge or approach. He doesn't understand the imagery of Hebrew poetry (which is in many cases not so different from our own modern poetry). Most scriptures are used out of context, a fact which Wiese himself admits from time to time. He also seems to have no clue about the Biblical languages. He also freely quotes any theologian that serves his purpose.In the English Bible, there are several distinctly different words that are translated as \\"hell.\\" In the Old Testament, the word occurring most often is Sheol, the underworld, where all the dead go. It is in no sense a burning, flaming hell, and would not have been imagined so by the OT authors, because at that point very little, if any, understanding of an afterlife had been developed. As such, Wiese uses nearly 100% of his Old Testament references inappropriately. The reader gets the feeling that Wiese just went through an English concordance and found what he was looking for.There are certainly questions with Wiese's account. Maybe I'm just too cynical, but I was hardly unnerved by his account of hell, as so many have claimed to be. And pretty convenient how he \\"instinctively\\" knew how the stench and the heat were \\"a thousand times\\" more intense than on earth, and that it was too hot to survive in. The reader is forced to take him at his word (or not). Did he have that experience? Maybe. Maybe he had a dream. Maybe he made it up. But of more glaring concern is how he bent the Bible to make it fit his account.The title certainly piggybacks on Piper and Murphey's 90 Minutes in Heaven. Also, Wiese mentions he got to know a man at his gym. Wiese says, \\"I discovered that he had won the World's Strongest Man contest in 1996\\" (p. 60). Well, I looked it up. The winner in 1996 (and 1991, 1994, and 1995) was Iceland's Magnus Ver Magnusson. He lives in Iceland. I was unable to find any evidence connecting him with Wiese (although I didn't try too hard).In spite of the heaps of criticism this book has deservedly received, it does make a good point: Christians have a duty to witness to others, as the Bible is clear that there will be a final judgment. As Wiese says on the back cover, \\"Even if you don't believe my story, I hope you will believe the Scriptures and avoid hell just the same.\\" Amen to that.From a scholarly perspective, this book is a joke. There are other \\"I had a personal experience\\" books that are a lot more credible. It is rather unfortunate that formally-trained seminarians never seem to have these experiences. It would be great to see a book like this written credibly by someone credible.NOT RECOMMENDED"},{"Title":"23 Minutes In Hell: One Man's Story About What He Saw, Heard, and Felt in that Place of Torment","review":"I heard Bill Weise's radio interview and was riveted.

If people don't pray in communion and intimacy with God they're discernment for spiritual consequences and knowing God's ways becomes dim. The world has too many influences and distractions to get caught up in life's routines that would cause someone to accept compromise when there is a very real God and a very real judgement. We have to face our sin head on and not take a chance of falling away from God's mercy through Christ. This book brings to understanding that hell is truly a real place of eternal torment, that means in agony every minute for ever, and ever, and ever... without mercy."},{"Title":"23 Minutes In Hell: One Man's Story About What He Saw, Heard, and Felt in that Place of Torment","review":"Haven't read the book yet, but I already KNOW that it is truth. I had the chance to see Bill Weise speak in person and give His testimony, there was NO fluctuation whatsoever in his testimony both times that I heard him speak. He is also a very humble man and is not very comfortable with public speaking, although he does it because God has called him to do so. I also have his personal testimony on CD and recently attended a church service on the subject of \\"mantels\\" by Steven Brooks,which he and his wife also attended. they are both very committed Christians. Also, Bill has been quite $successful$ in the real-estate business, he did not need to write this book. God instructed him to do so, and he FULLY FUNDED the publication of his book with his own finances. He refuses offerings at his speaking engagements and plans to retire from the real-estate business soon and go into full time preaching of his testimony. He is doing so out of obedience to the Lord, and to further God's Kingdom."},{"Title":"23 Minutes In Hell: One Man's Story About What He Saw, Heard, and Felt in that Place of Torment","review":"It is ugly.

I have read both \\"90 minutes in heaven\\" and \\"23 minutes in hell\\", and other than the title, these books have very little in common. This book is not only better written, but it also points the non-believer to a clear path to Jesus. My heart cries for those whose hearts are already too hardened to recognize the reality of hell and the need for a savior. The author's humility and willingness to be obedient to God in sharing his experience, in spite of those who would scoff, is refreshing, encouraging, and inspiring. I think everyone should read it. And I pray that Christians will be moved to warn others about the reality of hell! Thank you for your testimony Mr. Wiese!"},{"Title":"23 Minutes In Hell: One Man's Story About What He Saw, Heard, and Felt in that Place of Torment","review":"I know Bill Weise is telling the truth about what he experienced. We are in the end times and God is doing unusual things to get peoples attention. Most people can not comprehend eternity and eternal damnation because the devil has blinded them to it. Most only want to believe there is only good in the after life for everyone. I wish it were so, but it is not. I have had my own out of body experiences and I know that my spirit and soul are able to think, hear, and understand. I won't go into my experiences but you can read about them on my website tenwaiting4jesusdotblogdotcom. I have seen real blood on the moon as well. Jesus is alive and He is pleading with this unbelieving generation to wake up so that He can save them. The scribes an Pharisees had their own ideas of what a Messiah would be say and do, and they totally missed Him. In these last days, religious people have their own ideas of what Jesus is going to do to reach this lost and dying world, but Jesus is not limited by what people think, because He is God and He can do whatever He wants to do, and since He knows everything, He knows best how to help people come to Him. Our part is to witness an live the true Christian life, which is not just reading your bible, going to church, and paying tithes. There is more to this salvation than that, it is called relationship where you actually hear from God and He acknowledges you and He answers you and gives you promises, and confirms your faith, and touches your life in undeniable ways. He may still let you struggle because He is working His plan in your life, He will test your faith, and He will let the devil try to discourage you, but for those who keep on keeping on, there is an awesome breakthrough waiting for you. You see we are called to be overcomers and overcomeing means there are tests and trials. For those who don't quit an give up there will be the crown of life and an eternity of being with your Creator who loves you with an everlasting love! This is a most dangerous time for those who name the name of Christ because the hour of judgment has begun in earnest for our churched generation. God is sending clear warnings to us, and those who receive the messengers that Jesus is sending are receiving Jesus and the Father and the Holy Spirit. Repent while you still can, because the days will come when that will not be possible. I have been through a judgment by the Lord and I have seen others judged by Him. If you are a Christian an you need to be judged, you will be. If you don't need to be judged, to those who have more will be given, and to those who appear to have, what they appear to have will be taken away. We are in the days of the wheat an tares fully maturing. The wheat will be white and luscious and it will be bent over from the weight of the kernal which is a symbol of humility, but the tares will stand up tall and will be seen rising above the wheat and the fruit is gray and dead. It will be clear what is wheat and what is tares when the harvest time is very near! Now is the day of salvation, don't harden your hearts.

If you want to go thru the book faster skip some of the end chapter notes and continue on. I reread some of the book later and then referred to some of the notes. I think the author scattered scripture thru to match up with his narrative of his experience and vision. Like if you read a brochure about a place and then went to visit it and could elaborate on what you saw and experienced. This book is easy to read and my 13 year old son wants to read it as well. It has profoundly changed my outlook on life, others, causes one to soul search and realize what you want to dispell from your life and in turn better able to please our Lord and God. Because of the \\"anything goes\\" attitude in the world the line between right and wrong is disappearing. Yes, I suppose we can do just about whatever we'd like, but there Are Consequences and we do not realize how gravely our sin offends the holiness of God. Jesus message thru this person, wants to spare us from having to ever experience hell. It is not His will that we perish, but our landing in hell will be our own doing if we reject him.

I spent 8 years in a Reformed Presbyterian church with biblical, Calvinistic (Reformed) teaching, where I was converted in 1994. Unfortunately in spite of even this, the ministry fostered spiritual pride in the congregation due in part to preaching largely focussed on the issue of today's great apostasy from the Faith, and accordingly, secondary things (like judgment) were put before first things (like love). It has left me very bruised and hurt; it was a very controlling - though well-meaning - group of people.What's my point? I love books that appeal to my natural visual-style of learning. In my search for soundness regarding this book, I have found the following website very helpful and informative:http://www.jesus-is-savior.com/Wolves/bill_wiese.htmI post this review to help people make an informed decision about this book.\\"God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets, Hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son.\\"(Hebrews 1:1-2 KJV). QED."},{"Title":"23 Minutes In Hell: One Man's Story About What He Saw, Heard, and Felt in that Place of Torment","review":"I saw this book at Wal-Mart while I was waiting for a prescription to be filled, and I decided to page through it out of sheer morbid curiosity.The part where the author claims that he actually had a physical body in Hell (one that was different from the one he has on Earth), although it had no blood or water in it, and he couldn't explain how he knew that, yet he could still stand upright, move around, taste, smell, and feel things anyway, as well as see and hear everything, just like he was still alive...that was what proved to me beyond any doubt that this guy is totally full of crap and should not be trusted by anyone. Because it raises way too many really absurd questions that I know for a fact he can't even begin answer, other than by saying something stupid like, \\"That's just the way it is\\".Yeah, right.For example, how exactly does one \\"taste\\" anything if one's mouth is completely devoid of moisture? Did Mr. Weise ever bother to think about that? I mean seriously, how would you be able to move any of your extremities if there was no liquid whatsoever in any of your muscles? How would he be able to keep his balance if there was no fluid in his ears? And what about his eyes? His eyes wouldn't be able to stay in his sockets, let alone function without the proper fluid in them, so how exactly would he be able to see anything? Then of course there's the simple, all-encompassing fact that a brain can't work at all without oxygen, and a brain doesn't get oxygen without blood being pumped to it from the lungs by the heart. So if he didn't have any blood in his body, then the didn't have a working brain. In which case, he wouldn't be able to think, let alone do anything else. That is the kind of thing that I'm talking about. It makes no sense at all if you know anything about basic, grade-school level biology. Of course, I guess we are supposed to believe that such things are made possible regardless of logic and scientific fact by God Almighty's \\"magic\\", although that still makes no sense, and I think that's just an excuse for people to believe in things that don't make any sense, just because they want to, for whatever strange reason.No, I don't buy it. And so I didn't buy this book. Personally, I can't make myself believe in things that don't make any sense, and I'm not going to be giving any of my hard-earned money to anyone who expects me to. And if I deserve to go to Hell for that, then so be it!Speaking of the Hell, how anyone can take any comfort in the thought that billions upon billions of other human beings, some of which they may have known in life, some of which may even have been close to them, some of which may have even been related to them, are going to be made to suffer horrendously in the afterlife, forever and ever, just because of whatever beliefs they had, or didn't have, during their short, seemingly pointless existence on Earth, is beyond me. It actually makes me sick when I really think about it. It's downright disgusting!Of course, what else am I supposed to expect from a religion that uses the effigy of a mutilated corpse dangling from a crucifix, of all things, as it's primary symbol of identification?Then there's the part where Mr. Weise claims that there were no children in Hell, and he somehow \\"just knew\\" that even though he had no real way of telling for sure. It's like he basically \\"just knew\\" a lot of the things, or so he claims, and so he expects us to \\"just believe\\" what he says, just because he says so. Once again, that's not something I am capable of doing, even if I had the desire to, which I don't, because it's so ridiculous.Because, if he is right, and if Hell is real, and if children are safe from it, then there is no reason why we shouldn't just go ahead and kill all of our kids right now and never have any more of them, ever again, and let our species die out once and for all. Because we would be doing them and all future generations the best possible favor that we could ever hope to do for them if that was really the case. Fortunately, though, I don't think that is the case at all. No, in fact, I know it's not, and I can say so with much confidence. So it's actually a really good thing that I'm not a Christian.But it's like he actually expects us to believe that this supposedly wonderful and omnipotent deity of his, that he claims is not only our creator but also the epitome of all goodness and love in the universe, deliberately reincarnates dead people and gives them new bodies just so that they will be able to suffer in some horrid place that was created for the sole purpose of making people suffer for all eternity, with no hope of ever escaping it. So it's like God can't even do us the favor of just killing us and getting it over with. No, that would be too kind. Instead, this god apparently enjoys causing non-believers to suffer just because he is so jealous for their attention, and so wrathful for not being given it. And we're supposed to believe that this happens just because they didn't practice a certain religion based only on the word of other humans that lived on earth before they died. And even if they do accept the truth after they finally get to actually see real proof of it for themselves, in the afterlife, and then decide that they want to gain the favor of this god at that point, it will, for some absurd, inexplicable reason, be too late to make any difference in their fate.WTF?And they say that Christianity is not a fear-based religion, yet they still continue to pull this Pascal's Wager crap over and over again. It's actually terrorism!In any case, regardless of whatever you may believe, when it comes to this book, all that we have here is the word of yet another religionist who's telling us to believe what he says, even though he can't offer any proof of his claims, which is no more credible than that of any other person throughout the history of mankind who has already done the exact same thing in the past, to include the original authors of the Bible itself as well as people like John Smith, Buddha, Mohammed, et al. So it's really nothing special, just more of the same old crap that serves no purpose but to preach to the choir. Because it doesn't do anything for a non-believer such as myself, other than irritate me for it's stupidity and thus reaffirm my atheism.And then there's the fact that HE ACTUALLY EXPECTS US TO PAY MONEY FOR THIS! That just says it all right there. It proves that he is not just an innocent sufferer of horrible delusions, but an outright charlatan seeking to gain fame and fortune by peddling such poisonous and mentally debilitating lies to those who are sadly gullible enough to buy into them."},{"Title":"23 Minutes In Hell: One Man's Story About What He Saw, Heard, and Felt in that Place of Torment","review":"Please do not buy this book!

In that case, nobody could do it better."},{"Title":"23 Minutes In Hell: One Man's Story About What He Saw, Heard, and Felt in that Place of Torment","review":"Where to begin? The book seems to be a bit of reverse engineering aimed squarely at Christians who require blatant fairy tales to bolster their pathetic lack of faith. The author must be laughing all the way to the bank, after fleecing the credulous flock with this comic book trash.To begin with, each aspect of the story appears to be designed to match some scriptures, frequently cited in the book, on a point by point basis. The fact that too many Christians believe the Bible to be the inerrant word of God, makes them right for such cynically perpetrated fraud. Such uncritical acceptance of obvious deceptions should be considered less an virtue of faith, and more of an embarrassment to the creator responsible for giving the faithful brains which go unused. At the very least, the views of Hell, as reported in this book, and by the Church over the past two millennia, is a slander against the notion of a loving, competent deity worthy of worship and the title - God.There are sufficient accounts of people who have had \\"hellish\\" near death experiences (NDE's) to indicate that genuine spiritual torment has nothing to do with any form of physical discomfort, such as heat, cold or tearing of flesh or limbs. Most people who try to make a buck from writing of their own afterlife experiences, are to be regarded with a hefty dose of suspicion and skepticism. Mr. Wiese, along with Betty Eadie, Sylvia Brown, and John Edwards, need to be start a club for writers of spiritual fiction, bearers of false witness, and hucksters of little talent and less redeeming value.I urge all readers interested in afterlife studies, to avoid this kind of cynical, profit driven sensationalism, and instead to direct their money and attention to more enlightening works. Some recommendations are:1. Closer to the Light by Melvin Morse, Paul Perry, and Raymond A. Moodywhich examined the NDE's of children, some of whom have been to heaven and back2. The Complete Idiot's Guide To Near-Death Experiences by P. M. H. Atwater and David H. MorganWhich tackles negative and hellish aspects of NDE'sI cannot discourage buying this book too strongly. If you really must read it, check it out at the Library."},{"Title":"23 Minutes In Hell: One Man's Story About What He Saw, Heard, and Felt in that Place of Torment","review":"i didn't even finish page 1 before i handed the book back to my friend and said, \\"Burn it!\\"Mr Wiese firmly believes that CURRENTLY fallen angels and sinners share a place of torment and/or demons torment them.FALSE. Everything else in this book is based on this premise. Therefore, i can know for certain that this \\"revelation\\" is NOT of God and a great example of FALSE TEACHING that is leading many astray.TRUTH: further scriptural study teaches that (some of the fallen angels) are in a prison called Tartarus where they are bound in cells until judgement (2 peter 2:4, Jude 6). A separate place than Sheol (the place for the unsaved). Man can be saved, fallen angels can NOT.the actual word is tartaroo which means 'to be cast into Tartarus'.you may remember the story when Jesus cast demons possessing a man into a herd of pigs. they know there is a place of torment before God's appointed time (for them) and begged Jesus not to send them there but into the herd of pigs instead (Matthew 8:29-32)Scripture gives revelation that Jesus went to Tartarus and announced his victory over death and the foiling of Satan's plan to breed the bloodline of man out of being able to produce The Messiah (1 peter 3:19-22, Col 2:15) after His crucifixion.very deep stuff, but exciting stuff as well. there was so much going on in the spiritual realm that the disciples could not have possibly understood as the events unfolded...and obviously, Mr Wiese never bothered to study in Scripture himself...the work at the cross (Col 2:15) made a physical/public announcement to man and angels and His appearing in Tartarus, a personal one."},{"Title":"23 Minutes In Hell: One Man's Story About What He Saw, Heard, and Felt in that Place of Torment","review":"This is a very important story that needs to be told and I'm so glad my sister recommend I read it.

I would recommend it to believers and non-believers alike--especially non-believers. I don't think this book is a scare-tactic to get people to believe. It is more like it is revealing the scary truth that exists, but also tells the reader how to avoid being lost to it.This book teaches people how important it is to choose life. Through Biblical backing, it shows that when we die on earth, we are not truly dead, but indeed very much alive; WHERE we are alive, heaven or hell, depends on the choice we made to continue living in during our mortal lives here on earth. The decision we make here will carry on for eternity in our lives afterward.We have been given a choice life and eternal joy in heaven, or \\"death\\" and eternal suffering in hell. It would seem to me that the most logical and wisest choice would be to choose heaven. But, the only way to get to heaven is by accepting Jesus Christ into your heart and acknowledging Him as your savior.The author offers tons of evidence and quotes to back up his data and experiences.That's the book in a very tiny nutshell.

If you watched or read anything about the Exorcism of Emily Rose, the priest states that demons are most active at 3 am, which is a complete opposite of Jesus' death at 3 PM.I am a Christian and this book gave me even more reasons to praise God.I think EVERYONE should read this book, whether you're a Christian or not.

The book 23 minutes in hell is not asking the reader to do anything ludicrous such as worship a piece of bread with a picture of the virgin mary, He simply tells his readers to get saved, Is that so difficult?

Jesus said \\"My people perish for lack of Knowledge\\"."},{"Title":"23 Minutes In Hell: One Man's Story About What He Saw, Heard, and Felt in that Place of Torment","review":"23 Minutes in Hell - Book ReviewFirst of all, this is NOT a NDE book. This is a nightmare book. I read dozens and dozens of NDE books. I've read literally hundreds, and probably over 1,000 accounts of the afterlife. It is spooky how much they are all in agreement with each other, and how easily it's seen that it would be impossible for any kind of collaboration to be going on describing the afterlife. Anyways, with great joy I picked up this book, because I'm just intrigued by this type of stuff. (We're all going to die eh?) However, this one is quite different. I find it so interesting that with all of the books from beyond the veil, all people, regardless of religious upbringing, seem to abandon much of what is taught traditionally, for a entirely different view of the next world to come. Except this book, because it does nothing of that, but just rehashes what is traditionally taught. And that's just what is so odd - it aligns with \\"fundamental christian\\" traditional teachings - but that's what is so intriguing about reading NDE books, they are more often that not showing how the traditional views of heaven and hell are just not accurate.It's undeniably a collaboration, between the author, the author's imagination, and the author's upbringing in one of the most disconnected \\"fundamental\\" run of the mill, classic \\"fire and brimstone\\" churches around. If you sat in one of those (and I have) fire and brimstone churches and have them rant on about how bad hell is going to be for sinners your whole life, like the author did, you could put it all together, and that's what the author did. If you go find every single biblical reference of hell, you would have this book.\\"This beast looked like it was about... 13 feet high\\" Whoh, then the next scripture quoted talked about some hellish beast that in today's measurements was about... 13 feet high!!! Whoh, what a coincident!! I hope you can read the sarcasm here. Who look at something and says, \\"humm, that looks about 13 feet high\\" This is undoubtedly a collaboration of some kind between some kind of run of the mill preachin' \\"fire & brimstone\\" church. If you took every biblical scripture of hell, and every quote from the Colonial American period styled preacher of the 1800's, and put it all together, you would have this book.This leaves you rolling your eyes, and shaking your head when you read such comments like: \\"I never wanted to go to hell, I don't even like it when it's hot outside!\\"And When he meets \\"Jesus\\" it contradicts every single account of every single NDE book I've read. Regardless of denomination, when they meet Jesus, they get the message that it's all really about love, and everything else will be taken care of and love is the real hurdle. However this guy, Jesus says nothing of that, but thence teaches that the way to heaven is.... tada - exactly what this one guy's church teaches. Now you have to think, are those other CREDIBLE (certified medical death, etc) hundred accounts incorrect, and this lone guy who was admittedly just sleeping have a nightmare?So there are so many things about this do not match up with the story itself and do not match up with all of the other countless afterworld experiences, I don't doubt this guy had a nightmare, but that's all it was. Did he have a out of body experience? No. Did he really visit hell in his mind? Sure. The traditional hell he's been taught. I don't doubt there is a heaven and hell, but this buy did not visit it, he did visit a place in his mind, that was created by his mind.Go read anything else."},{"Title":"23 Minutes In Hell: One Man's Story About What He Saw, Heard, and Felt in that Place of Torment","review":"I was really disappointed by how short the actual description of Hell was. It's only a small part of the book, with the rest of the book consisting of how people were affected by the author's description of Hell and the author's giving of information from the Bible answering people's questions about Hell. I suppose that it would be a really great book for someone who is looking for what the Bible says about Hell, but if you're looking for an in-depth, lengthy description of the author's experience in Hell, you will likely be as underwhelmed as I was. That said, I do believe the author's account, and I think that, after reading it, I am even more grateful for the gift that Jesus gave us when He died on the cross for our sins. I wish I had just read the chapter about his experience in Hell in the bookstore and not actually bought the book."},{"Title":"23 Minutes In Hell: One Man's Story About What He Saw, Heard, and Felt in that Place of Torment","review":"The author came with his wife to my church located in Modesto, CA a few months ago and he talked about his experience in hell and why he wrote these books. He truely seemed sicere and I know that my pastor wouldn't invite people to the church who are fonies. He has all the verses to back up his experience and he makes it very clear that his experience isn't what is important, it's what's written in the bible. Both books are excellent and a must read. You will have a true understanding of what hell is and why people end up there. For thoses who need to be saved and you don't know how to convince them, have them read these books. It's our duty as Christians to inform all those who don't know about hell but it's up to them to save themselves. God bless all of you and may we all find eachother in heaven!"},{"Title":"23 Minutes In Hell: One Man's Story About What He Saw, Heard, and Felt in that Place of Torment","review":"Read with caution because it seems to involve an out of the body experience which I believe is unscriptural. It also involves the Lord Jesus appearing physically before the author and speaking to him. As far as I know, the last physical appearance of the Lord was to Paul who was an apostle. We are not apostles.With the closing of canon, it is unneedful for the Lord to appear physically or in visions. Familiar spirits can impersonate the Lord and can also give visions since as all who read scripture know, they can masquerade as angels of light and make hell seem more tolerable than reality.Indeed the hell that the author describes, though he uses the word 'terror' often, seems relatively tolerable. While fire exists in another part of his hell a distance away, some parts of the hell he saw had no fire. It was in total darkness. And though he could hear deafening screams nearby and smell the smell of putrid sulphur, that part of hell does not seem all that bad.God forbade Lazarus to go back to the surface of the earth to warn unbelievers of the torment of hell. Is it a little presumptuous of the author to claim to have been given the privilege (denied initially to Lazarus) to have gone to hell and come back?All that said, if you read the book with an open mind (with scripture at the back of your mind), the description of the pits of fire are very vivid and certainly nobody given a choice would desire to be in the pit. The strange horrible 13-foot creatures that attempted to pull his arms and legs apart ('because they have a hatred for man as mankind is made in the image of God') sounds terrifying.And you could also argue that his account of hell appears more 'scriptural' than the fantastic account given in Mary Baxter's book also on being in hell.The author's description of his experience in hell is short occupying only a quarter of the book. He devotes the next chapter to explain why he thinks his experience was divine, alluding to many coincidences like meeting various people in his travels who had the same experience as he had plus how some people seem to know he had a hell experience even though he had not told them before. Another chapter on how a person can be saved. And the closing chapter on an faq on hell.I find the appendix to be useful as it provides a particular aspect on hell and the verses from scripture supporting that aspect. eg evidence that there different degrees of punishment in hell ('It would be more tolerable for sodom and gommora than for thee...') and evidence of humiliation and nakedness in hell ('Blessed is he who watches, and keeps his garments, lest he walk naked and they see his shame.' Rev 16)."},{"Title":"23 Minutes In Hell: One Man's Story About What He Saw, Heard, and Felt in that Place of Torment","review":"This book is enough to convince me for sure that I don't want to go to Hell.

I always had my own image of what I thought hell was like, I assure you it was nothing even close to what Bill Weiss described during his 23 minute experience.Reading this book gave me a stronger desire to share my faith with other people.

Pulp fiction fantasy writers obviously have a better imagination than Satan himself, for there is nothing outside of human imagination on a single page of this book (cell blocks? iron gates? monsters with fins and long nails? - where's Stephen King when you need him?). Most important for readers to consider is that Hell has not even been created yet. Neither has Heaven. The Bible is clear that these realms are to be created in the presence of all mankind on the last day when Christ separates the \\"sheep from the goats\\". The book reads like Weise grabbed every verse in the Bible he could find about Hell, and then reverse-wrote it, to fit his dream (or fantasy) into biblical revelation, which Christians know is not possible (or permited) with the completion of Revelations. Christians are actually warned to watch out for these false prophesies, and with the gravest of warnings, so I guess Weise must be the exception to God's rule. Weise has conveniently given himself an escape hatch by saying that even if people don't believe his 'vision', at least they should take the biblical references to heart. I've had nightmares that make his vision seem like a walk in the park, and the only 23 minutes in Hell about this book is that this is how long it took me to read it.

Bill Wiese, the author, has such a unique approach to foaming up an introduction: He starts off by saying he has a wife. Why would we want to read the book from a single man? Bachelors cannot be trusted. He also starts off quoting Bible scriptures. That's original. We haven't seen that done before. Then he goes on to talk about how he has seen the error in his ways, and that the 23 minute experience has changed him. Why wouldn't it? Would we expect him to say that this experience didn't bother him?His descriptions of the \\"ogres\\" that are in charge of his captivity is strikingly cliche. Everything conjured up by Wiese is what you would expect to find in a book of fairy tales. And how did he know it was 23 minutes? Was he timing himself?A warning to anyone about to make the worst purchase of their lives on Amazon.com- If you don't believe in God, you should maybe buy the book for a good laugh. I'm sure Bill is having a grand old time spending all the money patrons have already shelled out on this trifling hoax, along with a good chuckle with his publishers. If you DO believe in God, don't give your well earned money to this jerk. Donate it to your church, or invest it in a Bible for a soul you want to save.Life is so ironic. Hitler hated Jews even though his Grandmother was one. Jewish people don't believe in Christ, even though Christ was Jewish himself.

On that account, I would not automatically assume that this vision is of divine origin. If the book does not make you desire to take sufferings and sacrifices upon yourself in order to save others from such a fate, I would be doubly suspect.The testimony in this book reminded me of the Jehovah's Witnesses who have come to my door and ask me what I thought my eternity would be like.This is my question, fellow Christians: If you knew for a fact that you could live your life any way you liked without repercussion--that is, that you were guaranteed by God that you would have the opportunity to repent at the last minute and still obtain eternal bliss in Heaven--would you still choose to serve God as fervently as you do because you believe you might be damned if you don't?If not, in what sense is that the love of God to which we are called? Have you not just chosen to be the resentful brother who stays home, rather than the prodigal who squanders the family fortune? While it is surely better to start serving God before your motives are the best, in the open-hearted hope that as your service of God goes on, your motives will likewise become more real, it is wrong to content yourself with a service of God that purely seeks to avoid your own suffering. It must be fairly obvious to anyone who stops to think about it that this is only a different way to serve yourself. If you are not willing to put up with vitriolic hatred, abuse, stench, heat, ugliness, pain, and even emotional desolation in order to serve God, ask yourself what kind of devotion it is that you are offering. It is not the same sort of devotion that Our Lord offered on the Cross.Jesus didn't say, \\"Repent, the end is near.\\" He said, \\"Repent, the Kingdom of God is at hand.\\" Please recognize that those are two very different things. The first is death; the second, life. When Jesus was asked, \\"Are there many who will be saved?\\" He didn't answer with a numerical estimate. He said, \\"Seek to enter through the narrow door.\\" Think about that."},{"Title":"23 Minutes In Hell: One Man's Story About What He Saw, Heard, and Felt in that Place of Torment","review":"I don't know if this guy went through this or not but, as a few have pointed out, there are some red flags here.

I also believe I've already caught this guy in a lie. I think he says in the book he wasn't a devoted Christian before this experience but I saw him on TV & he said he had been. The fact he uses so much scripture is also a little strange, almost like he's trying a little TOO hard to make his point.I want to leave everyone reading this some advice I SERIOUSLY suggest you take, religious or not.

I think it is very easy for anyone to say anything they want using Scripture, simply by taking a verse or verses out of context, which is how it seems this author has tried to \\"prove his point\\".We serve God, and God IS Love. To make the point of \\"eternal fire\\", or \\"burning forever where the smoke of their torment rises forever\\".. let me use a simple illustration, if I may. Say I have a piece of paper and I throw it into a fire, that piece of paper will burn until it is burned up. It is the effect of the fire that is eternal, NOT the burning. Gods heart aches over each soul that chooses a life away from Him. He certainly would NOT get any enjoyment or satisfaction out of having one of His created beings \\"burn forever and ever\\".Heaven is a physical place, with God, forever. Hell is eternal only in its effect.If you want to read a great book, read The Shack."},{"Title":"23 Minutes In Hell: One Man's Story About What He Saw, Heard, and Felt in that Place of Torment","review":"If this book brings ONE person to the love of our Jesus then true or not, it shouldnt matter! If this makes ONE single person want to bust open a study bible to find out what God says for themselves, then right on. Truly - Lies or not, only the author will have to answer for that in the end. I personally am not going to read this book. Why? I don't feel that God is calling me to read this book. I just saw a young man walking down the streat reading it and stopped by to see what it was about. If this book is causing that young man to draw closer to Jesus, he is closer to the truth than he will ever be by reading any book. But I do want to say this - As Christians, we need to stand together and stop bashing each other!! It's sickening and it turns more people away from Jesus than any book ever could! I beg us and pray for us to start representing our Lord the way we are called to. Just think - Jesus was harsher on the \\"religious\\" than he was on any \\"sinners\\" in the bible.

That being said, that may be what lends credibility to the account told. It is however interwoven with scripture references which are almost to 'like'. The reader may begin to get the impression that it was the scripture that gave rise to the story and not the experience that prompted further investigation.

Unfortunately, the author believes every word he wrote as true and tells people the experience he supposedly had is true. Such public statements make him either delusional or a fraud. Of course, we all have to take his word for it, and believe him. This book serves 2 purposes. First, it reinforces devout Christians (of course not any other religion) of the rightness of their absolute unsubstantiated faith. Second, it attempts to use fear as a means to convince non-believers to submit to religious authority starting with the belief that you are inherently evil from birth and deserve eternal torture. Kind of gives you a warm and fuzzy feeling inside doesn't it?"},{"Title":"23 Minutes In Hell: One Man's Story About What He Saw, Heard, and Felt in that Place of Torment","review":"Beware of this snake oil salesman. I have read the Bible, have read the works of John Paul II, Pope Benedict XVI and St Augustine. This is not a theological work. If Mr Wiese thinks that he is telling the truth, than he has been deluded by a very bad dream. If he is not telling the truth than he is not even capable of crafting a very good lie. His dipiction of hell is very predictable and not very compelling. His account of meeting Jesus is laughable. \\"Tell them I am coming very soon!\\" the Lord says? He speaks of others too that have experienced hell too. Mr Weise can quote all the scripture he wants but what I think that he is doing is appealing to a target audience that knows enough about scripture to create a sense of fear and forboding. Even in scripture itself, Jesus says that the Father and the Father alone knows the time of the end. Dante-esque images of souls falling down a great hole into hell are just bad fiction. Throw this in the same pile of pseudo-biblical garbage with \\"The DaVinci Code\\". I am a Catholic and a Christian and have studied Christianity in depth. What this man is peddling is fear and sensationalism. The message of Christianity is far richer and more profound than this image of Jesus Christ showing one man hell as reminder that God punishes. But perhaps that truth doesn't sell as well. I reccommend \\"God and the World\\" or \\"Truth and Tolerance\\" by Pope Benedict the XVI if you want a good read. There are many good books about Christianity. This is not one of them."},{"Title":"23 Minutes In Hell: One Man's Story About What He Saw, Heard, and Felt in that Place of Torment","review":"This book was designed for those who already believe the doctrine it espouses...as most \\"apologetic\\" works are. This man went to \\"hell\\" like I went to the moon. There is almost nothing believable about any of it.First of all, he says the demons in the cell threw him against the wall and broke all of his bones (he says all of them)...and then one demon shreds his skin with razor claws so that his skin is literally hanging off of his body...and yet after all of this unimaginable torture...he has the mind to blanche at the bad smell of the place? Like THAT would grab your attention when you are writhing in agony from your shredded skin and broken bones. Give me a break.Next, he says that God is able to peer down into hell at all times to observe the endless suffering. Oh, nice. So, after this all-powerful God who is fully able to end all suffering...chooses not do so...he then gets some weird thrill out of peering into to see these humans that he created tortured for all eternity? I mean, let's be honest, he could STILL do something. He could end the suffering of these BILLIONS OF BILLIONS of people who are writhing in agony right now...but he won't, for some strange, unknown reason. Uh-huh.At best, this book is mediocre in its genre. It's psychological games disguised as a non-fiction. If you can't win more souls to your faith by love...let's try fear! Sorry...I'm not buying. You shouldn't, either."},{"Title":"23 Minutes In Hell: One Man's Story About What He Saw, Heard, and Felt in that Place of Torment","review":"There is no hell. Only people who harp on it.

I know in my heart that hell doesn't exist and if such a place exists for the wicked it is definitely not eternal. The scriptures have been severley twisted from what it originally was supposed to mean. If Jesus Christ himself read this book, he would be so disgusted that he would cast Bill Wiese away from his presence. Jesus is definitely not the kind of God who would send sinners to hell for all eternity just because they didn't worship him and call him God in this short lifetime. If that were actually true, God would be a great cosmic failure no better than Satan or the fallen angels himself. God is actually a God of love and only punishes people according to their sins and the punishment fits the crime.In addition it sickens me that people actually find COMFORT in this book and say that it \\"strengthens their faith\\" in God. How can you even believe in God after reading such garbage? It got me very angry to think that God would actually do such a thing, but then I thought that the real anger should be directed toward the author(s) of this book rather than God or Jesus himself. These people are sub-humans who are either mentally deluded or who make up these things so they can receive a big fat profit. It must feel great to make tens of thousands of dollars scaring people to trust Jesus as their Lord and Savior or burn in hellfire for all eternity (great job Wiese)!! People like Bill Wiese are prime candidates for so called \\"eternal punishment\\" that they so joyously talk about for unbelievers.Shame on you Bill Wiese (and Mary Baxter for writing the Divine Revelation of Hell) and may God have mercy on your souls after you pass over to the other side.

What i've seen is the people who are most likely telling the truth are those who dont profit from their own stories (ie their story has been documented by someone else)I seem to recall the story in the bible where there was a Rich man in hell and Lazarus, a beggar. The bible says that when Lazarus died he was taken to Abrahams bosom to one side of paradise, and directly across from there,the rich man was ushered into hell. In this story that Jesus himself told in the new testament, he clearly stated in this story that even if someone from hell were to go preach what he or she saw, people would not believe it and to leave this task to a REAL PREACHER. Go to the New Testament and read the story for yourself for proof.Not to a publisher of some overly sensationalized book and cover with a fancy title.

Hell symbolizes a place of suffering or torment.Someone who dreams of Hell may be suffering from a seemingly inescapable situation caused by having given away his or her emotional power to someone else.Maybe somebody should do a background check on this guy.Bill Wiese also talks about a lady in Hell who is running from something.When people die for awhile and then come back sometimes your mind is still trying to shut down all of it's functions,and in doing so you may see some weird things.In a dream,running away or escaping may indicate that the dreamer needs to get away from a person or situation that is overwhelming the dreamer.A slower pace of life may be indicated.People don't understand that we are already getting our punishment.Bad things were intended in order for us to experience life.Don't you agree that if we were perfect,Jesus wouldn't even have been our Savior.Where did evil start?It started here in the universe,the place of imperfectness.The Devil,Hades,Death,and the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse are only personifications of things that truly exist in this universe.The Devil is short for all the bad things we can do to others and ourselves.Hades is the state of Depression,misery,and sadness that we get from doing these bad things.And Death is simply the experience everyone has to go through.The battle of Armageddon is the battle of good and evil,that's been going on since the beginning of our existence.It had a beginning so it will have an end.I am shocked at how misinterpreted the Bible is.The Bible is metaphorical,teaches lessons to make you a better person,personificates things,and is overall a great piece of literature (perfect).Don't you get it,Hell only exists if you let it.And everyone should agree with me when I say eventually everyones going to believe in Jesus,because when he brings everyone back to life everyone is going to see him with there own eyes and know he is real.Sometimes I think religeous fanatics,and church-aholics wish there was a Hell so they will feel rewarded for having less fun and mistreated by those who have more fun. How are you to experience life if all you do is stay in one place,worship,and be a goodie too shoes.I believe in God and pray every once in a while for me and my family's forgiveness,yet I still curse,use the Lord's name in vein,hurt people mentally and physically,lust,lie,cheat, and steal(rarely).I want people who read this review to go to dictionary.com and look up the word \\"Hinnom\\" and read the definition.I didn't actually read the book,but watched Bill's video testimony.He had a Hollywood movie made to show what Hell was like(laugh).And do you actually think people back then lived to be hundred's of years old.Let me show u an example,each month they would become one year older,there are 12 month's in a year.So if you times that by let's say 60,u get 720.And you just do that for everyone it talk's about to see how old they really are.Though I do believe that a rare species of people could although now have been extinct such as the giants.I've estimated that these people would have been at least 9 to 12ft. tall.If hell is in the center of the earth then it won't last forever because there's a thing in the universe called Dark Matter,and billion's of years from now it will have eaten up everything in the universe(including earth).Just like u can still believe in God and evolution.Evolution is a proven fact,how can you deny it? Just look at yourself and then look at a monkey,and see all the similarities.We also came from strardust from a star that went supernova.But it makes sense with the book of Genesis because when the star goes supernova it pumbels earth and creates the first organisms in the GROUND.And God's hand could be the giant beam of light that created life from the ground.We came from the ground and we will return there.So you see I could easily be an Atheist,but I kept my faith.I believe in a God of intelligent design,where everything plays a part in the plan,and everything in the universe is perfectly timed and staged.I'm only 14,but I feel smarter than all of you who are most likely adults.Another thing to prove evolution to you is to look at the skulls they have found from millions of years ago,that were like ours yet underdeveloped.Maybe Adam and Eve were the first fully developed human beings.Though I believe in all of this I still believe Jesus was a miracle worker and the son of God,and that God spoke to the prophet's in dream like visions.So u see I believe in the Bible,but I just think it's misinterpreted too much.I think everyone will go to Heaven eventually,and even if there is a Hell it wouldn't last forever,not even the Qur'an teaches that people will be in Hell forever,and that teaches to dislike Jew's and Christians.Not even the terrorists are terrible enough to think that. Do people honestly think we live in the End Time's,we've come along way, but we've got an even longer way's to go.I believe that when we reach the peak of our civilization and intelligence(wich isn't for a very long time)that the last and only thing that will need to be revealed is Jesus and his everlasting Kingdom(we will finally be complete).If you look back to our History this isn't the worst time in it,there were a lot of worse times and they weren't the End Times,so why should this less terrible time be it.Also the devil was created before the Bible and therefore is most likely a myth.People who are interested in the Gospels should try and locate the one's that didn't make it into the Bible,although they may not all be true they are interesting enough to look into and judge them for yourself.I believe that one should look at all religeons and sources of spirituality and decide from there what u truly believe in.I know if I have kid's that's what i'm going to do,is give them a wider variety of options and choices to choose from,and let them decide.My plans are to have kids,a life long girlfriend,travel to all reaches of the earth(with them),and just have as much fun as possible with my girlfriend,kids,family,and friends.Wish me luck in my journey for happiness,or u can just pray for me as i will for everyone else.P.s.

The large format allowed him to get in his film the tiniest detail and the &quot;zone system&quot;, to get the cleanest whites, the deepest blacks and the widest range of gray tones, all in the same picture. Well, in this book you would find the WORST copies of Ansel's plates... I don't know if he used 8x10 plates, but most pictures are smaller than that and they are all printed at 150 dpi!!!!! (I actually measured that, my... printer does 10 times better!!!!). Even worse, the pictures are completely gray!! I was not able to find a single spot of pure white or deep black, just a few gray tones in there! This book is really a bad joke... I also have the 2001 Ansel Adams calendar, that one is well printed, so nobody can lie to me concerning Ansel's printing technique, he is a genius! (Go for the calendar, it's good!) I found in the book (I quote): &quot;This book is independent of, and not authorized by Ansel Adams Publishing Rights Trust.&quot; Of course it is NOT!!! Ansel must be rolling over in his grave! Well, it's true that the book isn't expensive, but what's the point of a bad printed photo book? I still have to read the text, I hope it is worth...

He also writes about Ancient Egypt and Alexander the Great.A group of pilgrims have joined together, both for company and also for protection, as the roads and forests are littered with thieves and rogues, only too willing to relieve a traveller of their purse and most probably their lives as well. What adds even more spice to the journey is that several of the pilgrims know their fellow travellers but are not letting the fact become public knowledge.The pilgrims have agreed that at the end of each day's journey when they stop at an inn or other resting place one of them will entertain the others with a tale. Whether the story is true or not only the storyteller will know.The pilgrims are getting what shelter they can from the rain, in a ruined church while the Priest tells his tale. Young Philip Trumpington is accompanied to his post in the village of Scawsby by his brother and their friend. Philip soon discovers the church is haunted and the villagers scarred by a grim past.

With \\"Art and Soul: A Spiritual Approach to Crafts,\\" she shares her philosophy on how art can transform life and touch our souls. The quote that dominates the back cover of \\"Art and Soul\\" succinctly captures her perspective: \\"Creation is itself but a longing, a kind of Prayer to the Almighty.\\"An experienced art educator, Kornet believes that \\"everyone is creative by nature and is limited only by lack of experience, self-doubt or a lack of confidence due to other's criticism.\\" In \\"Art and Soul,\\" Kornet works to strip away some of those inhibitions that keep us from being the true creative spirits we were meant to be. She believes that art can teach us much about life.For example, in the creative process, we may make a \\"mistake.\\" Kornet encourages her students to go back and see how the project can be revised in order to make use of the \\"mistake\\" and take the project to a new level. This technique may also be used when we face problems in life. Such challenges can begin to be seen as opportunities.Art can also be used in the healing process. Art offers an opportunity to express pain or grief that may otherwise just fester inside. The creative process offers both an emotional release and a finished project that can be used to remember a special person or time period.\\"Art and Soul\\" offers many concrete ideas to get the creative juices flowing. Beautiful photographs of Kornet's own work illustrate many of the pages. In addition, a good portion of the book is dedicated to introductory how-to information. Some of the crafts represented include fabric arts, collage, jewelry, card making, gift wrappings, travel journals, and altered books. Kornet also offers suggestions on how to get the whole family involved in the creative process.Kornet writes from a Jewish perspective, but \\"Art and Soul\\" crosses religious lines. It is a book about life and creativity which anyone can appreciate.Patrice Fagnant-MacArthur is editor of \\"The Spiritual Woman Newsletter\\" ([...]) and author of \\"Letters to Mary from a Young Mother\\" (iUniverse, 2004)"},{"Title":"Art and Soul: a spiritual approach to crafts","review":"\\"Our own creative processes are stimulated and encouraged by Kornet's heartfelt words.

What this little treasure means to me:I came to Christian Science in my 50's. America and other parts of the world celebrate Christmas outwardly and within with great joy and fun.I love the Christmas Tree with the angel, and tiny white lights like the stars in the night. Tree decorations store bought, some unique, and home made too. The presents under the tree, the little Manger/Creche scene..on a table or under the tree. Christmas Carols and Sacred music --the Christ-Mass-the sights and sounds of Christmas, shopping for a special gift for a special someone maybe under the name of \\"Santa Claus\\" to free the obligation of 'from me to you'. The box with the Gifts of the Magi inside. We understand, it is following the Magi bringing their Gifts to the Christ Child, Jesus of Nazareth, so we bring gifts to honor the Christ within each of us. God IS the giver and the gift!Others think very material -- not really--we celebrate Jesus birthday and the Christ within each of us--spiritual things, is easier to say to children Santa Claus until they are old enough to understand:That great Mystery: Colossians 1:26-27 \\"the mystery that has been kept hidden for ages and generations, but is disclosed to the saints. To them God has chosen to make known among the Gentiles the glorious riches of this mystery, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory.\\"But, until I found Christian Science I really did not understand--I thought I did--I did not understand these:John 14:12 \\"Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greater works than these shall he do; because I go unto my Father.\\"John 17:20 \\"My prayer is not for them alone. I pray also for those who will believe in me\\" --all who believe him, what he said and didMatthew 10:8 \\"Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse the lepers, cast out demons\\" - Jesus's Command to his followersMatthew 7:16 \\"Ye shall know them by their fruits\\"Matthew 5:48 \\"Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father who is in heaven is perfect\\"So I wondered: Is there more than Christmas trees and carols and Easter Eggs at Resurrection? (Jesus did Resurrect, Psi Tech technically remote viewed it--I love the articles they have on Jesus of Nazareth / Resurrection Event and more..)I found Christian Science, who seemed shocked that the world does not know them and what they do.After reading Science and Health 1875 ed. Mary Baker Glover, and her original 1910 Science and Health with key to the scriptures Mary Baker Eddy, and on to her Prose Works, The Blue Book --love the Blue Book!! awesome, and Dominion Over the Weather. I have been Transformed.Having the Inner Christ, I need less of the old Christmas outer trappings that we all love. Still there, but less.This wonderful, simple little book fills my heart. It will satisfy my Christmas, Easter, Resurrection Breakfast, my everyday.My time to remember Jesus and be with Mary Baker Eddy. What they did for us all! Teaching us how to enter our God-being, use our Dominion. Saving us from the belief that we \\"fell\\" and lost our Dominion, causing us to misuse our Dominion and instead of a heaven on earth, and a divine Life,we created our own Hell: sin, sickness, death--The Great Lie that caused the misery of the Ages...and Jesus saved us from all that...so few listened, so few understood...until Mary Baker (Glover) Eddy slipped on ice, almost died, but was healed almost instantly when she read a healing of Jesus.That is what it means to me. To others, it is a collection of Mary Baker Eddy's Christmas writings in one pretty little book."},{"Title":"What Christmas means to me","review":"Although contemporary Christian Scientists may quite freely celebrate the Christmas holiday (including large gatherings, gift exchanges, etc.), the Founder herself had quite different ideas.

Christ is the Truth and Life born of God---born of Spirit and not of matter. Jesus, the Galilean prophet, was born of the Virgin Mary's spiritual thoughts of Life and its manifestation.\\" (Pg. 11)\\"This homely origin of the babe Jesus falls far short of my sense of the eternal Christ.\\" (Pg. 12)\\"I love to observe Christmas in quietude, humility, benevolence, charity, letting good will towards man, eloquent silence, prayer, and praise express my conception of Truth's appearing.\\" (Pg. 12-13)\\"This year, my beloved Christian Scientists, you must grant me my request that I be permitted total exemption from Christmas gifts.\\" (Pg. 35)\\"All our dear churches' Christmas telegrams to me are refreshing and most pleasing Christmas presents, for they require less attention than packages and give me more time to think and work for others.

The child's mother returns and causes major havoc. Of course the river thugs return to cause some trouble. Throughout all of this though is Sloan and Cherish and their determination to be together.

[grin] Blink yourself into her time and see how you would fare. Traveling in October with no real warm clothing had to be a trial in itself. Sloan did his best to provide for Cherish.Sloan Carroll is looking to pick up a wife to take home to his homestead to take care of his brother's child. Cherish is an angelic answer to his problem and he determines to return home sooner than expected. And he intends to keep his heart intact. No falling in love and giving any woman emotional power over him.Except for those blasted Hurons slowing him down. The Frenchie, Pierre is one lovable character and puts Cherish at ease. It's not easy being seventeen in a land of men, and one needs a man's protection.I could feel the freezing cold and exhustion of the characters as they arived home needing the help of Juice and True to make it inside. These two men turn out to be true friends.The advent of Ada coming for her baby, Orah Delle and stalking Sloan was a bit wicked. And then the doubts raised by Minnie Dove and her pursuit of Sloan and the friendship of John Spotted Elk began to round out Cherish's life in the small community.I don't see how she got over the visual extermination of the river rats so quickly - [I would still be having nightmares]but Cherish had the support of so many friends.

No, this is not Ms. Garlock's best... and no, there is not quite enough emotional conflict to carry the story for the 343 pages. However, it is a sweet story. If you're looking for a simple story without too much conflict, this is it!Cherish spends the entire book letting Sloan determine the route of the relationship, and giving into his every whim. Unlike most of Ms. Garlock female characters, Cherish is quite dependent on Sloan. Otherwise, it's a good story."},{"Title":"Love and Cherish","review":"I've read some of Dorothy Garlock's later books and they were pretty good, so I was kind of surprised at this silly inane story.

It is deep, emotional and full of courage and real love. The characters are wonderful and become like friends you feel honored to know.

The story begins in present time as Tom Prentice, a newly divorced college professor, finds himself back at his alma mater after the death of a beloved college dean. Through a series of flashbacks, we learn of the ill-fated love affair between Tom and Ginny Russo, who had contracted MD as a young child, suffering remissions and exacerbations through the years. As college romances tend to be, Tom and Ginny's romance was fast and torrid, but once her MD progressed to the point of her requiring total care, the two decide to break off the relationship and go their separate ways. This may sound alien or odd to us today, but Hartley pens the story in such a way that we get to see both Tom and Ginny's perspectives on the matter. During their courtship, they wrestle with what the future holds for them. Marriage is discussed, yet Ginny is determined not to become a \\"burden\\" lest her disease progresses. When the subject of having children arises, Ginny is already aware that \\"there is a 25% chance of passing the MD gene on to our offspring.\\" About halfway through the book, these flashbacks come to an end and the story reverts to present time as Tom tries to locate Ginny after 22 years that have passed since their break-up. The love story then turns into a mystery. The book also features a wrestle in spiritual faith as both characters ponder the meaning of disease, illness and suffering. It is thoughtfully well-written, but the dialogue in the story seems stilted and unnatural at times. The author does not shy away from showing us the physical dimension of Tom and Ginny's relationship either; some readers may be put off by some of the eroticism depicted throughout the story. Without divulging the conclusion of The Unforgotten, its ending may be viewed as too pat and idealistic. Still, the story is fiction and doesn't pretend to be otherwise."},{"Title":"Feeding the Beast: The White House Versus the Press","review":"Many Americans have grown increasingly disenchanted with the quality of national news coverage and journalist Kenneth Walsh is one of them. Taking aim at the vindictiveness and sensationalism that pervades coverage of the White House in particular, Walsh attributes much of the blame, not surprisingly, to shorter news cycles that encourage reporters to &quot;advance the story&quot; with &quot;hard-edged&quot; analysis and predictions, fierce competition for ratings, and the public's appetite for entertainment over hard news. The strength of the book, I believe, lies in his interviews with White House reporters and network news anchors. Their reactions to Walsh's questions struck me as running the gamut from surprisingly self-aware and candid to hopelessly defensive, sarcastic and naive. The weaknesses of the book, while not outweighing the strengths, are manifold. Walsh takes too much time to detail how, at the outset, Clinton and his youthful press secretaries needlessly antagonized the press; in the end, he concedes that Clinton's aversion to &quot;gotcha&quot; journalism is well-founded, and that even deft handling of the White House press would have done little to curb rampant negativism. And while he criticizes the Clintons for failing to reveal enough of their private personas to the media, Walsh also acknowledges that the unquenchable press appetite for this sort of information exceeds the limits of human toleration. My most serious reservations concern the author's conclusions. After identifying the competitive pressures that drive the news business, Walsh seems to forget about them as he lamely calls on journalists to restore professional standards. And although many would agree with him that Washington reporters often seem out of touch with the public, his cliched recommendation that reporters reconnect with the &quot;real&quot; America, MIddle America, seems to contravene his own agenda. If Middle America had a greater predilection for hard news and reasoned presentation, as offered for example on public radio and TV, it seems to me that commercial news sources would be only too happy to oblige them."},{"Title":"American practical navigator;: An epitome of navigation (H.O. pub)","review":"If you intend to navigate upon the ocean, out of sight of land, using only celestial bodies as your &quot;lighthouses,&quot; there are three absolute necessities: a sextant (or other means of getting the exact altitude of the sighted body); a nautical almanac or ephemeris, preferably the current issue (or a considerable ability with spherical trigonometry and an encyclopedic knowledge of the movement of celestial bodies--particularly the one you are using); and an accurate timepiece set to, or correctible to, Greenwich meridian time (Coordinated Universal Time).Given those things, and some paper and a pencil--and ideally, a chart and a few simple instruments, like a pair of dividers or compasses, a straightedge and perhaps a set of parallel rules or a pair of triangles, you should do very well--provided that you also know how to use all of the above.With American Practical Navigator, you can find the knowledge you need to use the above tools. It's all in there.It is one of the textbooks used by the United States Naval Academy to teach celestial navigation, as well as the United States Power Squadrons. I am a full certificate member of the latter.American Practical Navigator is not an essential book. There are other texts that are useful in learning celestial navigation; but, it is by far the best.Nathaniel Bowditch, the original author of the American Practical Navigator, was born in 1773, in Salem, Mass. He sailed as a ship's master, and worked as a cooper and ship's chandler, but his all-consuming interest was in mathematics. He learned French, Spanish, German, Latin and Greek in order to absorb the discoveries of others, and at the age of 16 was reading Newton's 'Principia,' translating it from Latin--and he found errors. He later published his own findings, and they were accepted. He wrote his first almanac at the age of 15. He developed an new, simplified method of determining lunar distance, and on his voyages began to find errors in John Moore's 'The Practical Navigator,' the leading navigational text. The rest, as they say, is history.The current American Practical Navigator, Nav Pub. No. 9, published by the Defense Mapping Agency Hydrographic Center, is in two volumes.Any serious student of celestial navigation will want a copy.Another volume, similarly useful, and a good adjunct to your library, will be 'Dutton's Navigation &amp; Piloting.'With these two volumes, and the current Nautical Almanac and your instruments, the world's seas become your thoroughfare.Joseph Pierre, NAuthor of THE ROAD TO DAMASCUS: Our Journey Through Eternity"},{"Title":"American practical navigator;: An epitome of navigation (H.O. pub)","review":"This is a government press. and I believe it may even be against the law to charge more than twent percent of cost.

It is a well established fact. My review is referring to the Kindle version of it as it should be. The existing bunch is dealing with paper and is thus confusing. As I stated above the content is great as always but the Kindle version is mutch to be desired. One obvious shortcoming is the black and white Kindle screan so charts and anything else that is color coded is of little use. This can be helped by getting a copy of the book across to a PC. In addition to this the 1400 page paper book has been formated like a carpet so practically it is very difficoult to navigate throughout. One can not flip between chapters with the 5 way toggle switch. The Kindle does not know where the list of content is so one has to choose &#34;Begining&#34; and then keep on pressing the page back button to get to the list. Chapter One has no hyper links at all. They're missing all together. Graphics are not that good and text formating is as it came out from the scanner. The Kindle itself is best at readng novels where pressing the next page button is all thats needed. In a publication of the size of The Merican Practical Navigator being able to move around the book easily is important. As a poduct of Guttenbergproject that would be have been acceptable but Amazon is selling it at a price. Its not good anough. In short. If you have to get the ebook version of the American Practical Navigator because of weight restrictions concider the above otherwise get the normal paper version of this book and you will have the real deal. Several bookmarks can be used and you will fly around the book as you normally do in a paper book. The combination of the Kindle design and the less than adequate formating of this ebook can be a pain in the neck.Good Luck and happy navigating."},{"Title":"American practical navigator;: An epitome of navigation (H.O. pub)","review":"The book is nnot a good download copy.

To say my son was brainwashed would be putting it mildly. I'm not sure how much the book did, but he's becoming more normal every day, and is now starting to be able to make his own decisions based on his own feelings of guilt and his own moral code, rather than having to ask himself \\"what would jesus do\\". I read the book myself, and though very basic and maybe a 2nd-3rd grade reading level, I thought it made some excellent points, and it made me think... no small matter for a book of such a low reading level! I highly recommend it to any agnostic or pagan parents trying to teach their children the true meaning of right and wrong, without the guilt of a higher being being used as an intimidation and scare tactic to twist the child into submission. This book should help to develop the free thinking skills that are required for any child to be happy and have good self-esteem in regards to their choices and actions."},{"Title":"Maybe Right, Maybe Wrong","review":"This book is about a young girl, Andrea, who is learning how to make ethical decisions in a variety of situations by acquiring and learning how to use the tools of reason, rather than relying on arbitrary doctrines or dogma decided beforehand by authorities past or present, be it Prophets,"},{"Title":"Maybe Right, Maybe Wrong","review":"The beginning of this book - and the part I had access to via the preview function - starts out well enough. We are introduced to Andrea, and immediately to a situation where she determines that fighting solves nothing. It then jumps to a hypothetical situation of Andrea's cat being hit by a car and we are walked through Andrea's struggle between two concepts she knows to be right and realizing that they can't both apply to the situation. Should her cat be 'put to sleep' and spared inevitable pain or kept alive, suffering, in an effort to delay inevitable death. Before Andrea makes her choice, the question is offered, aptly, to the reader. Then next page shows Andrea choosing the difficult but most logical choice -- to end her cat's life, and thus, his suffering. I found this portion of the book to be precisely what I expected in terms of reader interaction and the promotion of free thought the book is supposed to be based upon.The question regarding Andrea's cat posed on page 20 of the 76-page book, is essentially the last real thought-inducing question posed to the reader. Allow me to express my surprise here, as I believed that this book would gently guide its reader to conclusions, rather than stating them outright.There are some pages following this discourse which discuss the concept of morality and there being 'good people who do believe in god(s)' and 'good people who do not believe in god(s).' Appropriate enough.Then it jumps into small segments of 'do and don't' lists, ie. 'Do be fair.' or 'Don't cheat' and most of these have little follow-ups on the 'why' of explaining the reason these are or are not things we should do. I honestly expected more. As in, I expected that rather than laying down a bunch of adult concepts spelled out in simple kid language, that the adult concepts would be geared toward a kid audience on a kid-level while still maintaining their core ideas.Perhaps the following example will demonstrate this fairly succinctly. On page 48, addressing the topic of honesty it gives this example: \\"Suppose a woman you know comes to your home and says she needs somewhere to hide because her husband has been beating her up.\\" Huh? Really? Because dozens of 5 year olds are running their own covert battered women's shelters?I begin to question, with that last example, what age audience this is supposed to be geared toward. On one hand, the illustrations and tone of the writing seem quite well matched to an early grade-school child. It is written in simply-worded text that my five year old daughter could easily read herself (though I certainly intended to read it over with her first). But when you touch on a prickly topic like battered women, something that hopefully most children will not have to encounter, you open up some rather uncomfortable possibilities. The one that comes to my mind is my daughter going to school and telling her teacher than if daddy ever beats mommy, she won't tell him where mommy is. Parents out there may grasp why this would be an undesirable outcome of broadening their child's mind..... For children who have already encountered real-world domestic abuse, I think it's fair to say they have bigger fish to fry than pondering whether providing shelter to battered women whilst being honest with the husband is the moral high ground. The subject matter is too mature and could have been better chosen given the potential age group.Moving on.Later, on page 57, the Golden Rule is addressed. I'm quite fond of the Golden Rule and its endless applications. As I understand it, in its most common form, states \\"Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.\\" Barker has a different take on it and says it means, \\"Some people are kind to others because they want to be treated the same way themselves.\\" That's actually a quite different thing. Amazing how you can change words around ever so slightly and convey an entirely different concept. Barker goes on to demonstrate this glaring difference by saying, \\"But other people are kind because they think human beings are valuable, not because they want a reward.\\" I find this perplexing. Perhaps I've gone my whole life interpreting the phrase \\"as you would have them do unto you\\" incorrectly, but I always believed that you treated others the way you would ideally like to be treated -- though that may not necessarily be the way they actually treat you in return. It's a form of empathy, you know? One that comes from the most valid source of logical data one has for interpersonal relations - their own interpretation of how the actions of others effect them. If an action effects you negatively, then you should not visit that action upon another being (human or otherwise). Which, going back to the initial scenario, could have easily been the logic for euthanizing the pet cat. If your death were inevitable and you were suffering greatly, would you choose euthanasia or would you prolong your life, suffering, dignity beyond reason? I would have euthanized the cat because I would ideally hope that another would use their own insight to do the same for me in a similar situation. I would still euthanize the cat, even if someone chose not to euthanize me were the tables turned, because my moral compass is internal and greatly based on my experience of personal pain and suffering and the experience of watching others needlessly endure it. That is all to say, I find the section on the Golden Rule to be off- perhaps influenced by a negative connotation with its general association with religion?This book is presented and titled as being a guide for young thinkers. But as I got progressively further into the book, it seemed to be laying out a sort of moral dogma, with little justification, and requiring little thought and contemplation from the reader. Dogmatic presentations of moral thinking are precisely what I believed the book was created to counter, and I feel it fell flat. This is even more sad because on each and every page I can see the author's *intention* and then as he carries that good idea along he almost seems to trip himself up on it and it just gets regurgitated on the page in ineffective form. By the end I felt that the ability to think your own way through it was rather squelched by the 'do and don't' tone it takes on.I bought this book as part of a long-term plan to counter Christianity-based indoctrination that has been directed at my daughter. As an atheist of many years, I find it difficult to stand idly by and let her believe that what little she has been fed by religious infleunces represents the thinking of the entire world. I'm terribly disappointed to say I don't this will make its way into our 'Chrisitanity-unschooling' curriculum. Which is a shame, because I've looked extensively and can find nothing else like it.I plan on returning this book. It will be my first book return on Amazon. But I feel our money could be better spent on educating our daughter about -- well anything. Mythology, eastern religions, philosophy, ethics, science and the cosmos.... There are a lot of paths to free thought. But this one, I believe, is too forward, too black-and-white, and not informative enough to be the optimal one."},{"Title":"Maybe Right, Maybe Wrong","review":"We live in a country where Fundamentalists are pushing religion into every corner of our lives.

It gives valid reasons for why one should behave in certain ways, without appealing to any Bibles/Korans/Talmuds. And in a much more universal language, it advocates morality, listening to one's conscience, and living with principles. It leaves open the possibility that one principle might be more important than another principle, whereas religiously based morality makes inflexible (though sometimes contradictary) moral assertions, without any general principles and explanations about why something is moral (other than appealing to the authority of the bible, et. al). The religious way can and never could be reconciled with the paradoxes of real human society. For example, if killing is always against God's commandments, then why do Muslims exhort killing in Jihad's, or why do Christians and Jews believe in the eye for an eye (without any explicit permission). For real morality, you have to be consistent. Principle based morality relys on us humans to figure out what is truly moral.What a fresh and honest outlook on life this book gives.

The author, Dan Barker, explains the differences between rules and principles in simple terms that children can understand. He also stresses the importance of using principles to think for oneself, rather than blindly following the rules of an authority.The message of this book is strongly rooted in humanist philosophy. The book begins by stating that \\"there is nothing more important than human beings\\". The concepts which follow are all based on avoiding hurting another person. (It does also explain that humans are part of nature and that nature, including all other animals, should be respected.)Eight suggested principles are discussed: Life is Valuable, Respect, Fairness, Honesty, Responsibility, Kindness, Knowledge, and Enjoy Life.By explaining the concept of principled living in simple terms, Dan Barker gives parents a useful tool for teaching their children how to think about morality. The book is presented in clear statements that can easily lead to deeper discussion, particularly with older children."},{"Title":"Maybe Right, Maybe Wrong","review":"My children were brought up with no religious training, they were brought up with high moral standards.

I think they enjoyed it, and it made them think, but they were too young to get a whole lot out of it. Now that they are 11 and 13, we pulled the book off the bookshelf and read it again today. It's a very concise book - not at all wordy, and it's certainly not a book to \\"teach\\" your kids the ins, outs and whys of morality and principled living. What it DOES do well is serve as a simple, clear book that is easy to read together in one sitting, that kids can use as a jumping-off point to discuss their own feelings and experiences, and that parents can use as a basis for further discussion then and on a continual basis.Personally, we live in a secular home, and my Roman Catholic parents live next door. I found a lot of value in the rules vs. principles concept, since the way we choose to live our lives and make decisions is often in rather stark contrast to my parents. Will this book change my kids' lives? Nope. But books such as this are great additions to a secular home's library, and it's one I know we will return to again in the future. From someone who grew up in a home in which \\"moral relativism\\" was seen as one of the most pressing threats to humanity, it's nice to have books like this which support the concept that things are quite often relative, and that critical thinking and a genuine caring for living things are what really matters, as opposed to blind obedience to religiously imposed rules."},{"Title":"Maybe Right, Maybe Wrong","review":"The first example is of a loved family pet having been so badly hurt that it needs to be put to sleep.

That work ethic has fed Jack's success and made him a very rich man. When Jack meets Lisa, it's love at first sight. They commute by plane to steal precious time with each other, and when that is not possible they fuel their relationship in cyberspace. What could it hurt? They are both consenting adults and everything is protected by encrypted passwords, right? Wrong. During a romantic cyber-encounter, Lisa is brutally murdered as Jack looks on. >From that night, he isolates himself in high tech luxury and has nothing left to live for but the hunt for Lisa's killer.Jack's prey is pure voyeuristic evil, taking perverse pleasure in forcing friends and lovers to witness each victim's demise. Technology easily tracks committed lovers amd casual pleasure seekers as they fulfill sexual fantasies online in supposed safety. Lisa is the killer's first victim, but not the last. Numbed into celibacy for several years, Jack wades through the sometimes unsavory cesspool of private chat cams in search of clues. One suspect after another is examined and eliminated.

His detailed descriptions of their moods and the scenes make the reader feel the atmosphere and the environment.It is also attractive to feel that apart from the reader there is some body else watching, giving information on what is going on, and at the same time getting sentimentally involved with the characters.The book has explicit descriptions of sex and violence - scenes that need an open mind to be read, but it also has tenderness scenes that help to reconcile with the author.It is interesting to read the way in which the past influences personalities and the impact it has on future behavior of people.Reading The Sentinel is easy as it maintains expectation in each chapter and awakens the impulse to read it to the end. The way events are linked keeps alertness and the presence of certain elements, very well described, maintain interest in what happens in the novel. It is easy to identify with characters and get involved in their feelings.The climax, which happens in the last chapter, has a sequence that maintains expectation and permits to start concluding on the role of each character and to understand their participation on the scenes described earlier and in the whole plot.I did enjoy reading The Sentinel and I do recommend its reading."},{"Title":"The Sentinel","review":"An outstanding technology thriller.

If the stories arent the X or higher they tend to be slow and boring... not quite the erotic reads they should have been. Don't get me wrong, I've read stories that have been erotic without being XXX. But these don't cut it.The Second problem I have is that many of her stories almost drip with contempt for males. Why is it lesbian fiction should contain contempt for males? Are all lesbians male hating radicals. Well, none of the ones I know personally are, but to much lesbian fiction, erotic or otherwise, seems to portray this. That belongs in a political or philosophical treatise, not in something that is supposed to contain erotic fiction. If it weren't for some of the stories being really steamy, I would have given this book 1 star just on that alone. It really detracts from the mood of the story."},{"Title":"Abounding Grace: An Anthology of Wisdom","review":"M.

We don't own this book ... yet. Instead, we browsed through it at a very large, library like bookstore. The look and feel of the book made it difficult to put back on the shelf. Indeed, we found that this thick book was a feast of words, containing hundreds and hundreds of quotes - 1,600 or so -- on topics having to do with virtue: happiness, courage, compassion, purity, perseverance, courtesy, faith, goodness, love, respect, strength, and wisdom.But it proved to be much more than just the usual collection of great quotes, or words of wisdom to look at once in a while, or copy onto websites and into newsletters. &quot;Virtue&quot; when served up by M. Scott Peck goes beyond conventional, dogmatic wisdom that sees goodness as something to be applied externally, and medicinally.Peck thoughtfully reflects on what virtue is, what it means to individuals, how it emerges in each of us, from deep within. Before each section of quotes from a variety of people from different cultures, times, and beliefs, he offers his own reflections and experiences (on light purple paper, so you can easily see where each section begins) about the topic.We love this book because it gives us all those favorite quotes, and some delicious food for thought. For the M. Scott Peck fan (The Road Less Traveled), this book will be a welcome gift (its on MY list to give and get)!"},{"Title":"Abounding Grace: An Anthology of Wisdom","review":"Scott peck has put together this anthology of quotes on the virtues of happiness, courage, compassion, purity, perseverance, courtesy, faith, goodness, love, respect, strength, and wisdom.

Per its title, it has a Christian bias; it includes some Jewish & Moslem quotes, but almost no Eastern wisdom--the subtitle \\"An Anthology of Wisdom\\" should say \\"Western Wisdom.\\" My quote collection contained a few of these, but (per most such collections) most aren't my cup of tea-obvious, hackneyed, or uninspiring IMHO. Still, I collected over 50 here--not bad. Some were taken from Peck's introductions to each category which are well-written & explicit regarding his perspective; mine differs, but his candor is commendable. Regrettably, neither quote sources nor an index are provided, & many great quotes are absent. Many of those included seem to me to be knowledge rather than wisdom. Some are humorous: p. 92: Douglas Jerrold-He was so benevolent, so merciful a man that, in his mistaken passion, he would have held an umbrella over a duck in a shower of rain; p. 311: Malcolm X-I learned that pilgrims from every land-every color & class & rank-all snored in the same language; p. 379: Armenian Proverb-If there were wisdom in beards, all goats would be prophets.Some are practical: p. 72: Anonymous Chicago Teacher-Risks must be taken, because the greatest hazard in life is to risk nothing. The person who risks nothing, does nothing, has nothing, is nothing. They may avoid suffering & sorrow, but they cannot learn, feel, change, grow, love, live. Chained by their attitudes they are slaves; they have forfeited their freedom. Only a person who risks is free.p. 277: Anonymous-You can win more friends with your ears than your mouth.p. 348: Gustavo Diaz Ordaz-I like to operate like a submarine on sonar. When I am picking up noise from both he left & right, I know my course is correct.p. 358: Sam Levinson-It was on my 5th birthday that Papa put his hand on my shoulder & said, \`Remember my son, if you ever need a helping hand, you'll find one at the end of your arm.Some are profound: p. 331: Joanna Field-The growth of understanding follows an ascending spiral rather than a straight line. p. 378: Greek Proverb-Wonder is the beginning of wisdom.Some are unusual: p. 67: Thomas Szasz-The proverb warns that, ;You should not bite the hand that feeds you.' But maybe you should, if it prevents you from feeding yourself.Some are all of the above: p. 67: Will Henry-The wishbone will never replace the backbone.p. 362: Nancy Reagan-A woman is like a tea bag; you don't know her strength until she is in hot water.Overall, it's a pretty good collection & hopeful considering Peck's conclusion that: p. 232: Ever so slowly, almost imperceptibly, our standards of decency seem to be rising."},{"Title":"Abounding Grace: An Anthology of Wisdom","review":"This book is wonderful.

There comes a time when you have to stop sifting yourself and just admit: This is what you are. It doesn't mean you should--or can--stop trying. It just means that mortal flesh is not infinitely pliable, that there is no transformation-in-a-bottle to be had. Books abound which promise E-Z enlightenment, and people abound who have failed to avoid them, to their sorrow. M. Scott Peck's remarkable career has bucked the marketing trend of these books by reiterating the commonplace truth, &quot;Life is difficult.&quot; The wisdom that so many people have found in his works is thanks to his clinical psychological experience and to his Christian faith, which nowadays is somewhat filtered by a nimbus of syncretism. He hasn't always made all the right moves. _People of the Lie_ nearly went off the rails toward the end when he used his theories about evil to settle some old personal scores. And _The Different Drum_ threatened to float away into the New Age, as well as betraying some truly embarrassing political stupidity about communist countries. But _The Road Less Traveled_ was a lodestar for me at an impressionable age, as it was for millions of others.So it is with a degree of nostalgia that I took up _Abounding Grace_. I am an insatiable quote-hound, so I hoovered the contents as fast as I could, and passed them along to people who could also appreciate them. It is a big book with a dozen chapters, with many subheadings for each one. The authors of the quotes are identified, but not the sources, and there is no index. The narrative introductions to the sections are themselves strewn with quotes-a little sneakiness by the author to get me to read them? They also include various anecdotes and personal opinions about the virtues being treated.The quotations are well chosen, many of them being unfamiliar to me (which, if I do say so myself, is saying something). All are good and pithy, and are sure to strike a chord with someone. He indulges in an ipsedixitism or two, quoting himself, but that's okay; he's entitled. _Abounding Grace_ is a fine handbook of wisdom, which looks like it will return many hours of pleasurable self-discovery."},{"Title":"\\"Why Did You Do That?\\": Solving the Mysteries of Parenting","review":"Cracking the Parenting Code: 6 Clues to Solving the Mystery of Meeting Your Child's NeedsSimplistic and easy to read!"},{"Title":"The First 1000 Days (The Secret Diary of Harold L.

I'm so glad that I did.Secretary of the Interior Harold Ickes was not only the head of the PWA, but was also one of the most effective political speech-makers in Roosevelt's cabinet. It seems probable that Roosevelt might have lost the 1936 election to Alf Landon were it not for the \\"speechifying\\" of this trench-hardened political veteran.Ickes' day-to-day journal provides something of an insiders' view of President Roosevelt and his leadship style, as well as insights into the personalities and pecadillos of the members of his cabinet. Ickes' turf war with Harry Hopkins over the WPA is frequently discussed.An even mix of policy and politics, Ickes' book is a primary source for anyone wishing to look further into how the Roosevelt Administration actually functioned during this most difficult period in history."},{"Title":"100 Turn-of-the-Century House Plans (Dover Architecture)","review":"This is a reprint of Radford's 1909 Plan Book and (may I one day be forgiven for saying this, but), some of these houses were ugly.

It also includes fun activities for both children and adults that can help break the ice.Foster parents may be unpleasantly surprised by foster children's hesitancy to get close to them. This booklet can serve as a guide to help adults to effectively help each unique child. The beauty of this book is that the author is an experienced foster parent (in addition to being educated in psychology and pediatric nursing). Her experience in working with children, who have been deeply wounded, helps her to effectively relate to the unique issues that foster parents and pediatric professionals may face.

The words to this song/story are so engaging, they are the things that naturally catch a child's eye and ear-- windshield wipers, bus doors, baby's crying, parents shushing! My son initially enjoyed the whole book. Then, about 15 months, did not want to hear the part about the baby crying! Then resumed liking the whole book but more due to the details in the pictures. The illustrations are superb. Again, it is everything that captures a young toddlers exploration of their world--closed umbrellas opening upon raindrops falling, hands waving, money being exchanged, letters being mailed, how noise (horns, crying, hushing) can startle, capture attention, and calm.

It's a great book for conveying to your child your love of reading.I have to agree with one of the earlier reviewers that it's a bit disappointing to see an illustration of a baby being shushed with a bottle. It's true, though, that some moms can't breastfeed. And the pictures very sweetly convey the parents' love for the baby, and everyone on the bus is concerned about him/her too.My husband and I are very picky about the books we read to our daughter because we can't stand them ourselves if they're boring, annoying or offensive.

For example, there is a young girl with a very sour expression, sticking her tongue out at her mother and other passengers. Yuck. In addition, the baby on the bus appears to lose the pacifier in her mouth during the \\"up and down\\" and cries until Mama gives her a bottle. Shouldn't Mama be nursing her baby?

The book can be divided into thirds: easy sonatinas by Friederich Kuhlau (1786-1832) and Muzio Clementi (1752-1832); four easy sonatas by Haydn (Hob 35), Mozart (K 545) and Beethoven (Op. 49, No. 1 & 2); short pieces and excepts from symphonic works.I studied this book as a child and now use it in my private piano studio for what I consider \\"4th-yr students.\\" The upside is that it inexpensively gives them a great foundation of the classical style, the pieces are not difficult to learn, they begin to see the use of counterpoint and to understand the sonata form. The downside is the same with all of the older Schirmer texts in that the editor took liberties in regards to tempos, dynamic markings, articulations and even notes. Such was the trend over a hundred years ago and, fortunately, is not the case with today's urtext editions. Despite this, I still find it an economical resource for my students and of minor signifigance at this level. Any glaring errors (which are few), I will fix after consulting my urtext editions.Yes, there are other collections out there that are just as good, if not better; however, I've found that this edition provides an excellent grounding in the classical style at an inexpensive price."},{"Title":"Sonatina Album: Piano Solo (Schirmer's Library of Musical Classics)","review":"Sonatina album is great for teaching if you are a piano teacher.

This edition is clearly printed and carefully fingered."},{"Title":"Sonatina Album: Piano Solo (Schirmer's Library of Musical Classics)","review":"Though I've said \\"excellent book for students\\", the quality of the pieces is nice for players of any experience who enjoy sonatinas that aren't overly complex. I used this as a kid and always had several favorites I'd play every now and then as an adult. There is another version of this book that's identical, except that it has about two thirds of the pieces as best as I can remember. I lost the smaller version I had as a kid a dozen years ago and got this as a replacement. The difference in price between the two versions available at that time was so small it would've been stupid not to get this version. I'm glad I did as the extra selections in this version are nice pieces, though I haven't had much chance to really learn them yet, but the choices that were made to include these pieces was a good call. I have no problem with the fingerings in this book, as with Schirmer books in general. The other good feature is that the selections aren't heavily weighted towards just a few composers; it's a reasonably good spread. Probably no one will like every single piece, but most people will like most of the pieces."},{"Title":"Sonatina Album: Piano Solo (Schirmer's Library of Musical Classics)","review":"All the sonitanas in this book are provided with adequate fingering.The finest composers are represented in each piece.Book is easy to open and the book stays open during the time needed for practice."},{"Title":"Sonatina Album: Piano Solo (Schirmer's Library of Musical Classics)","review":"I was looking for a book of Clementi Sonatinas for warmups and practice.

I have been reading from Schirmer's editions for over 40 years and the quality of their printing has obviously taken a tumble. As with a Kalmus edition of Mozart Sonatas I recently purchased on Amazon, 7 lines of music are crammed onto a page where 5 or 6 used to be the norm. The notes are further compressed side to side (more notes per line). The printing is also faded, as if they were printed on a poor copy machine. I found this book very difficult and unpleasant to read, unlike the many Schirmer editions of classical piano music I own and use regularly. I am now wary of purchasing music online, despite the difficulty in buying good editions locally. Even in New York City, the great Patelson's music store has closed. On my next trip I will spend time at the Julliard School's music store, which still carries excellent editions of the classics."},{"Title":"Sonatina Album: Piano Solo (Schirmer's Library of Musical Classics)","review":"The Sonatina album is a great album containing sonatinas, rondos and a few other pieces.

Gold is, to put it bluntly, not a particularly skilled wordsmith. His limitations are obvious from the first page. Nevertheless this novel/memoir makes for fascinating reading. The book consists of a series of loosely connected vignettes from the life of a child growing up in the Lower East Side at the turn of the century. Gold wants to capture the sights and smells and sensations of that world, and while his prose is not quite up to the task, the reader still comes away powerfully moved.What seems to be unique about Gold's account is his political bent. Rather than softening or sentimentalizing his experiences, he picks at scabs and pulls back the curtain to reveal horrors to his readers. As a devoted socialist, he wants to expose the evils of unrestrained capitalism. What that means for him is, rather than denying anti-Semitic stereotypes, he revels in them. Gold he wants the reader to understand that they are the result, not of Jewish culture, but of the effects of American ghetto poverty upon the Jews of his neighborhood. Povery, he aruges, turns potential into corruption. His is a world in which people will do anything for a few pennies, often all that stands between them and starvation. On the other hand, his world is also populated by characters who remain strong despite their suffering: his mother, who would rather go hungry than see a stranger starve; the foolish store-owner, who loses her livelihood because she cannot stand to turn away the poor. There are also desperate prostitutes, rapacious pawn brokers, crooked businessmen, and dreamers and schemers of all sorts.This book lacks the literary ambition of Henry Roth's &quot;Call it Sleep&quot; or the narrative power of Abraham Cahan's &quot;Rise of David Levinsky&quot; (in my opinion, the finest novel ever about the Jewish immigrant experience). This is a political tract, and sometimes its dogma is rather irritating, even offensive. Nevertheless, it is a significant and important document of early 20th-century Jewish culture, and deserves to be read."},{"Title":"JEWS WITHOUT MONEY","review":"The only thing marring this important work is the introduction by Alfred Kazin which maligns the novel and Michael Gold and leaves the reader wondering if the publisher is really trying to promote the book. The introduction probably is the result of old grudges from bygone politically motivated &quot;cultural wars&quot; between Jewish writers. The author's widow was deeply upset by the underhanded and cowardly introduction."},{"Title":"JEWS WITHOUT MONEY","review":"This is a masterpiece that has lost none of its power since it was first published 70 years ago. The book hooks you from the first paragraph and never lets go."},{"Title":"JEWS WITHOUT MONEY","review":"I really enjoyed this book. Gold's writing style is very unorthodox but I think this allows you to feel the emotion in his words. This story really makes you appreciate the issues that these poor Jewish immigrants faced and confirms that the American Dream certainly is possible as we have the luxury today in 2007 to evaluate the situations of many of these character's descendants. These people worked hard and helped each other and therefore made better lives for their future generations."},{"Title":"JEWS WITHOUT MONEY","review":"A book you won't be able to put down.

The autobiographical type of narration works well, and the tales of Michael and his family are sure to smear your mind with many images of the hard life they lived and how important it was to get by. I am reading this for a course at my university, but I would recommend this book to anyone, even casual readers. The book does not mean to be informative, but it puts you back in the time and Gold makes you feel as if you are experiencing event after event in his life. Enjoy this one, it was good!

There is nothing very uplifting in the book, which makes me wonder exactly why he wrote it, other than perhaps to purge his soul of what he experienced as a child.I didn't find anything even close to the noble struggle of people in bad circumstances rising above those circumstances to become fully human in the face of wretchedness. In addition, his distaste for Christians, while honest and honestly come by (the Catholics in this book are reprehensible characters) comes out in spades.While it paints a vivid picture of the squallor of NYC at the turn of the last century, after a while all the badness gets tiring to read."},{"Title":"Toward a Democratic Science: Scientific Narration and Civic Communication","review":"In Toward a Democratic Science, Brown opens the radical possibility of an outside to science, an outside which can already be glimpse within science, through its various rhetorical devices and means of becoming engaged and therefore more democratic. Situating the question of democracy, not within the often limited standards of political argumentation which point either to liberal or conservative sentiments (while both sides denounce any new form of socialism), Brown seeks to rescue science as the vent of the democratic, as that singular activity with which we can unravel the closures of world representation and make new ones."},{"Title":"Redcoats and Rebels: The American Revolution Through British Eyes","review":"Christopher Hibbert is a very fine writer and, as a historian, has covered an extraordinary range of topics. Redcoats and Rebels is a perfect introduction to the events leading to the War of Independence and of the conduct of the war itself, and shows an even-handed perspective from both the British and colonial perspective, although it is meant to be more through British eyes. A serious student of the War of Independence may find the book a little superficial. Hibbert's books are always hugely enjoyable to read."},{"Title":"Redcoats and Rebels: The American Revolution Through British Eyes","review":"While there is nothing really new here, this book does provide a needed British perspective. For a change we read of British troops campaigning in rags and harsh conditions. Washy and the rebels don't have a monopoly on suffering. So often we read US historians rattling on about the martydom of the Rebel cause. Reading this book will give a different perspective. The book also displays how the British defeated the Americans over and over again in countless engagements small and large. For every Saratoga and Cowpens there was a Savanah and Camden.The main strength of Hibbert's book is that it shows how dysfunctional the British command structure was. Relationships between ministers and generals was ill-defined and often strained. Most of the British generals did not get along with each other. Clinton was probably the best over all, but he was hampered by severe personality defects. Howe in the beginning of the war had the best opportunity to crush the ametuer American war effort. When one reads of the British campaign in and around New York in 1776 it astounds what opportunities were thrown away over and over again. Added on top of this was the meddling influence of Lord Germain in Whitehall pitting each general against the other. The Saratoga campaign is a classic example of this situation. Logistics, uninspired generalship and insufficnet resources all doomed the British war effort. Spirited leadership does show on occasion what could be done. Archibald Campbell's brilliant Georgia campaign illustrates how effectively British forces could be employed against poorly lead rebels.Rev War battles were often extreme affairs. Because of the small numbers involved in most battles a single set-back for one side usually ended in its total defeat. Limited cavalry resources meant that no decisive follow-up for most victories could really be employed. The Revolutionary war was a limited conflict, fought with small armies and raiding parties. The British adapted to this mode of warfare with amazing alacrity, but in the end it was logistics, politics and weak leadership that doomed their cause. Readers that have only consulted American historians will find a lot that is surprising here, even if in the whole most of the material is not new. While not strong on details of battles, the author is good at showing who actually fought the war and what their motivations were. Recommended."},{"Title":"Redcoats and Rebels: The American Revolution Through British Eyes","review":"This book presented an insightful view of the American Revolutionary War without over glorifying and falsifying the American war mentality. It truly does a remarkable job of illustrating the way the war really was, and how close the American revolutionists were to losing despite there heartened efforts."},{"Title":"Redcoats and Rebels: The American Revolution Through British Eyes","review":"Very interesting and hard to put down.

Given the retrospective propaganda of this period in history in the United States, it comes as a relief to encounter such a balanced and realistic chronicle of the times. This should be mandatory reading in American schools."},{"Title":"Redcoats and Rebels: The American Revolution Through British Eyes","review":"I like the book condition, but it is just another version of the American Revolution through the British eyes."},{"Title":"Redcoats and Rebels: The American Revolution Through British Eyes","review":"\\"Redcoats and Rebels\\" is American Revolutionary War history at its best!This extremely well written and compelling history of the Revolutionary War is presented from the British perspective, thus adding a new dimension to that conflict.British historan Christopher Hibbert has made good use of British sources, especially the papers and documents of those who participated in the war, in writing \\"Redcoats and Rebels\\". His focus on the key individuals of both sides makes this an interesting read. Especially interesting are the parts played by men such as Nathanael Greene, Benedict Arnold and Banastre Tarleton in the war.The American Revolutionary War was America's first long war and first civil war. Between 1775 and 1782, the Colonies raised some 80 regiments to battle the British, while Loyalists raised some 40 American regiments to fight alongside the Redcoats. It was a war in which a small and extremely militant and even violent minority imposed its will on both the one-third of the American population that supported the British and another one-third which cared little about either an independent America or remaining under British control. Indeed, many American militia formations were used to intimidate Loyalist and keep them from openly supporting the British.Hibbert also shows clearly that there were many in the British Parliament and among the population that openly supported the Americans and did everything they could to undermine their own government's pursuit of the war.And the author does not hesitate to show how long lines of communications between England and the colonies and a scarcity of resources, especially men and military equipment, hampered the British conduct of the war. As did the long and extremely arduous theater of operations, which allowed defeated American armies to rise repeatedly from the ashes of defeat.Hibbert writes that the British Army was forced to lower its standards in order to fill its ranks in America. And many British soldiers and German mercenaries defected to the other side, while many Colonial soldiers and even some leaders, such as Benedict Arnold, had no hesitation in switching their allegiance from the Continental Congress to the British Empire. It was indeed a strange war!Hibbert also depicts the major role played America's military allies - France, Spain, and Holland - in ensuring an American victory.This book is recommended for any student of that conflict - young and old. And those wishing to understand the war in Iraq better might do well to read \\"Redcoats and Rebels\\" and contemplate the ability of a people numerous and armed and supported by allies both near and abroad to defeat a much larger, better armed, better equipped, and better disciplined force over the course of a long war."},{"Title":"Redcoats and Rebels: The American Revolution Through British Eyes","review":"This book is certainly not the dry unintersting history that so many of this genre can be, however it is definitely written from the British perspective. You will not get an in-depth review of the conflict, i.e. the atrocities commited by Tarlton's Calvery and the subsequent outrage they caused are almost neglected completely and are refered to only in passing as \\"harsh tactics\\". The pivotal battles of King's Mountain and Cowpens are treated almost as minor skirmishs although they were major turning points in the outcome of the war. Still, the reader does obtain a sense of the sometimes pompous arrogance and infighting that was eventually to lead to the downfall of the British Empire.All in all a good read and serves to fill out some otherwise often neglected segments of the AWI."},{"Title":"Redcoats and Rebels: The American Revolution Through British Eyes","review":"The British weren't so bad after all.

Some food for thought: On both sides of war there are too much loss."},{"Title":"Redcoats and Rebels: The American Revolution Through British Eyes","review":"Any value this book might have had was soon erased when I noticed basic mistakes in facts about people and events. So the material I might have found informative because I didn;t know it, I now suspect."},{"Title":"Redcoats and Rebels: The American Revolution Through British Eyes","review":"Christopher Hibbert has written an engaging narrative that tells the story of the Revolutionary War from the British perspective. At first this may seem like a useful addition to the historical literature, however there is less to this book than meets the eye.The problems with Mr. Hibbert's book were described by John Shy, Professor of History Emeritus at the University of Michigan, in a review published in the New York Times in 1990. Professor Shy points out that Mr. Hibbert makes factual errors that he should have been able to avoid given the sources cited in the book's bibliography. More fundamentally, there is a problem with the way in which Mr. Hibbert writes military history. The best practitioners of military history write with reference to the broader political and social questions war raises. This approach is particularly crucial in approaching the Revolutionary War, which was as political a conflict as a war can get. This is not the approach of \\"Redcoats and Rebels\\". What Mr. Hibbert has given us instead is another account of the battles and personalities of the Revolutionary War with little attention paid to broader issues of politics, society, or diplomacy that shaped the British side of the war. To correct these flaws Mr. Hibbert would have had to give serious attention to British wartime politics and the political dimensions of British strategy in America. His failure to do so makes this a fundamentally flawed book that is of questionable value even for the general reader. This book does not provide a deep understanding of the war.Readers interested in the Revolutionary War should turn to works of David Hackett Fischer, (Paul Revere's Ride and Washington's Crossing), Charles Royster, or Don Higgenbotham."},{"Title":"Redcoats and Rebels: The American Revolution Through British Eyes","review":"I bought this volume on the internet without first looking at it expecting it to be in the same format as the excellent Rebels and Redcoats by Scheer and Rankin. I had never read a book by Christopher Hibbert before, but I figured it was named in the same manner as the Scheer/Rankin volume there was nothing to worry about. When I received it, and found out it wasn't, I was extremely disappointed.However, after starting to thumb through the book, I became very interested, both in content and in Hibbert's excellent writing style.This volume is jam-packed with interesting and useful information and gives great insight to the British side of the war, one which is generally overlooked by American historians and general reading public. It also lets us know two things: how close the British came to winning at various times during the war, and that after the French Alliance in 1777, North American became just another theater in yet another world war between France and England.I highly recommend this book just because it gives an accurate picture of the 'other side', and the level of scholarship and research is high. It is good, solid history and deserves a much wider readership. It isn't Scheer and Rankin, but it's close."},{"Title":"Redcoats and Rebels: The American Revolution Through British Eyes","review":"Granted, this book was well received by me since in many ways it meets my personal feelings of the struggle. Knowing this, i can suggest this book to beginners or novices only.For the harcore revolutionary war era reader, no matter their leanings, this book would not reveal much that you either did not know or could not already figure out.However, for those that have only read \\"whig\\" histories and do not know or have forgotten that there was another side to the conflict, this would be a good read.Remember in most conflicts, including this one, there is no good-guy or bad-guy just two sides that were at odds. Both have valid points and both can be viewed as \\"right\\" or \\"wrong\\"."},{"Title":"Redcoats and Rebels: The American Revolution Through British Eyes","review":"I suppose Hibbert's book does exactly what Hibbert intended: a political and military history of the American Revolution from the British perspective (the book was initially published in Great Britain). What Hibbert does not accomplish--and clearly did not attempt to acomplish--is any social history of the revolutionary period from the British perspective. At the book's beginning we learn of acts of what we would now call terrorism against royal officers, and at its close there is a brief summary of what happened to many the main characters after the war. But I would have appreciated much more about the impact of the revolution on the inhabitants of British North America, and especially on those whose convictions were loyal to the crown during the war and the years that followed. Is this a flaw in Hibbert's book? No: he did what he intended to do. But a prospective purchaser will want to ascertain that his or her interests in the period are the same as Hibbert's. Those wanting a treatment of non-military matters will be disappointed."},{"Title":"Redcoats and Rebels: The American Revolution Through British Eyes","review":"It is very hard for Americans to swallow an alternative version of a key part of this nation's history. Having been force-fed the polarized view of the political structures of the 18th century, to find an account that points out that the rebellion was ultimately an entirely British affair, fuelled largely by greed and opportunism, is completely foreign to them.This sort of book is very important because it does not pander to the blinkered, flag-waving, Hallmark version of that period of history, but injects a much-needed reality check in case we run away with the idea that the USA was a perfect creation from that point onwards (it was 100 years behind Britain in banning slavery, for example)."},{"Title":"Redcoats and Rebels: The American Revolution Through British Eyes","review":"Okay, I am ordering this book and will review it when I read it, because it is a topic I am highly fascinated by.

On one side of the people misinterpreting the book are those who think that America was WRONG and that the colonists were nothing but a bunch of ungrateful troublemakers. On the other side are those who think that America and the Revolution is being bashed within these pages.Folks, this book is the point of view of THE BRITISH LOYALISTS of that time!

It is what America lost that Hibbert so admirably chronicles.In other ways the book is highly flawed: it offers very little to presage the causes of the war; it omits whole segments of history and has very little on the war in the Southern States, and; despite the purported purpose of the book to show the English side of the war, there is little on the Tory majority or their contribution to the war, nothing on Quebec and the British use of freed slaves, and very little on how this war was viewed in the grand scheme of strategy in London, having to take into account the actions of American allies France and Spain."},{"Title":"Redcoats and Rebels: The American Revolution Through British Eyes","review":"I was profoundly disappointed by this book. I had hoped that the book would contain insight into the thinking of members the British government about the colonies and the Revolution. Instead, I was told how the Revolutionaries were a bunch of paranoids who whined about nothing in particular and who really didn't have it bad at all under British rule. Hibbert makes no attempt to understand the ideological origins of American Revolutionary thought or the historical significance of the American Revolution and Revolutionists such as Washington, Adams, Mason, and Jefferson. This is profoundly bad scholarship, and one would be far better served to read Bernard Bailyn, Gordon Wood, Pauline Maier, or Rhys Issac."},{"Title":"Redcoats and Rebels: The American Revolution Through British Eyes","review":"Christopher Hibbert's &quot;Redcoats and Rebels&quot; is a book that would probably not have been published a quarter-century ago: it takes the most sacred of all political events, the American Revolution, and shows it through the eyes of the losing side. By the time this wonderfully readable history is finished, you are not impressed by the British side: they made one dumb mistake after another. But at least now a reader can be aware of precisely why the Americans won, and why George Washington is still to be admired. He lost battle after battle after battle after battle: and yet he won the war. He kept the army together, against all odds, and with the invaluable aid of the French, put together a coup de grace that ended the British political dominion over the newly born United States. This is a book for all lovers of political and military history, and in that, a very old-fashioned book. But anybody wanting to understand the American Revolution, the single most important armed struggle in our history (and I include the Civil War), has to take into account Hibbert's book."},{"Title":"Redcoats and Rebels: The American Revolution Through British Eyes","review":"Redcoats and Rebels is a succinct history of the American Revolution as told primarily from the British perspective. Like the United States, Great Britain has lost only one major war in the last three centuries, and such a singular defeat begs for close examination. Christopher Hibbert, a renowned professional historian, provides the British perspective on the war with his typical pithy style and insights. While there is nothing radically new in this book, Hibbert succeeds in providing a narrative with great insight into the decision-making processes and senior leadership on both sides. Redcoats and Rebels is suitable for either general audiences or specialists who desire background on the British high-level conduct of the war. However, American readers may notice certain sensitivities that have not faded with time and Hibbert fails to ask the hard questions about why Britain lost its American colonies.Redcoats and Rebels consists of 25 short chapters, each covering a specific phase or episode in the war. In addition to illustrations, some simple but decent maps and a detailed bibliography, Hibbert provides an interesting appendix on the post-war careers of the major participants. Overall, the narrative is well written and flows smoothly. These pages are obviously written by a professional historian.Ultimately, Hibbert points to three reasons for the British defeat: poor leadership, the difficulty of the terrain and the tenacity of the American rebels. Hibbert is particularly scathing throughout the book in his criticism of the senior British commanders who fought the war: Howe, Clinton, Burgoyne and Cornwallis, as well as the senior political leadership in London. Although the British won battle after battle, their leaders seemed to lack the killer instinct to finish off the Americans when they had the upper hand. The fact that Howe could sit in Philadelphia and not attack Washington's tattered army only 20 miles away at Valley Forge in the winter of 1777-1778 seems almost miraculous. One British officer at the time lamented that, \\"our generals and admirals don't seem to be in earnest about this business.\\" Although Hibbert only touches on the subject of British motivation, it seems evident that most of the senior British leaders had serious doubts about the war and that a certain fatalism crept into decision-making. Hibbert's criticisms of British generals, who often seem more concerned with lavish dinners and mistresses, is not always fair since Howe and Burgoyne both demonstrated tactical competence. The second factor that determined defeat, according to Hibbert, was the rugged and expansive nature of the American terrain, which always provided the rebels with places to escape British offensives. There is no doubt that the British army in America was too small for the task; Hibbert notes that the British estimated that they needed 50-75,000 troops to subdue the rebels but never had more than 35,000 troops available at any one time. As the Americans found in Vietnam, the British could control any terrain they occupied but their forces were just too small to fight war on such a continental scale. Previous campaigns against rebels in Ireland, Scotland and England had not had to contend with such major terrain obstacles or distances. Finally, Hibbert credits the tenacity of the Americans - particularly Washington and Greene - with protracting the war until British resolve dwindled.One major area that Hibbert only skims around is the issue of strategic objectives in America. Did Britain really have a chance to achieve a military victory and if so, what strategy offered the best chances? Hibbert does hint at the British strategic dilemma when he notes Cornwallis' efforts to raise loyalist troops in the south. With limited troops, Cornwallis could either protect the loyalist areas in a defensive strategy or pursue the rebel army in an offensive strategy. Without sufficient loyalist troops, the British effort in America was probably doomed, but a strategic defense that protected loyalist areas would inevitably yield the initiative to the revels. British commanders were split on the horns of this dilemma; Howe and Clinton were more or less content to hold the loyalist base in New York, whereas the more aggressive Burgoyne and Cornwallis made (fatal) efforts to catch and destroy the rebel armies. Hibbert's narrative also exposes the essentially one-dimensional approach of British strategy in containing the rebellion; the British relied too heavily on their own professional military and under-utilized the enormous political and economic tools at their disposal. Indeed, the main factor inhibiting the rebel war effort was always lack of hard cash yet the British made only modest efforts to go after this weakness. Politically, the British might have made more concessions earlier to encourage loyalist sympathies, but their envoys were never serious about compromise.Finally, the question of war mobilization is also addressed in part by Hibbert. Fundamentally, Britain never committed the army and navy resources to achieve a decisive military victory in America, but that does not mean that these resources were lacking. Hibbert notes an interesting point about the King's dilemma in raising new army formations: enlisted manpower was cheap and readily available but the officers could draw half pay for ten years after their units were demobilized. Instead, the King relied on hiring large numbers of Hessian mercenaries in order to avoid the overhead costs associated with the enlargement of the British Army. Although the British only had to fight the Americans for the first three years of the war, large army and navy forces were retained in Great Britain in order to deter French and Spanish intervention, but this deterrent effort was a failure. Essentially, Britain opted initially to fight the war on the cheap but was forced into a gradual military escalation that kept the war going but could not win it."},{"Title":"Redcoats and Rebels: The American Revolution Through British Eyes","review":"History that reads like an adventure novel. Great stuff. Being a Canadian living in the US, and looking forward to citizenship here, I found this book to be a fascinating perspective on the Revolution. Unlike some reviewers, I did NOT come away with a pro British feeling. In fact I was rooting for the rebels, and very much feeling that, if I had lived in that era, I would have been right there with them. So, it seems would some free thinkers in Britain at the time. The personal details about the participants makes the story come alive. Stimulated by this, I will read more about this period from other points of view, as one must do with all history. But, as a way to get into the picture, I think this is hard to beat. I guess my only complaint would be that the supporting maps could have been better laid out, with more details showing where, geographically, things were happening."},{"Title":"Redcoats and Rebels: The American Revolution Through British Eyes","review":"This reviewer made an erroneous initial assumption about \\"Redcoats and Rebels\\": He thought that since RR was authored by a Brit that the final product would be a snide, avuncular, anti-American treatment of the Revolutionary War. Wrong! Nothing could be further from the truth. Author Hibbert is far tougher on his fellow countrymen than on the American colonists. With the author's able retrospect, one could almost state that the British effort was doomed from the start. Among the factors burdening the British Army were the following: >Uncertain military leadership made worse by some truly surprising infighting. >Difficulty raising a sufficient number of troops to fight a foreign war in a large, distant colony > Very poor communication among the commanders (John Burgoyne, William Howe, Henry Clinton) once they encamped in America > The mistaken impression that many American Loyalists would rally under the Union Jack. Relatively few did. > What this reviewer would term concentration on the \\"good life\\". General Burgoyne took 30 carts (!) of personal goods on his fateful trek to Saratoga. And during the fateful Winter of 1777-1778, General Howe remained closeted in the comforts of Philadelphia-with his mistress! Not 30 miles away, Washington's men were enduring the cruel season at Valley Forge. Why didn't Howe attack? > The Brits allowed themselves to be trapped in a war of attrition in which they won most battles but were sucked dry. >Lukewarm support for and even opposition to the war effort in Parliament. Author Hibbert lays bare all of these factors squarely for the reader to absorb. The author has little use for the squabbling, halting British leadership; only Charles Cornwallis receives his due. Yet Cornwallis was hung out to dry by his boss, General Clinton, to be trapped on that peninsula on the York River: \\"Cornwallis surrenders at Yorktown\\". A review of R&R would not be complete without due mention to the MAPS! Most military works treat such as historical stepchildren; here they are quite useful, placed strategically throughout the text. Also, poignant quotes head each chapter. The most remarkable is from American General Nathanael Green: \\"We fight, get beat, rise and fight again\\". If the author truly believes, as he seems to, that England lost the War as much as the Americans won it, that is fair enough for this reviewer. R&R is highly rated historical reading for anyone seeking a fresh view on the Revolutionary War."},{"Title":"Redcoats and Rebels: The American Revolution Through British Eyes","review":"Redcoats and Rebels by Christopher Hibbert is an outstanding book on the American Revolution. The book is written through the British point of view. One interesting thing about he the book is that Hibbert is not all that glowing in his description of the British generals. Although he is British, Hibbert often speaks of how the men wished they had a leader that would get things done as Washington did. He describes the battles in a clear and interesting way. One part I liked was when he relates the shock that the British had in April of 1775. He tells of how the men were met with fire from the Patriots for the first time.\\"We were fired at from all sides, but mostly from the rear,\\" states one officer. One thing that is often brought up is that all the Patriots were for the longest time was a mob of farmers, and peasants. In a since this is true, yet they were just as skilled in war fair as the British, if not more. The American Revolution has always had a great appeal to me. This book is great for any one who is interested in American history, or one who just enjoys a well written book."},{"Title":"Redcoats and Rebels: The American Revolution Through British Eyes","review":"This book is an excellent read for anyone interested in a different viewpoint of the war. While other related material describes the British actions in a few sentences, this book offers more detailed explanations.The book reinforces the drastic mistakes that the British made during the war, providing the reader with a more thorough understanding of the reasons for them. One thing the book made me realize was that even with these mistakes, there is little question that America was destined for independence. As the war progressed, the British realized that there were not as many Loyalists as initially thought and the rebellious spirit was very much alive.I do agree with the other reviewer who criticized the maps. It would have been helpful to see a little more detail. Also, the introductory biographies for the British characters could have been shortened."},{"Title":"Redcoats and Rebels: The American Revolution Through British Eyes","review":"Christopher Hibbert, in his book Redcoats & Rebels, has given us a perspective not generally seen in American history - the American Revolution through British eyes, and what a picture it is!I found this book to be engrossing and written in a style unlike some history books - it reads more like a novel than a \\"textbook\\". The book is written from the British perspective, but I did not find it to display any preference for the British or the Americans. Instead, I found the book to be simply an accounting of the events during the revolutionary period.Hibbert's research is outstanding, and his writing style is, in my opinion, fantastic. I'm looking forward to reading other books by this same author.I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn about the American Revolution or anyone who wants to see a perspective not usually seen here in America about the war."},{"Title":"Redcoats and Rebels: The American Revolution Through British Eyes","review":"I liked this book so much I bought it three times over the past few years - one for myself, one for a friend, and a third to replace the first one after it was lost.The book is written from the perspective of a British historian, but it is remarkably balanced - much more so than most American books on the subject. In fact, the primary advantage of the book is that it doesn't fall into the trap of diefying George Washington and the founding fathers, thereby allowing a balanced approach to many issues. It gives considerable time to both the northern campaign in the Hudson Valley(ending in Saratoga and the southern campaign (starting in Charleston and ending in Yorktown), not just focusing on Washington's army and the \\"Valley Forge\\" experience.The book shows the parallels between the British experience in American and the American's experience in Vietnam. Like the Americans in Vietnam, the British received most of their intellegence and perspective from the appointed governors or the loyalists who lived in the cities. They persuaded the British government that most Americans were loyal to Britain, but they needed the British Army's protection from the few rebels who terrorized the remainder. \\"Protect us from the rebels,\\" they argued, \\"and most Americans would be free to show their support for the Crown\\". As Cornwallis found in his expeditions from Charleston, once the British departed from the loyalist enclaves in the occupied cities they found the population to be very hostile. The various reasons for that hostility shows that the British war for the \\"hearts and minds\\" of Americans was lost before the first shots had been fired at Lexington and Concord, and had little to do with taxes.(1) The British had expected frontiersmen to be grateful for the protection the British army provided from Indian attacks. The opposite was true. British efforts to encourage Indians to attack rebellious settlers backfired on them. The governor of Virginia's proclamation to that effect delivered that conservative colony firmly into the rebel hands, and sent him fleeing to the safety of a British warship.(2) The further inland the British ventured from the coast, the more the British ran into Scottish and Irish immigrants (or their close descendants) who had either been kicked out of their homeland or fled due to their anti-British loyalties. Many of these settlers hated the British and were more than happy to support independence.(3) Finally, economics played a part. Many left Britain to escape its oppresive class system and poverty of the lower classes. They endured bondage as endentured servants to pay for passage, and then hardship as they cleared the forests to build farms, houses, and barns, and defend them against attacks by Indians and outlaws. Yet huge areas of America were subject to the Crown's land grants to British nobility, who argued that the settlers should be paying rent for living on the land. Those settlers were hardly willing to support a regime which believed they should be paying rent to some rich absentee landlord in England for land made profitable by the sweat of their own brow.(4) The arrogant and condescending manner of British governors, officers, and enlisted ranks directed toward the Colonists made them many more enemies in America than official British policies ever did.If there were any one book I would recommend with respect to the American Revolution, this is it."},{"Title":"Redcoats and Rebels: The American Revolution Through British Eyes","review":"Military libraries strong in early American military history will love this survey, based on a range of sources that provide character sketches and eyewitness accounts of the War of American Independence.

I will just add that what I really appreciated was Hibbert's integration of fairly substantial primary sources. The lengthy quotations from letters and personal correspondence who fought for the British were excellent. I also enjoyed Hibbert's depictions of Clinton's rather fragile state of mind and his inability to get along with any of his officers, especially Howe and later Cornwallis.The pacing of the chapters was excellent for reading and putting down. There no chapters that seemed to go on forever. It read more like a series of connected essays arranged chronologically. This was a nice break from standard historical writing.Finally, the book overall was great to read and offered a refreshing take on a topic that has an obscene amount of scholarship.

The chapters are organized as short stories. These stories and pictures take the reader into the world that surrounds Warren Buffett, Charlie Munger, family, friends, fans, and the Berkshire Hathaway subsidiary companies. The book is a solid account of Warren Buffett's and Berkshire's history. Furthermore, it includes many of the people that have been affected by this growing phenomenon called Berkshire Hathaway.The author presents the story with a good sense of humor and he captures the spirit of fun each of these people bring to the annual meetings. I almost fell off my chair after seeing page 1464. This biography of investor Warren Buffett includes 1,500 pages and 750 photographs. It is a real valuable addition to anyone's library, and it is offered at a bargain price, relative to its intrinsic value. For those new to the study of the Buffett-Munger investment phenomenon, this book is a &quot;must have&quot; to your collection. The Compounding Success of the Graham-Dodd-Buffett-Munger investment ideas are conguent with ideas presented in the OPV book. Forget the Efficient Market Hypothesis! In an old school paper entitled the &quot;Compounding Success Model&quot;, found somewhere on a web search, I had concluded that 10 major factors contributed to the Compounding Success of the Graham-Dodd-Buffett-Munger investment approach:1. Rational and thorough business analysis, with keen emotional intellects that promote ethical information exchange.2. Wide experience with analyzing and managing numerous different businesses.3. Charlie Munger's Role as (a.)&quot;Devils-Advocate&quot; (Munger as therapist/analyst of investment decisions) and (b.) Munger's role in encouraging further limiting the portfolio towards &quot;wonderful businesses.&quot;4. Leverage via a Low Cost of Capital from Insurance Operations5. Disciplined Tracking of Understandable Businesses6. Analysis of Strategic and Sustainable Competitive Advantages of Industries and Businesses. Warren Buffett has a Masters in Economics from Columbia University and Charlie Munger has a Law degree from Harvard University. Both have a variety of operational business experiences.7. Trustworthy First-Class Managements with proven track records.8. Ben Graham's Mr. Market and search for the Margin of Safety. The Margin of Safety is the bargain obtained when purchasing at a market price below the intrinsic value estimation. Graham and Dodd taught: &quot;An investment operation is one which, upon thorough analysis, promises safety of principal and a satisfactory return.&quot;9. Satisfaction: Buffett stated: &quot;Though &quot;working&quot; means nothing to me financially, I love doing it at Berkshire for some simple reasons: It gives me a sense of achievement, a freedom to act as I see fit and an opportunity to interact daily with people I like and trust.&quot;10. Learning from Practice, Mistakes, and Experiences: &quot;After many years of buying and supervising a great variety of businesses, Charlie and I have not learned how to solve difficult business problems. What we have learned is to avoid them.&quot;Andy's book gives you a more comprehensive view of the human interactions that make these successes possible. I also got a big kick of Andy including my poem on page 1034. This book gives a very good account of Buffett's business and investing evolution. Any student of &quot;investment decision making&quot; should review this work. I learned more about this evolution by reading an earlier OPV edition. It described the growth from Benjamin Graham's classical &quot;Value Investing&quot; to the Buffett-Munger &quot;wonderful business&quot; purchases.Of Permanent Value: The Story Of Warren Buffett is a big book that will appeal to fans of financial wizard Warren Buffett. It explores how Buffett began from scratch to form a business empire. It includes in-depth examinations of business philosophy while providing a fun and lively read.

One is that this book is probably only suitable for Warren Buffett fanatics/fans. For general investors interested about Berkshire Hathaway or how Warren Buffett invest, this is probably not the best book to read (as it has so much more info. i.e. more than 1000 pages). Second is that I have read this book more than once and I still don't know how the book is organized (the chapters aren't following chronological order, alphabetical nor topical order), therefore it is quite confusing to read as you progress from one chapter to another. Only after you read enough chapter (or completed the book) then you can put it all in the big picture in your head (from Warren's childhood till his current Berkshire days). Nonetheless, kudos to Andrew Kilpatrick for putting this book together. Moreover, once you know the limitation, this book is easily considered the best book about Warren Buffett in my opinion.Now about the content of the book. You will learn a lot about Warren Buffett and his life, and not only investing topic (investing decisions that he made throughout his career) but his life principles, family, and business in general as well. You will learn about his first job delivering papers when he was 13 (he filed income tax and deducted the bike as business cost), and how he build his first business (pinball machine business), created Buffett partnership, break it up (liquidate), acquire berkshire mills, creating Berkshire Hathaway as investment vehicle, and many other great investment decision/story that he made (Geico, See's Candies, Dairy Queen, General Re, Coca Cola, Salomon, Washington Post, Gillette etc)Buffett concrete rules for investing are:1. Never lose money2. Never forget rule #1I know it's easier said (what he say above about to never lose money) than done based on my 10 years of invesitng experience , but then again I'm no Warren Buffett.In my opinion, here are the 5 strategy/skills that Warren Buffett uses (Mr. Buffett, please correct me if I'm wrong):1. Intrinsic Value2. Margin of Safety3. Temperament (discipline and understanding Mr.Market)4. Circle of Competence (knowing what your circle of competence)5. Common Sense (which I think is the most important factor and encapsulate everything about Warren Buffett.)You will learn that Warren is very good with numbers (calculating in his head) and memorizing so many facts and numbers. You will also learn that Warren is a man with a very good sense of humor.There are so many things/chapters that I like on this book. Let me try to mention two of my favorite sections.One is when Warren need to make a decision who would run Salomon ($150B institution with 8000 employees) within 2 days during their first crisis. There are 12 top-level managers that he interviewed. \\"This was the most important hire of my life\\", said Warren to the Columbia business students. The chapter explain his thought process of this candidate selection in detail. Warren mentioned that the good news (for the students and the candidate) is that he didn't ask what their grades were (laughter). Warren also said, \\"Somebody once said that in looking for people to hire, you look for three qualities: integrity, intelligence and energy. and if they don't have the first, the other two will kill you. if you think about it, it's true, if you hire somebody without integrity, you want them to be dumb and lazy\\" (laughter). And he conclude the topic with this statement which I think is very powerful: \\"Pick the kind of person to work for you that you want to marry your son or daughter. You won't go wrong\\". By the way, he picked Deryck Maughan by the way for his integrity.Another chapter that I really like is how Warren put the audience (of more than 2000 people) through Business School in an electrifying two minutes (The chapter about \\"Generics\\"). See how Warren answer the question of \\"Will developments in the generic brand area hurt coca-cola?\\" which is a very important questions. I'll try not to spill too much and take the joy of reading this chapter yourself but he basically explains in a nutshell (with all the details and numbers) how business and competition works (and using several other example like Gilette, Marlboro, Sam Cola etc) and how he convinced the audience (and me as a reader) that coca cola is considered immune to generics. He explains how one can save $500 for smoking generic brand (vs Marlboro) which is a lot of money. While a man will probably will only save $11 per year by not using Gilette Sensor and probably leave band-aids on his face and an uncomfotable experience for opting for generics/lower quality blades. And for coca cola, the net profit margin is only 1 cents per serving (can) while a lot of the ingredients cost (such as the aluminium close to 6 cents a can, sugar 1.3 ounce per can or 1.75 cents etc) the same regardless for coke or other cola company.I'll stop here before it's getting too long. In summary, If you are a Warren Buffett fans, then this book is for you. If you are uncertain, you can get other books first (potentially less thick book), like \\"Warren Buffet Way\\" or maybe \\"Buffettology\\", and if you like them (Warren) or want to know more about Warren then get this book. I personally don't like it in the beginning but as time goes by (and after I re-read the book/chapters), I changed my mind, this book is a masterpiece.As a Berkshire shareholder, I want to encourage all berkshire shareholders (and potential/future shareholders) to read this book to know more about the person in charge of your berkshire investment. I also want to encourage all shareholders to go to the annual shareholder meeting while Mr. Buffett is still in charge.Last but not least, if I have to sum this book up in a word or two, I would use the word \\"WISDOM\\" to describe this book, though I have a strong feeling that Warren will disagree with me and think that the more suitable phrase is \\"COMMON SENSE\\"Happy Investing!Sidarta Tanu"},{"Title":"Of Permanent Value: The Story of Warren Buffett/More in '04, California Edition","review":"Warren Buffett, the American Icon, is captured beautifully in these 1500some pages. The book is a haphazard collection of notes, annecdotes, rumors and stories of the Oracle himself. It contains much of the traditional folk wisdom of the man, as well as much of the lore you probably haven't heard yet. At 1500 pages, there's something for everyone.The book is a must for any member of the cult of Warren."},{"Title":"Of Permanent Value: The Story of Warren Buffett/More in '04, California Edition","review":"I bought an earlier edition of this book thinking it would be a regular biography of Warren Buffett. Instead, it's a strange, very lengthy collection of information about him. The writer rambles and digresses a LOT. But it's not a bad book, for what it is, and you can pick up some investing info amid all the trivia. Just don't expect an ordinary biography."},{"Title":"A Defense of Abortion (Cambridge Studies in Philosophy and Public Policy)","review":"The philosophical issue of abortion has been plagued with the difficulty of situating itself in a way whereby it can be successfully discussed. Often, proponents from a rights-based platform do battle against opponents from a moral-wrong platform and no claims are held in common. Thus, discussions in the literature tend to go past one another making the abortion issue nearly impossible to navigate. Boonin's book begins with a chapter where this problem is addressed and managed, at least to a degree whereby the dozens of arguments concerning abortion can be classified or organized in a logical sequence. He then proceeds to dismiss all arguments against abortion using claims the opponent of abortion accepts.Boonin uses the Rawlsian approach of reflective equilibrium in his analysis of the abortion issue. Chapters 2-4 concern &quot;rights-based&quot; arguments and the final chapter addresses &quot;non-rights&quot; based arguments. This text is written in true analytic form where non-obvious distinctions are noted and used to clarify weaknesses in all arguments which claim abortion is wrong or impermissible. What Boonin does well in the process is to provide a thorough literature review of all claims made about abortion over the last thirty years.An overall highlight of this text includes Boonin's ability to discuss weaknesses in arguments by analogy. For example, the now classic &quot;violinist analogy&quot; set forth by J. Thomson, and tacit consent arguments. If you are interested in the topics of arguments by analaogy in general, you will get a kick about of this part of the text! This is a very readable text for one with an intermediate to advanced background in philosophical argument and analysis."},{"Title":"A Defense of Abortion (Cambridge Studies in Philosophy and Public Policy)","review":"I used this book as a way to better structure arguments for debate on abortion. It took the arguments I had, discounted them, and gave me better ones.A background in informal logic and philosophy will certainly be helpful to the reader here. While this book is really the most comprehensive of its kind, it is not a simple read. I had to take notes just to understand some of the complexities within arguments. Fortunately, I was also able to read this with a friend, which made dense parts of the book easier.The author is careful in framing the debate and stresses arguing on an opponent's own terms. The author explains the contrast between morally criticizable and morally permissible. Moral relevance is also an essential idea. Further, the author establishes a moraly relevant criterion by brain development that may act as a cutoff point late in pregnancy so that it is still morally impermissible to kill an infant. I recommend previewing the table of contents to get a flavor of argument structure and the arguments covered. I have not encountered a topic that was not covered in the book except for maybe ageism. However, after reading this book my reasoning was developed enough to where I practically laid out a proof as to what ageism was and was not and why it was not a valid objection.I think this book may have been a little stronger had it looked at more than fetal rights in isolation, but rather also mention that what the question being asked is does the fetus's right to life outweigh the mother's right to her body and vice-versa. Fetal rights arguments are thoroughly explained as well as non-rights based arguments. This book has also been helpful in detailing how the logic works in analogies and why the weirdness objection is not valid. The author also takes apart the violinist analogy and explains why it is poor. Because of this book, even though I am pro-choice since I think it has a stronger argument, I can argue strongly on either side.Even if you are pro-choice, you should make sure you are pro-choice for logical reasons. I know many pro-choice people that couldn't answer standard pro-life objections. If you are pro-life, this book will challenge all your arguments and at least make you think of the issue differently. I recommend this to anyone who takes a stance on the issue and definitely anyone interested in philosophy, informal logic, and debate."},{"Title":"A Defense of Abortion (Cambridge Studies in Philosophy and Public Policy)","review":"There are already a couple of good reviews to this book, so I will only add that it is extremely easy to follow and in order to savour it one only needs to be a curious layperson.

I just did. As I got to the last chapter, I'd read just a few pages each day, savoring every word.\\"The Outlaw Years\\" by Robert M. Coates is the story of four different bands of \\"land pirates\\" who stalked the Natchez Trace from 1800-1835 - the Harpe, Hare, Mason, and Murrell gangs. It is the most suspense-filled, eye-opening, thrill ride I've been on in years. The Harpe brothers could be called America's first serial killers ... fascinating and a bit frightening at times.I picked up the book by chance at a shop in Natchez during the Christmas holidays. The cover is not eye-catching (what's that old saying about a book and its cover), but the subject seemed interesting. It's a reprint of a book first published in 1930, so it is not \\"politically correct\\" by any stretch of the imagination. If you're easily offended by rough language, don't bother.But if you want to know how hard life was back in the \\"good ol' days\\" - or if you think that today's political corruption would shock our high-minded ancestors - give this book a try.

George Soule seems to think you can, but not with anything thought up till now. Socialism, Communism, Distributivism, Anarchism and other systems all seem to have great ideas, but all have flaws. George Soule examines the post-war America (World War One), what works, what doesn't, both during war and peace, and in the end says that a planned economy can work, but the goals of business, methods used to decide what is produced and our very ideas on what is possible have to be changed.Lots of insight on how governments work, how business works and why people do what they do.

Johnson's knack for storytelling and colloquial style transports the reader straight to the harsh brushland of Civil War-era Texas. Unlike many modern western authors, Johnson has chosen not to blur the line between good and bad, creating the most dispicable of villains in Santiago and effecting sympathy for the story's hero Lance Morgan. But these characters, while morally black and white through most of the story, still manage to develop throughout. The story's intriguing plot and colorful characters make Brasada hard to put down and a must for fans of classic Western novels."},{"Title":"Brasada","review":"The characters are as vivid as those in Lonesome Dove.

Mr. Johnson has created a Civil War Drama that readers of the Western genre will thoroughly enjoy. It is cleverly constructed with full-dimensional characters and events that will linger long after the last page. A great read!"},{"Title":"Brasada","review":"From the back cover of the novel: &quot;The author knows firsthand the locale of this action-packed and fast-paced story. He owned and operated a cattle and horse ranch in the Texa brushland wilderness,in the land known as la brasada . . . . the ranch bordered the Rio Grande for nine miles . . . During the Civil War, wagons loaded with cotton left deep ruts while traveling across the ranch into Mexico. The tracks are visible to this day.&quot;From these roots comes Brasada by Don Johnson, a western novel that is interwoven with some fascinating Civil War History - in particular, how the South financed the War by smuggling its cotton into Mexico and getting paid in gold.This is a real page-turner that has everything a fan of Westerns and Civil War Novels could ask for, and then some. Just a great introduction to the Western genre for new readers. I strongly recommend it for anyone who likes to read good fiction.Jerry Patterson, thebuffalokid@aol.com"},{"Title":"A history of the expedition to Jerusalem, 1095-1127","review":"The History of the Expedition to Jerusalem, 1095-1127 by Fulcher of Chartres is one of the key sources for the First Crusade and the early history of the Crusader states up to 1127. While many contemporaries wrote histories of the First Crusade, only a few, such as Fulcher, also told of the complex and intriguing events that followed.While 'The First Crusade: \\"The Chronicle of Fulcher of Chartres\\" and Other Source Materials (The Middle Ages Series)' by Edward Peters is a useful sourcebook for the First Crusade, he only translates Fulcher's history until 1100, soon after the end of the First Crusade. Frances Ryan's translation allows us to read the rest of Fulcher's story, a story of battles, pragmatic politics, genuine piety and dissension in a distant land.I would have given 5 stars except my copy had handwritten editorial comments in the section dealing with the Council of Clermont. I do not know if these are in all copies. While they are irritating, it is still possible to read the printed text beneath.

Poor editing, chaotic organization of chapters and (maybe in an intent of making the book more enjoyable) a fixation in Dr. Mastria's story instead of his discovery make of it a dull reading. The writing is very confusing. You have to read the book a few times to find the very simple things he wants to say. He seems mistified for his own discovery and its importance, which is kind of anoying.

He has a very different approach on anxiety than anyone else. The basic of his method is to only focus on the five sense. Only worry about the things that you can focus on and sense right now, don't worry about those bills that are going to come in, don't worry about a bad situation before it ever happens(even if it might not happen), and so on. He believe in using your intelligence in-order to solve any and all problems.Most of the other students disproved of his methods, and thought it was a hoax. In all honesty; the lack of intelligence and understanding would be the reason. I understand that not everyone likes only one approach to something, and I talked to him about it.

I have done astrology consultations since 1968 - and have taught the Vedic System all over the world. With a library holding over 1000 books on Vedic Astrology and Vastu Shastra, many from India, and some from the West -- Bill Levacy's beginners guide is the missing link that I have been waiting for as a textbook for my students.It is written for a lay audience -- but even an experienced astrologer (Western or Eastern) will find gems of wisdom in this book.My students are raving about &quot;Beneath a Vedic Sky&quot; and are thrilled to finally have a textbook that simply defines yogas and nakshatras in clear, concise English.The book has the added bonus of an included CD where you can actually calculate your own vedic chart and that of your friends and family.Another bonus of this great book is the inclusion on the audio CD of the correct pronunciation of sanskrit astrology terms. You can learn without actually going to India or finding a local teacher.I recommend this book without question or hesitation. I use it as a text book in my classes. Sincerely, Christina Collins Hill, J.Ph.D., Jyotish Kovid, Jyotish Vachaspati, Academy for Vedic Studies, Boulder, Colorado, USA"},{"Title":"Beneath A Vedic Sky","review":"William Levacy's _Beneath A Vedic Sky_ is still the book I recommend most often (neck and neck for me with Ernst Wilhelm's _Vault of the Heavens_, another of my favorites) to just about anyone who expresses interest in Jyotish (Vedic Astrology).Why is this something I both praise to others so readily and reach for myself on a regular basis? For starters, Levacy successfully distills the marrow of Indian astrology -- an enduring tradition rooted in both a sacred worldview and hard-nosed pragmatic approaches to living -- and his book maintains both the spiritual and down-to-earth dimensions that comprise the Indian legacy (quite distinct from the dumb reductionism that typecasts Indians as otherworldly people).Levacy's one volume introduction provides all of the basics that set Jyotish practice apart as one of the most immediately useful predictive systems -- and then pushes further to set the foundations of intermediate study. For instance, not all of the current Vedic astrology primers have information on the nakshatras (lunar mansions) - arguably the matrix of nuances or signature component of the tradition that makes Jyotish Jyotish. By contrast, there is an informative 25-page chapter on the nakshatras here. Also, Levacy's excellent section on two-planet yogas (what we might call archetypal \\"cocktails\\") reveal more clearly than any other book in English of which I'm aware how deceptively simple and critical such \\"basic\\" combinations are. (If you want to take a stab at an even broader menu of arrangements of grahas [planets], pick up Wilhelm's _Core Yogas_. Levacy's deep minimalism and the detailed erudition of Wilhelm's book are not at all at odds with each other in my view, but rather perfect complements.) The \\"tell-it-like-it-is\\" approach here seems to derive from a few segments of Levacy's background: his years of practice as a working astrologer, his graduate studies in creative intelligence and education, and his real-world experience in the aerospace industry. This diverse backdrop likely has prepared him to teach the rudiments so that they'll stick, setting the stage without mystification for the student's further pursuits.Levacy indeed imparts an immediacy and refreshing bottom line as to what makes up the most useful set of meanings the planetary cast of characters can embody. The sections on planets in signs, planets in houses, and what I sometimes term the \\"applied numerology\\" of planetary rulerships are all excellent for the same reason -- we get to see the personality of Jyotish's various characters, settings and plots via an exposition that is clear and concise yet does not skimp on subtlety or in the way it sets priorities.The book's several chapters beyond those described above -- on vargas (divisional or harmonic charts); synthesizing a chart's components; elementary prediction; gochara (transits); traditional Indian _kuta_ analysis (relationship inquiry or synastry); muhurta (electional astrology); Indian remedial measures to address challenges; the Vedic sister disciplines of Ayurveda (medicine) and Vastu (geomancy); Levacy's detailed recommendations for additional studies; and a sturdy glossary and index -- all contain much that is tangible and memorable. Gayatri Devi Vasudev, Levacy's accomplished senior colleague in Vedic astrology and the daughter of India's grand ambassador of Jyotish, B.V. Raman, writes enthusiastically in her preface to the book that she anticipates future volumes from Levacy on various aspects of the field. Even Levacy's briefer chapters serve to nudge the reflective reader forward and prompt this sort of happy anticipation.I'm an author and life coach who uses Jyotish as a regular tool. This book has been extremely helpful in my work.To sum up, do yourself a favor and begin here (and/or with _Vault of the Heavens_; I find no conflict in using both.) Once you have more or less established your fingerholds, do look at Hart deFouw's and Robert Svoboda's tremendous resource _Light on Life_ -- though I don't suggest you start there! My own mentor Sat Siri Khalsa's forthcoming _Subtle Astrology_ (look for it in 2004 or so) will likewise serve as another way to grow and build upon what you have begun using a book like Levacy's as your home base.ONE FINAL NOTE: As you'll see in some of the other reviews posted here, Levacy's book is really a learning *kit* or package for beginners in that it contains a CD with a demo of reliable and interesting Vedic Astrology software. Since the application allows you to generate new charts, this inclusion along with the great contents of the book should settle the matter of whether you should invest in this title. For clarification, the CD is a limited version (sans ability to save or print) of an excellent program called Goravani Jyotish (GJ) by contemporary Vedic \\"blacksmith\\" Das Goravani -- still one of the best on the market. This demo will work with all pre-2001 mainstream operating systems (PC or Mac) - though note Windows XP users won't have luck, and I'm not sure about current Mac OS's -- such users will have to go to Goravani's site (www.goravani.com) and download a still decent but more limited demo.I wanted to redress the omission of Das Goravani's name in the other reviews, as his software was indispensable in the more intensive periods of my own early studies (and I still use GJ).
