Walt Whitman is perhaps the finest American poet ever as well as the most quintessentially American poet. His poetry never dates itself. It is as contemporary as if he just wrote it last week. Walt Whitman's poems overflow with life and energy, pulsate with excitement, and contain deep though simply-told truths that rival those of any wise man in history. Much maligned during life and after for the eroticism of his writing, he never let his inhibitions hold back his writing and thus it sparkles with honesty. Walt Whitman was also a great patriot, who loved America in a way modern Americans would do well to emulate. He sought it out on its own terms and recorded what he saw in his poetry. His war poems, written during the American Civil War, are some of the best war poems existing in literature. Whitman knew his subject, having spent much time caring for the wounded soldiers in the hospitals and visiting battlefields. His poems create vivid pictures, richly textured, as real as you read them as if you were seeing the scene yourself. And the dialog he carries on with the reader makes the reader feel that Whitman, if he were still alive, would like nothing more than to sit down and discuss life. He is one of the few poets who manages to establish a rapport with his reader, to anticipate his reader's reactions and talk to each one through the poem. Walt Whitman should be read by any and every literate American. 'Leaves of Grass' will change anyone who dares to read it."},{"Title":"Leaves of Grass","review":"The best way to appreciate Whitman is to read him aloud as you walk down a street or the country side.You'd feel electricity stirring within you and all else would change too.Even the inanimate would seeth with life and vitality amidst the gentle choreography of nature.Thats what happens to me when I read &quot;The Song Of the Open Road&quot;.It's amazing that Whitman could capture the deep inherent things we feel inside,things that stir us inside out and yet find it difficult to express.A timeless clasic that will stir people from generation to generation.Nothing like it."},{"Title":"Leaves of Grass","review":"Do yourself a favor and buy this book. As soon as you do open it and read O Captain, My Captain. Try to feel the emotions and the meaning behind this poem and finally read the rest of the poems. They are all pure gold.Buy this book and let yourself get caught up in it."},{"Title":"Leaves of Grass","review":"Walt Whitman is the father of free verse and his main work, Leaves of Grass, is perhaps one of the greatest works by an American poet ever written.He was born on Long Island and grew up in Brooklyn. Being a native of Brooklyn myself I feel a deep connection to him. When I read his work I am instantly transported into his universe, a universe which is the domain of every man. For Walt Whitman was possibly the greatest democrat who ever lived.In his great poem, Song of Myself, his opening lines are: &quot;I celebrate myself, and what I assume you shall assume, for every atom belonging to me as good belongs to you.&quot; This is not only good old American horse sense, it's good science. For everything comes forth from that great source of life the sun, and none can be better for it, only different.Walt was a born visionary. And I surmise that he must have had quite a few mystical experiences before he set out to write his great poems. You can really get a sense of his mystical connection when you read poems like When I Heard The Learned Astronomer or even in Song of Myself when he proclaims: &quot;There was never any more inception than there is now, nor any more youth or age than there is now; and will never be any more perfection than there is now, nor any more heaven or hell than there is now.&quot; Notice the emphasis on the word now. Mystics through the ages have said that God is beyond time, that God is the eternal presence, and that he exists in a timeless eternity sometimes referred to as the eternal now. I believe that's what Walt Whitman is telling us.I could go on and on singing the praises of Walt Whitman. His work is inexhaustable and profound and wise beyond measure. But there are innumerable books written about him. However, I believe to catch the essence of the man you have to read his poems. And if you let him in he will lead you to yourself and you will see the world through fresh eyes .... and you will see how the perennial grass covers only the outer layer of this our miraculous universe."},{"Title":"Leaves of Grass","review":"I just love it...helps me to day-dream and think about love, friends, freedom.with a hot cup of whatever you like, with a fire in the fireplace and you can give you away."},{"Title":"Leaves of Grass","review":"Excellent text and excellent service.I hate that they force us to write these reviews.I hate that they force us to write these reviews."},{"Title":"Leaves of Grass","review":"It's the kind of book to read when you wish to relax and contemplate life, your place in the world, and get over yourself.

Then I had an English teacher that introduced me to what I can only characterize as adult poetry. No more, Joyce Kilmer. Here was something that challenged me intellectually. High on the list of my favorites was Whitman and \\"Leaves of Grass\\".Now, in my 50's I decided to see if I would bring away something different, so I revisited this classic. I can testify that there is much still there; although my tastes in poetry have matured quite a bit. I don't find Whitman quite as \\"shocking\\" in light of the social changes that I've seen since my youth.Still, there is a certain nostalgia that makes Whitman eminantly readable. I imagine that if IBM's Watson composed poetry, it would be a lot like this in form and content.

The Kindle edition is in fact Whitman's original, short edition of \\"Leaves of Grass.\\" The mass market paperback edition is the Deathbed Edition, much longer but marred by the bowdlerization that occurred as the Good Gay Poet morphed into the Good Gray Poet. Whitman did go on to write a few great poems, most notably \\"When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloomed\\" and \\"Out of the Cradle Endlessly Rocking,\\" but if you want to read the rowdy, raunchy Whitman, you want \\"Leaves of Grass: The First Edition.\\""},{"Title":"Leaves of Grass","review":"Read this marvelous book of poetry only if you want to fall in love with the written word.

The typesetting is not ideal. The introduction is fine, but line-breaks are placed somewhat arbitrarily in the text of the poem, so that it is necessary to play with the font size and/or words per line to get satisfactory formatting. It is also a shame that the engraving of Whitman included in the first edition of the book is not reproduced.

He takes what seems like existential ramblings, and turns them into beautiful and self-reflective pieces of art. This is not just poetry, it's literally a thesis on life, a philosophical treasure, a song that celebrates being alive, a picture depicting the cycles of life, an ode to the SOUL - simple thoughts, taken to extraordinary levels by an extraordinary man.Although to some, the poems may be too open-ended, long, tedious or verbose to appear enjoyable - but, when you lay bare the meaning behind Whitman's words, you cannot help but feel empowered, aware, introspective, a believer in life, the lover of a human body, and a worshiper of the human soul.

This is the original 1855 version. Whitman added to the collection throughout his life, ending up with an overstuffed and very uneven \\"deathbed\\" version, which is better known. There are some good poems in it which aren't in the original, such as When Lilacs Last in the Door-yard Bloom'd, but there's a lot of pretty weak stuff, too. The 1855 has a small number of pretty consistently excellent poems which are highly original and loosely but definitely connected. Reading it is a very different experience from wading through the bloated, inconsistent final version - there's something Whitmanesque (i.e., at it's best) about the original collection as a unit. Malcolm Cowley's introduction is also a bit wild and wooly (written in the late 60s or early 70s), but interesting and enlightening."},{"Title":"Leaves of Grass","review":"I had tried to find this item for quite sometime.

The characterization is great in both Bradford books; the plotting is excellent; the penetrating insights into a New Mexico forever in transition between a colorful past, chaotic present and incomprehensible future are all conveyed here.Whether the reader wishes to know New Mexico or simply to spend the evening in smiles and laughs, Bradford will provide."},{"Title":"Red Sky at Morning (Perennial Classics (Prebound))","review":"This is a wondrous short novel.

It is about a boy name Josh, who has been raised in the ways of Mobile, Alabama. His father, Frank Arnold is a wealthy ship builder, who gets his volunteer commission in the U.S navy. Frank decides to move his wife and 17-year-old josh to the family summerhouse in Corazon Sagrado, in the high mountains of New Mexico. Mrs. Arnold finds it hard to get by living in a highly populated Hispanic village. Josh on the other hand becomes a part of the Hispanic community. Josh goes to school at Helen De Crispin where he found many new friends and he is fascinated with the culture. The book talks about the people who come and change the life of josh, the people who influenced his progress to maturity. In New Mexico is where josh finds himself and where he finally understands the meaning of responsibility and love.This book really brings you back to the good old times, the times when we were curious about everything. Josh doesn't fit in much with the community, but after no time he shows interest and curiosity in his summerhouse. The village, the setting, and the people help him to find himself and find maturity. By the end of the book he is totally different from what he was when he just came to the village. This book should be read especially because people and teenagers especially can relate to it. A lot of people are going through life changing period and many teenagers can relate to this book. It can bring the older people back to their young and curiosity age.

I just purchased it again to give to my 13 year old daughter."},{"Title":"Red Sky at Morning (Perennial Classics (Prebound))","review":"My father read to me a passage from RED SKY AT MORNING when I was eleven. He was trying to get me interested in reading the book for myself and chose one of the more memorable scenes. I remember reading it and getting partway into the book and giving up. I just found nothing interesting to the story.When I turned eighteen, I recalled the book my father told me about many years prior, and picked it up again. What a difference a few years made.I've literally spent a year getting intimate with this novel. Memorizing every passage, and character development. It's a rare American novel that has very few equal. Many people compare RED SKY AT MORNING with J.D. Salinger's CATCHER IN THE RYE. Both are classic works of literature, and have a very honest look at adolescents, but that's where their similarities end. RED SKY AT MORNING is also a rich look in the life of not just one character, but an entire town as diverse as we are. We grow along-side with those from the small town called Corazon, Sagrado.Frank Arnold decides to move his family from MOBILE, ALABAMA to a small town in New Mexico where Joshua (our Narrator) spends his Senior year of High School.RED SKY AT MORNING can be seen as a coming of age story; but it's very much a coming of understanding story as well. The Arnolds came from a mostly White upper class background, where they were the Majority, but by moving to this small town, they are turned into the Minority overnight. Old habits die hard for some, but through exposure others come to accept those who are different.This is a story that will make you laugh for days. It will make you cry the first time you read it, and the 9th time you read it. It's as bitter-sweet as life itself. I will never come across a book that has touched me as deeply as RED SKY AT MORNING."},{"Title":"Red Sky at Morning (Perennial Classics (Prebound))","review":"It's funny; I've read this book at least 10 times and I see from the reviews here that lots of people have seen fit to revisit Red Sky at Morning.I, too, grew up in the &quot;real&quot; Sagrado. In fact, Bradford's son and I were briefly acquainted as teenagers. I think the book is more autobiographical than Bradford would like to admit; my aunt has said that almost all of the teenaged characters were recognizable as actual people at the local high school at that time--especially Chango.Any time I'm homesick, all I have to do is reread the book and I'm right back home again. I'm glad that so many people from so many walks of life have enjoyed it as much as I have. It totally captures, very affectionately, all of the GOOD things about Northern New Mexico--things you wish would stay the same forever.It's like Catcher in the Rye, but it's warmer. It lovingly represents the wholly unique people of Northern New Mexico, who are unlike people anywhere else in the world. But it also reflects human nature and adaptation through scenes of humor, pain, the clashing and meshing of cultures, and the inevitable unwelcome changes that come with the passage of time. Red Sky at Morning bears witness to the coming of age of Joshua Arnold--the futile battle to remain young and untouched by the uglier side of the world, the bittersweet and inevitable transformation of boy to man. It was originally an allegory, I believe, parelleling Josh's growing pains with those of a post-war America. Ironically, it is now an allegory for what has become of the &quot;real&quot; Corazon, Sagrado--full of bittersweet memories--the end of an old road and the beginning of newer, less innocent one.Just beware: you won't be able to put it down and you WILL read it again and again. It really is that good."},{"Title":"Red Sky at Morning (Perennial Classics (Prebound))","review":"While I was browsing through the stacks at the library, I noticed that Harper Lee gave this a good blurb. That was good enough for me!The teenage narrator, Josh, has a really engaging attitude. He has a close relationship with his dad--who, as the novel opens, leaves his Mobile, Alabama shipyard for a stint in the Navy during WWII. Josh and his &quot;Southern aristocrat&quot; mom are supposed to wait out the war at the family's summer home in New Mexico.This has no adolescent angst or self-conscious soul-searching that marks so many coming-of-age novels. Josh makes good friends at school, has a lot of adventures and meets interesting characters. Josh is open-minded, honest with himself, and is not afraid to ask for help if he needs it. His story is compelling, and every few pages I laughed out loud.This should definitely be on the required reading list of any high school. For the adult reader, it's the sort of book you can enjoy, pass around to friends, and look forward to reading again."},{"Title":"Red Sky at Morning (Perennial Classics (Prebound))","review":"Richard Bradford has written one of the finest coming of age novels out there. \\"Red Sky at Morning\\" is the story of Josh Arnold, his friends, his family, and his environment as he deals with the repercussions a middle aged (41) father enlisting in the WWII Armed Forces and a move to their sometimes summer home in what is called Sagrado (most likely Santa Fe), New Mexico.Bradford has an eye for detail, masterful rapid-fire dialog, and that rare combination of comedy and poignancy. In some ways this novel brings to mind Salinger's \\"Catcher in the Rye\\" or Ferrol Sams' terrific Porter Osborne Jr. Trilogy (\\"Run with the Horsemen\\", \\"Whisper of the River\\", \\"When All the World Was Young\\"). Similarities include the teenage protagonist with an influential father, amusing and well-drawn characters, and plenty of thought-provoking interactions and events. One thing that sets this novel apart is its Western setting. Bradford does a terrific job of painting life in New Mexico and what it's like to attend school and come of age in such a diverse and different environment from the Southern one (Mobile, AL) Josh was primarily accustomed to.Josh is surrounded by colorful characters to include black servants in Alabama, hispanic servants in New Mexico, a minister's daughter (the hilarious Marcia), local classmates and townfolk, his Navy enlisted (ne shipbuilder) father, his more frequently pensive and recurringly drunken mother, the mooching/hayseed/epicene Jimbob, sheriff Chamaco, sculptor Romeo, and the extremely amusing Steenie (son of the town doctor). The adventures Josh gets into with Steenie and Marcia are particulalry inspiring (especially a night in a girlfriend's father's liquor cabinet) and the novel addresses both cultural and life changes in an always thoughtful and often amusing fashion. Josh's somewhat forced maturation process and the experiences of those around him are depicted with a beauty and skill rarely seen. This is one of the best novels I've ever read. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Red Sky at Morning (Perennial Classics (Prebound))","review":"Everyone has totemic books, books that mean something to them beyond the words on a page. It's a wonderful thing when a book that is special and meaningful is also funny and terrifically written. Yes, it's a coming-of-age story, set in 1942 in the southwest; it's also shrewd and miraculously observant about people and their behavior, about what happens when cultures bump up against each other. I discovered this book when I was fifteen (a new transplant from a city to a small rural town) and immediately fell in love with it. I've given copies to people over the years, and phrases from the book have worked their way into constant use.It also has the best dead horse scene in literature, a U.S. Army VD training film which is not to be missed, and a scene with an irate father of twins that will blow your socks (and regions nearby) off.I can't see anyone old enough to appreciate it not loving RED SKY."},{"Title":"Red Sky at Morning (Perennial Classics (Prebound))","review":"It may be set in northern New Mexico (Santa Fe, whether it says so or not)in the 1940s, but it's timeless. Even if times have changed, the emotions this book brings out transcend time. From teenage angst to bigotry to feeling alone in a not-so-familiar place, to making friends and dealing with becoming an adult, this book makes you laugh and makes you wistful. I first got it as an aside from a cousin who said she thought I'd like it. Two days later, I picked it up and then finished it that night at 4:30 AM, despite the fact that I had to be up at 6, because I just couldn't put it down. Several reads later, I still laugh at rotten horses and the ignorant Helen de Crispin, and grow sad at the inevitable march of time and the separation from loved ones. The book is so much deeper than the movie, which I finally found on e-bay, and which is worth watching just to see how much a movie can miss in the translation to the big screen. It's not bad, but the book is just tremendous, and it would've taken one hell of a director and cast to get it right, though some of the story resolutions in the movie seem more... complete I think is the right word. Too bad Richard Bradford only wrote two books in his life (he died a couple of years ago) - this and the slightly less luminous \\"So Far from Heaven\\" - but few better-written books you will find anywhere. Why this book isn't part of every required-reading list in high schools across the nation is beyond me. It beats the life out of anything I ever read in high school or college.

Now I try to return the favor for everyone I know."},{"Title":"Red Sky at Morning (Perennial Classics (Prebound))","review":"It has been so long since I've had time to read anything fictional. There's not a lot of time in a middle-aged guy's day to spend on fluff like that. Then I ran across this book at an estate sale my wife was dragging me through one day (I collect books but rarely read them) and the short exerpt of Mr. Arnold's admonition to Josh to take care of his mother while he was away on the cover leaf caught my eye. Throughout the book there is a frankness between Josh and his father that I strive for with my son ... sometimes successfully. Mr. Arnold had come to the conclusion that he has brought into the world an intelligent young man and he treats Josh just that way. If more fathers would have a relationship like this with their kids most of this country's problems would disappear in less than a decade! This book is worth more than its weight in 24k GOLD. It will always be one of my most cherished garage sale finds. (Its the fifth printing version of the 1968 release)Josh, himself, is a smart kid. Perhaps it's because his author is pretty sharp himself as youthful ignorance seems to be missing in much of Josh's observations and narration. Nevertheless, this story takes me back so smoothly, successfully and with such wonderful dead-pan humor that I made time for it almost every night before my eyes slammed shut until I'd read the whole thing. Now I ache for my kids to add this book to their reading experience. Once I read with incredulity of that Southern delicacy called Coca-Cola ham I was hooked and laughed my way through the rest of the book. I fervently hope my kids will too.My wife is Mexican-American. I was always jealous of the kids that could speak Spanish in school and thus maintain their privacy in a crowd. That makes our kids half Mexican and our son speaks it regularly with his abuela. Our daughter, welllll... I delved into my Spanish/English dictionary, and my wife's knowledge, many times throughout this book because it thrills me to learn what I can of this language in an everyday setting. This being the case, it makes this book doubly good for those who have an interest (if you don't you ought to) in our country's &quot;second&quot; language. Even though many of the phrases may be from a era strange to us now it opens a wonderful and accurate picture into the Hispanic community in a much simpler time. This book will help those of us outside the Hipanic community understand the pride that comes from being born into it and the distinct priviledge of being welcomed into it."},{"Title":"Red Sky at Morning (Perennial Classics (Prebound))","review":"I agree with the other reviews- I saw the movie first, way back in 1971, and then read the book. Both are excellent and, as usually is the case because of the luxury afforded by the printed page, the book was &quot;better.&quot; But I also love the movie; it will always have a special place for me because my time of coming of age was synchronized with the release of the movie. Very moving story, wonderful character development, something that will stay with me forever. Now that the book has been re-released, why don't they release the original 1971 movie on a video? With all the magnetic tape wasted on things that should have never been recorded in the first place, this time put the tape to good use!"},{"Title":"Red Sky at Morning (Perennial Classics (Prebound))","review":"As many others have said, it's impossible to get tired of this book. My parents gave it to me when I was 18 and (again, like several others) the first time I read it I found it a little slow and disjointed. It gets better and better with every read - each time I pick up on the subtleties of a scene for the first time.Rather than boring the reader with a bunch of obnoxious capers and hijinks, Bradford envelops you in his characters' community, and it's this day-to-day banality (which turned me off so much the first time) that really draws you into the story. Josh's adjustment to Sagrado takes time, but when it comes it's so natural and amusing that you're almost completely unprepared for the sobering conclusion of the story.I had no idea the book was so loved until I read these reviews. There are so many special moments in the story - the big wet snowfalls that ruins Chamaco's fiesta, the horribly backward residents of La Cima, the refreshing \\"white trashiness\\" of the Cloyd sisters, even Parker Holmes tearing an elk sandwich apart with his teeth.I wish these characters existed in real life, and I wish I could be their friend."},{"Title":"Red Sky at Morning (Perennial Classics (Prebound))","review":"I was surprised to see that I had not already written a review on \\"Red Sky At Morning\\" as I have purchased countless used copies and passed them on to anyone I loved. I decided to simply make a statement recommending this to anyone who loves a well-written book that will make you laugh out loud, cry and quote its words to anyone who will listen. From the perspective of a upper-level literature student, there is enough allegory, bildungsroman, symbolism and carpe diem to make anybody happy.But like \\"The Old Man and the Sea,\\" this book can be read on so many different levels. I first picked it up in an airport bookstore at about age 12 in about 1970, intrigued by the description on the cover. But I didn't read it for five years or more. When I finally picked it up again, it spoke to me on levels and in ways that no novel ever has. And I'm 47 years old and a person who devours novels like Elmer's Gold Brick Eggs (a Louisiana Easter tradition - I digress).I have read it more than probably any other book in the world and it is still fresh and relevant.

The author died young after writing only two novels, but what a treasure!"},{"Title":"Red Sky at Morning (Perennial Classics (Prebound))","review":"I first read Red Sky at Morning in High School as an impressionable teenager and was quite moved by the story and the character. I was curious to see what it would feel like to read the book more than two decades later. Although I enjoyed rereading the book, I found it much less of a moving experience than as a teenager. It is still a good book, it still has an interesting story with memorable characters but it did not click in the same way as it once did.The story is told by Josh Arnold, a 17 year old wealthy boy from Mobile, Alabama (his mother is Alabaman born and bred; his father is a more recent migrant). During World War Two, his father decides to join the Navy and sends Josh and his mother to their summer home in the mountains of New Mexico. Without his father and his familiar surroundings, Josh has to deal with life more or less on his own. While the story itself is not funny, the novel has a lot of deadpan humor ranging from a detailed description of Ham with Coca Cola Sauce to a very \\"touchy feely\\" psychiatrist. It is an easy book to read.In addition to its coming-of-age theme, the story very also deals with racial prejudice and how it messes up both personal and societal relationships. In many ways, Josh is an outsider both in Alabama and New Mexico, which gives him the ability to blend in and understand what is going on.Although not (To Kill a Mockingbird: 50th Anniversary Edition) or (The Catcher in the Rye), this book is well done and a worth a read."},{"Title":"Red Sky at Morning (Perennial Classics (Prebound))","review":". . . and so it is with Red Sky at Morning, a book and a town that never wear out their welcome, even after repeated readings.The basic story has been synopsized here repeatedly and well by other reviewers; I don't think I could add anything, so I offer instead a few personal reactions to this genuine American Classic.The tone is mostly light, but the book is not a lightweight by any means. The choice of an old mariners' proverb - or rather, the dark half of one - for the title signaled right from the cover that this was a book to be reckoned with; a grab-you-by-the-lapels title if ever there was one. Nautical imagery in a high desert/mountain setting, it limns the entire narrative arc before we even get to the plaudits. Too, my musician's ear was captivated by the sheer rhythmic beauty of it (is it coincidence that the title of Bradford's only other novel, So Far From Heaven, has the exact same cadence?). It has been often remarked how deftly Bradford combined pathos and bathos. Red Sky at Morning is downright glib in places, but his sense of timing and . . . propriety, were unfailing. The jokes completely outnumber the jabs, but the jabs always land square, and \\"sting down to the kneecaps\\" as Josh Arnold, the story's young protagonist, would put it.I believe that Bradford's secret ingredient was not, as many reviewers have had it, the jokey, even flippant tone, or the trio of impossibly bright, impossible-not-to-like teenagers - Josh, Marcia & Steenie (to say nothing of siblings Viola & Maximiliano Lopez, and Victoria Montoya), or even the slightly melancholy undertone. Rather it was Bradford's evocation of northern New Mexico, circa 1945, before it was overrun and anglo-fied. Oh, the touristas and the artistes were very much present by 1945, but the northern New Mexico A*R*T* culture (which subsumes the Colorful Native American cultures) hadn't yet reached the fever pitch of today where no pilgrimage to Taos or Santa Fe is complete without several thousand bucks worth of bandana'd coyotes and hunch-backed flute players and other Santa Fe kitsch in the back of the Land Rover. But I digress.Bradford's La Villa Real del Corazon Sagrado actually transcends the poetically descriptive and pushes into the mythic. Think about it: A town of 5,000+ inhabitants, with a drug store, movie theater, hospital, several churches of different denominations, at the almost-dead-end of a single 50-mile dirt road? (and no railroad, or at least Bradford never mentioned one). How would such a place be supplied? The current population of Taos, which was probably the model for Sagrado, is under 5,000, and Taos is served from four directions on two major highways. If you've ever been there, imagine approaching Taos from the west - across the high Taos Desert (7,000'), including the drop into & climb back out of the Rio Grande Gorge. That is somewhat close to how Bradford describes the Arnold's first approach to Sagrado - except the one just described is maybe 25 miles, whereas Bradford's is 50; and of course the road into Taos is paved and connects to other paved roads leading north to Colorado, South to Santa Fe & Albuquerque, or east through the Sangre de Cristo Mountains. The dirt road to Sagrado pretty much ends in Sagrado except for a straggling two-track up to some mountain villages. Sagrado is also a mountain town, with \\"mountain air, cool, fresh, and joyous to breathe . . .\\", as Bradford/Josh put it. While Taos is high at 7,000', and backs up to the foothills of the Sangre de Cristo range, it has never been known as a \\"mountain town,\\" at least in the sense of an Aspen or Park City. Sagrado sits on the high side of a broad alluvial skirt with enough pasturage for a million sheep - a thousand square miles as Josh calculated. So: baking desert rises suddenly to vast, cool, semi-arid grassland, sloping up to foot of high mountains. I know of no such place in North America. The closest approximation would probably be western Montana, except there are no deserts in western Montana.I should also mention one of the mountain villages near Sagrado, La Cima, as it shares Sagrado's quasi-mythic setting (I don't know of any year-round villages near 11,000 feet anywhere in North America - 11,000' is at or above tree line in most of the American southwest), but adds an unsettling, alien quality (I should also mention that I've been to a few of the northern New Mexico mountain villages in our universe (\\"visited\\" is not quite the word), and they can be almost as xenophobic as La Cima. I once got stuck in a snow drift on a forest service road near one of them and made my way back to Denver by foot, thumb and bus in time for work Monday morning. But before I could arrange to have a tow service fetch my truck it had been stripped nearly to the frame. Northern New Mexico's long, proud tradition of lawlessness is still very much alive in the 21st Century.). Josh is taken to La Cima by Amadeo Montoya, the family caretaker, along with his beautiful Josh's-age daughter, Victoria, to witness a very old-world solstice ceremony (it only vaguely resembled Christmas). I couldn't improve on or condense Bradford's description of their night-time approach - no one could - so I'll just paste it here mostly verbatim:\\"We had pulled up onto a stretch of level plateau after a hard climb. Ahead of us, across a steep gorge, was La Cima, perched like an eagle's nest on a bluff, white peaks shining behind it. A thousand tiny fires made the village glow, and the wind from the mountains brought the sweet smell of pine and pi&ntilde;on smoke to us.\\"\\"I couldn't tell immediately what it was that made the village look so antique, and Amadeo helped me.\\"\\"'There's no electricity there,' he said. \`They use fires and kerosene lamps. They don't want electricity.'\\"\\". . . La Cima had just one street. It curved along the top of a narrow ridge, faced on both sides by thick-looking houses built of heavy logs with mud chinkng. Many of them seemed to have no windows at all; others had hide stretched tightly over small square holes, the hide oiled to let the light through\\" . . . \\"All the roofs were of corrugated metal, pitched steeply like those on Swiss chalets, shining dully in the firelight. The snow had fallen deeply and heavily here, and had slid off the roofs and piled high between the houses.\\"\\"The level summit of the ridge was no more than a hundred feet wide, enough for the road and the front rooms of the houses. Then the land dropped off sharply, and I could see that a house one level in front was two or three levels high in back, the rear portions braced and buttressed against gravity by lodge poles and boulders. The dark houses seemed to belly up against the slope, like animals standing on their hind legs to feed on whatever came along the road.\\"That image - of houses crouched on either side of a ridge like predatory animals - took my breath away when I first read it, and the intervening 30-odd years have done little to dull it.La Cima's culture is even more atavistic. Sitting in the truck, out of sight & carefully out of the way, Josh and the Montoyas see an extremely pregnant young woman (she \\"pushed her belly before her like a wheelbarrow full of melons.\\") in a thin cotton dress and un-laced boots riding a donkey down La Cima's only street, having cold water and curses thrown at her from various doorways (a metaphor so clear that \\"even a Protestant should get it,\\" as Victoria informs him) in the doubtlessly sub-zero winter night at close to 11,000 feet. The people sing a vaguely recognizable tune accompanied by a few men on short, primitive flutes - \\"It had a different tone here in La Cima; it sounded Oriental, or Arabic . . .\\" She then mounts a bear(!), barely controlled by a collar and chains and three or four burly men, while she whispers to it and strokes its neck. I've never been able to determine whether this ceremony was Bradford's invention or a genuine bit of back-country culture, but this short La Cima \\"Christmas\\" scene is one of the most vivid, arresting passages I've ever read.I've been visiting Sagrado, New Mexico, ca. 1945, every four or five years since my mid-twenties. I never tire of this scruffy, charming town; its dirt streets shared by cars and donkeys, its endearingly eccentric denizens, and its collection of precocious adolescents. Since it exists solely between the covers of maybe a half-million copies in print and in the minds of millions of enchanted readers, it is like Brigadoon, frozen in time, forever poised on the brink of post-WWII modernity - dirt streets about to be paved. And also like Brigadoon, it is just a step away through some inter-dimensional portal . . . or at the end of a lone fifty-mile dirt road, which in our universe would be almost as unlikely.In short, the Sagrado, N.M. & environs of Richard Bradford's imagination could not exist in our world. It is mythical, a magical milieu which never ages, and never ceases to enchant. I expect I will continue to visit as long as I can read."},{"Title":"Red Sky at Morning (Perennial Classics (Prebound))","review":"I read this book in high school, in about 1972, and it has remained one of my favorite novels ever since.

Perhaps it helps to live in northern New Mexico in which the novel is set. Although times have changed since the latter part of World War II, we still have many \\"norte&ntilde;os\\" -- \\"Northerners,\\" who are Hispanics, many from families who have been here for hundreds of years and whose Spanish doesn't sound like the Spanish in Spain or that of southern New Mexico or the Spanish of more recent Mexican immigrants. Many natives still switch from Spanish to English and back, as appropriate, without thinking about it. In 1944 these people were the largest population group and as a result many \\"Anglos\\" picked up a lot of Spanish as did the major, adolescent Anglo characters in this superb book. \\"Spanglish\\" is not, by the way, what they picked up. That connotes bad Spanish and bad English mixed.The native characters in the book are well drawn as are the white kids, and having spent 24 years of my life in New Mexico I can recognize them all, even though \\"Sagrado\\"(arguably Santa Fe) is much, much more populated now, and La Cima (arguably Truchas)is now safe enough for some Anglos to live there which in the time the book is set they certainly did not and could not have done.The story, in a nutshell, is how a high schooler from Mobile, when his father went to war, was settled with his \\"Southern Belle\\" mother in the little town of Sagrado in northern New Mexico, met as one would, the other kids in his school, took up with another boy and a girl as best buddies (all three were smart, funny and had educated parents) and fit in, for the most part easily with his school, the community and the native language, the ease stemming in part from the fact that he had previously spent a number of summers in their Sagrado house with his parents, and in part because his new buddies took him under their wings. The \\"adventures\\", some of which are hilarious, some more serious, all seem quite feasible given the times, the circumstances and the age of the kids.The real secret to fully appreciating this book is to read it slowly for flavor, not for plot which in my opinion is secondary, savoring every word and phrase, and to have a good Spanish dictionary at hand unless you speak the language.

Cultures comically clash as Josh and some of the other \\"newer\\" families in town try to blend in with the established Mexican residents. Bradford, who lived in New Mexico during the 1950-60s, is particularly adept at capturing the language, flavors, and feel of life in a Southwestern small town. While some of the usual teenage angst is on display here as in other works in the \\"coming of age\\" genre, Bradford also explores more serious topics including a father who has left to go off to war and a mother's declining mental stability.A self-proclaimed \\"slow\\" writer, it is doubtful that we will read more works from Bradford (he did complete a second novel, \\"So Far From Heaven,\\" five years after this one).

It is wildly honest and funny and shot through with a bemused melancholy that can break your heart. The dialogue is so sharp you could cut your fingers on it, and every character is crystal clear. Like life itself it's a little messy, doesn't always make sense, and bittersweet is the best you can hope for.It seems to me that if you wanted a ya version of \\"high literature\\" to really show a young reader what a book can do, this is where you could start. This is a book that stays with you."},{"Title":"Red Sky at Morning (Perennial Classics (Prebound))","review":"Red Sky at Morning is a coming of age novel, albeit a relatively quiet one. Unlike some of the book's fans, I don't think it has the power or emotional depth of Catcher in the Rye, but then, few novels do. There is some intensity in the conflict between the narrator, 17-year-old Joshua Arnold, and the neighborhood tough, Chango, and the absence of Joshua's father that compels his transition to adulthood is well handled. Many of the episodes in Joshua's life are amusing and a few are downright funny, making this an enjoyable read.So here are my quibbles, preventing me from highly recommending the novel: Joshua's father builds ships but leaves home to help the war effort more directly. The father is a likable character. I enjoyed the banter between Joshua's father and the employee he left in charge of the shipyard, and between Joshua's father and Joshua. But when the same kind of light-hearted sarcastic dialog was taken up by Joshua's friends Steenie and Marcia, it seemed to me that too many characters were speaking in the same voice, as if they had all been cloned from Joshua's father. More importantly, I was left with the feeling that the novel was striving relentlessly to be light-hearted even in the face of circumstances in Joshua's life (unnamed here to avoid spoiling the plot for those who haven't read the book) that should have been tragic. Finally, I didn't buy Chango's character change at all. I can accept that the events in the novel would have had an impact on Chango, but the immediate and extreme alteration of his personality that Joshua describes isn't credible.I came to this novel late in life. Perhaps if I'd first read it as a teenager or young adult, or perhaps if I had ever lived in the southwest (which is lovingly described), it would have left a greater impression. At any rate, although younger readers who might most enjoy Red Sky at Morning will likely find it a bit dated, I recommend the novel. I nonetheless feel it lacks the depth that causes some readers to hold it in high esteem; to me it is a fine novel that falls well short of greatness."},{"Title":"Red Sky at Morning (Perennial Classics (Prebound))","review":"My signed first edition of Red Sky At Morning is one of my most cherished posessions.

It should be read by anyone familiar with the usual condemnations of the government's and individuals' actions for an eye-opening alternative point of view. It appears that the other nineteen chapters, each describing a different battle, are much more sympathetic to the Indians.

You can talk about your anger, and try to physically calm your body, but you cannot be abusive and hurt yourself, others, or property.If you are a parent hoping to help a child with anger issues, this is probably not the best book for you.

I read the book and it helped me think about my own anger and maybe gave me some ammo for dealing with his anger. But a better book I found was \\"What to do when your temper flares\\". That book gave us images of anger that were tangible. For example it likened allowing anger to run rampant is like driving a car. You have to learn how to drive and you have to learn how to handle anger. Even tho my boy is too young to drive he understood the concept immediately. This other book also says: It isn't what happens that makes you mad it's what you THINK about what happened that determines how you feel.In a group setting the lessons would be combined with class discussions but they don't lend themselves well to story time reading material.

Don't get me wrong, MacDonald is still MacDonald and the book is well written and engaging, but I thought overall &quot;Tan and Sandy Silence&quot; was lacking somehow. Maybe it's that this is obviously one of his later books and he was getting bored or tired, or maybe it's just something I didn't notice in his other books, but he seemed to take the easy way out a few times. For instance, when McGee interviews people the conversations don't seem realistic--the people volunteer too much information: If you just met someone and they asked what you knew about your next-door neighbor would you say, &quot;Well, not a lot other than she just opened an account at the Blah-Blah Bank and her loan officer is John Blah&quot;? (How convenient!) Also, there was an element of predictability that may have come from reading his other books; I knew certain characters were going to die, and even is one or two instances HOW they would die. Some of McGee's encounters seemed too coincidental and lucky, with old friends showing up at just the right time and place to save his skin. Finally, the ending appeared rushed and illogical and didn't tie up all the loose ends.But even with all that, there was enough fun and suspense and McGee-ism to make this a worthwhile read. You could certainly do far worse."},{"Title":"A Tan And Sandy Silence","review":"Over the years I've read hundreds of novels in a variety of genres, but for pure fun and enjoyment it's hard to beat Travis McGee. Some of the books are better than others, but they're nearly all worth a couple of lazy summer days. They are the ultimate summer time, quick-read beach books. At their core, they're good mysteries. But Travis McGee is such a great character, with such a wry outlook on life, that often the mystery seems secondary to McGee's views on whatever topic author John D. McDonald has selected for his soap box. Most of them take place in Florida, (a Florida no one will ever see again given they were written mostly in the 60s and 70s) and all have a color in the title. Don't take them too seriously, just have fun in the sun."},{"Title":"A Tan And Sandy Silence","review":"If this was your first Travis McGee book, don't worry. Most of them are much, much better. This book suffers from an overload of the author's rambling commentary on society. After the introduction to jealous husband, you have to slug through 100 pages before you begin to get into typical Travis McGee action. The action is often illogical, and too often Travis - err - Gavin stumbles into old friends at the most unlikely places, bailing him out of trouble. Sorry, this one just didn't click for me. In many ways, it reminded me of the Pale Gray for Guilt story, but there was much less action in this book."},{"Title":"A Tan And Sandy Silence","review":"A Tan and Sandy Silence is certainly not the best book John D. MacDonald ever authored. In fact, some may find it way too dark and unsettingly disturbing. Others may object to it for a host of very legitimate reasons. But I daresay that even those readers who find themselves hating this Travis McGee novel still will have to admit it is a substantive, unforgettable read.The unevenly paced narrative revolves around McGee's efforts to locate Mary Broll, a former lover whom no one seems to have seen in over three months. His search takes him to the tropical island of Grenada where the case takes on an entirely different trajectory. As others have already accurately pointed out, the novel starts off slow, climaxes with some very macabre events and has somewhat of a rushed ending. Along the way, the reader is treated to large helpings of Travis McGee's introspection on a wide range of topics having to do with modern life. After a while, this inner monologue, though at times clever, becomes tiresome and gives the impression of too much self-indulgence on author MacDonald's part.Other objectionable aspects of this book include its incorporation of an excessive amount of amateur psychology into the plot and the fact that McGee never, ever fails to completely captivate members of the opposite sex.The positive attributes of this book would have to include MacDonald's very evocative and original brand of prose and the presence of a number of characters who come off as quite believable.John D. MacDonald was unquestionably a great writer, but A Tan and Sandy Silence is one of his lesser works. He was capable of much better."},{"Title":"A Tan And Sandy Silence","review":"I've read all but one of the Travis McGee novels, and this is the only one that felt like John D. was just going through the motions. I think he was burned out, and it really shows. He was too prolific to maintain high quality. This was the 13th book in an 8 year span (in addition to several non-McGee novels); by contrast, the last 8 books in the series are spread out over 14 years, which helped MacDonald keep the quality high.I can understand why MacDonald need to write this book: so he could write off the cost of a trip to Grenada (a small island in the southern Caribbean that President Reagan later made famous by liberating it from a Marxist dictatorship). But I cannot recommend that anyone read it.There's stuff in here that wouldn't have made it into a James Bond film even during the Roger Moore years, like McGee floating out to sea on a rip tide and being picked up by a sailing yacht/floating bordello crewed by beautiful naked young ladies. But no need to detail all of the nonsense in this book. Suffice it to say that no one hits a home run every time at bat. The series as a whole is still great stuff."},{"Title":"A Tan And Sandy Silence","review":"It's 1971 and a little more than halfway through the Travis McGee series when we meet our hero here, brooding about the passage of time and a growing sense of his own mortality. Time for him to stop risking his neck in the \\"salvage consulting\\" business, perhaps?\\"I think you've been doing it for too long, darling,\\" he is warned early on by a wealthy woman who wants him to settle down as her catamaran companion. \\"One day some dim little chap will come upon you suddenly and take out a gun and shoot you quite dead.\\"One of the worst things you can do with a Travis McGee novel is read that little bit of text on the back cover before you read anything else. You know, those two or three sentences that give you some idea what this mystery is about. Especially with \\"A Tan And Sandy Silence.\\" Here, a big part of the pleasure is discovering as Travis does just what is up, as the story takes its time setting itself up and unfolds rather magnificently.The first chapter gets us off with a bang, or rather six of them, all fired at Travis by an enraged husband who demands to know where his wife is. Travis for once is innocent, but the episode leaves him shaken. Could he nearly have gotten his ticket punched by an out-of-shape palooka like Harry Broll? And where is his wife, anyway? Since she is one of Travis's old flames, he wonders if he should find out. And keeps wondering for a few chapters. Meanwhile, we wonder what this novel we are a fifth of the way through is going to be about. Unless we read the back-cover blurb, anyway.For me, the pleasure of MacDonald's story construction was more than a little compromised by a weakish mystery, full of improbable standoffs and left-field coincidences. The positive is that McGee is interesting company throughout, nowhere more so than when he must face some unhappy truths about his situation in the company of one of those nasty female characters MacDonald drew so uncomfortably well. When we meet her, well into the story on the Caribbean island nation of Grenada, it's easy to fall into the trap of wanting Travis to give her the business. He sort of does, but pauses long enough to discover the potential of a better person under her hard shell. Then everything changes all at once, and the story gets harsher and colder.The action of the story gets more implausible as it goes on, but the core of it remains interesting, especially to McGee fans: Our hero is beginning to doubt his own abilities. Worse, after years of bedding women, he is beginning to lose his taste for employing his masculinity so casually. MacDonald puts us on notice here that McGee is a man of flesh and blood, able to feel not only pain but fear. It sharpens the narrative substantially.Which is a good thing when the story gets a bit slack here and there. The weakest part is a ship full of happy prostitutes who remind us what an unabashed male fantasist MacDonald could be, even when it hurt his story. The best part is a deepening of McGee's tie with his financially minded companion, the wry Meyer, who makes for a worthy sounding board for the book's longer philosophical stretches. There is a lot of philosophizing here.\\"The real guilt is being a human being,\\" MacDonald has McGee observe. \\"That is the horrible reality which bugs us all. Wolves, as a class, are cleaner, more industrious, far less savage, and kinder to each other and their young.\\"Better McGee novels tie down such thoughts to firmer narratives, but \\"A Tan And Sandy Silence\\" is a gripping read even when it's not holding together that well as a story. As a visit with an old friend who is facing the prospect of getting older with less than his usual suavity, \\"Tan\\" has a good deal going for it. If you are following the McGee series, and don't mind a few loose ends, you may feel your interest for Travis deepening after reading this book."},{"Title":"A Tan And Sandy Silence","review":"Would there be a Carl Hiaasen, Tim Dorsey or Randy Wayne White without John D. MacDonald? Maybe, but it's not too difficult to find a dozen authors who owe a debt to MacDonald, who pioneered the Florida crime novel. Of course, it's one thing to be a pioneer, it's another to be good. Happily, MacDonald is both, as most aptly demonstrated in his Travis McGee series.A Tan and Sandy Silence is the 13th in the series. It opens with McGee doing what he likes most, enjoying life on his houseboat, the Busted Flush. All is well till he is visited by Harry Broll, the boorish husband of McGee's old friend Mary Dillon. Mary walked out on Harry three months back after catching him with another woman. Broll is convinced McGee is hiding her. Broll is not so much interested in reconciliation as getting Mary to complete some paperwork essential to an investment.McGee isn't hiding Mary, but he's also a little worried that she never contacted him. A bit of investigating eventually points to her hiding out on the island of Grenada (giving the island a drop of notoriety a decade before Reagan put it on the map with a minor military adventure). He still has enough doubts to go there, where he will find out about a scheme to deprive Broll of a lot of cash. At the heart of it is a typical MacDonald villain, an intelligent sociopath who McGee will underestimate.This is another fun thriller with the usual share of Travis McGee cynicism about society that sets it apart from other novels of the era. MacDonald was a great storyteller, and this book, even if not the strongest in the set, is still good enough for any mystery fan."},{"Title":"A Tan And Sandy Silence","review":"The first intimations of McGee's impending dotage are fascinating. Hearing him acknowledge he may be losing a step, may be a tad less intuitive..... Frankly, it's a little painful. The expected carnage of women continues as in most John D.'s books, but the level of intimacy is surprisingly low. In many ways this is the book that highlights McGee's relationship with Meyer and brings them closer together in their awareness of each other's abilities. Several reviews weren't very strong on this book. I disagree; I think it's one of his better runs with Travis."},{"Title":"A Tan And Sandy Silence","review":"Another Travis McGee book. This one seemed to take forever to get going, to set up the problem, and then as soon as you understood the problem, MacDonald popped you a good one, and the rest of the book was a catch-up from that moment. But that's the simple &quot;mystery&quot; of this McGee novel, and as such is never that special. The attraction of McGee, at least in these later books, are MacDonald's comments within them on the human condition, both specifically with regard to the Quixotish nature of McGee, as well as a general feeling of malaise which centers around money and violence. The McGee novels are as much about philosophy--ethics, particularly--as they are about mystery. Or maybe the point is that the philosophy is the mystery, and as we get to know McGee better, we understand more about his philosophy. I seem to remember the Spenser novels of Robert Parker to be similar to this as well. Are there other mystery series in which the character growth is as important, if not more so, than the particular story of the time?"},{"Title":"A Tan And Sandy Silence","review":"So the consensus is thumbs down.But, even though this isn't MacDonald's best, and even though there are indeed strong--I would say uncharacteristic--elements of misogynism in some of what Travis does to a particular woman for detective purposes, and even though the antagonist is so psychotically evil as to be unlikely to have survived past his teen years (much less prospered as a super-rich international corporate executive), and even though some of the McGee cultural observations seem pedestrian and heavy handed, it's still John D. MacDonald and Travis McGee.As one of the reviewers remarks, it may not be one of MacDonald's best--perhaps his teenage kids were acting up or protesting the war in Vietnam and his wife was verbally abusing him in that timeframe (1971)--but it is certainly memorable....For my complete review of this book and for other book and moviereviews, please visit my site [...]Brian WrightCopyright 2009"},{"Title":"A Tan And Sandy Silence","review":"This was about my 13th McGee novel and it was a disappointment. I'm hip to the Trav legacy, and aware that the author's condescension toward women, rock music and men with long hair was part of the McDonald DNA (sign of the times, probably). But this book just has too much of that. The villain's level of sadism is over the top and we are treated to a particularly vicious drowning murder of a woman. The land development scheme is baffling Trav accomplishes a physical feat in the ocean that is flat impossible and his rescue is an outrageous coincidence. Finally, the villain's comeuppance is out of a James Bond novel. Be warned.Still, I'll probably get around to more McGee adventures. BTW, ever notice these common traits shared by McGee women: They're in glowing health, when they sit on a couch they tuck their legs under, when they concentrate they put the tip of their tongue in the corner of their mouth, when they eat they lick their fingers, when they sleep they snore softly and they yawn a lot.

I just wanted to say that this one was a disappointment for me. This one was predictable, had Travis doing things that unpleasantly surprised me, and the ending was something cheap and quick. I never felt like I was \\"there\\" with him as I have in other books.As far as being a tired effort from the end of MacDonald's career, \\"The Lonely Silver Rain\\" was written in 1985 and was much better in my mind. I would just save \\"A Tan and Sandy Silence\\" for later or last. Go through the ones that are just gold first."},{"Title":"A Tan And Sandy Silence","review":"A colleague of mine left this book on my desk one day. Reading it made me wish he had left the hardbound version, since that way it would have hurt more when I threw it back at him!It's a detective story, you see, featuring the inimitable Travis McGee, the beach bum cum gumshoe who appears in over a dozen MacDonald outings.What can I say about this book? In one stroke, MacDonald has managed to outstrip Flaubert, Dostoevsky, and Joyce, making them all look like mewling infants.Here's just a sample of MacDonald's deathless prose:\\"And I suppose you had an affair with her.\\"\\"Gee, honey. I'd have to look it up.\\"I caught her fist about five inches from my eye. \\"You bahstid,\\" she said. [p. 32]Of course, MacDonald cannot be accused of being a superficial writer! Consider these penetrating philosophical musings:\\"I own some Sears electric clippers with plastic gadgets of various shapes which fit on the clippers to keep you from accidentally peeling your hair off down to the skull. I find that long hair is a damned nuisance on boats, on the beach, and in the water. So when it gets long enough to start to make me aware of it, I clipper it off, doing the sides in the mirror and the back by feel. The sun bleaches my hair and burns it and dries it out. And the salt water makes it feel stiff and look like some kind of Dynel. Were I going to keep it long, I would have to take care of it. That would mean tonics and lotions and special shampoos. That would mean brushing it and combing it a lot more than I do and somehow fastening it out of the way in a stiff breeze.\\" [pp. 123-124]But perhaps Travis, our hero, is at his most debonair when he's beating the snot out of recalicrant women:\\"I smiled at her, pulling her a half-step closer and said, 'If you get loud and say nasty things, dear, if you get on my nerves, I can hold you like this, and I can take this free hand and make a big fist like this, and I can give you one little pop right here that will give you a nose three inches wide and a quarter inch high.''Please,' she said in a rusty little voice.'You can get a job as a clown. Or you can see if you can find a surgeon willing to try to rebuild it.'\\" [p. 136]In sum, if you're in the mood for sappy, incoherent, misogynistic, and, well, all-around cruddy fiction, you can't go wrong with the peerless Travis McGee!(The author, John MacDonald, died in 1986, and therefore -- it tickles me to announce -- will not be inflicting any more of these books on us!

This time the mystery centers on the Flying Express, a hydrofoil that is just entering service on Barmet Bay. Someone is out to prevent the Flying Express from entering service. Who is behind these attempts?This story is somewhat interesting in the Chet Morton's new hobby, astrology, plays a critical part in the story. Chet's hobbies have often played a part in Hardy Boys books, but in this book his hobby is central to capturing the criminals.The Hardys discover an unusual group of criminals in this mystery, including one who does everything based on his horoscope. The boys also encounter a businessman who seems as though he might have something to do with the mystery, but how, and why?The Hardy boys have frequently encountered criminals who have put them into danger, in addition to the danger they often encounter on their own. This time the criminals do things that could endanger dozens of lives as they try to stop the Flying Express from crossing Barmet Bay.This story is interesting with elements that are educational and enjoyable. The story is paced well and is reasonably easy to follow. While I enjoyed the complexity of the previous story, \\"The Disappearing Floor,\\" the relative simplicity of the story line in this book was welcomed. Further, though the story line is somewhat simple, there was sufficient complexity to keep the story interesting.Though the Hardy Boys series is written in a relatively archaic fashion, as reading material for an increasingly younger audience they are excellent. The stories were once recommended for children ages 10 to 14. As children are exposed to more violence and seem to require greater levels of stimulation, the recommended age range has move to 9 to 12. I think any child capable of reading some of the challenging words in these books will enjoy them, regardless of how tame most of the action may be. Once a child has reached age 12 or so the stories may be of less interest, but given the combination of mystery and action, these books remain good safe choices for parents who want to know what their children are reading."},{"Title":"The Mystery of the Flying Express (Hardy Boys, Book 20)","review":"Frank and Joe get tangled with violint crimmanls in this frightning mystery.

The book is very slightly disjointed in places and perhaps more to the point it contains several glaring errors all too well known to most Hardy enthusiasts - ie: The incorrect names given for Mrs. Hardy & Chief Collig. That said and those things aside this was a pretty good book. As I child I held this book in high esteem. It is a story about spies using a train called the Flying Express. It is the brothers task to find the spies and their camp and bring them to justice. It is too bad the book contains several errors because otherwise it had a great plot and was an enjoyable read. More accurately I rate it a 3.4 star, the story a 4 star, the errors within a 2 star. RATED B-REVISION: The 1970 revision - from memory was a dud. I may not be the best person to rate the revision.

I hate reviewing books like this one because there really isn't much to say. The book was neither excellent nor bad; just average.

I'd more accurately give the book 3 1/2 stars instead of a 4 star rating. The plot of the book was pretty good and there was a fair bit of action. I only found three things really wrong with the book : 1.other regular characters, like Chet, Mr. Hardy, etc., weren't included in most of the book, 2.the end of the book was a bit disappointing, as the spies were rounded-up with little incident, and 3.the author doesn't appear to have been that familiar with the characters in the series because he called Mrs. Hardy Mildred, instead of Laura and he replaced Chief Collig with a Chief Finch.

I love the realism, coupled with the symbolism. I love all the details you missed before. The style is simple, but beautiful and speaks volumes. A wonderful story that I love to read."},{"Title":"Hey, Wait...","review":"This is one of Jason's earliest graphic novels and could arguably be his best. It starts with two friends who go through the usual childhood antics of playing football, playing computer games, slowly noticing girls, and being bored in school. Then a tragedy occurs with one of the friends being killed. The surviving friend is haunted by this event and Part 2 opens with him grown up, divorced, working a job he hates, and increasingly becoming dependent on alcohol.It's a portrait of trauma painted subtly, touchingly, and imaginatively. The quirky devices Jason employs are here. Instead of cars everyone goes about on stilts. All the characters are of course animal faced. But the imaginative devices he uses like at the end of Part 1 to show how childhood ends for the friend who survives is brilliant and original. Time lapse in Part 2 is again dealt with well so the reader is jarred by the sudden span of years. Despite Jason's usual lack of expressions on his characters' faces, in \\"Hey, Wait...\\" he alters them so you see real pain, frustration, and regret in their faces. Also, coming out of an alcoholic bender is done remarkably well for the comics medium.The ending is ambiguous but memorable and again blurs reality and fantasy. Is it a happy ending or a sad one? I promise you, even if you're not a comics fan once you've read this you'll be thinking about this book for years. An amazing work of art."},{"Title":"Hey, Wait...","review":"If you're a comics buff who's only into superheros or manga or whatever popular subjects featured in mainstream comics, this book is probably not for you, regardless of the glowing reviews here. Otherwise ... read on.I utterly enjoyed the book. The story is so intense, yet the illustration is minimalistic and poetic. Because of the frugal use of text, I had to revisit some pages just to interpret what exactly happened. But I'm telling you - less is more! The book has the rare quality and artistic appeal of a Criterion Collection classic film. It also reminded me of Art Spiegelman's Maus. If Maus has been studied in schools, Hey Wait should be, too. I hope, through word of mouth, this book as well as others by Jason will get more attention in the States."},{"Title":"Hey, Wait...","review":"\\"Hey, Wait..\\" TP, is a book conceived and drawn both by Jason.This terse graphic novella uses no words,but all-pantomine.It is an allegorical genre, tackling by stretching out gradually the life of a young boy leading up, maturing & his becoming of a young man.My givings of this short precis\` is about two pubescent boys spending jovially on one of there school summer vacations. The twosome literally smell the happy air of there school-free environment, exuberantly eating the ticking time heedfully the rest of there holliday lives, & they just simply wallow the concurrent moments of what in store for them during these cherished times. However one day, a fortutious event diverges the path they both tread for the rest of there lives permanently. The other one simply could not accept the happenstance what predestined by fate. So he cope with it antipathetically as his life sinks spirally to the toilet, & as well, he tries to endure this guilt for the remainder of his adult life.Essentially, this comic book is broken down to two halves. The first chapter is all about exploring fully the childhood lives of these two young boys. While the latter half shown us by sifting through the lives of the protagonists & that wretched and tragedic repercussions. By the way, this book utilizes anthropomorphic characters or in other words, uses animals as oppose to humans as way to smoothly deliver the story as what the author intended it to be.Jason is a very talented & well-rounded comic book creator. he artfully etched out the story to life with his true-to-life and accurate rendition of diverse & realistic emotions of each circumstances upon dictated spontaneously by the story itself. The story turns out very profound in the dimensions of emotions and rich in psychological dealings,at least in reference to subtle, not blatant aspects. Likewise,the story is very poignant, dark & melancholic, heartbreaking and ultimately, heart-rending.However, the grandest talent of Jason based by critique-ing this work, is his ability to leverage panels to his pluses per page (6 panels a page). He skillfully by fully delineating lucidly the essences to fruition such as those articulated prior, such as the psychological, emotional, and allegorical ranges. Most of the times, his panels do not even show people nor any interactions, neither a situation at all.Ironically, merely illustrated a tree or any object for that matter & completed, then presenting to us, only the tree & its environment for example, for all 6 panels, with the author sole purpose to starkly immersing the reader to every inch of significant emotions & other nuances of what Jason deemed neccessary & clever.This slender graphic novella constitutes only for 64 pages, all in B&W; & comic book format, softbounded & with sturdy frontage cover. A good buy and a \\"must own\\".A bonafide, quasi literary piece of work. In the same breath alongside \\"Maus\\" by. Art Spiegelmann; \\"Four Women\\" by. Sam Kieth; \\"To the Heart of the Storm\\" by. Will Eisner & \\" A Jew in Communist Prague\\" by. Vittorio Giardino.Highly recommended for story, price and Jason."},{"Title":"Hey, Wait...","review":"I bought this book because of the good review I read in 'Preview' and was really kind of confused when I actually sat down and read it. I have never read anything like it, the whole set up and style was foriegn to me. I found the story itself pretty depressing. At least the parts of it I understood. I can see how some people would consider it deep and moving, but when I finished it I just felt like I had been tricked out of fourteen bucks. Read the first few pages of the preview on this site, it gives you a pretty good idea of the tone of the book. Wish that I had done that."},{"Title":"Hey, Wait...","review":"I bought this book a few months ago, and have read it 5 times since. &quot;I have absorbed its contents&quot;, would be more fitting, as the bulk of story in this book is told more through the artists complex while seemingly simplistic visuals. It's the story of two childhood friends, a tragic event that separates them, and finally how one of the friends grows up and how the events of his childhood still affect him. It's an amazing story, and I'd highly recommend it for people who like to think when they read comics. I find Jason's art to have many layers. There is so much that is being said in almost every panel. You have to look at it and think about it for a bit, though, or you'll miss what Jason is representing in these panels and throughout the book.A great book. :)"},{"Title":"Hey, Wait...","review":"This book is incredible. A masterpiece in graphic literature. The art is superb and is perfect for this story which I found hauntingly familiar. The perfectly drawn facial expressions bring the characters alive. The story will grip you and stay with you for eternity. The editorial review that says, \\"this story is beautiful but will utterly break your heart\\" is SO right on. Everyone needs this. I wish I knew if this artist had any other graphic novels out? I'd like to thank the first Amazon reviewer as his (or her) review convinced me to buy it. Now it's your turn. I assure you that it will be one of the best ten bucks you ever spent."},{"Title":"Hey, Wait...","review":"Jason, Hey, Wait... (Fantagraphics, 2001)Graphic novel artist Jason made a huge splash with this slim volume when it first came out a few years back. It's pretty easy to see why; with a minimum of dialogue and a ot of abstraction, Jason paints a deeply affecting pastiche.The story concerns two childhood friends who decide to start a fan club. While they're planning out the initiation, something goes horribly wrong, and the rest of the book deals with one friend's lifelong reaction to a life-changing event.Hey, Wait... is unflinching. If you haven't yet come to the world of graphic novels, this is a great place to start; even the toughest critics of graphic novels, I should think, would be hard-pressed to deny the emotional power of this little tale (and it certainly puts to bed the idea that all comics are for kids). ****"},{"Title":"Hey, Wait...","review":"A moving example of the power of simplicity, \\"Hey, Wait\\" is a work of art to be treasured and read again and again. It speaks across generations, across languages, and across national borders. It speaks to the human condition. As a graphic utterance of our postmodern existential angst, \\"Hey, Wait\\" is highly recommended."},{"Title":"Hey, Wait...","review":"I'll have to say that this artist has a way with the graphic art form that I feel few others have demontrated thus far in the genre. The sincerity conveyed through simplicity in order to portray a wonderful series of elements that characterise the human condition is refreshing...not to mention that zombies, mummies and monsters in general NEED to be in our lives!"},{"Title":"Hey, Wait...","review":"I just found a first edition of this wonderful story and I must say that after reading Dylan Horrock's small quote on the rear cover I was quite interested.I lost my childhood friend to suicide three years ago and this story, while not similar in that fate, really helped me see what I have been holding inside. Guilt is a terrible suitcase, one not easily discarded, but it's nice to see no one is alone.I knew little of the book before literally stumbling onto it and I am very glad I did. It now sits in my large collection of comics and such and will be one of my favorite conversation pieces in my local comic shop in weeks to come. I highly recommend it to all!"},{"Title":"Hey, Wait...","review":"Jason's comic coming-of-age story has many gems. His simplistic style and steady pacing with the use of the same comic panels on every page forge a universe made of a very personal visual language. The lines between adulthood and childhood are clearly drawn (so to speak): adults are tired, working-class that rarely smile as they tread the streets on stilts; the two kids in the story have boundless imagination and their world is populated by undead bullies and comic monsters.The second part does not read as cleverly as the first, though done with the same care. The symbolism of the first half is only seen when the main character hits his lowest ebb. Its not clear why this character is made to suffer so much as his guilt succumbs to an unsatisfying life. Jason's very linear narrative could have used a little more complexity on this end but is otherwise a work that strikes a dark chord in regards to lost innocence and lost life and the parallels between the two."},{"Title":"Hey, Wait...","review":"Jason's graphic novels are great. They flumox many people but I love them andfind them quite real in expressing human emotion. Great graphics."},{"Title":"Hey, Wait...","review":"I purchased this book based on the praise given in other reviews. I'm pretty well in touch with my feelings, but this book just didn't do it for me. The progression is disjointed and somewhat hard to follow and the portions that should have been emotional didn't really resonate with me. I also finished this in no more than thirty minutes. Overall, I'm just not pleased with this one."},{"Title":"Hey, Wait...","review":"I just read this last night and it blew me away. I read it after finishing Jason's other piece Why Are You Doing This? which I haven't been able to find on Amazon, but I find Hey, Wait! to be just as tragic, if not more-so.This story is incredibly sad. Part One reflects on the lives of two young boys who spend the summer days together, doing things normal kids would. They have a tight friendship, and events that would seem average in our lives are magnified just as they would be in the eyes of children. Instead of writing from an adult's perspective, Jason looks at each panel like the children would which makes the tragedy that takes place even more devastating.Part Two is just as important, as it follows the main character through the remainder of his life, dealing with the residue from Part One's tragedy. The metaphorical aspects are so strong sometimes it's hard to decipher them from real life events in the story, but I feel like that's the point. Not everything in life is spelled out for us, and Jason portrays his narratives in a way that exercises our minds, even if it with painfully real scenarios.I would recommend this book for anyone who is looking for a drastically different, bold comic."},{"Title":"Charity, Philanthropy, and Civility in American History","review":"I am puzzled by the acidity of the review by \\"J Onyx\\", who contrasts the supposedly unscholarly and \\"Marxist\\" authors of this collection with the scholarly \\"gentleman\\" Robert Bremner, who wrote various works on the history of American Philanthropy. J Onyx even speculates that these historians waited until Professor Bremner was gone before they published their writings.I was one of Professor Bremner's graduate students at Ohio State and assisted him with his revision of his classic work American Philanthropy. Bob Bremner was indeed a gentleman, and he treated other scholars with an irenic spirit even when he disagreed with them. It is impossible for me to imagine Bob Bremner being so uncharitable of other scholars as J Onyx, or engaging in such an acerbic and inaccurate misrepresentation of a work.This is an important collection of well-researched essays.

Within a few years of his election to the Papacy, his apostolic zeal took him to every continent with the Christian message of joy and hope. This book, &quot;A Pilgrim Pope&quot;, is a collection of the Pope's messages given out to peoples of various cultures during the course of his travels beginning in Poland in 1979, up to Romania in 1999. Cardinal Achille Silvestrini who was the Prefect of the Congregation for the Oriental Churches, has edited this collection, giving a valuable introduction to each message from the point of view of the context and the relevance of the message. But the message itself is in the form of excerpts from the Pope's speeches. Cardinal Pio Laghi has written a forward to this collection. This book, as a whole captures the man and mission of this pilgrim Pope."},{"Title":"Grandma's Wartime Baking Book: World War II and the Way We Baked","review":"This book, discusses food prep, rationing and offers a historical prospective to foods prepared and served during WWII. Rationing is well explained here. I became interested in WWII cooking after I read that diabetes, obesity etc levels DECREASED during the war years. I feel this is due in part to the rationing of fats and sugers. Grandma's Wartime Baking shares baking recipes that are lower in fat and sugar. Lemon, Huckleberry, and bread puddings are included here. The cookie section offers lower sugar treats such as Gingersnaps, Apple Butter, Carrot, and Prune cookies. The oatmeal icebox cookies are good as are the butterscotch Bars. 18 Cookie recipes are in the book. Also another factor is the lack of time many women experienced- a result of women going to work. Most of the recipes are not time comsuming. The muffin chapter is impressive. Muffins and quick breads were the ideal solution for busy moms in the morning. Applesauce muffins, Popovers, Orange Marmalade Bread and Quick Cheese Bread are only a few of the offerings. Other chapters include Celebration cakes, (wedding cake is here) Cakes, Cobblers, Pies, and on and on. The cover jacket is charming, with a WWII look to it and red checkered edging. 5 stars from me."},{"Title":"Grandma's Wartime Baking Book: World War II and the Way We Baked","review":"The previous reviewer did a wonderful job in summarizing the chapters of this book so I will refrain from repeating and instead will say that this book is a \\"good read\\".There are those out there that like to occasionally peruse cookbooks (and you know who you are) but in this case there is more to think about than whether you have all the ingredients on hand. It is interesting to contemplate how much WWI and WWII affected our culture and how adaptive our forebearers were when shortages occurred.

This year I chose to also bring the reality of rationing to my students and went in search of a cookbook to do the job. \\"Grandma's Wartime Baking Book\\" did just that.In addition to dozens of recipes, the author also provides plenty of stories, insights, and excerpts from period publications. For example, here's a conservation tip from the 1943 publication \\"Your Share\\": 'Save fresh fluid milk....rinse cream bottles with milk, and use with milk; rinse milk bottles with water, and use in cooking.' Evidently, the frugal homemaker didn't waste anything!I haven't tried very many recipes yet, but I did bake a couple batches of cookies to try and stress to my students what rationing was all about. I first made the carrot cookies on page 74, and then I tried the chocolate rolled oats cookies on page 75. Both of these recipes used no sugar--honey was used as a sweetener. And while both recipes only called for two cups of flour (remember sugar and flour were in limited supply during wartime), they both yielded the four dozen cookies stated in the recipe.

It may be a classic, but it really didn't do anything for me."},{"Title":"The Peculiar Institution: Slavery in the ante-bellum South","review":"Stampp's aim in writing this book was not to provide the complete and comprehensive last word on the subject of the American enslavement of Africans and their American descendents, nor to empathize with the oppressed slaves, nor to apologize for slavery, nor to echo the \\"voices\\" of slaves, nor to place it in the context of slavery around the world throughout human history (all of which are worthy topics which have been (and continue to be) addressed by other historians.Stampp's aim was to provide information lacking (in 1955, and still scant fifty years later) as to the nature of the institution itself, AS an American institution (which it certainly was up until its final (and sloppily inefficient) dismantling beginning 1863 (in the midst of the civil war). The \\"Peculiar\\" Insitution (so dubbed by slave owners themselves, in secret (and embarrassed) acknowledgement of the sheer hypocrisy of this institution. Stampp does not attack the morality of slavery, nor does he \\"witness\\" the evils of slavery through statements of slaves or abolitionists (he is not writing a polemic); instead he provides us with something far more useful: empirical data on just what the institution was, how it worked, what its practices were and what putative justifications were offered by its proponents for its existence and nature. In doing so, Stampp gives his readers a far more damning criticism of slavery than any other writer I have encountered since reading Stampp's book for a high school history class in 1969. Stampp expertly strips the subject of the emotion and bias (on both sides) that has obscured the facts (history is distinct from myth and propaganda to the extent that it is about *facts* assembled through valid inferences) about slavery.Some trite but persisting claims about slavery debunked by Stampp are:(1) the myth that all (or even a majority) of Southern whites owned slaves. [A white family had to be fairly well off even to afford owning even one slave; a huge proportion of whites were scarcely better off financially or in terms of workload than were many slaves.](2) the myth that the institution of slavery was in fact predicated upon \\"bettering\\" the lot of Africans, or even \\"taking care of them\\"(the view that blacks were incurably biologically, poltically, socially or otherwise \\"inferior\\" to whites. [Even thoough these arguments for various policies concerning the treatment of slaves were often argued by defenders of the Peculiar Institution, the facts of the actual practice of slave belie both of these claims. Adding up the actual \\"benefits\\" slaveowners offered blacks, the fact is that blacks were not subjected to any sort of \\"improvement\\". (Bible study, as Mark Twain -- still a key observer of the *realities* of slavery! -- served to entertain and enculturate slaves -- even subjugate them as a \\"lower class\\", NOT as moral or social improvement. Policies (actual practices, whatever the rhetoric) toward slaves did NOT lead towards freedom or citizenship at all. (Facts may be cold, as one review pointed out -- but they tend to outweigh rhetoric or sentiment) -- and they are far harder to dismiss or impeach. ](3) in connnection with (2), Stampp's collection of data belies the claim that the typical slaveowner had any education or insight into the \\"care and feeding\\" -- much less mental and moral development -- of Africans. The chapter on the theory and practice of diet and health as applied to slaves alone (a section guaranteed to make the reader physically queasy) says more about not only the awfulness of the institution slavery, but the incredible -- beyond incredible -- ignorance and poor (one could say \\"inferior\\") judgment of slave owners. The myth that slaves were \\"bred\\" (or even captured or bought (usually bought) in Africa) and \\"fed\\" and cared for with even the insight one needed to raise cattle is dispelled by Stampp. An typcial African in Africa, left to fend for his food and health in \\"the uncivilized jungles\\" of the \\"dark continent\\" stood a far bettter chance of living healthily and to a ripe age than the typical American slave (I am not even considering the most highly exploited slaves of the very deep south (or in the \\"island\\") who were literally worked to death -- even \\"well treated slaves\\" were raised and fed and cared in compliance with white superstituions that rivaled any African mystical practices.(4) One of the biggest myths addressed by Stampp is the myth that the slave economy was even a viable alternative to free enterprise (even in the most rudimentary and primitive sense of 'free enterprise' in which the free worker struggled to get work, do work, and earn enough to stay alive. Even if one writes off slaves as having absolutely NO value whatsoever as human beings to society (a direct and flagrant contradiction to the claims of pro-slave moralists -- but that's one of the many \\"peculiarities\\" of the Peculiar Institution!) Stampp provide data to show that as far as economic develop in America was concerned, slavery could be considered at best a poor alternative to other economic systems (not only \\"free enterprise, but even to \\"utopian closed-and-regulated societies, of which there were many then as now), a crutch to be abandoned at the earliest opportunity possible, not a \\"way of life\\", even for white slave owners, much less poor whites (who did NOT benefit from slavery economically, and only generated a sort of class resentment against African-American slaves.)And there are plenty of other insights to be found in this half-century-old book that make it still worth purchasing and reading. This book is rich with balanced, documented facts -- conspicuously missing or undervalued in today's \\"subjective viewpoint historian\\" arguments. A subjective viewpoint -- even one as twisted as that of the advocates and defenders of \\"the Peculiar Institution\\" -- is not easily or effective refuted by another subjective viewpoint. Facts speak for themselves, and Stampp does an excellent job of providing facts which completely undermine the romantic notions (pro and con) of slavery, and showe it for what it was, an inept, ill-conceived, irrational, contradictory, absurd, manifestly unproductive and unfair institution which, if subject to the sort of review institutions these days are accountable to, would never have passed the initial blueprint stage.Two final comments:(1) RE comments other reviewers have made about this book. The use of the word \\"negro\\" (critized by one reviewer as antiquated) in Stampp's 1955 preface, was NOT antiquated in 1955, but a term accepted (even preferred) by most African Americans. Given Stampp's meaning and use of the term, it is still acceptable by all but those persons (of any race) who can some how manage to read through the account of one of the most unbelievably sickening, savage and idiotic institutions in human history and only take offense at the use of the term \\"negro\\", and at a writer who has portrayed a remarkably faithful, accurate, insightful and *useful* look at \\"the land of the free\\" 's most infamous institution, the negative effects of which we (all of us) still feel today.(2) For the would-be reader still not convinced a book of this nature (neither a polemic now an apology, but an empirically based handbook on the pathology of slavery) is good or useful, I highly recommend this book as a useful good in examining the claims of modern-day oppressors (a large number, even if one restricts one's scope to the continent of Africa and the mid-East alone(!) ) that their nations or subcultures are \\"for the greater good\\", despite their differences from present-day American \\"culture\\". Stampp's book provides a methodology for evaluating such spurious claims the would-be sociologist, political scientist, anthropologist or other \\"critic\\" of contemporary human culture is seriously and truthfully and conscientiously attempting to evaluate.RDB"},{"Title":"The Peculiar Institution: Slavery in the ante-bellum South","review":"Professor Stampp's book on American Slavery was published in 1956-- two years after the Supreme Court's decision in Brown v Board of Education and at the beginning of the American Civil Rights Movement. At the time of its publication, the book was recognized as a seminal study of America's &quot;peculiar institution&quot;. Time has not changed the value of the book.The book attacks a picture of the Old South that attained wide currency after Reconstruction and was carried through American culture in works such as, for example, Gone With the Wind-- that plantation slavery was a benign institution, part of an agrarian way of life, that was accepted by both slave and master. Professor Stampp shows that slavery had an economic, commercial basis, that it was resisted by slaves overtly and covertly, and that led to squalor, cruelty and suffering by the slaves. The peculiar institution does not merit sentimintality in any form.In reading the book a half-century after its publication, and with some benefit of having read subsequent studies, I was struck with the moderate tone of the book. Yes, there were humane masters in an inhumane system and yes,there were variants in time and place. Stampp gives these variants their due, perhaps more than modern students would be inclined to do.I was stuck with the tone of slavery's defenders, pre Civil War and thereafter, describing the institution as &quot;patriarchal&quot;. Not only is that description in error, as Stampp shows, but for readers in a time beyond the mid 1950s, it is hardly a compliment to call a society &quot;patriarchal&quot;, even if it deserved this characterization.There has been a great deal of writing since the publication of this book on matters such as the nature of the slave trade, the presence, or lack of it, of an indigenous culture among the slaves, and the economic viability of slavery. These studies add to the picture that Professor Stampp has drawn.This is an essential book for the understanding of our Nation's history. Those looking for an introduction to the Ante-Bellum South could not do better than to read this book."},{"Title":"The Peculiar Institution: Slavery in the ante-bellum South","review":"This is a fabulous resource for educators. It is a straight to the point account of slavery. I use it often to teach the Civil War era. It is one of those books that reads like fiction. Super!"},{"Title":"The Peculiar Institution: Slavery in the ante-bellum South","review":"The Peculiar Institution is a detailed, logical book but it does not hold one's interest well. It is difficult to stay focused when attempting to wade through the details. Stampp addresses every issue, including the food eaten by slaves and how they ate it.There is not much prior knowledge expected of the reader. Stampp addresses the information he intends to disprove. For example, he shows that not all slaves wanted to escape their chains since many believed God wanted them to serve their masters.The sources used not only maintained Stampp's credibility, it added perspective. The slave owner's diaries and the diaries of the slaves were utilized and helped project everyone involved as human instead of the monsters they are depicted as in elementary school.It is interesting to take into account the time period in which this book was written, right after Brown v. Board and at the beginning of the civil rights movement. In a time when Gone With the Wind's pro-South sentiment was a popular way to remember the Civil War, Stampp's book must have changed many opinions.Overall, this is a useful history of slavery."},{"Title":"The Peculiar Institution: Slavery in the ante-bellum South","review":"In the mid-1950s, Jim Crow was still commonplace in the South, Brown vs. Board of Education made integration mandatory, and blacks refused to move to the \\"back of the bus,\\" leading the United States Supreme Court to condemn Alabama's segregated public transportation. Morrison Professor of History Emeritus at the University of California at Berkeley, and a specialist in nineteenth-century history, Kenneth M. Stampp wrote The Peculiar Institution; Slavery in the Ante-bellum South during the infancy of the civil rights movement. Stampp's book refutes the Gone With the Wind view of the paternalistic slaveowner and his \\"cheerful and acquiescent\\" bondsmen. (86)Southern slaveowners rationalized the ownership of black human beings for more than a century, and with greater vigor as the institution increasingly fell from acceptance in more liberal societies. Pro-slavery writers used \\"religious, historical, scientific, and sociological arguments to demonstrate that slavery was a positive good for both Negroes and whites.\\" (383) Stampp assumes the burden of proof, and meets each of these arguments head-on with irrefutable evidence taken from first person sources: inventories, diaries, newspaper advertisements and editorials, slave narratives, and the personal letters of slaveowners. He finds an \\"important form of protest\\" in the advertisements for runaway slaves, (110) \\"managerial inefficiency\\" not \\"evidence of the unprofitability of slavery\\" in the account books of debt-ridden planters, (391) and heartrending humanity in the letter of one slavewoman who, sold away, begged for her daughter, Jennie, to be restored to her, after their separation. (242)While debaters might quibble about the respective benefits slaves and slaveowners derived from slavery, there can be little debate about the mercenary benefits of the system. Stampp reserves his strongest arguments for his penultimate chapter, Profit and Loss. Slavery's defenders protested that slavery was unprofitable, in an effort to strengthen their claims of benevolent paternalism. The author's careful review of \\"the business records which many masters kept, and in the reports which some prepared for various publications,\\" he finds slave labor produced handsome profits, even for the small owners with just one or two slaves. The average slaveholder had moderate expenses, \\"the annual tax on able-bodied slaves was usually between fifty and seventy-five cents,\\" and with necessary items, such as \\"Negro shoes,\\" selling for a dollar or less, and annual food costs of between $7.50 and $15.00 per slave, the maintenance of a captive labor force seldom exceeded $35.00 a year per slave to the plantation owner. (405-406) Profits ranged from a very comfortable $250 a year per hand in the thriving southwest of the 1850s, to the Deep South where slaveholders seldom failed to reap returns of seven to ten percent annually. The bottom line is slavery was profitable, and continued to be profitable until emancipation. If free labor, or divestment of slaves and land, had proven itself to be a more profitable venture, surely the \\"peculiar institution\\" would have found few adherents.A more honest book on the slave experience had likely never been written when Kenneth Stampp took up the task. In his well-written and exhaustive history, he re-affirms the historian's \\"article of faith that knowledge of the past is a key to understanding the present.\\" In the preface, written in 1955, Stampp acknowledges that \\"American Negroes . . . still strive to break what remains of the caste barriers first imposed upon them in slavery days.\\" (vii) More than fifty years later this book is still relevant, and deserves to be called a classic of antebellum American History."},{"Title":"The Peculiar Institution: Slavery in the ante-bellum South","review":"One of the main reasons I picked up The Peculiar Institution was to learn why a nation that was founded on the basis of a popular government would then turn around and aggressively import African slaves. The book tells of the creation of the institution of slavery in the New World as something that evolved, rather than something that European settlers consciously constructed.It also does a good job of discussing the demographics and economics of slavery. Only a small number of white people in the south owned slaves, and those that did usually owned just one. Yet, because ownership of the vast majority of slaves was concentrated in the hands of a few, most slaves lived on huge plantations. Because slave labor was so cheap, business managers would frequently choose to buy or lease out slaves for work. This forced free labor to compete with the slaves for jobs and wages declined.These portions of the book are utterly fascinating, and I couldn't put the book down. However, there was a bit more than I really cared to know about the average diet of slaves, and it seemed to belabor the rather obvious fact that free whites were usually able to commit violent crimes against black slaves with impunity. In these sections the book dragged a bit, and I felt that the author would have done the reader a favor by cutting a few of the 400+ pages."},{"Title":"The Peculiar Institution: Slavery in the ante-bellum South","review":"If you are a \\"lay reader\\" first venturing into a study of Southern slavery, then this may not be the place to start. However, for scholars, students, and those with a foundation in the topic, Stampp's \\"Peculiar Institution\\" is a must-read.Admittedly, his writing is deep, yet it is vital and relevant. Stamp is a myth-buster busting myths with first-hand quotes, statistics, and primary sources.

The controversial line in the Preface, \\"...Negroes are, after all, only white men with black skins\\" obviously falls short in terms of culture, identity and power relations. But back in 1956, asserting equality among peoples was a big advance in understanding compared to Ulrich Phillips' work. Exhaustively using the same kinds of plantation sources as Phillips, Stampp revived the neo-abolitionist interpretation and reshaped our view of US slavery, crafting a book that remains the essential starting point for all later work. Further advances built upon this achievement, notably by using direct slave testimony (personal narratives, the WPA oral histories), but the perspective of later studies such as J. Blassingame, \\"The Slave Community\\" and E. Genovese, \\"Roll Jordan Roll\\" is similarly sympathetic to those held in bondage. The other main shortcoming is that Stampp deals mostly with the 1830-60 period while assuming it represented the overall experience of American enslavement, which it did not. It is still a monument of 20th-century historiography by any standard."},{"Title":"The Peculiar Institution: Slavery in the ante-bellum South","review":"This work was a turning point in historiography of slavery in America. As such, I find it essential to a personal collection of American Civil War history books."},{"Title":"The Peculiar Institution: Slavery in the ante-bellum South","review":"This book was excellent since Mr.Stampp doesn't impress his conclusions on the reader but rather presents a landscape of the ante-bellum south inwhich the reader can for there own opinion."},{"Title":"The Peculiar Institution: Slavery in the ante-bellum South","review":"This book is written in a style similar to \\"The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire\\", \\"The Wealth of Nations\\" and \\"The Origin of Species\\"--That manner is the machine gun-like statement of fact after fact. Stampp intends to and does limit his discussion to the impact of Black slavery upon Blacks in anAnglo-Saxon world. He does not venture much into arguments that slavery or serfdom existed until the 19th century in Eastern Europe as well as in Africa itself and some of the Arab world. Nor does Stampp tell anything of the great harm done the greater society. He does go into the economics of slavery a bit- enough to see the future. It is quite evident that slavery was on the way out and the Civil War pushed up the date perhaps 10 or 20 years. He does not go much into the moral ambiguity among the White civilization. Thomas Jefferson believed the presence of the Blacks in North America was a mortal danger.Perhaps Stampp has done the best thing in leaving unsaid thetragedy visited upon Western civilization in favor of the tragedy visited upon the slaves, with some small discussion of the \\"why\\" of Black presence and the \\"why\\" of Black slavery.His attention placed as it is lends greater purity to the history. The weakness of the book is any attention to happiness which slaves, perhaps a minority of slaves, enjoyed.This absence tends the book toward a work of propaganda rather than an history. Stampp's book is worth reading. It should not be taken as the whole story, not by a long shot!"},{"Title":"The Peculiar Institution: Slavery in the ante-bellum South","review":"I agree with other reviewers that this book is good. Good, but not to be taken, in my opinion, as the final authority on the subject. Prof. Stampp does not give enough detail concerning his credentials on this subject, and the other thing I object to in general is not that this book exists, but that, like so many others, it concentrates on the institution in the South, and glosses over the role played by our Northern brethren (who btw had much more racist opinions of blacks than southerners at that time as evidenced by their restrictive laws - and why the underground railway ended in Canada and not in a northern state) in buying and transporting these poor souls for profit and fortunes (all of which they and their heirs got to KEEP, not like in the South where all was lost), and the roles played by just about every nation at the time, not to mention the 500 years of slavery the black man suffered under the Islamic rule.Anyone really interested in the subject should be required to read Rawick's 'The American Slave' based on the Slave Narratives which are interviews taken from actual former slaves during the 1930's. This is hearing it from the horses' mouth, so to speak, for the good and bad aspects.Personally, my studies have brought me to believe that if handed the situation of slavery (which of course I would never have permitted in the first place), that immediate freedom ultimately was a great injustice to blacks. Given the situation at hand, blacks today would be much better off had slavery first been regulated so that it could have been gradually phased out in an organized and deliberate manner instead of people being 'turned out to pasture like cattle' with no education, no way of livelihood, and at a time when the entire South (even whites) were hard pressed to make a living. I, myself, could write a book on this subject, but suffice it to say that this is why I believe we have suffering today among blacks that are the result of parentless or fatherless homes, lack of education, lack of respect, and lack of culture. It has only been about 4 or 5 generations since the end of slavery, and the first 3 of these not much progress was made because everyone was living poorly. This is not that long of time to right such a terrible wrong, and the correct and best way of righting it might not have necessarily been to seek the fastest and most immediate."},{"Title":"The Peculiar Institution: Slavery in the ante-bellum South","review":"Kenneth Stamp's work demarcates a position in Black and White Studies regarding the efficacies of American slavery. The problem with this book is that it does exactly what slavery did which supposed to be rational and pragmatic but the Enlightenment made more problems than it ever solved.Slavery is one such problem and while Stamp examines the necessity of slavery, suggestions that it \\"evolved\\" rather than was consciously constructed to maximize profit regardless of human consequences to slavers or the enslaved are a complete msireading of what the book and slavery suggests. Stamp's book is a useful piece in the total picture of slavery but it is by NO MEANS the most significant or even the most current.Everything in a canon is not there because it's good. This book is in the canon because of it's succinct economic examination of slavery. As such, Stamp completely neglects to examine racism, the thinking that justified slavery and still exists depsite the fact that plantation slavery no longer exists!"},{"Title":"Searching for Isabel Godin","review":"This was a very interesting book about a little known woman in history.

The first difficulty is Mr. Douglas's massive ego. The second problem is that, regardless of how unbiased he thinks he is, he cannot look at these cases with a fresh eye. I found myself disagreeing with almost all of his \\"most likely\\" suspects and felt that he disregarded relevant information because it didn't fit his theories. I do think that if Mr. Douglas had profiled these cases with no preconceived notions, the outcome would have been significantly different.The book is an interesting look at several famous cases, but don't expect to know whodunit when you finish this book."},{"Title":"The Cases That Haunt Us: From Jack The Ripper To Jon Benet Ransey, The","review":"As die-hard true crime buff I have read most of FBI top profiler John E. DOUGLAS' books, so THE CASES THAT HAUNT US was mandatory reading for me.This time, he revisits some of the most shocking and infamous crimes of the last 120 years, and takes a new approach towards them utilizing modern criminal behavioral analysis and profiling. The book offers a vast array of cases in chronological order, starting with the notorious prostitue killer Jack the Ripper in 1889 's London's Eastend, and encompassing 1892's Lizzie BORDEN case (BORDEN was tried for murdering her father and stepmother with an axe, but aquitted), the tragic case of the LINDBERG kidnapping and the horrifying deeds of the Zodiac killer, a Californian serial killer of the late 1960ies/early 1970ies, up to the murder of six-year old JonBenet RAMSEY on Christmas Eve 1996 (the only case in the book in which DOUGLAS was personally involved).It is true that several cases were never solved with no perpetrator brought to justice, and it is impossible to prove DOUGLAS's conclusions one way or another. Often decades have passed, and none of the people involved in the crime are alive. However DOUGLAS' conclusions are based on experiences and knowledge gained in a long career in law enforcement as profiler and head of the FBI's Investigative Support Unit (ISU). His observations and conclusions are absolutely convincing. Needless to say that they often contradict popular perceptions of particular cases. Take for example the Jack the Ripper case - I don't want to repeat here what the authors have to say (and hereby spoil your reading pleasure), but unsurprisingly the killer in DOUGLAS' view is NOT the type of &quot;glamourous&quot; murder (like Prince Eddie, the Duke of Clarence, supported by some kind of fancy conspirators) so often found in books and films about this haunting crime.DOUGLAS'in-depth analysis of the cases with meticulous attention to details makes for fascinating reading.My favorite chapters are the ones on Jack the Ripper and the horrible murder of JonBenet RAMSEY.There are some pictures in the books, but with the exception of some maps I did not find them very helpful or interesting.The book is well-written.If you are a true crime fan like me, you will dig it!"},{"Title":"The Cases That Haunt Us: From Jack The Ripper To Jon Benet Ransey, The","review":"John Douglas spent 25 years profiling for the FBI. In the book Mindhunter we learned about his exploits in that capacity.In this book however Douglas turns the pages of history giving us the inside scoop of \\"what really happened\\" in some of history's most intriguing crime cases.JACK THE RIPPERIn the most thorough treatment I've yet read, Douglas describes the murders themselves and tells us how a profiler would use those details. Gone sadly are the really interesting theories like maybe someone from the Royal household did it.But left is the even more tragic notion that Jack the Ripper was just a common ordinary sort, unusual only in his contempt for women. Properly, Douglas shows that modern apprehension techniques would of course have identified Jack long before he claimed his last victim.LIZZIE BORDENAs with Jack the Ripper, Douglas recounts the details. \\"Someone\\" used an axe to hatchet Lizzie's father over twenty times and her step mother over ten. Following how Lizzie interacted with investigator's early on, Douglas tells the believable story of a woman who litterally got away with murder because a prejudices that a woman couldn't not have killed like she did and also of course the fact that Lizzie Borden had an enormous amount of money to use in her defense.THE LINDBERGH KIDNAPPINGLike all good books, this one provides an additional insight on this case that I hadn't thought of before: namely that Bruno Hauptman, the supposed kidnapper did NOT act alone. In recounting the facts and making his case, Douglas made me a believer even though I'd previously thought the case against Hauptman individually was pretty airtight.THE RAMSEY CASEHaving served as a paid expert on this matter, Douglas provides the unique insight he got from having personal contact with the Ramseys. Again using his profiling techniques Douglas showed how the Coloroda police were right not to charge these people. In a then throw away point (the book is from 2000) Douglas observed how the child's body was not wrapped like one would expect if a parent was the murderer.In reading that detail I thought of the Casey Anthony case and wondered just what Douglas would have to say about more modern murder cases.Not only is this book highly recommended but here's hoping Douglas writes again to bring us more up to date insights on even more recent cases."},{"Title":"The Cases That Haunt Us: From Jack The Ripper To Jon Benet Ransey, The","review":"This book is great. Mr. Douglas is obviously a very credible researcher and he is also a very good author. From Jack The Ripper to The Zodiac Killer, from Lizzie Borden to the Boston Strangler this book is covering all the great unsolved cases of the last century.I'm giving this book 4 stars because of two things: The very controversial chapter about JonBenet Ramsey, and I thought Mr. Douglas should've shared a little more of his wisdom about the Black Dahlia murder, this part of the book was way too short.But overall this book is a must own for all True Crimes investigators/fans. :)"},{"Title":"The Cases That Haunt Us: From Jack The Ripper To Jon Benet Ransey, The","review":"I work for a state investigatory agency, so these books always catch my interest. I was familiar with the famous \\"Mindhunter\\", but not so much with his literary works. I can say that I picked up a TON of useful knowledge that can be applied to my own job.On a case-by-case basis, I would agree with some of the NEGATIVE reviews that he may have been a little self-aggrandizing during the Ramsey chapter. I found it a little long and tedious and a little too much about him and not enough about what actually happened. I found the potential scenarios at the end to be the best part of that chapter.As far as the other chapters go, they were all fascinating. I learned so much that I never knew about any of the cases before. I never knew about the trial of Lizzie Borden, or the details of the Lindbergh baby kidnapping, etc. The only case I had any familiarity with was the Bambi case, which makes sense because I'm in Wisconsin. My favorite chapter was the Zodiac Killer chapter. I truly learned a lot. I like how each chapter pretty much gave the story's background, then how the case was handled, and then what he would have done in the case. I really liked it.I read this book with my longtime reading partner, and this was a tangent from the books we usually read. We both liked it, but she was more into the stories, and I was more into the analysis of what the Mindhunter would have done. That's what made this book really good to me ... and gave us more to talk about."},{"Title":"The Cases That Haunt Us: From Jack The Ripper To Jon Benet Ransey, The","review":"A very interesting analysis of a number of famous crimes which includes a review of available facts and some probable perpetrators using profiling interpretations and what makes sense and what doesn't. These two authors work well together and have written some fascinating books. As to the crimes addressed in this one, some were very familiar to me and others were not. I have never read much about Jack the Ripper and enjoyed learning about what the murders actually involved and gained some information about the time period. The conclusions in this book make sense to me. On the other hand, I have read everything that I have been able to find about Lizzie Borden and came to the same conclusions that this book comes to. The Lindbergh kidnappings are another one that I have only heard of and I found the conclusions were logical and provided information about what can happen when law enforcement doesn't keep control of an investigation. John Douglas is truly a genius in the area of crime analysis and profiling. As with most fields of endeavor, this one is part science and part art and his skills obviously include both arenas. Having also read a lot about JonBenet Ramsey, I think he is wrong in his conclusions about this crime. Before I read this book, I assumed that he was co-opted by the money that he was paid by the parents to consult about who killed this little girl. Having read this book, I have changed my mind. I think what happened is that he liked the parents too much to be objective. They probably have a lot in common, being fairly wealthy, educated, Caucasian people. I found myself shaking my head at some of the conclusions that were drawn that seem to be in opposition to the evidence. I highly recommend this book to all who are interested in true crime and how investigations are completed. Whether a person agrees with the conclusions or not, a person will definitely learn a lot about the process and the dangers to be avoided if the right person or persons is to be brought to justice."},{"Title":"The Cases That Haunt Us: From Jack The Ripper To Jon Benet Ransey, The","review":"A very good book, hard to put down. I was hoping Mr. Douglas was going to tell us the who-dun-it in each case, but most of the cases are very old, and instead, he told us how he would have handled them with today's technology and personality profiling. Still, very interesting."},{"Title":"The Cases That Haunt Us: From Jack The Ripper To Jon Benet Ransey, The","review":"I went into this book for the JonBenet Ramsey chapter, thinking John Douglas had sold out to the Ramseys when they hired him to consult on their case. But I have to say, JD changed my mind. I no longer believe the Ramseys killed their own daughter.JD brought a fresh and enlightening viewpoint to the Ripper case and convinced me Scotland Yard had their man, but couldn't prove it. The Zodiac chapter was also nicely done. I would have to say the Lindbergh kidnapping was the hardest chapter to get through. It's hard to make old cases fresh if there isn't compelling new information. Good read for the crime buff."},{"Title":"The Cases That Haunt Us: From Jack The Ripper To Jon Benet Ransey, The","review":"Let me start off by saying that I've read all of John Douglas's books and that excepting Mindhunter and The Anatomy of Motive, this is perhaps the most interesting since it combines two of my greatest passions: history and true crime. Moreover, I've a great deal of respect for the work which, Mr. Douglas does. True, at times he may come off as a being a bit cocky, but it is unquestionably clear that he truely cares about all the victims of violent crime as well as bringing their killers to justice. That is precisely why I find his books so appealing.In The Cases that Haunt Us, Douglas looks at five fascinating and mostly unsolved cases: Jack the Ripper, Lizzie Borden, Lindbergh, Zodiac and JonBonet Ramsey. First, he comprehensively lays out the known facts and then gives his professional opinion concerning who the culprit was likely to have been or, at least, what type of personality they would have had. In chapter five, Douglas also gives shorter, but interesting accounts of The Black Dahlia, Lawrencia Bemebenek, and the Boston Strangler cases.The only reason I have not given the book five stars is that I believe that including the JonBenet Ramsey case might have been a mistake. Please don't get me wrong! I do not say this because I disagree with Douglas's conclusion that the killer was someone other than one of the parents. The truth is that while (like so many others) I once believed that either Patricia or John Ramsey must be guilty; after reading this book, I began to doubt that that was indeed the case. And, since it has recently been revealed that a convicted pedophile was staying right down the block at the same time as the murder occured, I have even more doubts than before. Still, perhaps the case is too fresh because so many people have strong (though mostly emotionally based) opinions on the subject. Unfortunatly, it seems that many have concluded that Douglas's professional judgement was clouded by his own emotions concerning the JonBenet case. I disagree entirely. After reading John Douglas for years, I have absolutely no doubts that if the evidence pointed to either Patricia or John Ramsey as the killer of their little girl, he would say so and more importantly do everything in his power to see to it that they eventually paid for their crime.In closing, The Cases that Haunt Us is a very fascinating and informative read for anyone interested in either true crime or history, so long as they leave any preconceived notions at the door."},{"Title":"The Cases That Haunt Us: From Jack The Ripper To Jon Benet Ransey, The","review":"I couldn't wait to read this book, and when I started it, I couldn't put it down. Douglas is a master profiler, and he covered the cases that have most interested me, JonBenet Ramsey, Lizzie Borden and the Black Dahlia. Those are the three cases that have &quot;haunted&quot; me. Although I never was much interested in the Ripper murders and thought I had heard and read all I really wanted about the Lindbergh kidnapping, I found Douglas' perspective to be incredibly interesting. What he does is what any professional person should do; he looks at the evidence, the victim and the details of the crime and puts aside emotional aspects that cause people to &quot;jump to conclusions&quot; without being objective."},{"Title":"The Cases That Haunt Us: From Jack The Ripper To Jon Benet Ransey, The","review":"This book gives an inside look into some of histories most watched cases.

He carefully de-structures crime scenes, profiles key suspects, and creates the victimology with the skill of a commanding storyteller. These stories are haunting because they're true. A great read for fans of Douglas and a great intro for readers who are new to his books."},{"Title":"The Cases That Haunt Us: From Jack The Ripper To Jon Benet Ransey, The","review":"Finally, a true crime book that takes the evidence into account. Douglas in this book presents the facts and from them logically presents his theory on who the killers were. There is no wild conspiracy theories, just conclusions based on the evidence.Refreshing too is the conclusion he makes in the Ripper case that the Ripper was ***** or some one with these traits."},{"Title":"The Cases That Haunt Us: From Jack The Ripper To Jon Benet Ransey, The","review":"I feel this is the most interesting true crime book I've ever read. It's full of interesting history along with the crime. Douglas lays out all the details in a clear step by step manner. He comes to conclusions that appear so obvious that when you're done, you wonder how anyone missed them. Everyone I've lent this book to loves it also.Douglas and Olshaker do a wonderful job of gathering the many and sundry details on each case into clear and concise chapters. I've read up on many of these cases before - in much longer books - and not got all the details I get gathered together right here. The authors then tie up the details into a neat package and Douglas gives his analysis of the crime. He addresses the different theories floating around and makes a strong case for his opinion. My favorite chapter is the one on Lizzy Borden."},{"Title":"The Cases That Haunt Us: From Jack The Ripper To Jon Benet Ransey, The","review":"Excellent book by the master profiler, John Douglas.

His writing style is surprisingly well polished and entertaining. If you studied Psychology (as I did) this book is a must read if you have any interest in the criminal or forensic side. His analysis of the Jon Benet Ramsey case is very controversial but it is the high light of this book. It forced me to do a complete 180 and I believe that his conclusions are right on the mark. I know someone that worked at the FBI while he was there and his reputation is genuine though not superhuman. In real life, the Behavioral Sciences Unit can't contribute on many occassions because there isn't enough initial data. If there isn't much to go on from the beginning or if its a random act they aren't able to construct a viable profile. That said, Douglas has almost single handedly created a new field that has provided immense value and his is a brilliant person. This is a book for people that don't mind immersing themselves in something for several days until its done."},{"Title":"The Cases That Haunt Us: From Jack The Ripper To Jon Benet Ransey, The","review":"A true crime buff, I enjoyed this cross-section of cases, as presented by a longtime detective. The cases, which include Jack the Ripper, the Zodiac Killer, Lizzie Borden, and JonBenet Ramsey, are presented in a straightforward, factual manner, which nonetheless manages to give readers a sense of understanding about the victims -- and the killers, too.Even if you aren't really into true crime, I'd recommend picking up this book -- it's important to know about some of the most well-known crimes in history, which in turn shaped popular culture and society."},{"Title":"The Cases That Haunt Us: From Jack The Ripper To Jon Benet Ransey, The","review":"I initially picked this book up to read what John Douglas had to say about the Jonbenet Ramsey case. I'll comment on that as well. But the remainder of the book was just as interesting and engaging. Well researched, balanced, very well written and non-biased. Douglas never disappoints.But best of all, he is among the first I know of to go against the 'court of public opinion' and to remind us that we have a doctrine in this country entitled &quot;innocent until proven guilty.&quot; He clarifies why we would be well served to allow the Ramsey's that basic right. I agree with his conclusions about the Ramsey's innocence and am grateful for his public stance in stating what the facts bear out rather than going along with a media-made popular and well oiled agency strategy intended to cover up departmental blunders.Imagine the collective apology as a culture we will owe the Ramsey family when we discover that Douglas is right.Thanks John Douglas, for your hard work, your excellent book and your integrity in standing up for a family that is (carefully and understandably cautiously) doing everything within their power to solve the tragic murder of their young child. If your readers ever find themselves in the position of the Ramsey family, and they certainly could, I hope they are so lucky as to encounter investigative professionals as well informed and courageous as you."},{"Title":"The Cases That Haunt Us: From Jack The Ripper To Jon Benet Ransey, The","review":"FBI veteran John Douglas (with Mark Olshaker) takes a detailed, analytical look at several infamous crimes including Jack the Ripper, Lizzie Borden, The Lindbergh Baby, Zodiac Killer, Joan Benet-Ramsey, etc. Only two of these crimes were solved, and even then some wondered if justice had prevailed. As an FBI agent Douglas has tracked killers via investigative techniques and personality profiling. Here he strives to establish truth without any seeming prejudices. Of course, establishing the truth in difficult cases isn't easy, and the result is many best guesses by the author. I found parts of their book to be a bit staid or long-winded, but a good investigator needs to be thorough. I particularly liked the coverage of the Lindbergh Kidnapping, where Douglas concludes that Bruno Hauptman was almost certainly guilty (he was hanged) but probably had accomplices (something the court doubted). I wasn't quite convinced in a couple other cases (like JonBenet Ramsey), but Douglas' approach remains logical and persuasive. Also, if Olshaker was not just co-author but co-investigator let's give him credit too. If you like thorough investigations and don't mind a detailed read, this book may be for you."},{"Title":"The Cases That Haunt Us: From Jack The Ripper To Jon Benet Ransey, The","review":"Please don't be duped by the ad hominem arguments of the negative reviews against the person of John Douglas. They tell you NOTHING about this book. Read it and make up your own mind. Seriously, the \\"disagreements\\" (they don't even rise to the dignity of being called disagreements but I have to call them something) are based on prejudiced condemnations of Jonbenet's parents. Their arguments are inductive conspiracy-like nonsense that want answers where there are none. They claim Douglas is arrogant. Defending one's self is not arrogant but even if it were, so what? One can be arrogant and right at the same time. Also arrogance is an inflated view of one's self, read the book, his estimations of his own abilities are backed up by facts and an overall authoritative countenance. I bought this book not caring at all about the Jonbenet Ramsey case, I knew only a little more about John Douglas having read \\"Mindhunter\\" and enjoyed it. His arguments absolving Jon Ramsey are practically air tight and his defense of Patsy leaves his (Douglas's) opponents looking very foolish. He even starts the chapter defending himself against the ridiculous claims that you can read right here on Amazon; read the eight lame one star reviews that are currently on here and try not to laugh.The reason why I picked the book up was for the Jack the Ripper case thinking that applying criminal psychological profiling could be an interesting approach. I have never burned through a book faster. I mention in my reviews frequently that I have ADD and dyslexia and I don't want to keep beating that drum but it means a lot to me to read a book that keeps my attention. I have a friend at work who never reads and when I let him read it he could not put it down either. Truly a gratifying experience to read this. His conclusions are responsible, he will say when profiling does not give answers and in the case of the Zodiac he deliberately withholds the name of his primary suspect for just that reason. If you are familiar with these cases already you probably can go to a book store and skim this because he assumes you don't know everything about the cases so seasoned veterans of the subject have some things to gain but may be bored with his historical approach. His conclusion on Jack the Ripper is very compelling and is just part of a really well written book. I envy you if you know little about these cases and this is your introduction you are in for a Hell of a ride. Very, very good read, enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Cases That Haunt Us: From Jack The Ripper To Jon Benet Ransey, The","review":"An excellent book. There is nobody writing today who is more insightful on the subject of profiling and catching murderers.I notice most people who gave him one-star reviews were those who didn't believe his opinion that the Ramseys were innocent. I used to think they were guilty, but the news was just released that DNA from an intruder was found inside and outside JonBenet's underwear and they are working on a genetic profile of the real killer. Vindication for the author's unpopular opinion on this topic."},{"Title":"The Cases That Haunt Us: From Jack The Ripper To Jon Benet Ransey, The","review":"Douglas and Olshaker have done their usual stellar job in recounting several famous unsolved murders and approaching them from a 21st century perspective. They strip away all the sensationalism that surrounded these cases and focus in on the profiling that has proven correct so many times. What kind of person would have committed this crime? In this particular way, leaving behind these particular clues? This book has the some of the answers.The cases given such scrutiny are London's Jack the Ripper murders, Lizzie Borden and the hatchet murders of her father and step-mother, the kidnapping and murder of the Lindbergh baby, California's Zodiac killer, and the JonBenet Ramsey murder. Other cases encapsulated in one chapter illustrating the power of motive to make or break a case are the Black Dahlia homicide, the Lawrencia Bembeneck case, and the Boston Strangler killings.It is fascinating to get to the heart of the matter, especially in the Ripper and Borden cases, and zero in on \\"just the facts\\" of who was there who had the motive, means, and opportunity to commit these crimes in this particular way? In the days before criminal profiling and behavioral analysis, it seemed as though it must be a crazed fiend running around killing people. Certainly not a God-fearing, Sunday School teacher of good family bashing in the heads of the parents to obtain a higher level of existence for herself. That speaks strongly to motive: who else but Lizzie (and her sister Emma) stood to gain if her parents were dead? Not a crazed fiend, but the Borden sisters themselves.Obviously a crazed fiend was responsible for the Ripper murders, for which Douglas produces a likely suspect. It was either this man, or someone very much like him. Someone who, after the last murder, disintegrated to such an extent he was institutionalized and died soon after. This makes more sense than, say, an elaborate conspiracy plot involving members of the Victorian royal family.Douglas dissects the crime to its individual components and adds them up to a behavioral profile and then compares this to the existing suspects. The best match is the likeliest culprit. Douglas seems less arrogant here than in other works; perhaps he worked on analyzing his own behavior!Also, another reviewer made the point that Douglas is inconsistent with his findings. His or her example is that Douglas doubts that an intruder broke in to the Borden home, killed Mrs. Borden, then waited 90 minutes and killed Mr. Borden. But it made perfect sense to Douglas that someone broke into the Ramsey home and waited hours for them to come home, go to sleep, and then abduct and murder JonBenet. His findings do make sense when you consider that the Borden home was an extremely small (even for the day) house, with no place to hide without being seen by someone. The Ramsey house was a very large and warren-like, which could have afforded an intruder ample places to wait for hours.I've got to say, Douglas has definitely changed my mind on the JonBenet Ramsey case; the combination of a compromised crime scene, incorrect suppositions, and tabloid sensationalism have contributed to a hopelessly muddled case which will in all probability never be solved. But Douglas is pretty persuasive that it was not John and Patsy Ramsey.I noticed a few typos, but all in all, a ripping good read!"},{"Title":"The Cases That Haunt Us: From Jack The Ripper To Jon Benet Ransey, The","review":"This is a great premise: using current profiling techniques to examine crimes from Jack the Ripper to the JonBenet Ramsey murder. John Douglas, \\"America's foremost expert on criminal profiling\\", presents the facts of the cases, the crimes themselves and the crime scenes, and the suspects. Then, by applying profiling techniques to the information at hand, he explains what type of UNSUB he would expect would have committed the crime, and outlines whether the suspects fit or don't fit the profile and why. Although he doesn't \\"solve\\" any of these crimes, he presents a well reasoned explanation of why he thinks someone was wither guilty or not guilty in each case.I have read extensively on the Ripper, Lizzie Borden, and Black Dahlia cases, and found his profiles on those to be fascinating. I am, however, disturbed by his profiling in the JonBenet Ramsey case. Here, Douglas doesn't come across as being as impartial as he was in the other cases. Of course, he was brought in by the Ramseys' attorneys to give his opinion as to whether or not he thought either one of them could have killed JonBenet; he does not think that either is guilty. Because of this, and the criticisms that have come his way from his involvement in this case, this chapter comes across as much more strident, more \\"I'm right! I'm right! Any whoever says I'm not is WRONG!\\" This quickly becomes annoying. However, that said, I will say that he did give me points to consider about that murder that I had not considered before. But I think the book would have been stronger without this last chapter; it makes you wonder if the rest of the book wasn't just written to allow Douglas to ultimately discuss the JonBenet murder, and to predispose you to believe his presentation of this sad case."},{"Title":"The Cases That Haunt Us: From Jack The Ripper To Jon Benet Ransey, The","review":"This is a fascinating read.The idea behind this book is that John Douglas and Mark Olshanker look at some of the unsolved cases through out history that have continued to be of interest to the public. Through the evidence and accounts of each crime, they try to apply the FBI behavioral science that has been developed since these crimes as a way to 'solve' each crime.Beginning with Jack the Ripper and ending with the Jon Benet-Ramsey murder with a wide variety of unsolved, famous crimes in between this book is just plain fascinating. They begin with a description of the crime, the crime scene and the people involved. Then they begin to explain and catagorize what they can learn from the known facts on hand. They explore possible solutions that have been provided by other authors and try to decide if these solutions fit the crime through a behavioral science point of view. They then provide what they think might be the appropriate solution.One thing I appreciated about this book was that these authors constantly stress that they can not prove their solution is correct, only that it fits what they know to be facts and the behavior science views. They do not belittle other authors or police, in fact, they are constantly praising the good job the police have done in each case. The stress that this is an exact science at best due to it being a behavioral science and a people science.Another thing I appreciated about this book was that it was peppered with a variety of cases that the author had personally worked on and stories of criminal the author had personally interviewed. Rather than being distracting, these short stories only support his theories and go a long ways to explaining exactly what the authors are talking about.I rated this a four mainly for one reason: I find that many of the sentences are long and convoluted. I find that I have to go back to reread a sentence at times to be sure I understand what the sentence was saying. Maybe others won't find this to be an issue, but it occurs just often enough that it disturbs me.Overall, this is a very fascinating read."},{"Title":"The Cases That Haunt Us: From Jack The Ripper To Jon Benet Ransey, The","review":"Many readers may want to read this book to read about John solving these cases that have gone unsolved, but that is not the case. Once again, John Douglas has created a masterpiece that gives great intellicetual insight to these unsolved cases and gives his opinions and theories as to what happened.

Even though there are no clear cut answers to these cases, he does provide a lot of thought provking facts that make you really think \\"who did it\\"...if you know anything about John Douglas and the work his unit does, you would know he does not name suspects, ever.

This book is different though in that it provides a profiling look at famous cases from the long ago past and not so long ago. Lizzie Borden, Baby Lindberg, and Zodiac, among several others. I've read all of the books on profiling these authors have written and have found each one informative and interesting. I bought this book for myself but I'm buying several copies to send to friends. Another &quot;must read&quot; for those who want to have more insight into the killer mind than the daily newspapers provide. I've learned a lot about what to be aware of in my own enviornment and what crime scenes reveal about the &quot;personality&quot; of the killer. To John Douglas and Mark Olshaker - Bravo!"},{"Title":"The Cases That Haunt Us: From Jack The Ripper To Jon Benet Ransey, The","review":"Wow! This book was very enjoyable. John Douglas, with his usual serious yet cocky flair, proceeds to recap some of the most famous crimes in history. He covers Jack the Ripper, Lizzie Borden, the Zodiac, The JonBenet Ramsey murder, the Lindbergh Baby, Black Dahlia, the Boston Strangler, and a few more. He doesn't proceed to recap OJ Simpson or other cases which have received more than their fair share of attention, with the exception of the JonBenet Ramsey case, and this one I think he covers because he feels that the media misrepresented the parents. He gives background of what happened, the accused and their important behavioral traits, trials (if any) and a profile of what the killer would have been like. Fascinating stuff!I like John Douglas. The writing style of his books, including occasional profanity inserted for emphasis, really keeps your attention. He is not overly graphic, yet doesn't sugar-coat a thing. And although he does seem to like himself an awful lot, he does not profess to be an expert on all subjects, only those he can back up with skills and experience. This book will intrigue you and keep your interest from cover to cover.One thing I would have changed about this book- I would have added a few more unsolved cases. Perhaps lesser known, yet equally intriguing cases would have been a good addition to this book. It just seemed to be too short a book to me!"},{"Title":"The Cases That Haunt Us: From Jack The Ripper To Jon Benet Ransey, The","review":"I've read some, but not a lot on almost all the cases in this book. I found this fascinating reading, partially because Douglas gives us an edited view into a world most of us are interested in, but really don't want to be immersed in. He has admitted before that his job took a familial and health toll on him, and most of us recognize that we would even be less prepared for what this 'world' requires of those who work in it.The stories/cases are especially interesting because of the insight which Douglas can give. I thought the histories of the Ripper and Borden cases were especially good. I had no idea of the historical and social context of the area in London where the Ripper resided, and the lack of forensic evidence does not seem to interfere much with the common sense with which Douglas proposes specific possible suspects.As others have said, all I read on the Jon Benet murder was from the slanted information given through the media. Plus as a mother, I was horrified by the dressing up of this little girl to look like someone older than she was. Douglas provides a different point of view with validity, that I don't see being portrayed in the media. We definitely should not be trying people though the media...we cannot possibly know all the facts, especially when others involved (including the police, the FBI, friends of the family, etc.) all provide divergent views. I am not sure what I believe at this point, but I think I will reserve judgement in most cases from now on and also curtail my exposure to the news media's take on cases like this...As usual, Douglas and company write a good, and intelligent book for readers. I get a huge kick out of his snide remarks...he tends to write as he thinks and as he talks, which makes it more accessible.Karen Sadler,University of Pittsburgh"},{"Title":"The Cases That Haunt Us: From Jack The Ripper To Jon Benet Ransey, The","review":"I am just as guilty as most in that I thought I had the Jon Benet Ramsey case solved. This book, and the excellent analysis it provided into the mind of killers, proves that you should not jump to conclusions before you have all the facts. This case, and the others in the book, provided valuable information into the minds of different types of killers. It will prove invaluable in making analysis of cases to come. Super work and very easy to read."},{"Title":"The Cases That Haunt Us: From Jack The Ripper To Jon Benet Ransey, The","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book and learning how FBI profilers work.

I felt sorry for Charles Lindbergh and his wife. The Ramsey case still baffles me and the &quot;police procedures gone wrong&quot; is a scary thought... It made me wonder if a lot of the killers had actually really died or if they are still lurking out there wanting to kill again."},{"Title":"The Cases That Haunt Us: From Jack The Ripper To Jon Benet Ransey, The","review":"I actually listened to this on an unabridged audio tape. It was a facinating trip to take. The author brought logic to the cases I've read about. He brings out facts I've never known and his deductions are compelling. It was well worth reading.

Interesting cases presented, but interpretations of behaviors are superficial, lack insight, lack curiosity. Why did Patsy Ramsey sit unmoved on the sofa while others with her reacted to screams from the basement--Duh.. No clear answer to who would sit and compose lengthy note without worry of discovery--Duh. I am inspired to seek other authors for insights."},{"Title":"The Cases That Haunt Us: From Jack The Ripper To Jon Benet Ransey, The","review":"I own all but one of Douglas's profiling books. This one strikes me as being written to write a book rather than being written because Douglas has something he wants to tell us. Nevertheless, I liked it. He actually named a suspect in the Ripper murders and nailed Bruno Hauptmann for the Lindbergh baby kidnapping. Certain of the reviewers have excoriated Douglas for favoring the parents in the Ramsey case. It's one thing to disagree, even to say someone's opinion is garbage. It's another entirely to slander someone's good name by stating he was motivated by money in this case. Douglas says he would give up the Ramseys in a heartbeat if he thought they were at all guilty and I have no cause to doubt that. Steve Thomas's book postulates that JonBenet was bludgeoned in a fit of rage and the garotte was part of the staging. Douglas says a crushing blow to the head would cause a lot of bleeding and lack of blood means she was garotted first. He does not answer several critical points raised by Thomas, but he does give me seriously to think. I had not thought that possible. Douglas is a good as he thinks he is. You can take that several ways."},{"Title":"The Cases That Haunt Us: From Jack The Ripper To Jon Benet Ransey, The","review":"I bought this book in the paperback. When I opened it up I realized it was printed in VERY poor quality. The font on the writing is VERY small compared to others, about an eight or ten font on Word, and to make things worse the print is faded and not even crisp black print. I have good eyesight and don't wear glasses but I knew after the first two pages I would have a major headache if I continued reading this book so I put it up. If extremely small and light faded print bothers you, then you better not buy the mass market paperback version of this book!"},{"Title":"The Cases That Haunt Us: From Jack The Ripper To Jon Benet Ransey, The","review":"Moderately interesting treatment of famous unsolved cases. Main interest for experienced readers lies in application of behavioral profiling to notorious murders from Jack the Ripper to JonBenet Ramsey. For more casual readers, book serves as compact introduction to several classics from true crime canon. Douglas pioneered much of profiling methodology for the FBI and is thus highly regarded in many circles. Here he must rely on historical records for the vintage cases, so, despite the new technique, there remains a tinge of warmed-over stew. Nonetheless, his profiling is able at times to open up new slants.For example, it's hardly daring to point out that Jack the Ripper must have been insane to have killed in the way he did. It is riskier, however, to argue that on the basis of profiling, he could not have functioned in a sometimes normal way, which would rule out popular Jekyll and Hyde theories since there could be no Jekyll side to this highly disordered mind. Not a startling conclusion but a plausible and refined one nonetheless.The only real mystery in the Borden case is not whether Lizzie did it, but instead how she did it. Douglas offers little insight into this fascinating aspect, still his proposed strategy of how to interrogate this paragon of Victorian repression should be of interest.The book's best chapter, I believe, concerns the Lindbergh kidnapping. Here Olshaker's narrative skills come to the fore as the chapter amounts to a gripping account of a complex story that literally shook the nation. I don't know how much Douglas advances our understanding, but it does make for a fascinating read.The chapter on the Zodiac killings should be red meat for profiling. So it's a disappointment that his observations are too often vague and pedestrian, adding little to what is already known.This seems a case that could have been solved had there been better police work, such as correlating the northern and southern California phases more thoroughly. More than any other chapter, this one smacks of a stale retelling of an oft-told tale.Without doubt, Douglas does his reputation no favors in the final chapter. I don't object to the personal involvement with the Ramseys, nor even to the ill-advised taking of money from them. What is objectionable is the categorical position he takes concerning their innocence. This is a betrayal not only of the case itself but of the objective tone that the book as a whole has wisely established. It's as though the judge of a case suddenly throws aside his robes and becomes a Perry Mason for the defense. At bottom, the facts of the crime are simply too conflicting for anyone to draw hard and fast conclusions of any kind. Moreover, as page 411 indicates, too great an emphasis is placed on a first meeting with John Ramsey, where Douglas becomes convinced of the father's credibility -- a rather hasty conclusion for such a seasoned investigator. That being said, some interesting profiling aspects are raised which have to be considered in the Ramsey's behalf. Still and all, despite Douglas' failure to deal with counter evidence, there is simply too much of it to justify any sort of blanket exoneration. (For example, the possible role of ten-year old brother Burke in the crime appears not to have been seriously considered. Yet his participation would explain many puzzling features, including the apparent coverup and the resolve of John and Patsy to tell a convincing story. I realize this is a dicey subject, but then this was a dicey crime.) Anyway, those looking for a more balanced and forensic approach should check out Cyril Wecht's \\"Who Killed JonBenet Ramsey\\".All in all, the book is a worthwhile addition and an interesting read, for which Mark Olshaker deserves more credit than he usually gets."},{"Title":"The Cases That Haunt Us: From Jack The Ripper To Jon Benet Ransey, The","review":"Facinating. I have read quite a bit about Jack the Ripper, the Black Dalia, and Lizzie Borden and this book really gives great possible solutions with very good points. I appreciated the way they put all the evidence and theories on the table and went throught them one by one.As for the Ramseys, I don't think we will ever know the truth, one way or another, like so many cases in this book. I think that Douglas' take is as valid as any. Do I think the Ramseys made mistakes AFTER the murder, absolutely, but that doesn't mean they did or didn't do it. I like the fact that the authors noted the mysterious death of another little girl at about the same time. No publicity for that little girl.But, I don't want to get bogged down in the case that Douglas was involved in (Ramseys), the rest of the book is spectacular, thought provoking and terrifying in the way that some of these cases have gone unsolved (esp. the Zodiac.)All in all a great true crime read."},{"Title":"The Cases That Haunt Us: From Jack The Ripper To Jon Benet Ransey, The","review":"I would like to toss a couple of tidbits out to those who are upset that Mr. Douglas didn't tell us whodunnit in these cases.1. Being sued for libel and slander isn't something that any writer wants, especially a man of Douglas' experience and reputation.2. There is no way to know for sure who actually committed these crimes. In addition, it is not a profiler's job to look at a suspect and build a profile around the crime. A profiler looks at the crime and offers a profile of the killer. He or she may then note that a suspect may fit the profile, but that is not how a case is solved. A case is solved with evidence beyond a reasonable doubt.AND to the readers disappointed that Douglas didn't offer a profile for the Nicole Simpson/Ron Goldman murders: he did. In a book titled \\"Journey Into Darkness\\". To do so again would have been redundant. And the Green River case? I believe the case was still open at the time this book was published, and since the profile he had given the police was likely still confidential and in the file, it would have been highly irresponsible for him to publish it.I loved the section on the Ramsey case; for once it was nice to see someone examine the case without pointing the finger at the obvious suspects. And people, if there had been a SCRAP of real evidence against the Ramseys, the Grand Jury would have indicted."},{"Title":"The Cases That Haunt Us: From Jack The Ripper To Jon Benet Ransey, The","review":"The highlights of this book are the recaps of mysteries with which I was unfamiliar, including Jack the Ripper, Lizzie Borden, and especially the Lindburgh Baby Kidnapping. The kidnapping piece was particularly interesting and Douglas' points regarding the involvement of Bruno Hauptmann are believable.I don't think it is any coincidence that Douglas builds up his book with sensational mysteries from the past, and then leads into his piece about the JonBenet Ramsey investigation. In stark contrast with the earlier pieces, however, The feel of this read is far more biased. Douglas' writing during this last chapter has a defensive air vs. the exploratory air of the previous chapters. I'm surprised Olshaker let Douglas get away with that type of writing. As far as Douglas' points, I found his claim unconvincing that in no way could Jon-Benet Ramsey's parents have killed her because parents don't kill their kids that way. Douglas also talks about his &quot;small fee&quot; for taking on the Ramsey case, and I think that it would have been more ethical to fully disclose that fee in the book. One man's small fee is another man's fortune. Also, where were the personality profiles of the parents? How can Douglas not mention the possibility of narcissism with a parent who names his daughter after himself?Overall, I'm disappointed in the lack of full exploration of all of the key suspects in the Ramsey piece of the book -- where was mention of the brother? However, I think the book is worth purchasing in paperbook for the fascinating overviews of old cases."},{"Title":"The Cases That Haunt Us: From Jack The Ripper To Jon Benet Ransey, The","review":"THE CASES THAT HAUNT US is a fascinating account of several mysteries surrounding high profile cases... some of which remain unsolved years after the tragic events. What is also disturbing, however, is learning, via some of the posted reviews on this book, that there continues to be widespread finger-pointing at the Ramsey family. Is it possible that these readers are unaware of the Ramseys having been totally exonerated, for nearly three years, in the brutal murder of their daughter and sister? Here is just one of countless news releases:DNA clears JonBenet's family, points to mystery killerJuly 09, 2008Recently developed \\"touch DNA\\" technology has cleared all members of JonBenet Ramsey's family of her slaying, authorities said Wednesday.Boulder County District Attorney Mary Lacy said no one in the Ramsey family is considered a suspect and formally apologized in a letter to John Ramsey for the cloud of suspicion his family has lived under for nearly 12 years.\\"To the extent that we may have contributed in any way to the public perception that you might have been involved in this crime, I am deeply sorry,\\" Lacy wrote."},{"Title":"The Cases That Haunt Us: From Jack The Ripper To Jon Benet Ransey, The","review":"I couldnt put this book down. I really got into the chapters that covered Jack the Ripper, the Ramsey case, the Borden case too. Very informative book on profiling too. I didnt comepletely agree with Douglas and Olshaker in everything (especially the Ramsey case) ,but still a very good read."},{"Title":"The Cases That Haunt Us: From Jack The Ripper To Jon Benet Ransey, The","review":"Most of the cases detailed in this book are old cases that are either unsolved or with convictions that have some degree of doubt attached to them.The insights from John Douglas as a profiler are very interesting.The \\"Jack the Ripper\\" case is one of the most notorious of all time.Mr.Douglas explains why he would eliminate some the known,hypothetical suspects and settles on a probable suspect.He argues for the guilt of Lizzie Borden and I think that he's correct on that case.His assessment of the Lindbergh kidnapping is intriguing. \\"More than one individual took part in the crime that night\\"-page 180. Hauptmann was no doubt heavily involved but the case for the \\"dual intruder theory\\" makes sense.The \\"Black Dahlia\\" case was another savage murder and he lists two very strong possible suspects.I can understand how he arrived at his conclusion in the JonBenet Ramsey case. That case was hamstrung from the start with crime scene contamination and the well-known animosity between the police and DA's office. The presence of foreign DNA enforces the theory of an intruder.John Douglas will get slammed for his supporting of the Ramseys. Considering the victim and the unsolved status of that case,it's going to be an infamous topic for years to come.As a fan of true crime genre books I liked this book."},{"Title":"The Cases That Haunt Us: From Jack The Ripper To Jon Benet Ransey, The","review":"Great book for anyone interested in true crime and the criminal mind. John Douglas looks at some classic crime cases using his profiling method: look at the facts of the crime and draw conclusions about what kind of person could have done it. This is in contrast to the approach of: identify a likely suspect, then identify facts of the crime that fit the suspect. The author does not claim to solve all of the cases he studies in this book, but rather point us in the right direction. For example, he describes the likely personality characteristics and behavior of Jack the Ripper (interestingly this does not seem to match Patricia Cornwell's conclusion) and the Zodiac. His discussion of the Ramsey case is probably the most controversial since he was personally involved in the case. A well written and interesting book."},{"Title":"The Cases That Haunt Us: From Jack The Ripper To Jon Benet Ransey, The","review":"I enjoy reading John Douglas's books; I have always found his insights interesting. This book is not up to par with some of his other works, however. Perhaps it is because these are cases that remain unsolved and much that he would use in &quot;working cases&quot; has been muddied by years of mystery. Perhaps the best thing he says is that all killings deserve equality in the press -- that the press shouldn't single some cases out because of some sensational in the case, whether it be the brutality or the wealth of the family. Everyone deserves for their suffering to receive equal attention."},{"Title":"The Cases That Haunt Us: From Jack The Ripper To Jon Benet Ransey, The","review":"It seems as though John Douglas has a high opinion of himself in his books....and he has every right to feel that way; the man truly is a legend. Such a reputation is not built on trying to please everyone or go with the popular opinion, however, and that bound to be the conclusion some readers come to regarding the chapter on the Jon Benet Ramsey case. Everybody knows the details of this case, but truthfully, no matter who you believe really &quot;dunnit&quot; in this case, you cannot argue with the fact that Douglas makes a lot of good points in the Ramsey chapter.He actually makes a lot of good points in ALL the chapters: especially the Lindbergh baby kidnapping case. After reading it, you can't help but think how much easier this case would have been to solve if it has happened in a more modern era. There are a number of people out there who doubt the guilt of Hauptmann, and Douglas does an excellent job pointing out the indicias of guilt that seem to stare in only one direction. In the case of the Zodiac, Douglas does not exactly name a suspect but he does provide a very common sense method which the police could and should have used to catch this person. Douglas's account of how this criminal eluded the police for years and continues to do so is definitely deserved of reading. The chapters on Jack the Ripper and Lizzie Borden were interesting as well, but definitely do not stand out as a &quot;must read&quot; so if I had to skip something in this book, I would skip those.The only complaint I have regarding this book is that there are a lot of other very interesting cases highlighted in the chapter called &quot;American Dreams/American Nightmares&quot; which did not receive what I feel was enough &quot;limelight&quot;. Included in this chapter are the Black Dahlia case, the case of Lawrencia &quot;Bambi&quot; Bembenek, and the Boston Strangler. I would have like to see more on these, especially the first two cases. Perhaps in a future endeavor of Douglas's? Either way, the information he does provide on these is interesting and worth a read; they only further compliment the expert opinions contained in this volume.I would definitely recommend this to any true crime buff. If you have more than a passing interest in understanding profiling, I would also recommend Mindhunter by this same author."},{"Title":"The Cases That Haunt Us: From Jack The Ripper To Jon Benet Ransey, The","review":"Wait for the paperback. This book is a rehash of earlier works. It may be interesting to those who don't know much about profiling. However, Mindhunter is a much better book than this recycled effort, which seems to have been written primarily to justify his support of the Ramseys. Regarding the Ramsey case, he presents a few credible scenarios incriminating Paty and/or John, and then immediately dismisses them as &quot;absurd&quot;. His ego seems to have created quite a blind spot."},{"Title":"The Cases That Haunt Us: From Jack The Ripper To Jon Benet Ransey, The","review":"i thought this book had alot of info on the crimes and suspects. i didn't necessarily agree with the author's input on the jon benet ramsey murder but it's still a good read. this book makes you want to protect your children more ;)"},{"Title":"The Cases That Haunt Us: From Jack The Ripper To Jon Benet Ransey, The","review":"John Douglas is known for his expertise in the realm of criminal-personality profiling and modern investigative analysis. Mark Olshaker is a novelist and filmmaker; this book is very readable and entertaining. The book lists no sources or footnotes for their chapters.The book's chapters are: &quot;Jack the Ripper&quot;, &quot;Lizzie Borden&quot;, &quot;The Lindbergh Kidnapping&quot;, &quot;The Zodiac&quot;, &quot;The JonBenet Ramsey Murder&quot;, and a catch-all chapter. There is no &quot;Trail of OJ Simpson&quot; but references to it are sprinkled in some chapters; why not? My comments are on the the trial of Lizzie Borden.On pages 114-116 JD imagines how he could get Lizzie Borden to confess - to a crime she didn't commit! His invention of a scandalous past for LB reminds me of those stories of &quot;recovered memories&quot;. He says this trick works if he can keep a dialogue going - which could mean he puts ideas in their minds and words in their mouths. He would try to use a compliant press to present himself as one who &quot;might understand&quot;. The fact of LB's innocence of the murders seems to be irrelevant.What I learned from this book is not to talk to the police unless your lawyer is present. JD makes this point perfectly clear for Mr. &amp; Mrs. Ramsey. It also helps if you're rich enough to hire the best lawyers in town, and then move to another state. JD correctly recommends making the FBI Crime Lab independent. Read &quot;Tainting Evidence&quot; by J. Kelly and P. Wearne to learn why."},{"Title":"The Cases That Haunt Us: From Jack The Ripper To Jon Benet Ransey, The","review":"Douglas and Olshaker have done it again. Only these two gentlemen could give a fresh insight into some of the most difficult crimes in history. It takes more than talent to accomplish this. Those who have given a negative review to this publication have only one complaint and that is the Ramsey case. Clearly their ignorance can not just be attributed to the fact that they probably have not read the book in it's entirety,or that they lack 30 years of investigative experience. It can only be attributed to narrow-mindedness."},{"Title":"The Cases That Haunt Us: From Jack The Ripper To Jon Benet Ransey, The","review":"I enjoy Douglas's writing style. He has always been an interesting read and was the initiator of my fascination with criminal psychology.However, this book was a far cry from most other things I have read by Douglas and others in the field. He mainly examines 5 cases (plus some smaller ones). He offers insight into Jack the Ripper and the Zodiac enough to offer an interpretation of the mindset of the killer that is weak, but forgiven, considering how little evidence he had to examine. However, his chapter on the Ramsey murders was just maddening. John Douglas, known for his profiling, actually wrote that he will not profile the killer of Jon Ramsey, and he doesn't. Although he offers his insight as to why he believes the parents didn't do it, this can easily be dismissed due to his close relationship that he has with the family.The other two cases weren't exactly cases the \\"haunt us\\". The Lindenberg kidnapping and a late 1800 murder of a father in the US, weren't exactly enthralling. Considering that Douglas didn't offer any new information to the cases, or offer explanations that were contradictory to other explanations, it seemed he included these as filler...and that just upsets me.Read Mindhunter, instead."},{"Title":"The Cases That Haunt Us: From Jack The Ripper To Jon Benet Ransey, The","review":"THE WORLD RENOWNED DOUGLAS RELIES TOO HEAVILY ON THE ''RESEARCH''OF OTHER WRITERS IN FORMING OPINIONS..........SOME OF IT IS THINLY DISGUISED FICTION,AS IN JOHN GILMORE'S ''SEVERED''(THE BLACK DAHLIA),OR ROBERT GRAYSMITH'S EPONYMOUS ''ZODIAC''.........SOMETIMES HE'S RIGHT ON TARGET(LIZZIE),REAL CLOSE(JACK THE RIPPER),OR,AND I'M SURE MOST WILL AGREE,TOTALLY WRONG(JON BENET)........DOUGLAS DID NOT DO HIS HOMEWORK CORRECTLY HERE,AND SOMETIMES IT SHOWS BADLY.........OF COURSE,WITH SOME OF THESE ANCIENT CRIMES,IS IT EVEN POSSIBLE TO SEPERATE FACT FROM SPECULATION ANYMORE?.........OTHER WRITERS HAVE DEVOTED YEARS OF THEIR LIVES TO SOME OF THESE CASES,AND THEY'RE TOTALLY LOST,SOMETIMES.......MAYBE THE COMPLEXITY INVOLVED W/ MOST CASES PRESENTED HERE DEFIES ENCAPSULATION,WHICH IS BASICALLY WHAT THIS BOOK PROVIDES.........JOHN DOUGLAS SHOULD STICK TO THE FRESH CRIMES OUT THERE,ITS TOO LATE FOR THE HOPELESSLY DISTORTED ONES HERE........."},{"Title":"The Cases That Haunt Us: From Jack The Ripper To Jon Benet Ransey, The","review":"Typical Douglas, in his self aggrandizing style, makes himself the authority on all crime related topics.

Incredible that Douglas makes such a conclusion, even though he wasnt privvy to the evidence, as the FBI was and who came to a markedly different conclusion about the parents' involvement.A waste of time to read this book.

There are so many holes in his theories that I am compelled to completely disregard his opinion as entirely motivated by ego.

Here, he had a chance to show us what a 21st century criminologist and profiler can bring to these familiar cases. I believe he failed.In the early cases, \\"Jack the Ripper\\" and the Borden tragedy, he does little but summarize these familiar cases. His \\"insights\\" are little more than rubber-stamps on the official interpretations of these events. He comes to the same conclusions as the authorities, and cites the same reasons. Of course, it's too much to expect that Douglas will have anything new to add to these cases; other researchers have spent far more time delving into the details of these murders. Still, it would have been useful for Douglas to walk through the process of how a modern criminologist would approach these cases and explain how he arrived at his conclusions. Instead, he simply presents his opinions as facts, without justifying how he came to his determinations.Disappointing. I think most readers of books like this want insight into the process, so that they may find a deeper understanding of these events. Here, it seems like Mark did most of the work of writing up the case, while John just tossed in his two-bits at the end.His treatment of the Ramsey case deserves a longer examination. Douglas's association with the Ramseys calls into doubt his impartiality. He shrugs this off without much thought. A good writer would have seen this an another \\"teaching moment\\": what is the role of the \\"expert witness\\" who is in the employee of murder suspect? As it is, I am left with doubts about his conclusions and about his relationship to this case, an inevitable situation when money changes hands.I was hoping for something more along the lines of McCrary's \\"The Unknown Darkness: Profiling the Predators Among Us\\", in which the investigator describes not only his conclusions, but how he arrived at them. I would encourage Douglas to share with us more of this inner work as an investigator, so that he might add to our understanding of these events. I'm sure he has much that he could share."},{"Title":"The Cases That Haunt Us: From Jack The Ripper To Jon Benet Ransey, The","review":"This is my favorite book by John Douglas.

There is a need for an independent laboratory for processing evidence so its reports can be trusted (p.337).

[Did this predict the shooter in the Virginia-Maryland area in October 2002 was a middle-aged white blue-collar worker?] These predictions require a faith in a technique that is new and may not stand the test of time. It uses subjective means rather than objective means that can be independently and objectively tested. Who can read the mind of a person? [Why didn't they catch the BTK killer of Kansas City earlier?]Chapter One deals with \\"Jack the Ripper\\", one of the first and most infamous serial killers. Douglas tells of the methods he uses to analyze these crimes. He discusses the murders, and the suspects, then describes the likely murderer (pp.79-80). We'll never know. Chapter Two is about Lizzie Borden. Most people know very little of this case beyond the jingle. Lizzie was correctly found 'not guilty' of the murders, and the case was never solved. Pages 81-102 summarize the facts. Douglas' analysis on pages 103-109 touches all known suspects. His solution shows his assumptions, and suggests he hasn't done his homework in reading the available books on the Borden murders (p.112). His strategy on pages 115-6 is hilarious to anyone who has read the books on this case. Just because \\"no outside suspect had surfaced\\" (p.310) is no reason to blame Lizzie.Chapter Three is \\"The Lindbergh Kidnapping\\". Unlike the previous chapters, it was solved in a court of law. The baby was tucked into bed before 8pm. Around 9pm Lindbergh heard a strange sound. When the nurse checked on Charlie at 10pm, he had been kidnapped. \\"The dog did nothing in the night.\\" By 10:25 the Sheriff and State Police were notified. By 11pm statewide roadblocks were in place (p.125). The house and floor plans had been well publicized (p.127). Meetings were arranged between \\"Jafsie\\" and \\"John\\"; after the ransom money was paid they took plaster casts of \\"John's\\" footprints (p.151). On May 12 they found the body of a badly decomposed body (p.153); it was identified as Charlie. Who planted six of Brinkert's business cards in Violet Sharpe's room (p.157)? One of the ransom bills was traced to Richard Hauptmann. He was arrested, tried, and and convicted. Hauptmann claimed innocence until he was executed. Controversy over the verdict continues to this day. It seem impossible for a carpenter to go 2 years without replacing a chisel (p.174)! Douglas discusses Rail 16, but doesn't mention that this board was thicker than the other floorboards (p.177). Douglas believes the facts point to more than one person involved in this crime (pp.179-180). Hauptmann couldn't have done it alone (p.183). Douglas mentions that \\"John\\" said the servants were innocent, according to Condon. But could that have really occurred (p.185)?In Chapter Five Douglas explains why Albert DeSalvo was not the Boston Strangler (pp.262-265). He describes many suspects, but doesn't try to solve this crime. Could one man have killed them all \\"from older women to younger ones\\" (p.265)? We'll never know."},{"Title":"The Cases That Haunt Us: From Jack The Ripper To Jon Benet Ransey, The","review":"The book The Cases That Haunt Us, by John Douglas and Mark Olshaker, goes into great deal over ever single object in the cases. For every piece of evidence the book presents, it gives multiple reasons why that evidence is significant. After they have put all of the evidence together, they write how they think the entire crime happened and list all of the possible suspects. As they go through all of the suspects, they state why it is likely for some to have committed the crime, and unlikely for other to have done it. I would suggest this book to anyone that really likes to try to solve mysteries that a book presents. At the end of every section, it doesn't tell you exactly what happens, it lets you decide for yourself. I found it to be a bit too boring for my tastes, but others who more enjoy this genre will surely like it."},{"Title":"The Cases That Haunt Us: From Jack The Ripper To Jon Benet Ransey, The","review":"In Cases that Haunt Us, Douglas takes us into some of the most infamous cases of all time giving us his expert opinion and analysis based on the evidence from these cases. From Jack the Ripper to Jon Benet Ramsey you will be immediately hooked to this book and won't want to put it down, but what else could be expected from Douglas? The man is pure genius and it certainly shines in this work! Another job well done!"},{"Title":"The Cases That Haunt Us: From Jack The Ripper To Jon Benet Ransey, The","review":"This book was a major disappointment for me, although that should not have come as a surprise since the quality of Mr. Douglas's books has declined steadily since the first one I read, Mind Hunter. The premise is a good one--he uses his modern &quot;profiling&quot; techniques to provide insights into some older, well-known murders. But his performance here is mediocre &amp; this book proves to be his weakest yet.The first four chapters deal in detail with Jack the Ripper, Lizzie Borden, the Lindbergh kidnapping, &amp; the Zodiac killer. While the overviews are decent &amp; his analysis more or less sound, of necessity he relies heavily on the writings &amp; research of others &amp; there is really nothing in these chapters that you could not find more extensively in a book devoted exclusively to any of those cases. The next chapter includes three more famous cases (the Black Dahlia, Bambi Bembenek, &amp; the Boston Strangler) &amp; the same criticisms that apply to the first chapters apply to this one except that his descriptions &amp; analyses of the cases are much sketchier.The book really falls apart though, in the last full chapter, which covers JonBenet Ramsey. Douglas has ties to the Ramsey family &amp; their lawyers &amp;, while he makes a couple of good points in favor of the &quot;intruder&quot; theory, his allegiance is obvious &amp; he often does not play fair with his readers. His attempts to defend the Ramseys from any &amp; all allegations are fairly pathetic &amp; seriously call into doubt his objectivity. As an example, he makes a big deal out of the fact that the Ramseys submitted to having samples of their hair, etc. taken saying that if they were guilty they would never have done so. But this is disingenuous--the crime scene was the Ramsey house which would have been full of their hair &amp; DNA so matching their samples up with something found in the house would really be meaningless. On the other hand, the Ramseys have consistently refused to be interviewed by the police--interviews which, if they were guilty, would be very dangerous for them. Douglas also belittles the fact that the Ramseys hired lawyers right after the crime saying that any potential suspect would have done so. While true, it was this &quot;lawyering up&quot; that prevented the police from having contact with the Ramseys &amp; from properly investigating the crime. While one could understand a suspect refusing to talk with the police even if he were innocent, it is much more difficult to understand the motivation of a parent whose daughter had just been brutally murdered to impede the investigation of the crime in such a substantial way. Interviewing &amp; clearing the Ramseys, or using the information they provided to match up with other leads, could have focused on some other suspect &amp; possibly solved the case. Regardless of who committed this crime, &amp; it could very well have been an intruder, Douglas's tortured excuse making for the Ramseys pretty much ruins this book &amp; his credibility in general.For someone who has never read anything on the crimes discussed in the early chapters, this book will provide a decent overview &amp; reference for further reading. But the contents are nothing special &amp;, in the case of the JonBenet chapter, are much less than that. Two stars."},{"Title":"The Cases That Haunt Us: From Jack The Ripper To Jon Benet Ransey, The","review":"P.T. Barnum said \\"There's a sucker born every minute\\" and it appears that the Ramseys have found a big one in former F.B.I. profiler and \\"Mindhunter\\" John Douglas. If you buy this book, then maybe Douglas has found one too. If you are intellectually curious about this book, but don't want to be part of P.T.\`s prophesy, borrow it from the library (as I did) or read it in a book store while sipping a fine cappucino.The foundation of American criminal jurisprudence is that one is presumed innocent until proven guilty. But that does not require a totally gullible populace. It appears that John Douglas has gone quite daft - all Patsy had to do was bat those \\"Runner-up-beauty-queen\\" eyes at him. Patsy is a former Miss West Virginia, a state where they say such things as \\"Use that good southern common sense of yours.\\" (Coincidentally (?) a phrase from the \\"ransom note\\" - See also \\"Author Unknown - On the Trail of Anonymous\\" by Donald W. Foster.)There's another colloquialism they have in the south: \\"That dog won't hunt!\\" Despite reliance on his previous books and the first part of this one, Douglas' rationalizations around the Ramseys won't hunt.The first part of the book is ostensibly a tour through historic crimes from a profiler's point of view. These portions are interesting and often, for instance his views on Lawrencia (Bambi) Bembenick and Albert DeSalvo, make more sense than the \\"conventional wisdom.\\" But when the reader arrives at the chapter on JonBenet Ramsey's murder, it becomes clear that the authors' objective throughout was to buttress his Ramsey rationalizations - for example: \\"As we saw in the Lindbergh case...\\"Dr. Sam Sheppard's case is employed as a \\"cautionary tale\\" in Douglas' Ramsey rationalizations. (p. 310) The tragedy of the Sheppard family is written by Dr. Sam's son in \\"Mockery of Justice: the True Story of the Sheppard Murder Case.\\" The Sheppard book is also available here on Amazon.com and is, IMHO, a more prudent investment.John Douglas blows his own horn that he is no longer being paid by the Ramseys. But he is selling this book. So, remember what P.T. Barnum said!"},{"Title":"The Cases That Haunt Us: From Jack The Ripper To Jon Benet Ransey, The","review":"I went into this knowing I would not agree with the authors take on the Ramsey case, so I was more than willing to agree to disagree on that issue. I found the Ripper and Borden chapters only mildly interesting, mostly just rehashing of information previously known.My main disappointment came with the Zodiac chapter. I have long been fascinated with that case. I was a young child when the murders were taking place, and living in Northern California at the time and I well remember the fear that permeated the area.So I was very sorry to see that not only did Mr. Douglas simply rehash most of the information from Robert Graysmith's book, which many Zodiac researchers already consider unreliable(which is a kind description of what many actually think), he also mistates what he calls \\"fact\\". Mr. Douglas states emphatically that the last \\"confirmed\\" letter from Zodiac was in 1978. In fact, although one expert originally confirmed that letter as from the Zodiac, that same expert later changed his position and stated it was a fake, albeit a good one,and all other experts rejected it as NOT having been written by the Zodiac. The fact is the last letter confirmed to have been written by the Zodiac was received in 1974. Yet Mr. Douglas blithely anounces that the 1978 letter is authentic. Not that he \\"believes\\" it is authentic, an opinion he would certainly been entitled to argue. Some researchers do clng to that letter as authentic because it fits the most popular suspect, who has since been cleared by both DNA testing and handwriting experts. It fits their theory, based on the time that suspect was released from prison for a child molestation conviction. I would have liked he see the great mindhunters explanation for why a convicted child molestor would go so far outside his normal victim pool and attack young adults as the Zodiac, yet Mr. Douglas completely ignores that incongruity and again blithely states it could have been that suspect or it could have been one of the many other suspects. REALLY?Now I see why he was willing to sell out to the Ramseys. Highest bidders or just publicity?Sad and disappointing for such a highly respected man."},{"Title":"The Cases That Haunt Us: From Jack The Ripper To Jon Benet Ransey, The","review":"I read a previous book by John Douglas and was fascinated by the science of profiling. As a result, I also enjoyed this book. I believe the book could have been improved by not including the Lizzy Border case; the Bembenek story; and the Black Dahlia case, none of which many Americans are really familiar with. Douglas could have included theories about the more reknown cases such as the Green River Killer and the OJ Simpson case. The book is certainly worth a read if you enjoy the true crime genre."},{"Title":"The Cases That Haunt Us: From Jack The Ripper To Jon Benet Ransey, The","review":"Reading &quot;The Cases That Haunt Is&quot; it is clear that John Douglas, a former FBI profiler, knows his stuff. His case-by-case breakdown of some of the world's most famous unsolved (or possibly incorrectly solved) murders, including Jack the Ripper, Lizzie Borden and Jon Benet Ramsey, is well-researched and, as far as a lay person like myself can tell, highly accurate. Douglas makes a good case for a likely suspect TYPE in each case, and offers opinions in some as to the identity of the killer and validity of accepted evidence, but remains thoroughly professional and refrains from the lurid speculation often associated with &quot;true crime&quot; books. (He is particularly circumspect in the more modern cases, fearing, I'd assume, legal retaliation.)In fact, therein lies the problem. Douglas is so professional that reading this book is like reading a police blotter, factual and insightful, but not very interesting. The prose is dry--more proof that Douglas did this (profiling) for a living, not even Mark Olshaker's writing skills can punch up Douglas' fact-by-fact analysis. I'm not usually a true crime fan and I don't obsessively follow serial killers or &quot;big cases&quot; on the news. Actually, I'm not even sure why I picked this book up, as it's a bit out of my typical fiction genre. I guess if I'd been more the audience this book was geared towards, I might have enjoyed it more. As it is, it just sort of creeped me out and made me realize (once again) the frightening number of truly sick individuals our modern world has spawned. Detailed reports on exactly how Jack the Ripper or Borden mutilated their victims (OK, their entire face was gone. Oh goody!) doesn't make for great bedtime reading as far as I'm concerned and as Douglas refers to case after case which has &quot;similar&quot; overtones to the more famous murders chronicled here you get the feeling that there's a serial killer around every corner. Mostly I just found myself wondering, again and again, how anyone can muck through horrors like this for a living. A book on how that affects someone's psyche might be REALLY interesting."},{"Title":"The Cases That Haunt Us: From Jack The Ripper To Jon Benet Ransey, The","review":"John Douglas gives us a fascinating new glimpse into some old, and not-so-old crimes. He explores the legendary Jack the Ripper, Lizzie Borden, the Lindberg kidnapping, and the recent murder of JonBenet Ramsey. At first I wondered why he was rehashing ground that has been covered so many times, but after reading just a few pages, I realized how much I didn't know about these crimes. Douglas isn't afraid to give his opinion about these murders, even if it conflicts with conventional wisdom. A must have for true crime readers!"},{"Title":"The Cases That Haunt Us: From Jack The Ripper To Jon Benet Ransey, The","review":"As has been noted, the Ramsey case has been written up in such a biased manner, it should have been placed first so the reader can wonder about what information has been left out in the other cases. The book comes across as self-justifying, as reviews have said. In the Borden case: &quot;From my experience, there is no way a stranger would...&quot; and &quot;Even a maniac wouldn't hang around for ninety minutes, and he would have killed Lizzie and Bridget too.&quot; Yet in the Ramsey case, he makes the claim for just such behavior. Despite the classifications of &quot;organized/disorganized/mixed&quot; behavioural characteristics, there's mostly a lot of arm-waving and building assumptions upon assumptions upon assumptions...though I admit many of his conclusions are likely right, the arguments to get there aren't airtight. And where's the followup discussion of Jeff Merrick, etc....?"},{"Title":"The Cases That Haunt Us: From Jack The Ripper To Jon Benet Ransey, The","review":"This was a fascinating read on Jack the Ripper, Lizzie Borden, the Lindbergh kidnapping, the Zodiac, and several others. But as many others have said, the author lost his credibility in the Ramsey Chapter. The author was was a paid consultant for the Ramseys. His \\"theory\\" that the murderer was an intruder seeking revenge on John Ramsey for a bad business deal made no sense. If someone really wanted to get revenge on John Ramsey, couldn't they find a better way than to break into his house on Christmas night, strangle his daughter, spend enough time to write a long-winded ransom note, and then escape the house with no signs of forced entry? There are thousands of easier ways to harm John Ramsey for this alleged revenge-minded businessman. I'm not buying it.And if an intruder did murder JonBenet, why would he leave a ransom note? Assuming this theory is true, the intruder has already killed the child and he knows they will find her dead body in the basement. Why would he be so careful to remove ALL prints, all traces of forced entry, only to leave a two-page handwriting sample for the cops to study? It makes no sense that he would be such a careful \\"organized\\" offender, only to leave a gift-wrapped piece of evidence for no reason whatsoever.The author would have us believe that some sexual-sadist intruder (who has business revenge on his mind) broke into the house, murdered the child, and then saw a pen and pad and sat down to waste 10 minutes writing a ransom note for a kidnapping that never happened? If you say so, John.If you can put aside what the author wrote about JonBenet Ramsey, this is a good book and worth the read. It's only at the end, where Author reveals his final opinion, bought and paid for by the Ramseys, that the book falls short."},{"Title":"The Cases That Haunt Us: From Jack The Ripper To Jon Benet Ransey, The","review":"This book is interesting, worth buying, and informative.

I have liked some more than others but over-all his theories are none short of brilliant. He actually makes YOU THINK!! Once I have started any of his books, I cannot put them down. I have recommended them to friends and they too have never been disappointed. In this book I was drawn to the JonBenet case. I thought that I had made up my mind who I felt the killer or killerS were until I read his thoughts. He makes the reader look at things in a way you never would have before. I strongly recommend any of his books if you are open minded (or not, but like to challenge yourself) enough to step out of your box for a while and actually USE that brain.

I was most fascinated by the JonBenet Ramsey portion of the book. Many of lambasted Douglas for his belief in the Ramseys' not guilty stance. I agree with him and his thought process is illuminating.

He primarily spends a great deal of time on two key areas: context of area in which crime committed and victomology.From Jack the Ripper to JonBenet Ramsey, he applies all that years of working the toughest cases has brought to him.One that fascinated me the most was the one I knew the least, the Lindbergh kidnapping. The missing chisel, the removed flooring, all this pointing to the convicted one. Also, that Gen.

He goes into detail of the facts of the cases, then adds his own thoughts and profile on the suspects personality. Douglas does go into detail but keeps it simple enough so that people other then Law Enforcement Proffessionals can understand. For a non-fiction book, it is very interesting.

I know detectives and psychologists who delight in the interesting way that Douglas makes the wisdom of the FBI available to readers. The United States has spent millions of dollars in researching the psychology of criminal behavior, so it should be of no surprize that so much quality information exists. Douglas and Olshaker are doing an excellent job at disseminating this information in a fascinating way. Researchers in other human behaviors should take note of the massive work done by the United States into the criminal mind."},{"Title":"The Cases That Haunt Us: From Jack The Ripper To Jon Benet Ransey, The","review":"This is the best Douglas book since his first, &quot;Mindhunter.&quot; Subsequent books has have tended to be repetitive with not much new information. In this book, since he is looking into historical cases for the most part, he offers new analyses and ideas about the Unsubs in cases including Jack the Ripper, Lizzy Borden, Charles Lindbergh Jr, Zodiac killer, and Boston Strangler.I almost wish he hadn't included the JonBenet Ramsey case, because I think that takes away from the rest of the book. He could have included some other cases that still &quot;haunt&quot; us, that would be interesting from a historical point of view. I don't think enough time has passed for people to consider the Ramsay case objectively. I am not saying I disagree with his conclusions about the Ramsays, but I don't completely buy them either. If he is ever proved wrong, he will have to eat a ton of crow. Enough said.Still, I would recommend this book for true crime lovers, historical crime buffs, and anyone with an interest in psychological profilings. I admit freely my favorite TV show is Discovery Channels &quot;The New Detectives.&quot; If you have never seen it, and you fall into one of the above categories, you must check this show out."},{"Title":"The Cases That Haunt Us: From Jack The Ripper To Jon Benet Ransey, The","review":"Not since his first work, MINDHUNTER, have I read a Douglas book this interesting. Mindhunter set the pace for all the profiling narratives that followed. Although nobody does it better than Douglas, his subsequent works were somewhat lacking because they did not grab the reader with the same tenacity as his first novel. He takes a somewhat new direction with THE CASES THAT HAUNT US and in turn a better book surfaces.In CASES THAT HAUNT US Douglas looks at some of the more infamous murders of all time and adds his professional perspective. Whereas he can offer nothing new (after all there have been thousands of books on Jack the Ripper for example), he does weigh some of the more mentioned theories and shows their strenghts and more often than not, their weaknesses. He picks some of the all time chilling real life horror stories....Jack the Ripper, The Zodiac, The Boston Strangler, The Lindbergh Kidnapping, and even the infamous Jon Benet Ramsey case. All the chapters are intriguing and well thought out. He does an outstanding job of showing how some of the conventional thinking on these cases is flawed and in turn relays his years of hands on experience in the field. Along the way, he peppers his views with recollections of cases he has touched.The main point of controversy in this book in sure to be the Ramsey killing. It is no secret that Douglas was called in to offers his thoughts on this tragic event by the lawyers representing the Ramseys. While I do not agree that he sold out as some would insist, I do question his desire to hire himself out to the main suspects in this grisly event. (in all fairness to Douglas he does contend that after the initial consultation fee he refused to accept further payment and even paid for subsequent flights to Atlanta). This chapter should not prevent anyone from reading the book. Rather, it ranks as one of the more interesting sections of this work. Douglas offers his own insights and makes convincing arguements for an inturder theory. You dont have to agree with the man to respect his logic, reasoning, and experience.Overall the book reads at the speed of light. All of the chapters with the possible exception of the Lizzy Borden case are well written and really grab the reader's attention. True crime fans will have to read this book."},{"Title":"The Cases That Haunt Us: From Jack The Ripper To Jon Benet Ransey, The","review":"I've read most of John Douglas' books, and most of the other books inspired by the work done in the FBI's Behavioral Sciences unit. I have a deep respect for Douglas and his many colleagues around the country who continue to work in law enforcement and are students of the criminal mind.&quot;The Cases that Haunt Us&quot; is, for the most part, a work that deserves as much accolade as Douglas and Olshaker's previous books. The historical perspective and fresh evaluative light shed on such classic cases as Jack the Ripper and the Lindbergh kidnapping is fascinating and invaluable. However, upon reading the final chapter, I was left with the nagging feeling that every chapter in the book was a carefully calculated setup to prepare the reader for the final chapter, where Douglas presents his findings and opinions on the JonBenet Ramsey murder case.I don't fault him for being unobjective. He admits that he was hired by the Ramseys' lawyers to provide his opinions on their possible guilt or innocence. He was not, as is often assumed by the public, hired to provide a profile of the killer (he was never given access to the autopsy reports, crime scene photos, physical evidence, etc., that would be necessary for a true profile). As with his style in the previous chapters, he presents the facts of the case. But his chapter on JonBenet is hopelessly contaminated by his own involvement with the family (none of the other high profile cases in the book involved him personally). The result is a missive that reads like a cross between a rationalization and an apology. Don't get me wrong, Douglas presents his findings in a clear and very logical manner, and I don't disagree with his findings. I just wish for the sake of this book, that he had left the Ramsey case alone and had added some additional historical cases (JFK or MLK Jr assassinations, for instance, or the OJ case) in which he was not personally involved.Much has been written about the JonBenet Ramsey murder, and I was curious to see Douglas' own conclusions on this case. But by including it in this book, he busted what was easily a 5-star work down to 3 stars."},{"Title":"The Cases That Haunt Us: From Jack The Ripper To Jon Benet Ransey, The","review":"I bought this book about a week ago--both my wife and I have finished reading it already, and we spent most of the week reading over each other's shoulders (or &quot;borrowing&quot; the book when the other wasn't looking). Douglas has a lot of interesing things to say, and Olshaker is an excellent writer. Their collaboration has produced a book that is nearly impossible to put down.The most controversial part of this book will be the last chapter, in which Douglas sets out his views about who killed JonBenet Ramsey. He will be pounced on by many irate readers who are just absolutely, positively certain that one (or both) of the Ramseys did it--these readers will give the book an undeserved &quot;one star&quot; rating not because the book isn't terrific but because they disagree with Douglas' conclusion.For my part, I found Douglas' defense of the Ramseys to be diplomatic, well-reasoned and persuasive. After reading Steve Thomas' JonBenet: Inside the Ramsey Murder Investigation, I was convinced that the crime was not committed by an intruder. Douglas made me think twice about that conclusion and has moved me back to sitting on the fence.For those who are ready to hang the Ramseys from the nearest tree, remember that the standard of guilt in America is &quot;beyond a reasonable doubt.&quot; The only thing that is &quot;beyond doubt&quot; about the Ramsey murder is that an understandably inexperienced Boulder police department allowed the crime scene to be turned into a world class mess within the first few hours of arriving at the Ramseys' home, thus insuring that, short of a confession, the real killer would never be brought to justice. (Douglas once thought that having a child murdered was the worst thing that could happen to someone; now he believes that the worst thing that could happen to someone is to have a child murdered and be wrongly blamed for it.)And for those who are focused to the point of obsession on the Ramsey murder, Douglas reminds us that 804 other children were murdered in the year JonBenet died. As Douglas says, those are the cases that should really haunt us."},{"Title":"The Cases That Haunt Us: From Jack The Ripper To Jon Benet Ransey, The","review":"It's been a long time since John Douglas has written a strong book, and I was delighted to find that this is his strongest book in years. I often have wondered when Douglas was suddenly going to run out of ideas to work from, when the Douglas writing well was going to run dry, and indeed, for a while it seemed that he was just running the same idea over and over, or running new ideas weakly.With this book, we get a nice taste of Douglas's profiling and an in-depth look at many cases that have bothered all of us for a long time in terms of their never having been solved.I found it very interesting that this book is so in-depth that Doulas even includes the Lawrencia Bembenek case, one that even while it happened, was mostly local in interest rather than national.Douglas carries us from the unsolved &quot;Jack the Ripper&quot; case all the way to the JonBenet Ramsey case, and shows us how he'd solve the crimes and who possible suspects might be. I find this clever and interesting writing.He gives powerful energy particularly to the Lindbergh kidnapping and the Zodiac serial killer, and in these two sections, he is at his best, and really gets the reader deeply involved and Douglas himself writing with great skill and powerful ideas.The only weak link in the book is the section on the JonBenet Ramsey killing, which section seems more like &quot;In Defense of John Douglas's Profiling.&quot;Other than the Ramsey section, this is an excellent and even thrilling book, and the first Douglas book in a long time that I couldn't put down."},{"Title":"The Cases That Haunt Us: From Jack The Ripper To Jon Benet Ransey, The","review":"I admit I wasn't familiar with Douglas' earlier works or his connection with the Ramsey case before buying this: what drew me to the book were both the historical murders (Jack the Ripper, Lizzie Borden, & The Lindbergh case), and Douglas' way of approaching them, weighing all the evidence, considering victimology, the various suspects, and profiling the killer. What kept the book from being dry was Douglas' writing style, the fact that he spoke in his own voice, and not the voice of a police report. This offered a chance to see not just into the mind of the UNSUB's (unknown subjects), but also into the mind of Douglas, to see how he works these cases. Given the historical interest of the earlier cases, the book works quite well until the last chapter; Douglas provides many sensible hypotheses and observations to the cases of Jack the Ripper, Lizzie Borden, the Zodiac killer and the Boston strangler.However, the last chapter, dealing with the JonBenet Ramsey murder, is difficult going from the start, given Douglas' relation to the case. Obviously, he can't be completely objective. While he does go through all the evidence as meticulously as in the other chapters, he seems to be too close to the events in question. After describing an interview with John Ramsey and his lawyer, which ended in tears being shed by both men, Douglas writes, \\"Could this have been more staging for my benefit? I quickly concluded it was not. I think after interviewing hundreds of offenders and victims, I'm experienced enough to recognize genuine tears when I see them.\\"In the same chapter, Douglas argues that the child's killer would have had to enter the house and wait several hours for the Ramsey's to fall asleep before taking the girl from her bedroom. Yet in the chapter on Lizzie Borden, Douglas argues for Miss Borden's guilt by casting serious doubt that a stranger to the household would hide in the Borden house for the ninety minutes that elapsed between the two murders there.All in all, I believe that too little time, less than four years, has passed since the Ramsey case for Douglas or anyone else to write objectively about a subject which is still so emotionally charged. Interestingly enough, in the first chapter, Douglas admits that his feelings on the Jack the Ripper case have changed in the twelve years since he participated in a television show called The Secret Indentity of Jack the Ripper. I would be curious to hear Douglas' feelings about the Ramsey case in a decade or so, after some of the lingering controversy surrounding that case has faded."},{"Title":"The Cases That Haunt Us: From Jack The Ripper To Jon Benet Ransey, The","review":"I purchased this book on the assumption that Mr. Douglas would shed new light on old mysteries. I mistakenly assumed he would have looked at the case files and then offered new perspectives given his experience in profiling. Having some knowledge of the cases presented, I expected better.The Lindburgh chapter was interesting. In all these years, I somehow missed the fact that the kidnap ladder was hinged. I never doubted Hauptmann's involvement. And I still don't.Unlike others posting here, I take no issue with his stance on the Ramsey case, there is simply no solid evidence with which to charge them. Absent that evidence, it is irresponsible to assume their guilt. We should ALL know better than to convict people via the news media.My main gripe, I suppose, is that I expected better information on the Zodiac case. Douglas seems to rely almost entirely on the work of author Robert Graysmith. And Graysmith's work is unfortunately more fiction than fact. Perhaps Douglas should have used Graysmith's latest book identifying Jack the Ripper. He could have pronounced that case solved.If you still feel the need to read this book, borrow it from the library."},{"Title":"The Cases That Haunt Us: From Jack The Ripper To Jon Benet Ransey, The","review":"Jack the Ripper. Lizzie Borden. The Zodiac. Bruno Richard Hauptmann. The psycho who killed JonBenet Ramsey. Crispin Glover. O.k., that last name doesn't belong there, but the guy is so weird I thought I'd throw him in for good measure. All of these folks (except for Crispin Glover), according to former FBI profiler turned author John Douglas, share a common theme. One is murder, of course, but the other is their involvement in criminal cases that continue to haunt the public imagination. Plug in any one of the abovementioned names into a search engine and you'll understand why the authors chose \\"The Cases That Haunt Us\\" as the title of the book. On one of the most popular search engines JonBenet Ramsey brings up 780,000 returns. Jack the Ripper has over two million, Zodiac a million and a half. While not all of these links directly relate to these infamous cases, obviously, the numbers do show how these names have worked their way into the popular consciousness. And that occurred, sadly, because the crimes documented in this book are truly hideous, bone-chilling incidents of murder most foul that stand out even in a country as violent as America.John Douglas is a familiar name to those of us who follow dastardly deeds. He once worked as one of the premier criminal profilers at the FBI. Profiling is a cutting edge psychological approach to fighting crime that attained national prominence thanks to the film \\"The Silence of the Lambs\\". It's also a lot older than the FBI. Profiling an unknown criminal in an attempt to catch him or her stretches all the way back to the 19th century. But Douglas and his ilk updated the techniques and have used them to catch many murderers. Clever killers who would never have been captured are now sitting in prison thanks to profiling. So what exactly is profiling? Well, according to this book it involves assembling every scrap of available evidence and using said evidence to assemble a mental profile of the suspect. Douglas and his colleagues then determine if the killer is \\"organized\\" or \\"disorganized\\". They can then use the profile to identify likely suspects. Many times their profile matches a person being held in another, minor case. The purpose of \\"The Cases That Haunt Us\\" is, therefore, an attempt to apply profiling to major unsolved crimes. The results are, to say the least, interesting and likely controversial.If you believe Lizzie Borden killed her father with forty whacks, Douglas agrees with you--except for the forty whacks part. It took far fewer blows to do in Andrew Borden. But Douglas does believe beyond a shadow of a doubt that Lizzie killed her father and stepmother. He also comes up with a compelling suspect in the Jack the Ripper murders, although it's nothing we haven't seen in other treatments on the monster of Whitechapel. His analysis of the Lindbergh baby kidnapping endorses the view taken by history, i.e. that Bruno Richard Hauptmann was guilty of the crime, if not its prime architect. As for the Zodiac case...well...Douglas does a great job summarizing his terrible crime spree. Coming up with a viable, living suspect is another matter entirely. He also tackles the Black Dahlia mutilation, Bambi Bembenek, and the Boston Strangler outrages. He doesn't really shed new light on these cases, at least not in my opinion, but he does do an excellent job of assembling the facts and giving us an insight or two into the twisted minds that carried out the crimes. Ahh, to have had a modern profiler back in Jack the Ripper's day!The most controversial part of the book deals with the JonBenet Ramsey murder case. If you ever want to read about a crime that chills the blood, peruse the various accounts of this horrific killing. It's a case so bizarre in nearly every one of its aspects that solving the crime has proved insurmountable to everyone involved. That doesn't stop Douglas, who once worked as a paid advisor to John and Patsy Ramsey, from taking a crack at this mystifying incident. Those who believe the Ramseys killed their daughter will fume at Douglas's conclusions. He believes that an intruder invaded the house and murdered the young beauty queen. So do I, actually, although there's always that little part of me that suspects the parents. How else to explain the pineapple on the table, or that weird ransom note? To totally exclude the parents, one has to believe them incapable of carrying out such an evil act, and we know from the newspapers and television that such evil acts (and far worse) occur every day. We can't seem to rely on the evidence, which points to just about everyone in JonBenet's life as a possible suspect. Douglas does a great job of condensing the pertinent facts down to a few pages, but his analysis will do nothing to stop the endless speculation concerning the case that continues unabated to this day.On the whole, I'd say \\"The Cases That Haunt Us\\" is a worthy effort. It's not going to solve any of these cases, or even bring about a seismic shift in how we view these crimes, but it is a well-written account of these nightmarish events. I would definitely recommend this book to someone just starting to read about famous crimes. Douglas's ability to summarize the evidence is masterful, always a plus when you're refreshing the old memory banks or just charting a course into the dark waters of real life murder and mayhem. If you're an old hand looking for new information on Saucy Jacky, Lizzie, and JonBenet, I'd probably look elsewhere. You have already seen everything that appears here, and you have already heard about the suspects Douglas names in these pages."},{"Title":"The Cases That Haunt Us: From Jack The Ripper To Jon Benet Ransey, The","review":"THE CASES THAT HAUNT US provides fascinating and convincing insights into some very high-visibility crimes. When Douglas says Jack the Ripper was So-and-So or someone like So-and-So (I don't want to give you a spoiler here), I believe him. Douglas makes solid arguments regarding Jack the Ripper, Lizzie Borden, the Lindbergh kidnapping and the Zodiac. Those chapters kept me turning the pages and then wanting to learn more. I ordered additional Jack the Ripper and Lizzie Borden books and videos...even before I finished reading CASES.Which brings me to the last chapter, on JonBenet Ramsey. That chapter read too much like a justification of Douglas's controversial defense of the Ramseys, and less like a profile. After all, he didn't have access to the evidence he would normally use to make a profile, so how could he really decide that the Ramseys are innocent? He measures other theorists with the yardsticks: \\"people don't act out of character. If they appear to, it is only because you don't understand the character well enough,\\" and \\"'when you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.'\\" Douglas would do well to measure himself with those yardsticks, too.In retrospect, the \\"look and feel\\" of the beginning chapters of CASES doesn't seem to match the last chapter, and vice versa. Douglas and Olshaker seem to make careful studies of the historic cases, then quickly zoom over decades to Douglas's defense of his position regarding the Ramseys. Only a few references to the earlier murders tie the chapters together. Perhaps...the earlier chapters were included only as a build-up to JonBenet Ramsey. Alternatively, perhaps Douglas and Olshaker were writing a history, then decided to tack on JonBenet Ramsey. Or, maybe they knew that Jack the Ripper and JonBenet Ramsey would sell, and therefore added some cases in between.That said, the bottom line is that CASES is a slightly disjointed but intriguing book from beginning to end. There's something here for those interested in history, and those interested in current events."},{"Title":"The Cases That Haunt Us: From Jack The Ripper To Jon Benet Ransey, The","review":"This is one of those books that can completely change your view of events on a daily basis. It's the best of Douglas' books, and it creates order out of what had once been utter chaos. His Jack the Ripper chapter was particularly valuable. There has been so much garbage written about that case that Douglas's logical analysis was very welcome. After reading this book, I can't look at any crime the same way again, and I have also come to a different understanding of human psychology. I have recommended this book to everyone I know, and even the skeptical ones, once they started it, couldn't put it down! It made the rounds of my office, and then of my friends, and then of my friends' friends! Warning: it can be grim and horrific. The Lindbergh baby case and the JonBenet Ramsey cases in particular were painful. The authors are skilled at conveying the horrors of these crimes, yet at the same time really delving into the psyches of the criminals in an unflinching way."},{"Title":"The Cases That Haunt Us: From Jack The Ripper To Jon Benet Ransey, The","review":"This book shows how significant investigative insights emerge when extensive homicide experience, high intelligence, professional training and common sense are applied to murder cases.Unfortunately, throughout the four-year Ramsey investigation, we have all sadly witnessed what occurs when untrained, arrogant, and eventually corrupt law enforcement personnel decide who's guilty first and then concoct a case to cover their backsides. The case against the Ramseys that the Bouler Police have created doesn't even fit the indisputble forensic evidence (like the sequence of injuries), uses analyses from charlatans, misrepresents handwriting results (Patsy scored 4.5 out of 5, with 5 being absolutely no match) and dismisses key DNA evidence inside JonBenet's underwear because it doesn't match a Ramsey.This book should be required reading for all the &quot;mainstream&quot; journalists who were so easily fooled by the silly police and who gladly copied stories from the tabloids because it helped boost ratings. It should also be read by any American who still believes that the US media are ever honest in their reporting.Many decent people have been manipulated into believing &quot;The Ramseys Did It&quot; despite the extensive evidence that the family was not involved. The Ramsey case section of this book should make us all ashamed of our gullibility and willingness to believe whatever we're fed by the media.Read this book. You'll be glad you did. You will see that there are still honest people who will stand up for the truth, even in the face of hysteria and hatred."},{"Title":"The Cases That Haunt Us: From Jack The Ripper To Jon Benet Ransey, The","review":"In The Cases That Haunt Us, former FBI profiler John Douglas - along with his frequent collaborator writer-filmmaker Mark Olshaker - examines some of the prevailing mysteries of the last century and a half. In-depth chapters on Jack the Ripper, Lizzie Borden, the Lindbergh Kidnapping, and the Zodiac intrigue and bring interesting facts to light - including the naming of a suspect in the Ripper case. Lesser sections, collected in a chapter called American Dreams/American Nightmares, bring the focus onto The Black Dahlia, the Boston Strangler, and Lawrencia Bembenek - the last of whom I had never heard of before. The better chapters - Jack the Ripper, Lindbergh, and the Boston Strangler section - are easily 5 star entries, while lesser chapters are still good - 3 or 4 star.However, it is the crux of the book is the JonBenet Ramsey murder. The penultimate chapter of the work, the JonBenet Ramsey case seems to be the sole reason the book was written. In light of this chapter, all the rest seem but Douglas establishing his bona fides, setting himself up to justify his opinion on this, the only case in the book, he personally worked. A case he regularly references in the earlier chapters. The chapter remains interesting and his arguments seem sound. However, this chapter greatly bogs down the rest of the work as does Douglas's sometimes cocky attitude - as seen in his assurance that he could have secured a confession from Lizzie Borden among other places.Another oft mentioned case which would have fit into this volume is the OJ Simpson trial, brought up several times to illustrate points but never truly discussed. Also regularly mentioned is the Unabomber case, which was solved - and on which Douglas and Olshaker have already released a book (Unabomber: On the Trail of America's Most-Wanted Serial Killer). Still either of these or any of numerous other unsolved or dubiously solved cases would have fit better.I first read the chapter on Jack the Ripper when the book first came out over a decade ago, and was glad to get a hold of a copy so I could finish reading the work. Despite the above mentioned issues, the book remains an interesting and compelling read. Given the opportunity I would gladly read Douglas and Olshaker's other works, particularlyMindhunterwhich deals with Douglas's time at the FBI and their novelBroken Wings.Recommended especially for fans of True Crime and Police Procedurals, as well as interested readers in general. Probably a 4 star book, but as I said earlier, bogged down by the Ramsey chapter."},{"Title":"The Cases That Haunt Us: From Jack The Ripper To Jon Benet Ransey, The","review":"This book is well written and very informative.

You'll learn about the business side (dealing with clients, sticky politics between directors and producers, etc), the technical side (the equipment you'll need, what it all does, etc), and the musical side (developing themes and so on). He also includes interviews with several other prominent film composers, which is great because he asks the questions other musicians would ask.Rona's style is quite approachable, as evidenced by the column he's written for Keyboard magazine for years. In fact, my only criticism of the book might be that some of the chapters are taken directly from his past columns and the result is sometimes a choppy transition from one chapter to the next.

Seems like everything I pick up by the guy is wonderful. This early piece (a collection? A long poem? Can't tell) continues the trend.It's either a collection of short, untitled pieces (which the acknowledgments section would seem to indicate) or a longer work called \\"White\\" with a postscript. Either way, it's classic Simic and well worth the trouble it will take to hunt down. It's more classically surreal than his later works, but with the same tone of understated wit, the same veneration of the odd ins-and-outs of quirky beauty, the same engaging, and distinct, diction.If you're not yet familiar with the work of Charles Simic, the only reason not to start with this one is that it will take you way too long to find, probably.

I'm a pediatrcian, like the author, who was recently diagnosed with prostate cancer and had a radical prostatectomy with good results. I was hoping for more wisdom from reading the book, but found most of it only in the introduction. The author's obsessive pursuit of knowledge in order to make his decision fit his personality, but perhaps not many others. His anecdotal comments about the surgical option are just that, and far from what I experienced. I'm afraid that many of his own fears will only serve to cause more anxiety to readers than is necessary and prevent them from &quot;coming to peace&quot; with prostate cancer and the decision they make.

My cousin recommended the John Gunnell reference books as a good bet for a well-rounded source. I've read his Ford book and found it to be an excellent source for all things Ford, and therefore decided to order the Cadillac book.The good news is that this book really is a great reference to have on hand, at least for the relative newcomer to the collector car world. The text is concise for the most part, fairly exhaustive, and the photos are mostly of good quality and in color. The book itself would make a great \\"coffee table\\" reference with its colorful covers, large size and numerous photos.Once inside the reference, however, there seemed to be a lot of errors in spelling and sentence structure. On top of this, many of the photos are mis-labeled as to the model year and body style of the cars pictured. Not knowing much about the earlier Cadillacs of the 20th century, I'm not sure whether I can always trust the captions or not. I also found at least one instance of a block of text in one column being repeated, verbatum, in the next, as if that section had managed to escape the editorial staff. I almost got the impression that this was a pre-publication of some kind that had found its way into the general public before the final revision was released. I don't believe it is, however, it's just odd to me that they didn't seem to edit the book more carefully before its publication.All-in-all, a wonderful reference book with loads of great information, and I would recommend it wholeheartedly as long as the buyer is aware of the editing \\"glitches\\" before purchase. I just wouldn't necessarily use it to win any bets without first checking another source for verification."},{"Title":"Standard Catalog Of Cadillac 1903-2005, 3RD EDITION","review":"A very good book with all the statistics on every model immaginable.

Take the story of the 1972 Oakland A's.Blue Moon Odom, a solid veteran pitcher for the team, spent his off-season working at a store, where he wound up getting shot trying to stop a robbery.Meanwhile, another pitcher on that same team, Vida Blue, who won 1971's Cy Young and Most Valuable Player awards, patiently listened as A's owner Charlie Finley told him: \\"You have as much chance of getting $115,000 from me as I do of jumping out of my office window.\\" The amazing part was that Finley was right.In 1970, a temperamental slugger named Reggie Jackson would be forced by Finley to publicly apologize for making a face in Finley's direction after slamming a game-winning home run. Bonus money that wouldn't pay for a night on the town with Derek Jeter today made everything alright again, sort of. Jackson was not only playing for Finley two years later but heroically injured himself to help his team capture the American League crown.Ron Bergman's 1973 \\"Mustache Gang\\" is a time capsule in many ways. First, it is a deep-dish profile of the Athletics as Finley built them into the 1972 World Champions. Also, it captures the rush of excitement in that success, a feeling of being inside an exciting locomotive controlled by an entertaining madman, equal parts P.T. Barnum and Caligula, and fueled by a nutty gang of misfits who serve up a never-ending barrage of amusing zingers and fisticuffs, at their opponents and sometimes each other.Because it was published in May, 1973, Bergman's book misses the fact the A's won the 1973 and 1974 championships, too. More importantly, it misses something else, the fact that a lot of Finley's act wasn't all that funny, and that some of the things he was doing to his players and personnel was downright hurtful and demeaning. He fired managers and released players for the flimsiest of reasons, mainly to keep beat writers like Bergman writing about him. And it worked. Bergman's not blind to Finley's antics, but he serves them up as part of the entertainment. The fact Finley was ultimately not a good man, perhaps the most miserable man ever in an industry that has produced several worthy candidates, is missed.So to is a real idea of what about the A's made them great. Bergman's book focuses instead on the colorful antics. And I enjoyed it a lot of the time. Like the time Catfish Hunter, a 20-game winner, takes a reporter aside and demands to know why he wrote a story about his stealing a bullhorn, which resulted in a team fine.But I didn't write you stole the bullhorn, the writer replies. It never came out who did steal it.\\"Well, as soon as my wife read it in the paper, she knew. The first thing she asks me when we got back home was, 'Cat, why did you take that thing?'\\"That's fun stuff. If only the book gave as much attention to the game being played. Rollie Fingers was as much a reason as anyone on the 1972 A's for their championship, but he didn't generate any off-the-field controversy and barely gets mentioned. Instead, it serves up innuendo about why Vida Blue was visiting a hospital.But I read this book quickly because Bergman, who obviously did his time in the press box and the locker room, knew what he was writing about, and serves it up well. He has a lean style and an ear for a telling comment. He doesn't make judgments, which can be a good thing sometimes. There are two kinds of sports writers, the windy George Will types and the kind who stick to facts, and Bergman belonged in the latter camp.About as close as he gets to prophesy is accidental: \\"Champagne is funny. It goes down like ginger ale. Then it hits.\\" Bergman's description of the A's victory celebration is nicely apt; too bad his narrative didn't linger for the hangover."},{"Title":"The Soviet Estimate: U.S. Intelligence Analysis and Soviet Strategic Forces","review":"Book ReviewsUnited Press International July 27, 1982Jack ReddenThe Soviet Estimate: U.S. intelligence analysis and Russian military strength, by John Prados (Dial Press, $17.95)John Prados could not have picked a better time for his book, ''The Soviet Estimate.'' The Reagan adminstration has been busy telling of the Soviet threat ever since taking office.Each new adminstration goes through the rhetoric and then reality of deciding a military policy, but this one came in with claims of American weakness reminiscent of John Kennedy's charges of a ''missile gap.''The history of U.S. estimates of Soviet strength that Prados relates is not likely to raise optimism in the nation. But more alarming than mistakes in estimates, which obviously so far haven't been fatal, is the political maneuvering with the figures by both elected officials and the military-intelligence establishments.For all the criticism of the CIA, history seems to show less danger of off-base figures from that body, involved just in spying, than from branches of the military with vested interests in the perceived Soviet threat.The record consistently shows high estimates from the air force for the Soviet airborne threat -- backing up its demands for larger budget allocations to counter the supposed danger.Despite skepticism based on past over-estimates, Prados does agree with the view that both the United States and the Soviet Union are nearing the point of being able to destroy each other's land-based missiles.Whether or not there really will be a ''window-of-vulnerability'' in the next few years, he correctly points out that the government's estimates of Soviet power and intentions will become ever more important during this period as the concern over a pre-emptive strike deepens.--Red Scares;The Soviet Estimate: U,S, Intelligence Analysis and Russian Military Strength. By John PradosNewsweekJuly 12, 1982,BOOKS; Pg. 74ALENNY GLYNNSilencer pistols and sang-froid are the staples of spy novels, but satellite photos and yellowed clippings from foreign technical journals have more to do with the most crucial role of intelligence agencies: weighing the military capacities and the intentions of a nation's adversaries. In \\"The Soviet Estimate,\\" John Prados fills a virtual information vacuum on how well America's spies have assessed Soviet power and prospects since World War II.It is a tale more reminiscent of Kafka than le Carre--duels are waged with memos in Washington, not stilettos in Budapest. From the infancy of atomic weapons to current disputes about verifying nuclear-arms treaties, Prados surveys a series of controversies within the U.S. intelligence community that have shaped both American perceptions and arms budgets.He traces an oscillating pattern of smug underestimates followed by overblown discoveries of new Soviet \\"threats.\\" The Kremlin's development of nuclear weapons, for example, came years earlier than Western experts predicted in the late 1940s. As if to make up for that, a series of worrisome but ill-founded scares about Soviet bomber and missile strength followed in the 1950s and early 1960s.Bluster: As Prados shows, the Soviets fueled American fears--in one case by flying a single wing of Bison bombers past a U.S. military attache twice, thus doubling American estimates of Russia's bomber strength. Nikita Khrushchev also bluffed about the mighty clout of his missile forces after the 1957 sputnik launch (they were, in fact, tiny and highly inaccurate). That bluster spawned the \\"missile gap\\" that helped elect John Kennedy in 1960. Then, to Moscow's horror, Kennedy proceeded to build the more than 1,000 ICBM's that still form the core of the U.S. deterrent. Having overestimated Soviet power in the late 1950s, the CIA proceeded to underestimate the scope and pace ofthe Soviet buildup that followed the Kremlin's humiliating backdown in the 1962 Cuban missile crisis.Prados believes that both the errors and the criticism of them stem, in part, from the most troubling trend in the U.S. intelligence community: the growing importance of both service interests--particularly the Navy and Air Force--and of political ideology in shaping intelligence estimates. Frightening estimates that help secure approval for new weapons systems generally advance their authors' careers--even when they later prove grossly off the mark. The civilian role in the process has steadily weakened. Under a system inaugurated by Henry Kissinger, for example, a single CIA analyst is now responsible for producing each year's \\"Soviet Estimate.\\" The effect is to pit a lone civilian's views against those of the corporate bodies of Army, Air Force and Naval intelligence--backed by the political weight of the services and the defense industries that equip them.Worse still, as the CIA's influence weakened in the late 1970s and early 1980s, its willingness to bend with the political winds grew. In recent years the agency has doubled both its estimates of the percent of the Russian economy devoted to the military and the number of incidents staged by international terrorists. We live in an era when analysis of Soviet weaponry and the capacity to monitor it are crucial to any hope of stopping the nuclear-arms spiral. \\"The Soviet Estimate\\" makes a strong case that arms-control advocates should now be clamoring to \\"unleash\\" the CIA's deskbound analysts even more fervently than they did to restrain its covert-action \\"spooks.\\""},{"Title":"The Hot Dog Syndrome: Everlasting Strategies for Obtaining Money, Enjoyment and Security from Your Business","review":"Most entrepreneurs are so caught up in putting out fires on a daily basis that they lose sight of the big picture and a long term business plan.

Rarely in fantasy art collections do you get a chance to get a glimpse behind the creation of the art. That is exactly what More Fantasy Art Masters does. The book spotlights ten very talented, yet very diversified artists and lets them provide commentary on their own work. Fans now can get inside their heads to know their motivations behind a piece. What perhaps those novices among us may have viewed as random placements of items in a painting, of color and light is actually very carefully planned from the beginning. In addition the artists provide interesting insights into their own careers.We'll see how colors are chosen to present interesting contrasts between foreground and background and to set the proper mood of the piece. For example a Keith Parkinson painting, (one of my favorites) shows a couple of Orcs riding on horseback through a snow covered forest. The trees devoid of leaves and nearly of life provides an austere, grim setting as the pair seem hellbent on some type of evil quest. Most interesting and previously something I never fully realized is how color is used to very subtly convey moods and emotions, almost on a subliminal level. To hear the artists tell it in their own words sets off a bell in your head as you truly grasp what they hoped to convey in the painting. It's quite fascinating. The artists also go into great detail on the tools and materials they used for the works on display. Some work soley in one type of medium whether it's oil, acrylic, water color, digital, etc, while others are quite comfortable in combining several different types of paint.The artists included in the book are Keith Parkinson, Anne Sudworth, Judith Clute, Phil Hale, Ian Miller, J.K. Potter, Greg Spalenka, Dave Seeley, Darrel Anderson, and John Harris. The book really does a great job of spotlighting an eclectic array of talent.Reviewed by Tim Janson"},{"Title":"More Fantasy Art Masters: The Best Fantasy and Science Fiction Artists Show How They Work","review":"A little frustrated with the seller on this one.

The cover made me think it would be a bunch of artists like the first but in this one they are more computer based artist and artists who paint far more loosely.

(Classic fiction series)","review":"Another great story from L. Ron Hubbard. This one is an air adventure story featuring Breeze Callahan who works diligently at proving the effectiveness of gliders to the US Government. Hubbard's love of flying comes across in this story which was originally published in 1936.

Kudos!"},{"Title":"Sky birds dare! (Classic fiction series)","review":"I honestly wasn't sure if I would enjoy this one, but quickly changed my minds within minutes. This story pulls you in almost immediately, and really keeps you rooting for the 'good guy', even through his ups and downs.Breeze Callaghan is a very smart man that tries to convince the Navy the value of gliders and gliding techniques for the war. They can be used to aid the war by keeping a plane up in the air when engines cut out, and to spy on enemies undetected, as gliders can enter silently.But Breeze and his mentor Pop Donegon, are sabotaged time and time again by their rival, Badger O'Dowell. Badger has his own conventional motorized training planes he wants the Navy to use, so he will do anything to remove the competition, even if it means death. Every demonstration Breeze gives the military, Badger sabotages it, damaging each glider used.After getting tired, and quite frustrated with Badger, Breeze decides to put it all to rest by attempting to prove his gliders are the best. Unfortunately, it also ends up putting his life in danger once more, along with a few others.This is definitely a good guy versus bad guy story, that really shows not only children, but us all, that good always conquers evil in the end. With having such good morals and values played throughout, I couldn't recommend Sky Birds Dare! enough. L Ron Hubbard has done it again, as this pulp fiction story is one whole family will enjoy."},{"Title":"Sky birds dare!

(Stories from the Golden Age)"},{"Title":"Sky birds dare! (Classic fiction series)","review":"Hubbard was a major player in the pulp fiction world in the 1930's and 1940's. From westerns and suspense to adventures on land and sea, he was one of the most prolific, popular, and entertaining writers of the pulp period. \\"Sky Birds Dare,\\" originally published in Five Novels in September, 1936, chronicles the story of Breeze Callahan, crackerjack glider pilot, who tries to demonstrate the value of gliders and gliding techniques in the war effort behind enemy lines. In this daring tale, Breeze attempts to convince the Navy of the glider's value; but also, has to weather his competitor, Badger O'Dowell's attempts to sabotage his efforts.I believe this narrative reaches its zenith because of Hubbard's extensive real-life experience as a glider pilot with George Washington University \\"Buzzards\\" in the 1930's. He infuses that experience into this pulp to capture the thrill and rush of silent flight interwoven with romance and the intrigue of sabotage and betrayal. Like Icarus, Hubbard's hero, Breeze climbs steadily in the dangerous and troubling sky roads fearlessly unaware of the looming consequences."},{"Title":"Sky birds dare!

This gang is up to Galaxy Audio's usual high standards, adding just the right amounts of drama and satire to their roles.In addition to the excellent cast named above, \\"Sky Birds Dare!\\" features Galaxy Audio's superb music and sound enhancements. It seems like more and more publishers are doing this kind of cinematic audio production, but I don't think anyone does it as well as Galaxy. The voices, music, and sound effects hit you seemingly from every direction, putting you right in the middle of the action. The passage I quoted above is a perfect example of this. All through the scene we hear Breeze grunting and straining at the controls, the light framework of the glider rattling, rain spattering the cockpit, wind howling, lightning crashing; adrenaline junkies beware. If you've never experienced this kind of audio production, you're in for a real treat.Steven Brandt - Audiobook Heaven"},{"Title":"Sky birds dare! (Classic fiction series)","review":"\\"Sky Birds Dare!\\"by L. Ron Hubbardmulticast performanceproduced by Galaxy Audioto be released November, 2011Approx 2 hoursPulp magazines (often referred to as \\"the pulps\\"), also collectively known as pulp fiction, refers to inexpensive fiction magazines published from 1896 through the 1950s. The typical pulp magazine was seven inches wide by ten inches high, half an inch thick, and 128 pages long. Pulps were printed on cheap paper with ragged, untrimmed edges. The name pulp comes from the cheap wood pulp paper on which the magazines were printed. Magazines printed on better paper were called \\"glossies\\" or \\"slicks.\\" They were most often priced at ten cents per magazine, while competing slicks were 25 cents apiece. Pulps were the successor to the penny dreadfuls, dime novels, and short fiction magazines of the 19th century.Although many respected writers wrote for pulps, the magazines are best remembered for their lurid and exploitative stories and sensational cover art. L. Ron Hubbard published many short stories and novellas during this period in these pulps. Galaxy Press has been reprinting these stories and have created their own pulps (these have better paper quality) featuring stories from the many genres in which Hubbard wrote. I have to admit my favorites are from the Science-Fiction and Fantasy genres, but recently I've been exploring some of the other genres. I've been amazed at what other genres I began liking; such as Westerns. I never thought I'd be a fan of westerns, but Hubbard wrote some fun stories in that genre. My favorites, other than sci-fi/fantasy, seem to come from the Air and Sea Adventures, maybe that has to do with my Navy background.What also makes these stories fun is that I've chosen to listen to these books. I love audio books and when I first tried out one of these stories from Galaxy Audio, I was amazed. First of all they sound like old radio dramas, like back in the day the stories were originally published, and the talent behind these productions is phenomenal. Starting with the actors, these stories take on a new life with superb voice actors performing them. The actors even give the characters a larger than life feel which is true to the Hubbard stories.The next aspect of these stories in audiobook is the sound effects and music. Between chapters and stories Galaxy Audio segues with original music that blends perfect with in the genre. The sound effects are perfect and at the same time subtle enough to not be overbearing. They sweep you up into the story and don't allow you to let go until the end.This story, \\"Sky Birds Dare!,\\" was originally published in Five-Novels Monthly September, 1936. and tells the story of a glider pilot, trying to demonstrate the value of gliders and gliding techniques in war. Not only does he have to convince the Navy of their value but he has to survive a competitor's ruthless attempts to destroy him.Ace glider pilot Breeze Callaghan is an definitely an Ace when it comes to gliders, although he has never flown a powered aircraft. There are two ways Breeze believes they can be used to aid the war effort: they'll keep a plane aloft when engines cut out, and gliders will be able to enter enemy airspace silently--a perfect way to spy undetected. Breeze loves the feel of the glider in flight, because a powered craft is always beating the air into submission, a glider uses what nature gives to move through space.Callahan's ruthless competitor, Badger O'Dowell, has other ideas. Badger's determined to get the Navy to buy his training ships instead. So every chance he gets He sabotages Breeze's demonstrations. These sabotages not only wreck the gliders but endanger Breeze's life.After several run-ins with O'Dowell, Breeze finally just decides to set a flight record, after saving himself from one sabotage by using heat updrafts to stay aloft. He decides to use a storm and the landscape to fly down the Appalachian Mountains. The storm becomes too much for him and the plane following and soon Breeze has to use his skills to save lives.This book will keep you on the edge as Breeze manages to save himself through all the flights."},{"Title":"Sky birds dare! (Classic fiction series)","review":"What I liked about this story was that it really showed the value of understanding flying gliders to assist with powered flight. This story was written decades prior to Captain Sullenberger making his famous landing in the Hudson River, once again proving the value of glider training. As is usual with Hubbard's adventures, it is very fast paced and incredibly enjoyable telling the story of ace glider pilot Breeze Callahan who is trying to sell the Navy on the importance of using gliders in training pilots."},{"Title":"Divided by God: America's Church-State Problem--and What We Should Do About It","review":"Feldman's book is an intelligently written discussion of both the history of church-state law in the U.S. and the current debates that engage our society. Feldman works his way from the founding to the latest Supreme Court decisions of the last 15 years which have reshaped the interpretation of the Establishment Clause; the result is a fascinating overview of the legal and cultural evolution of America's ideas about church and state.The great strength of this book is its focus on ideas and their development. Feldman does an excellent job laying out the reasoning used by various sides of the church-state debates over the last 200 years; he also frequently critiques these historical arguments, not as a partisan, but as more of a guide to these debates.There are two larger issues that were problematic for me in this book:First, I think Feldman's discussion of the church-state arguments made by the framers of the Constitution is too cursory and somewhat oversimplified. The Founding-era debates were arguably the most sophisticated and philosophically complex of all in American church-state history, and a bulkier, more rigorous chapter would have been better. After having read such great historical studies on this era as \\"The Sacred Fire of Liberty,\\" \\"Original Meanings,\\" and \\"The Founding Fathers and The Place of Religion in America,\\" I was disappointed in this part of Feldman's book.Second, I think Feldman overemphasizes the partisan divide over church and state in our contemporary culture. This sentence captures Feldman's outlook:\\"...no single, unified theory or logical reason can explain the arrangements we now have. They are the product of an ongoing battle. The field has changed, some objectives have been captured and others lost, and disorder reigns.\\"Probably only the most active players and partisans would view the current status as an 'ongoing battle' where 'some objectives have been captured.' Most reasonable Americans are likely to find many of the recent Supreme Court decisions relying on Justice O'Connor's 'endorsement test' a fair compromise in tune with the deeper principle motivating the First Amendment. At the very least, I doubt that most Americans fall neatly into either of the two warring camps Feldman describes, although there are activist groups that certainly do fit.This is a great book - one of best books on the subject I have read covering the specific legal and cultural arguments over all of American history and not just a specific era. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Divided by God: America's Church-State Problem--and What We Should Do About It","review":"While I find Mr. Feldman solution to the Church-State problem overly simplistic and probably unworkable, I found the book in general to be very useful. It helps one to understand the series of events that have brought the United States to today's church/state quagmire. The history leading up to a situation is always useful in understanding that situation (and possibly finding solutions and compromises to solve problems.)The majority of Mr. Feldman's book deals with the history of how we arrived at where we are today. It is readable, not overly verbose and easy to follow and understand. Mr. Feldman has written with little or no editorial content in describing the history of the church/state problem. He is to be congratulated for this effort and his book read in the context of the clear concise history he presents."},{"Title":"Divided by God: America's Church-State Problem--and What We Should Do About It","review":"If the church - state debate interests you, you owe it to yourself to get informed. This book does an excellent job of blowing up all the talking points, from both sides of the political spectrum and helps the reader understand what happened and see both sides of this fascinating issue. Here's a list of interesting, historical observations which vary from the typical left and right talking points.The nation was NOT founded by Christians. Most of the founders were deists who believed in a creator, but were NOT traditional christians.Those who wrote the constitution did not think christian symbols, prayer in public ceremonies or other chrsitian trappings \\"established\\" religion.Bible reading was prominent in public schools all the way into the middle of the 20th century and was viewed as a way of establishing public morality. It was NOT viewed as establishing religion.The judges who created a more severe interpretation of the establishment clause were influenced by the events of World War II, where millions were killed on the basis of their religion alone. The idea that they might have been power hungry, liberal and secular judges is not strongly supported by the facts. Justice Black who wrote the first opinion in 1947 that called for a \\"high wall of separation\\" was a former klansman and was concerned about one religion holding sway, not with building a secular country.The establishment clause was originally applied only to federal matters.There are many more fascinating historical facts that will help inform and broaden your grasp of this issue.I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Divided by God: America's Church-State Problem--and What We Should Do About It","review":"The author first gives a very detailed history of the church-state relationship in this country, which helps him support his thesis that the religious clauses to the first amendment should only be used to prevent financial entanglement, as opposed to symbolic (ie manger scene in front of city hall)."},{"Title":"Divided by God: America's Church-State Problem--and What We Should Do About It","review":"This book does an absolutely fantastic job of laying out an objective history of church-state issues in America. The author places a particular emphasis on the interplay between church and education. Considering the large role government plays in American education this is perhaps logical. If the book had stopped at the history lesson I would have given it five stars. Unfortunately, perhaps because of the pundit media culture in which we live, the author felt compelled to throw in some advocation at the end of the book.I braced myself for the conlusion... Would I love it? Would I hate it and shout out loud at my book as though the author could actually hear my disgust? Unfortunately neither. The conclusion is undeveloped, sophomoric, and perhaps worst of all... BORING! I found myself not caring at all about what this guy had to say. I actually had trouble finishing the book after absolutely loving the first 95% of it.So basically I loved the history (which is almost all of the book) but hated the conclusion."},{"Title":"Divided by God: America's Church-State Problem--and What We Should Do About It","review":"Unlike the rest of the \\"reviewers\\", I think that this book:\\"Divided by God:America's Church-State Problem\\" addresses a very real problem within the culture of the United States. WE THE PEOPLE, who are Christians, regardless of theological stripe, want control of the nation and each other.Feldman addresses the history of the problem extremely accurately. His recounting of that history may be a little dry but his conclusions are on target, in my humble opinion.This is a book written for this time, for unlike any time previous to this, we are in national crisis attempting to determine who shall rule the \\"ways and means of our country\\". This book, and I would recommend its inclusion as a textbook in college religion courses or sociology/anthropology courses, is an avenue of addressing the issues ar large within our culture.Read this book! This book is an indepth study of the history of the difficulties of our \\"balanced\\" church-state relationship. This book makes perfect sense in the context of our confused times."},{"Title":"Divided by God: America's Church-State Problem--and What We Should Do About It","review":"Now at Harvard Law, at the time he wrote this book Feldman taught law at New York University. He has emerged as one of the nation's leading experts on the relationship of church and state. He argues that the Founding Fathers, and the United States Constitution they left us, never intended to separate religion and politics or even religion and state via an impermeable \\"wall of separation.\\" Rather, they intended what they said in the First Amendment: \\"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.\\"Feldman believes we need to provide even more freedom for public religious expression--despite the wishes of \\"legal secularists,\\"--people who want to fully privatize religion via the law, and with more religious diversity than desired by \\"values evangelicals\\"--those who want to legalize their particular view of public morality. Then, Feldman states we should vigorously maintain a financial wall of separation--absolutely no tax generated government funds for any purpose whatsoever.This is an interesting book offering a different, creative argument. I liked the book and the argument.As to Feldman's solution? God be with you in making it happen."},{"Title":"Divided by God: America's Church-State Problem--and What We Should Do About It","review":"Divided by God: America's Church State Problem and What we Should Do About It by Noah Feldman.The author writes about all the church/state issues since the beginning of our country as well as the issues confronting us today and how to deal with them.One such early story regarded how many jurisdictions would have a church tax. The government would collect taxes and then give to the denomination of the taxpayer's choice. It was believed churches would die if they did not received tax money and it was further believed churches were important to society as they were the only institution providing moral authority, which guided civilization.There was also some discussion in the early days that the Constitutional Amendment on freedom of religion only applied to the federal government and no necessarily to state governments.Many religious people today talk about the Christian foundation upon which this country was formed, yet Feldman makes mention of the fact Jefferson rejected the issue of a personal God. Madison did not feel the government should pay salaries for government chaplains. Mail service was delivered on Sundays up until 1912.The religious right seems to have been around (albeit in a different name) since the beginning. There was an attempt in the mid l800's to have a Constitutional Amendment, which would recognize the Christian God and the Bible as the foundation for this country. Fortunately and obviously it did not pass.I had always wanted to know the exact story of how the Mormons left the issue of bigamy and why the U. S. Court made any ruling on the issue. As you probably know, the Mormons went cross-country escaping states, which would not allow them to practice this part of their religion. They decided to settle in a territory of Utah, which had no prohibition for this practice. Then the Congress passed a law saying bigamy would be outlawed in the territories. The Mormons took the issue to court. The Supreme Court ruled though this was an infringement upon their religious right, they felt that allowing this practice would create a domino affect on other religious practices. What if a religion wanted to burn people at the stake, for instance? When the Supreme Court ruled against them, their leader had a new revelation saying that bigamy would no longer be allowed as an official church practice.Another interesting story was when local jurisdictions started to mandate children saying the Pledge of Allegiance, many Jehovah Witnesses protested. They took their case to the Supreme Court and lost. Then as FDR started appointing new people to the Court, the JW's decided to try again and the Court reversed itself.He also talks about current day issues and the conflict between the religious right and people on the other side. He fears a real battle ahead unless both sides can find common ground.He talks about the issue of Christmas. He feels it is a cultural activity for the vast majority of US citizens, therefore people who don't celebrate Christmas should \\"just get used to it\\". I would say there is a difference between public and private sector. The private sector can do whatever it wants, but the public sector should not celebrate any religious holiday. (I am such a strong advocate for church separation to think that government offices should be open on Dec 25).He talks about \\"under God\\" issue in the Pledge. He mentions the JW issue of not wanting to say the Pledge. Their argument was not that everyone should refrain only they should be allowed to. He feels that should be the compromise for those who do not want the word God in the Pledge.He feels the same as I do that there is a different between church and state, which must always be separate and religion and politics, which cannot be separated. Religious people (on both right and left) have a constitutional right and a religious mandate to try to change laws as they feel is best.The author is a former clerk for the U. S. Supreme Court and now law professor. The book sometimes is written for attorneys and therefore at times difficult for a layperson like me to gasp all the aspects of his writing. Nevertheless, it is a fascinating book to read."},{"Title":"Divided by God: America's Church-State Problem--and What We Should Do About It","review":"Did you know the Constitution never mentions God, and it explicitly stops Congress from \\"establishing\\" a religion? Yet, the official motto of our country is \\"In God We Trust.\\" Did you know that President John Adams made Thanksgiving a day of fasting and mortification? Save for perhaps the pain Detroit Lions' fans always seem to endure on the third Thursday in November, modern Thanksgivings are a far cry from Adams' ideal. Clearly, times have changed but God and religion, as Feldman lays out, are very much part of our heritage. His brilliant book, Divided by God, begs the question: Do Americans truly want resolution on the issue of separation. Like Judge Noah Sweat's position on whiskey, we seem to enjoy our \\"if when you say\\" position that goes something like this: If when you say religion, you mean the right to free exercise of religion, Parochial Schools, religious organizations that provide tender care for our little children, our blind, our deaf, our dumb, our pitiful aged, and infirm, then we are for it. But, if when you say relgion, you mean those organizations that would impose their views upon others, who would exclude you from their organizations, their country clubs, their conversations, their private rituals, then we are against it. Or to put it another way, if the winless Detroit Lions ever expect to win a game, look for their fans to be singing Irving Berlin's \\"God Bless America\\" next Sunday.

I think the entire premise of this book is based on the history of the concept of secularism and all the definitions associated with it. Because of his legal background, Feldman draws together the cases that have helped shape America's face with the history behind the cases. It is very interesting to see how America's idea of secularism has changed and why. This book is well complimented by Stark and Finke's \\"Acts of Faith\\" and \\"Habits of the Heart\\" by Bella et all."},{"Title":"Divided by God: America's Church-State Problem--and What We Should Do About It","review":"In \\"Divided By God\\" Noah Feldman examines the church state issue from the problem of state, and colony, sponsored churches faced by the Founding Fathers, traces the history of church state relations, and how the ideas of the Founding Fathers were interpreted, from then to now. At the end he poses a possible solution that is well worth considering. His scholarship is excellent, and his writing is thoroughly readable. Those who have strong secularist tendencies as well as those with strong religious convictions should read this \\"outside the box\\" and potential solution to a huge dividing factor in American political life today."},{"Title":"Divided by God: America's Church-State Problem--and What We Should Do About It","review":"This book has been valuable for my students in terms of providing historic background on the rise of secularism in the US. The conclusion, however is rather flawed and presupposes a level of civility (present or future) among parties that is somewhat naive. A lot of unwarranted \\"shoulds\\"! Other authors (notably William Connolly) raise similar points but in a more considered framework."},{"Title":"Divided by God: America's Church-State Problem--and What We Should Do About It","review":"Feldman attempts to \\"solve\\" church/state tensions by dividing the country into two camps -- secularists and evangelicals. This starting premise dooms the book. He has bought into the evangelicals' rhetoric, rather than any actual array of beliefs on these issues. Those in opposition to the evangelicals are not anti-religion, as the term \\"secularist\\" implies, but rather in the vast majority of circumstances are themselves religious. The debate over relgion in the U.S. cannot be reduced to this simple dichotomy. This is an ivory tower worldview, untouched by empirical reality."},{"Title":"Divided by God: America's Church-State Problem--and What We Should Do About It","review":"America's church-state conflict figures prominently in a number of debates - same-sex marriages, stem-cell research, abortion, euthanasia, appropriateness of the death penalty, religious displays in public buildings and areas, government funding of religious schools, prayer in the schools, and the words \\"under God\\" in the Pledge. These issues have increasingly divided the U.S. for about the last 50 years, and during the last Presidential campaign they were increasingly used by Republicans for political advantage.Feldman points out that about one-fourth of the 2004 electorate identified \\"moral values\\" as most important to them, and 80% of those voted for Bush. Further, the more often voters attended church, the more likely they were to also vote for him. Clearly this is an area very important to many.Feldman then goes on to divide Americans into two camps: 1)Those who insist on the direct relevance of religious values to political decisions (values evangelicals), and 2)Those who see religion as a personal and private issue (legal secularists). The \\"values evangelicals\\" are especially populated by \\"born-again\\" Christians, but also may include some Jews, Catholics, and Muslims.Feldman's proposed \\"solution\\" to the conflict betwen the two groups is to allow religion where it is inclusive (eg. multiple religious displays). Unfortunately, I see little value in this approach - the Republicans have found great political value in exploiting the issue as long as Democrats predominantly populate the legal secularist group, and the Christian evangelicals dominate the values-evangelical group (not willing to compromise)."},{"Title":"Divided by God: America's Church-State Problem--and What We Should Do About It","review":"There have been many new books to come out about God and Christianity in the last six months, and this one is nonpartisan in nature which makes it easier to comprehend. Religion used to be private, but it seems that we need more, a pluralist understanding of the Americans' spiritual journey. From paganism in the 1800s to evangelicalism in which members consider themselves as being 'born again' (began in 1846 but very active today), pentecostalism (1901) where they 'speak in tongues' and some handle rattlesnakes to charismatics in the 1960s, using the baptism in the Holy Spirit, religion keeps re-inventing itself on the past. We must not forget fundamentalism to which many still endorse and believe in. The memory of the Civil War gave impetus to the rise of secularism. The Pilgrims came to America to practice their own form of Christianity and to found Christian states, passing laws in accordance with the rule of the word 'God.'Noah Feldman explains in this book, \\"it would take another 75 years and the transformation of a peripheral movement into one supported by its own universities and national political organizations. Fundamentalism would eventually change the face of American religion and politics and give its name to a broader worldwide phenomenon of enormous historical importance.\\" When I was young, we were encouraged to memorize Bible verses and recite them to earn a brand new 'New Testament.' Children were able to recite the Pledge of Allegiance to the American flag at the beginning of each day in their school classroom. The pledge did not include the phrase \\"under God\\" until the Cold War and the presidency of Dwight D. Eisenhower. It has been removed again because of the atheists.We have Scientology, Buddhism, Mormonism, but the Christian Nondenominational far out numbers the congregations of the older faiths in Christian churches. In the broadest sense, the Christian believer and the New Age acolyte are on the same mission looking for transcendence in the midst of the mundane. Seventy-five percent say that a very important reason for their faith is to forge a personal relationship with God, not fighting political battles. What is more mundane than politics! As diverse as America itself are the ways in which Americans seek spiritual enlightment. At the University of Chicago, where my son Jeff met his first atheist, the quest continues in prayer led by historian, Martin Marty, who asserts that we are a nation growing more diverse in beliefs and practices as the years roll on.Mr. Feldman teaches at the New York University Law School. Other new books on the shelves today include GOD'S POLITICS: WHY THE RIGHT GETS IT WRONG AND THE LEFT DOESN'T GET IT by Jim Wallis, UNITED WE STAND, DIVIDED WITH GOD by John Olenik, and WHAT GOD WANTS: A COMPELLING ANSWER TO HUMANITY'S BIGGEST QUESTION.

Like a good legal opinion, much of the book is on prerequisites, i.e. history. Only in the last fifty pages or so does he get to the present and future.It is an interesting problem. We (that's the universal we, as everyone must think like I do) look at Islamic fundamentalists as somewhat crazy. Yet it seems that the American fundamentalists are not too far different in their blowing up of abortion clinics, or Pat Robertson wanting to kill the President of Venezuela (or maybe just kidnap him).It further seems that the more science learns about things, the more that some people reject the scientific evidence in favor of knowing in their own mind that God didn't do it that way.I'm not so sure that this isn't just a current fad. One day the Democrats will decide that they want to get back into power and start putting together candidates that can win. Perhaps then we'll go back to some form of sanity."},{"Title":"Divided by God: America's Church-State Problem--and What We Should Do About It","review":"I heard about this book on Air America and thought it would be a good read. I was getting a sense that he leaned wrong when I read about Michael Newdow. Stating Mr. Newdow chooses to be offended or marginalized because under god is in the Pledge. Feldman states the Jehovah Witnesses had the right idea by asking to be excused or stay quiet during the Pledge. Sorry, but it's not a choice to be offended. Why is it okay to allow pro-religious bunk to go unchallenged when there is no fact or science to support it? Should we allow creationism ID in science class? The scientists who support evolution are choosing to be offended? When does standing up to the religious majority become okay? If it's just words and no physical harm is done then allow us the same opportunity. Allow science teachers to spend weeks on exploring how all the supernatural ideas in the bible fail scientific examination? Religion has survived so long because challenging it gets one marginalized. That is the choice others make against someone who dares to confront religion. It's a choice to allow superstitious mythology to be in our government and not say anything. The original Pledge did not have under god in it. Newdow is asking for it to be reverted back to the way it was. Even I could see that Newdow would be taking it too far to the left if he asked the Pledge to be amended to state \\"not under/over/around/ or near a god\\". He didn't ask for that and that is the point Feldman and I disagree on. Newdow wanted secular neutrality, Feldman wants generic religious ideas left alone."},{"Title":"Our Song: Meditations on Love and Marriage (Images & Insights from the Song of Solomon)","review":"This is a really nice little book with a quality binding that is a perfect affordable wedding gift for anyone you know.

In comparison, the verse translations are more compact. Another advantage is completeness. By and large, what we have of the Satires and Epistles is here. Not so in some other translations.But these \\"Satires and Epistles\\" translations do not dance. They go on leaden feet. Where a phrase could have some metre, some wings, it is clunky. The Epistles, for example, were written as poetry, light poetry to be sure and using as Horace did, metre rather than rhyme. Horace delighted in metre, in studying the Greek metres and \\"being the first\\" to find Latin equivalents. The Satires properly translated (as another example) would show his mastery, each being in a different metre.And to be fair Horace is difficult enough in Latin, since some perhaps many of his effects come from juxtapositions of sound and sense, rather than traditional word order.Still---this is clunky. There are better translations but I still refer to this one when I want a full & literal translation. Perhaps this is the best we can do to be close-to-lietral, even though it wrings out the lightness and the laughter that make so many of us dearly love him after 2,000 years."},{"Title":"Satires and epistles","review":"Horace's collection of Satires and Epistles have always been left in the shadows of his Odes and Epodes due to this very reason--that they are didactic rather than aesthetic. In this work, Horace gives modest moral and social instruction to his correspondents, while in his Odes and Epodes his lust for life and the beautiful give the reader something much more palatable to digest. What one will find here that may be the of most value is his Ars Poetica, which hands the novice some well-gained advice on how to write good poetry. This work also furnishes itself as an excellent historical source into the world of the Augustan Age. Overall, it must be said that these poems are not quite as entertaining as his Odes and Epodes, yet the reader must consider Horace's purpose in writing them before making any rash judgements. The Norton Editions are of course one of the most trustworthy texts to be found and for the price listed this one is incomparable with any others available."},{"Title":"Pocketful of Promises for Women","review":"This book found me as I was on my way to be with my special aunt who is dying with cancer.

Adams at times finds his enthusiasm for his subjects embarrassing, but gives in to it nevertheless and writes a brilliant and joyous paean to these cathedrals and to the spirit that created them. Rereading this book now, twenty years later, I remember the thrill of reading it the first time, and it sparks my own enthusiasm all over again."},{"Title":"Mont-Saint-Michel and Chartres (Doubleday Anchor Books)","review":"A reading of Richard Brookhiser's recent (and highly recommended) *America's First Dynasty* sent me back to *Mont Saint Michel and Chartres*, a book I hadn't read in thirty years. I'm glad I returned to it, because a few years have, I trust, put me in a better position to appreciate what's going on in the book.On one level, the most obvious one, Adam's book is a sometimes idiosyncratic history of Medieval art, literature, and religion that takes as its center of gravity the great Gothic cathedrals of the period--structures that Adams thinks sum up what the middle ages are all about. To read the book on this level alone is fine. It provides intriguing insights into, for example, courtly love and the cult of Mary.But I now believe that, at a deeper level, the book is disguised autobiography on the one hand and a backhanded history of Adams's own time on the other. An at times overwhelming sense of nostalgia permeates the book. In reading Adams on the 11th century mystics, the debates of the schoolmen, the chansons of the troubadours, and the unified worldview of the middle ages, one can almost hear him sigh with longing to return to a world which, he thinks, was whole, unfractured, and pure--a world, as the medievals themselves would've said, which reflects &quot;integritas.&quot; This reveals a great deal about the restless, unquiet nature of Henry Adams the man. But it also reveals the restless, unquiet nature of the modern era which spawned and molded him: the gilded age, the fast-paced first wave of capitalism, secularism, and consumerism, which has no center of gravity, no art, no tradition. And even though we claim to be living in a &quot;postmodern&quot; age, it seems to me that a great deal of the qualities Adams deplored in his own times are still with us and account for our own sense of homelessness.*Mont Saint Michel and Chartres,* then, is more than a quaint turn-of-the-last-century history.

Adams' lucid writing style and his insights are impressive, and this book should be read by every supposedly \\"educated\\" individual. Adams deals with complex topics such as Gothic Architecture, Medieval poetry and mysticsim, and Scholastic Philosophy with clarity and ease.The early sections of MSMC compare the church of Mont Saint Michel with the Catholic view of St. Michel who was militant and was the perfect example of the Medieval hero defending the Catholic Church against all enemies. The comparison with this church with that of Chartres which was the examplar of God's mercy via St. Mary is insighful and facinating reading.Such embellishment of St. Mary or Notre Dame(Our Lady)is further investigated in Adams book by Adams' careful treatment of Medieval Poetry. Adams's translations of Medieval French and Latin are good and give those who are not familiar with these languages a better understanding of both the poetry and the Medieval devotion to St. Mary.Much of this peotry was mystical, and Adams demonstrates the attempt of St. Francis and the Franciscans to use such mystical thought in their missionary efforts to help the very poor. St. Francis' mysticism is revealed in Adams' translation of St. Francis' poem titled BROTHER SUN AND SISTER MOON.Henry Adams then compares and contrasts Medieveal mysticism, which bordered on Pantheism, with Scholastic Philosophy. Adams gives the reader an insight to scholastic debate when he summarizes the debate between William of Champaux and Peter Abelard(1079-1142). Here Adams demonstrates his understanding of how students and masters argued and learned. He also shows the careful balence the Catholic authorities tried to impose between reasoned debate and heresy.The last section of the book deals with the Angelic Doctor, St. Thomas Aquinas (1225-1274). Adams careful treatment of Aquinas' thought is worth the price of the book. Adams gives the Angelic Doctor high praise for both his clear thinking and liberality. Adams also effectively deals with the liberality of the Medieval Catholic authorities who canonized so many men whose views were apparently contradcitory.Henry Adams' MONT SAINT MICHEL AND CHARTRES is intellectual history at its best. The book deals with complex ideas and views in an attractive literary style which holds the readers' interest. This reviewer has read this book numerous times since he first read it in 1968 and has never found the book to be boring. Readers should also read Thomas Woods HOW THE CATHOLIC CHURCH BUILT WESTERN CIVILIZATION and compare Woods sections on the High Middle Ages with Adams' book."},{"Title":"Mont-Saint-Michel and Chartres (Doubleday Anchor Books)","review":"Privately printed in 1904 (and revised seven years later), &quot;Mont Saint Michel and Chartres&quot; was never meant for the general public. It's the intellectual's ultimate &quot;what I did on my summer vacation&quot; essay, written for friends as a gift to accompany their excursions through France. The first half is a highly personal travel book and an idiosyncratic guide to art and architecture of medieval French cathedrals (particularly of Chartres); the last six chapters offer a succinct excursion through the spiritual mindset of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries.If you've never been to Mont Saint Michel or to Chartres, the first ten chapters can be hard going; it's like reading a 250-page description of a painting you've never seen. Even if you have been to both locations, it's unlikely you'll remember the details Adams expected his readers to have in front of them. Fortunately, his prose is not dry (and is at times characteristically witty). Adams is able to render vividly the fleches, the portals, the arches, the statues, and the stained glass panels, and he provides the tourist with a thorough understanding of the achievement represented by medieval religious art. He also supplies as background a wealth of related literary and historical references .The tenth chapter (and the last of Adams's official &quot;tour&quot;) focuses less on the cathedral of Chartres itself and more on the cult of the Virgin that it represents. It serves as a segue to the second half of the book, which will be far more accessible to general readers. He compares contemporary portrayals of three queens--Eleanor of Guienne (Aquitaine), Blanche of Castile, and Mary of Champagne (who wasn't really a queen, but never mind)--to the representations of the Virgin Mary in the art, in poetry, and in hagiography. &quot;The Virgin was a real person, whose tastes, wishes, instincts, passions, were intimately known,&quot; Adams argues. &quot;Like other Queens, she had many of the failings and prejudices of her humanity.&quot; The final three chapters turn to the intellectual life: the ongoing tensions between universalism and nominalism, Bernard and Abelard, mysticism and rationalism--all culminating in the balancing act of Thomas Aquinas.Over 75 years ago the &quot;Cambridge History of English and American Literature&quot; judged Adams's book as &quot;probably the best expression of the spirit of the Middle Ages.&quot; Well, not quite; such a view could be proffered by a literary critic perhaps, but certainly not by a historian, and I think Adams himself would have been appalled by such a statement. (A more accurate and more thorough account from the early twentieth century is Charles Homer Haskins's &quot;Renaissance of the Twelfth Century,&quot; published in 1927.) What Adams offers here is a glimpse of the medieval Catholic intellectual spirit as seen through the prism of his own rather conservative nineteenth-century Protestantism. His book is not so much a scholarly treatise as it is a wistful refashioning of the medieval spirit."},{"Title":"Mont-Saint-Michel and Chartres (Doubleday Anchor Books)","review":"This review is ONLY for the edition noted above.

In Chartres, he described the medieval world view as reflected in its cathedrals, which he believed expressed \\"an emotion, the deepest man ever felt--the struggle of his own littleness to grasp the infinite.\\" Adams was drawn to the ideological unity expressed in Roman Catholicism and symbolized by the Virgin Mary; he contrasted this coherence with the uncertainties of the 20th century.

It is hard to disagree with this assessment, since this tome is really that good and the research which went into it is nothing short of painstaking. George Ostrogorsky introduces his narrative with a thorough overview of the development of Byzantine studies from the sixteenth century onwards, followed by the history of the Empire proper by sections, each of which covers a specific historical period. In addition, each section is prefaced by an excellent bibliographical narrative of Byzantine sources which cover the period in question; these narratives put together provide the reader with a very instructive literary history of Byzantium. Ostrogorsky has a penchant for detail in both the text and the extensive footnotes accompanying it. But let the reader beware: this book is essentially a dry political and military history with some legal, theological, and economic history thrown in for good measure; even the literary history mentioned above limits itself to documents of historiographical value. The author did compensate for the lack of written coverage of the arts and architecture by including nice illustrations of Byzantine structures and artwork. Even as this revised edition was published almost 30 years ago, &quot;History of the Byzantine State&quot; remains a much-revered classic among Byzantinists."},{"Title":"History of the Byzantine state","review":"George Ostrogorsky's book covers all Byzantine history from Diocletian and Constantine to the fall of Constantinople in 1453. It is, moreover, intelligible and useful to the nonspecialist with only a broad historical background. Its particular value is that it imparts an understanding of the *process* of Byzantine history, especially in three key periods. First, the transformation of the decrepit East Roman Empire to a viable state able to withstand great adversities and heavy defeats. Second, the reinvigoration of that state after the iconoclast crisis and its rise to great power. Finally, the unintentionally suicidal policies adopted after the death of Basil II, which led to the breaking of Byzantium's back only fifty years later. Ostrogorsky's copious footnotes - happily, not endnotes - are especially useful because they cite many arguments and authors with which Ostrogorsky himself disagrees. Thus he provides easy access to views other than his own. There are a few minor irritants in the softcover edition, the absence of most of Ostrogorsky's excellent maps being the main one. There is also some little use of untranslated and untransliterated Greek. But neither deficiency adversely affects the book's overall value."},{"Title":"History of the Byzantine state","review":"Ostrogorsky has put together a good single-volume survey of the thousand years of Byzantium. The tale begins, standardly, with Diocletian and Constantine, and ends with the fall of Constantinople in 1453. He takes an omniscient view of Byzantium, focusing neither on the lives and deeds of the Emperors nor the cultural and religious developments, but telling a well-balanced narrative. In that it serves as a useful introduction. However, Ostrogorsky writes without any passion, and fails to humanize the major figures. There are, though, several excellent maps that put others to shame. In all, the book is worth owning for the factual narrative and great maps. If you are looking for an impassioned and entertaining story you should pick up John Julius Norwich instead."},{"Title":"History of the Byzantine state","review":"Ostrogorsky's History of the Byzantine State is an excellent book for the scholar, as well as the interested reader to use for any understanding of the history of the Byzantine Empire. Well written, concise, and thoroughly interesting, Ostrogorsky depicts the transition of a multi-cultural Late Roman Empire, to a smaller but more centralized and powerful Byzantine State, that became the cultural Renaissance for Eastern Europe and the Near East. Anyone wishing to expand his/her knowledge on this important time in history will not be disappointed to read this work"},{"Title":"History of the Byzantine state","review":"This book is a well presented overview of the political history of the Byzantine Empire. Therefore, it suffers from the same problems as most other political history books, it fails to take into account important non-political developments. For instance, the Plague of Justinian is not mentioned. One would thing that a sixty percent mortality rate in Constantinople would earn at least a passing glance. However, the author/publishers are not responsible for the woeful inadquecies of political history. The problem with the book lies in the bizarre lack of maps. (I have the Rutgers University Press, Fourth Paperback Printing, 1995.) There are only two maps (p. 289 and 521). They are both of the Balkans. There is not a single map of Anatolia in the entire book. Why would anyone publish a book in English for a western audience on the Byzantine Empire and not include a single map of Anatolia?"},{"Title":"History of the Byzantine state","review":"Ostrogorski's History of the Byzantine State does a great job describing the relationship between the state, the civil and military aristoracy and small holders.He starts this theme during the early tenth century and carries it forward to the end of the book. It is a story of how the state becomes less and less able to defend itself against the aristocracy.While other writers speak of Ostrogorski's lack of passion about Byzantium's last centuries, this is also an advantage because it allows him to focus on political and military causes of the Empire's decline after 1025.A few years ago I read Vassliev's two volume book on Byzantium and enjoyed it very much. In particular, those looking for a lengthy discussions of culture would do better with Vassilev.But it was only after reading Ostrogoski that I got a clear understanding of the political change after the death of Basil II (and the role of Psellus in them), the wars against Michael VIII after the recapture of Constantinople in 1261 and fourteenth century civil wars.In addition, this is a very well written book. In particular, Ostrogoski does a great job of starting his paragraphs with short, pithy topic sentences. He is also very good at drawing broad comparisons across Byzantine history (Vassilev, by contrast, tends to get caught up in details).In sum, while I am glad I read Vassilev first, Ostrogoski's book has given me a much stronger sense of the outlines of Byznatine history."},{"Title":"History of the Byzantine state","review":"\\"Roman political concepts, Greek culture, and the Christian faith were the main elements which determined Byzantine development. Without all three the Byzantine way of life would have been inconceivable. It was the integration of Hellenistic culture and the Christian religion within the Roman imperial framework that gave rise to that historical phenomenon which we know as the Byzantine Empire.\\" Thus begins the first paragraph of George Ostrogorsky's masterful narrative of Byzantine history. As this quotation demonstrates, Ostrogorsky's writing is a model of erudition, clarity, and efficiency. It would be hard to improve the quality of his prose, and he maintains this level of scholarship throughout the 500+ pages of main text. But the writing has a natural fluidity which carries the reader along rather effortlessly throughout the full span of East Roman/Byzantine history, from 284 A.D. (rise of Emperor Diocletian) to 1453 A.D. (fall of Constantinople to the Turks). Ostrogorsky gives this inherently rich and fascinating material the virtuoso treatment it deserves, and the reader is rewarded on every page by Ostrogorsky's efforts.Of course, readers of this English translation from the original German of the 3rd edition (1963) of Ostrogorsky's \\"History of the Byzantine State\\" owe an immense debt to Professor Joan M. Hussey, whose rendering of the German into English is a masterpiece in its own right. Moreover, through the collaboration of Professors Ostrogorsky and Hussey, the truly extensive references and footnotes have been brought up to date from the 1940 German 1st ed. to the 1967 time-frame of Hussey's 2nd English edition presented here. Of course, in the intervening 40+ years a veritable explosion in the fields of Late Antique and Byzantine studies has taken place, but Ostrogorky's mastery of the original sources, and the German, French, Italian, English, and Slavic secondary literature will not soon be replicated.\\"History of the Byzantine State\\" is a delight to read, and is divided into 8 main chapters. These chapters are respectively subdivided into numbered sections, and both chapters and sections are clearly titled, so that the breadth of Byzantine History is clear through a glance at the Table of Contents.Other reviewers have complained that Ostrogorsky's writing is dry and lacks a \\"human touch.\\" I found the opposite to be the case: \\"History of the Byzantine State\\" has a cogency and beauty of style, and is a model of articulate scholarship. And with such rich material as the myriad colorful historical human figures and locales which populate Byzantine history, it would be difficult to render this history in a boring fashion. Ostrogorsky's emphasis is the political narrative, but he does not ignore social and cultural aspects of Byzantium, and upon finishing his book the reader has a sense of a complete picture of Byzantine history and civilization. In the paperback version now standard the maps are incomplete, but this is easily remedied by consulting an historical atlas or the Internet."},{"Title":"History of the Byzantine state","review":"Recommended for anyone serious about understanding the Byzantine Empire in depth.

The not so good part is that it assumes knowledge about many peoples that contribute to the story.When I read \\"The Histories\\" by Herodus I had a terrible time getting through the part on the Scythians.

After that I was interested in them and had not trouble reading the material.I say this to point out the biggest drawback of this book. There is no mention of the ethnographic or linguistic relationships between the various groups. Today it is important that Serbs and Russians are enthnically close. This books doesn't give a hint of these kinds of relationships.

Twilight etc. etc. leave me absolutely cold. However, I was recommended this book by a member of staff in my local bookshop (where I couldn't get it) and he's the same chap who told me about the superlative Roman novelThe Boat of Fateby Keith Roberts, so I took his recommendation at face value.Yarbro has been writing vampire novels about the same character, Saint Germain, for 30 years now, and she has apparently taken him through much of the history of the world. She is to be applauded for this, because if the other books are anything like this one, she sure does her research. The historical detail of first century AD Rome is wonderful, and well-written. It's not dumped on the reader either. So we have great depictions of households, ordinary life, the emperor's palaces, the intrigue that surrounded all those who wanted power, and the terrible punishments dealt out to those who fell foul of the emperor. There are also particularly good scenes set at the games. I lapped all these up, and for a good part of the book, I enjoyed the story too, which is all about Olivia, an unfortunate noblewoman who is horribly mistreated by her cruel husband. She falls in love with Saint Germain, and he becomes her saviour of sorts. The vampire stuff is dealt with very lightly. In fact, it's barely mentioned in many places, which I appreciated.So why didn't I like this book more? Well, I think it comes down to the 'love' story between Olivia and Saint Germain. It just didn't ring true to me. It felt false from the word 'go', and it stayed that way. If it had been more convincing, I might just have said that I had enjoyed a vampire novel. As it is, I can't.A minor point to mention was the over use of the phrase 'small hands' when referring to Saint Germain's physical appearance. Being told it once or twice is fine. But every few pages! I wanted to scream about it by the end. One more small gripe: this book is clearly a digital imprint. Given its hefty price tag, it's a shame that the many typos in it weren't removed before it was printed again.Ben Kane, author of The Forgotten Legion."},{"Title":"Blood games: A novel of historical horror, third in the Count de Saint-Germain series","review":"The story of when the Count Saint-Germain meets Olivia, in ancientRome, and tries to help her with the abuse she is suffering.

(about 60 C.E.) The book is the third one written in the series; it is one of the earliest in terms of historical chronology. Despite being the third one written, it is a good one to start with if one is first starting the whole series, because this is the book in which St. Germain acquires his bondsman, Roger, who will be a continuing character in the series. The spectacles at the Circus Maximus form a large part of the book, along with the corruption of Roman politics. The book is well titled; there is a great deal of blood and violence both in and out of the arena. Atta Olivia Clemens is the wife of Senator Cornelius Justus Silius, one of the most corrupt and perverse of the Romans. St. Germain rescues her from his cruelties through bringing her &quot;to his life,&quot; that is, turning her into a vampire also. Olivia will be a continuing character in the series for another millenium and a half. An epilogue set in the 855th Year of the City gives perspective, and establishes the pattern of letters between Olivia and St. Germain which is used in future books of the series to set the scene and bring us up to date.Those who already know that they like vampire novels, anything at all that features a vampire, can skip this review, and likewise, those who hate the whole idea of vampires can skip it. But for those trying to decide whether or not to read more of this genre, or whether the one vampire novel you've already read was a fluke, it may help if we have some ways to categorize these novels. Thus: BunRab's Standard Vampire Elements. First, most authors of vampire novels approach from one of the main genres of genre fiction; thus their background may be primarily in romance, or in science fiction/fantasy, or in murder mysteries, or in horror. Second, many vampire novels come in series; knowing whether this is one of a series, and where in the series it falls, may be helpful. Then we have some particular characteristics: - Is the vampire character (or characters) a &quot;good guy&quot; or a &quot;bad guy&quot;? Or are there some of each? - Are there continuing characters besides the vampire, through the series? - Are there other types of supernatural beings besides vampires? - Can the vampire stand daylight under some circumstances, or not stand daylight at all? - Does the vampire have a few other supernatural characteristics, many other supernatural characteristics, or none other than just being a vampire? (E.g., super strength, change into an animal, turn invisible) - Does the vampire have a regular job and place in society, or is being a vampire his or her entire raison d'etre? - Does the vampire literally drink blood, or is there some other (perhaps metaphorical) method of feeding? - Is sex a major plot element, a minor plot element, or nonexistent? - Is the entire vampire feeding act a metaphor for sex, part of a standard sex act, or unrelated to sex? - Is the story set in one historical period, more than one historical period, or entirely in the present day? - Does the story have elements of humor, or is it strictly serious? - Is the writing style good, or is the writing just there to manage to hold together the plot and characters?Chelsea Quinn Yarbro's series about the vampire St. Germain starts from the historical romance genre, and is a continuing series. St. Germain is definitely a good guy, using the knowledge he's gained in several thousand years of living to help others. There are a few characters that continue from book to book besides him: the women he turns into vampires, and his &quot;servant,&quot; Roger, who is a ghoul. Ghouls are the only other supernatural characters who appear in these books. St. Germain can stand daylight with the right preparations. He has unusual strength, but not limitless, and unusual wisdom, and is an &quot;alchemist&quot; but there are no other overt magic powers. In most of the series, he has an occupation of being an aristocrat, insofar as that was a full-time occupation through most of history; in some books he has another &quot;job&quot; as well. St. Germain does not literally drink blood; he feeds on emotions, usually during erotic experiences, but sex is nonetheless only a minor plot element, rare and very discreet. The series covers 3000 years, from ancient Egypt to the modern day; each book is set in a span of a particular period, usually 20-30 years. The writing is serious, but not self-important; the writing quality is excellent, and Yarbro's abilities as an author qualify these books as literature rather than &quot;merely&quot; genre fiction."},{"Title":"Blood games: A novel of historical horror, third in the Count de Saint-Germain series","review":"Though this is not the first in the series, this is a good introduction to Chelsea Quinn Yarbro's great creation, the Comte de Saint-Germain, a noble, a man of righteousness, and - oh, yes - a vampire who has lived, at the time of this tale, for several thousand years.I had not read any of Yarbro's tales of Saint-Germain for quite a while and it is a pleasure to come back to them. These stories are a worthy alternative to Anne Rice's tales of Lestat, Louis, Armand, and all the other denizens of her dark world. The world of Saint-Germain is much lighter by comparison, and also contains far more action and intrigue than any of Rice's works (with the possible exception of \\"The Queen of the Damned\\"). This does not mean I dislike Rice's books. Quite the contrary, in fact - but Yarbro paints a far less shadowy world than Rice does.Here we meet one of the great loves of Saint-Germain's long life - Atta Olivia Clemens. She has been horribly abused by her husband, a Senator of the Roman Empire around the time of Nero. To call him a pervert is to make light of his atrocities; in addition he has political ambitions that are almost as sickening as his sexual ones. It is this man, Cornelius Justus Silius, who is Saint-Germain's adversary in this novel, although the two of them do not actually do battle in any true sense of the word - and it is their actions against each other, and events related to those actions, which make up the core of this book.Along the way Yarbro has much to teach us about vampire lore. There is no mention of the use of a cross - but then again, this novel takes place at the time of Nero, and the Christians were just beginning to make themselves noticed at this time. If Yarbro is correct, vampires are apparently more resilient than both Anne Rice and Bela Lugosi would have us believe. They can live in sunlight, provided they are insulated in some manner by their native earth. In the same manner, they can cross running water - something I did not know affected vampires until I read it here. And they can create others of their kind, but not just in the way that Rice describes (I leave it to you to read this book to discover how).At various points in this story there is also mention of Saint-Germain's past. Some are just vague (but intriguing) hints; others are more explicit. There is also some mention of his birthplace, and I would definitely like to know more about that particular part of the Comte de Saint-Germain. He is such a fascinating individual that I will definitely be buying more of Yarbro's tales, to learn more about this worthy vampire and the worlds (plural intended) he lives in."},{"Title":"Blood games: A novel of historical horror, third in the Count de Saint-Germain series","review":"I had never considered reading a vampire novel until I stumbled across &quot;Blood Games&quot; while searching for novels on ancient Rome. St. Germain's dangerous yet compellingly compassionate character completely drew me into the story and I've since been reading my way through the rest of his history. Ancient Rome's excesses and casual disregard for human life is sharply contrasted with the vampire's compassion and loyalty to the people around him. His essential &quot;humanity&quot; is shown most in his relationship to Olivia, the horrifically abused wife of the villian, who becomes one of the enduring loves of his life. If you've never before considered reading a vampire novel you'll change your mind once you've met St. Germain."},{"Title":"Blood games: A novel of historical horror, third in the Count de Saint-Germain series","review":"Chelsea Quinn Yarbro's extremely civilized, debonair vampire protagonist Comte de Saint-Germain appears in \\"Blood Games\\" as Ragoczy Sanct' Germain Franciscus, an import/shipping magnate living in the Rome of Emperor Nero. As a matter of fact, the year before this story begins, in 64 AD, a mammoth fire raged through Rome for nine days, destroying two-thirds of the city. Although Nero was at the coastal resort of Antium when the fire broke out, (yes, this is the one where he supposedly played his fiddle...actually it was a lyre!), the conflagration and subsequent destruction were to his advantage. One of Nero's more ambitious plans was to tear down a third of Rome so that he could build an elaborate series of palaces that would be known as Neropolis. The senate, however, objected to this proposal. History has put the blame for the fire on Nero - but no one knows to this day how it started.Anyway...back to \\"Blood Games,\\" and Rome in 65 AD is busy rebuilding after the disaster. Nero, who began his reign with such promise is showing signs of madness in the extreme. During this period a series of treason laws were put to deadly use against anyone considered a threat. These laws are to have devastating consequences for Sanct' Germain and those he holds dear. The back-stabbing, political and literal, has not changed since the days when Julius Caesar said. \\"Et tu, Brutus?\\" Our protagonist manages to maneuver through the dangers of life in the Big City, surviving seven emperors in as many years, by being politically savvy and above reproach in his business and social dealings. All this changes when he meets and begins to love Atta Olivia Clemens, the wife of the powerful and corrupt Senator Cornelius Justus Silius. The senator delights in degrading and debasing his wife and there is little Sanct' Germain can do to improve her situation without giving himself away as a vampire with preternatural powers. Sanct' Germain/Ragoczy will bring Olivia into her Unlife during Roman Emperor Vespasian's reign (c.72). She is a recurring character throughout this series. Roger, a former bondsman from Gades, (C&aacute;diz, Spain), is resurrected by Sanct' Germain in 71 AD and is introduced here also. He is another recurring character and serves as Saint-Germain's valet and close friend in future books.A fascinating subplot involves three of Ragoczy's \\"slaves:\\" Aumtehoutep, a Ghoul and former novice of Thoth whom the vampire brought back from near death during the reign of Rameses II; Tishtry an Armenian woman, champion charioteer and horse trainer who volunteers her blood and love; and Kosrozd, formerly a Persian prince, now a renowned charioteer who wins great sums of money for Sanct' Germain. As a result of their roles in the novel, much of the narrative is set in the Circus' Maximus and Flavian, providing terrific action and excitement.\\"Blood Games\\" is the third book published in the series. I believe there are 16 Saint-Germain novels with a 17th due out soon. I began with \\"The Palace\\" which is set in Renaissance Florence. \\"Hotel Transylvania's\\" setting is Paris, 1743, and this is my third venture into Ms. Yarbro's historical-fiction-supernatural world. Ragoczy/Sanct' Germain is neither Bram Stocker's brand of vampire nor does he resemble Anne Rice's Lestat. He IS a hero, not an anti-hero. You won't find fangs, gore, and horror of the supernatural kind in \\"Blood Games,\\" although there's more than enough blood and violence caused by humans. Our vampire is an exceptionally nice guy - who just happens to have walked the earth since the beginning of time, practically. He does not personify evil, and, unlike other vampiric creations, he is able to stroll about in daylight as long as he carries soil from his homeland in his shoes. He does need blood to survive - but the human donor must be willing to give a pint or two or he won't drink. And true emotional attachments nourish Sanct' Germain as much as the blood he takes. So the concept of \\"love\\" and affection figure strongly here.I don't know how important it is to read the books in order of publication as the stories do not take place in chronological order historically. The author has done an extraordinary job of vividly portraying life in the first century Rome with its opulence, excesses, and political and social intrigues. Ms. Quinn Yarbro is truly a master at writing historical fiction. Her research is impeccable and the narrative is filled with fascinating period details.The novel is rich in characters and storyline. I highly recommend it. I liked it enough to order more books in the series. ENJOY!JANA"},{"Title":"Blood games: A novel of historical horror, third in the Count de Saint-Germain series","review":"I have been reading this line of novels for about five years, and have often had to read them out of sync since they can be very hard to find at the chain stores (and I have no good local stores to go to). I must say that this book should be one of the first that you read if you are beginning the series (which I HIGHLY recommend). The story is set in Nero's Rome and introduces two of Yarbro's main characters (Roger and Olivia) to the story arc. The writing is magnificent, and the attention to detail in the historical background is wonderful. Rome is portrayed as a wonderfully alien place rather than \\"Americans in Togas\\" that some historical writers seem to go for. I have a few more Yarbro novels waiting in my read pile now (Thanks Amazon!) and I can't wait to read more."},{"Title":"Blood games: A novel of historical horror, third in the Count de Saint-Germain series","review":"After having been alive for two thousand years, Sanct' Germain finds himself in Rome, at the time of Emperor Nero. In the 7 years that follow, during political and social turmoil, Sanct' Germain meets Atta Olivia Clemens, who is suffering unspeakable torture at the hands of her husband. Together, they save each other through their shared love.Truly, this book was incredibly well researched. Every detail of life in Rome at that time was impeccable - from the vivid descriptions of arena games, to the imperial plots and political backstabbing, it felt as if I was actually there. I also very much enjoyed the way Yarbro portrayed vampires in her novel. Sanct' Germain was different. He was able to go out in sunlight and cross running water, as long as he took some precautions beforehand. It was also interesting to discover the way he made other vampires... it wasn't what I was expecting. I was fascinated by the way each chapter began with a letter. It gave me a lot more insight into Roman culture than I otherwise could have obtained from just reading the chapters themselves. At times, I found that I looked forward to the letter to come more than the chapter itself!The writing style flowed beautifully. I was especially amazed by how the dialogue sounded so true. Each time a character spoke it made me feel as if I was listening to a Roman citizen speaking. The story line was fascinating. I found the book an incredible page-turner, and the plot progressed smoothly throughout the novel. I couldn't wait to see what would happen next.As far as characters go, I really liked Olivia. She had to endure so much at the hands of her husband, and I was in awe of how she was able to handle it as well as she did. She took strength from Sanct' Germain, and managed to continue on, no matter how hard it was for her. I admired the way she lived for those stolen moments, when it could have been so easy for her to give in and perhaps take her own life. I also really liked Sanct' Germain. He was so compassionate, and caring, and strong... admirable qualities in any century. Tishtry was another character I admired. She was very confident in her abilities, and herself. Even though she was a slave, she had a self-respect few people have. Justus, Olivia's husband, was a character I loved to hate. My breathing came just a little faster each time a chapter focused on him. I didn't know what to expect. It's been a long time since I've felt such complete loathing for a literary character.I found myself thinking about the memorable themes in this novel: mainly, the cruelties of men in the name of power and entertainment. Betrayal, and the way people can mask their evil nature were also major themes. The \\"unnatural creature\\" turned out to be much kinder and compassionate than a highly regarded Roman Senator.Overall, a definite must-read for any historical fiction, or vampire fan."},{"Title":"Blood games: A novel of historical horror, third in the Count de Saint-Germain series","review":"This is one of the hardest books of Chelsea Quinn Yarbro's to find in some areas, but it is worth any trouble you have to go to find it. It's a gorgeous tale bringing together many of the popular characters from Yarbro's vampire novels--Saint Germain, Rogerian, Aumtehotep and Olivia. The attention to Roman history tied in with the personal stories of the characters is some of the most skillful writing I have ever had the pleasure of experiencing. I fully intend to recommend this novel and its fellows to my historical fiction professor. If you have an opportunity to read this book, then grab it. You'll be grateful for it."},{"Title":"Blood games: A novel of historical horror, third in the Count de Saint-Germain series","review":"Ms. Yarbro takes St. Germaine to the ancient world of the Roman Circus and the cruelties that men can to in the name of power and entertainment.

Of the 3 I have read, this one is definitely my favorite, but I do have a soft spot for Roman history. That said, it's also the first time I've noticed some historical inaccuracies, which really irked me. As usual, I bogged down in the letters at the beginning of every section, and eventually skipped them altogether."},{"Title":"Blood games: A novel of historical horror, third in the Count de Saint-Germain series","review":"Strictly speaking, a prequel to a prequel, this is the third book in the series. The first, &quot;Hotel Transylvania&quot;, took place in mid-1700s France; the second, &quot;The Palace&quot;, in late 1400s Italy. This one takes place in the first century of the common era, in imperial Rome during the time of Nero and a bit later. There are something over a dozen books in the series all told, plus a few spinoffs of books about Olivia Clemens and Madeline, two of Saint Germain's lovers who become vampires themselves.The series so far has been quite good; I continue to feel somewhat guilty for not rating the books higher than I do. But there is the continuing stylistic affectation of placing a piece of correspondence after every chapter, which I continue to find minorly distracting, and there is a scene in this book that seems to be simply out of character as it has been so far defined for the main character. We have been given to understand that many of the traditional legends of the weaknesses of vampires, such as the inability to cross running water and the inability to withstand sunlight, are conditionally true in the world of Saint Germain; that is to say, they are true, but can be overcome so long as he stands upon his &quot;native soil&quot;, so he has learned to wear special shoes that are hollow and filled with soil from the land of his birth. Yet in this story, when deprived of his special shoes and forced to fight giant crocodiles at midday during a blisteringly hot Roman summer day in the arena, (in water) while constantly commenting on how ill and unwell this makes him feel, he's still able to function well enough to slay several crocs and survive. (It's not giving away critical plot points to reveal his survival, considering that he exists in the previous two books of the series, both of which occur historically later than this one). He doesn't, as near as I can tell, even get a sunburn. This is just so far out of line that I feel the need to dock the book a star just for this one scene; otherwise, the book is quite well written.If you are a fan of traditional vampire fiction, you may possibly find yourself disappointed with this series; there are many elements generally found in the vampire genre that are missing from these books. But if you like historical romance, or even historical fiction in general, and don't object to the concept of a heroic vampire protagonist, you should find this book, and probably most of this series, quite enjoyable."},{"Title":"Thoreau As World Traveler","review":"\\"I have travelled a good deal in Concord ...\\" reads the opening chapter of \\"Walden.\\" And during his lifetime, Henry David Thoreau was most comfortable staying in his hometown, which he knew intimately from his daily walks and wanderings. He did manage to journey a bit throughout Massachusetts and New England. He once lectured in Philadelphia and even lived for a time on Staten Island. He made a Canadian excursion to Montreal and the St. Lawrence River, and he visited Maine three times. His longest trip occurred in 1861, when he took two months to travel to Minnesota and back via train and steamship, in the hopes of curing his consumption. But compared to the other Transcendentalists, Henry was generally a stay-at-home man.While sitting in Concord, he could travel a good deal through books. The travel narrative was a thriving genre for 19th-century readers. Thoreau not only pored through such volumes, he even wrote one or two of his own. He was first enamored by the travel writings of Goethe, Alexander Henry, and Charles Darwin. Those men set the stage for the narratives Thoreau would read later in life -- books that would take him to every corner of the earth without having to leave his beloved Concord.The intent of \\"Thoreau as World Traveler\\" is to chronicle both methods of travel for Thoreau: the real and the vicarious. Map the paths of his actual journeys, then turn to those made by the authors he traveled with on the printed page. This worthy endeavor required a lot of research for author Christie, as he duplicated Thoreau's reading habits. While he begins with details of the real excursions, the meat of this work comes inthe second half of the book. There he dissects Thoreau's readings and shows how the 19th-century naturalist's writings and philosophies reflected those of the authors and places he was reading about at the time. Christie's analysis and interpretations are intricate, thoughtful, and fascinating.And yet, flaws in the first half of the book have me wondering about the veracity of the interpretations presented in the second. The map of \\"Thoreau's Own Excursions\\" that appears on page 9 includes travel routes that are simply wrong. Christie himself shows inconsistencies. For example, he cites a quote from Thoreau about what he saw in Brattleboro, Vermont -- but no path even runs through that state on the page 9 map. The mapmaker mistakenly moved that northbound route into New York state instead.Even more errors show up in references to Thoreau's Minnesota trip of 1861. Again, the route shown in the page 9 map is wrong. Then in two separate instances, Christie refers to that trip as having occurred in 1862. On another page, he says it was in 1860. On yet another, he says that after the Montreal trip, Thoreau \\"never made another trip of his own to Canada.\\" (p. 101) In reality, Thoreau's return route from Minnesotatook him through Canada with a stop in Toronto. While Christie's map is wrong, it does show a return trip through part of Canada. Inconsistency again.Perhaps we can forgive the author. When Christie wrote this book in the 1960s, he didn't have access to some of the basic Thoreau references that are now available, like Walter Harding's \\"The Days of Henry Thoreau\\" and Robert F. Stowell's \\"Thoreau Gazetteer.\\" But he cites and must have consulted the important sources of his time: Canby's biography, Sanborn's \\"First and Last Journeys,\\" and Thoreau's own published journals and original notebooks. Relying on those sources and doing some fact-checking should have prevented those errors mentioned above. How many more are there?This book is thought-provoking, in general. But researchers should beware. If you use this book as a springboard for your own work, check the facts with against original documentation or known authorities. Above all, dismiss the page 9 map entirely."},{"Title":"The master-key to riches","review":"I really don't see what the previous reviews are raving about.

Many of the pearls of wisdom he has only make sense in hindsight. If you're adding this book to your Napoleon Hill collection, you'll love it.If you've never read Hill before, you might have a hard time adjusting to him... and in that case, this review is meant for you.The subject of this book is supposedly the business philosophy of Andrew Carnegie, as requested by Carnegie. I don't think this essay was quite what he wanted, though. The book may have some jewels of ideas in it, but it's so horribly written that they'll slip past you without notice, or be so mangled that you just won't care.I don't really have the overly paranoid &quot;Satan-is-coming!&quot; view of this book that the reviewer a few slots before me does, but I suggest you read his qualms - it's a good overview of the truly weird New Age-ish approach this book takes. Instead of saying, &quot;Be grateful for what you've got,&quot; Mr. Hill suggests you sit down with an imaginary &quot;Eight Princes&quot; around a table once a day, each named for something you're grateful for, and thank them. Um. Yeah. Loads of that sort of thing in here.And the whole book reads like an infomercial. &quot;We'll get to the Master Key soon... but first... let me tell you about this other exciting opportunity!&quot; In fact, he tells you the Master Key in the very last sentences of the book(!), I suppose so you'll bother to read the rest.The Master Key is absolutely a golden idea, truly. I just wouldn't suggest *this* book as an introduction to it.Spoiler: don't read the rest of this review if you don't want to know the juicy tidbits.The important ideas that this book actually gives you:1) The Master Key: &quot;You are in control of your own mind.&quot; You're in control of everything from which commercial music it listens to, to what your purpose will be in life and how you plan to get there. It may take a month or two of contemplation to truly &quot;get&quot; this and realize how powerful it can be.2) &quot;Going the extra mile.&quot; This is great for business; my roommate just got an award with exactly those words written on it.3) &quot;Positive Mental Attitude.&quot; This is SO important to health, opportunities, and quality of life, but Mr. Hill's ramblings don't go into all of that. Most of his chapters' ideas -- &quot;When you're ready, an opportunity will appear,&quot; &quot;Have faith in the outcome,&quot; &quot;Do it, and you'll have the power,&quot; &quot;The universe will align itself to your purposes,&quot; etc. -- are ALL wrapped up in this one principle, but even he didn't seem to understand it was all *perspective* and not some sort of mysterious &quot;law of cosmic habitforce&quot; (yes, he actually uses phrases like that!!!).In conclusion: Get this book if you're interested in digging up info about Carnegie. Otherwise, get &quot;The New Feeling Good Handbook&quot; by David Burns; &quot;Seven Habits of Highly Effective People&quot; by Stephen R. Covey; and &quot;Learned Optimism&quot; by Martin Seligman - to learn the points above, respectively, in a much less confusing manner."},{"Title":"The master-key to riches","review":"This book brought tears of joy to my eyes as I read a story about an acorn on page 115.

Mr hill stated that he has never benefited anyone in any manner whatsoever without having received in return, from one source or another, 10X as much benefit as he has contributed to others. In comparison with \\"Think and Grow Rich\\", \\"The Master-Key to Riches\\" is a broader, more philosophical manual for wealth of every type, including happiness and life satisfaction. Hill includes 17 principles or \\"doors\\" thropugh which you must pass to reach the inner chambers where you will find the source of riches. These include the following: (1). Definiteness of purpose; (2). Going the extra mile. Doing this makes you shine minside and out; (3). Applied Faith. Hill offers no apology for his belief that no great and enduring success has ever been achieved, except by those who recognise and use the spiritual power of the infinite. Finally, the ideas in this book come from the secret strategies of America's most successful businessmen of his time."},{"Title":"The master-key to riches","review":"Please, do something for yourself and READ THIS BOOK !

I think it is worth a quick \\"warning\\" that the material is getting to be nearly 100 years old, and the style is sometimes a bit dated. Additionally, like many self-help types, there is a touch of New Age influence and feel good platitudes. Why recommend it then? Very simply, I believe Hill has the formula right. Distilled down, his focus is on willpower, self-discipline and proper attitude. Truly what you think and truly believe you can achieve. He talks about the 8 princes (or angels, patron saints, or cosmic forces if you are New Agey) - like the Prince of Sound Health, or Sound Mind. He talks on the 12 true riches - shich as good health, prosperity and faith. But at the end of the day, the keys are willpower, self-discipline and proper attitude. Follow the philosophy and it will help attain those things - and free you to achieve great things."},{"Title":"The master-key to riches","review":"My initial interest with this book was purely for personal gain, i.e. to get rich!

The power that exists within each one of us through self-discipline and determination is literally life changing.

Now I can quote my favorite Charles Williams line, spoken by the skeleton in one of these plays: \\"The price of heaven, hell or earth is the same: always a broken heart, sometimes a broken neck.\\" Lines like that are why we keep reading.Mention Charles Williams' plays, and immediately someone comes up with more objections than even to his novels. Let's admit the plays are flawed so the critics will depart satisfied and we can lie back and read them. That indefineable, maddening something quietly lurking at the corners of the novels rages through the plays.T.S. Eliot, in the view of many, took language as far as it can go in \\"The Wasteland\\" and \\"Four Quartets\\". Charles Williams doesn't make the journey; he just begins on the other side. The skeleton and other characters stumble dazed as if through the debris of bombed-out London, scavenging through the detrius of words. CW lived outside of his own time, which is why he has become so relevant in ours. For the form of that age was already passing away. The long, dark night of modernism over and done, the pre-modern and post-modern reach and touch one another, as blinking in the dawn we stumble from the rubble."},{"Title":"Collected Plays","review":"I can't say how pleased I am to discover this back in print (I have a rather expensive used copy). I am a huge fan of Charles Williams, and this book is one of my favorites of his, along with the Taliessin poems and All Hallows' Eve-- with the added benefit that it isn't as impenetrable as the Taliessin poems often are. Thomas Cranmer of Canterbury alone is worth (to me) getting the book for, with its sympathetic yet unsparing (even harsh at times-- Cranmer's last scene, ooh) picture of Cranmer mixed with haunting cascading language. Seed of Adam is kind of cool with its rather unorthodox portrayal of Joseph and Adam; The House by the Stable and its sequel are just fun. Terror of Light is perhaps my favorite after Cranmer; the portrayal is just so... right, for example Thomas's rejoicing in rationality and Saul's misplaced (but understood and forgiven) judgmentalism, and Judas's (possibly heretical?) authority even in damnation. The only play I don't love is Judgement at Chelmsford, which is a bit too formal for my taste, with not enough plot, although I'm sure that actually seeing it probably works better than reading it.If you like plays, and you like Williams' other work, then I recommend this. Of course, there are lots of people out there who don't like his erudite and casually-theological/supernatural style, which I do quite understand, and those probably wouldn't like this either. I would also have to say don't read all the plays at once, as he has some language tricks he *really likes*, and reading them three times in a row is a bit tiresome."},{"Title":"Collected Plays","review":"For Charles Williams Words are everything. Why? We are not God and we don't live in heaven, so Words are the things we must stand by. A Word is much more than an utterance said, or written. It is, for Williams, an act of adoration--or blasphemy. It is the stuff that fills up life and makes it human. Or not. That, I think, is the key to Williams plays. Words do not so such signify as exist. They are bricks. Word upon Word, they build up patterns of being, real or an illusion, something or nothing, an arrangement of truth or lies, fashioned by Words uttered--and lived. God's or yours."},{"Title":"Toys & Prices 2005 (Toys and Prices)","review":"The Krause book of Toys and Prices has long been a favorite of mine. It is comprehensive, layed out well in its format and sections, as well as providing informative information on the hobby or business of toy collecting. Each year Krause does a better job of including more modern day toys as there are so many companies now producing toys specifically for a collectors market. Like any good book the Krause guide provides manufacturer, year and of course condition based prices.While No one guide can ever be totally comprehensive, Krause is one I buy every two years or so along with the Schroeder toy price guide.

I also really liked that there were many shared experiences from other families who had dealt with childhood cancer, it made me feel like we weren't alone.

He went on and on at how great this book was, and how it was many years in the making.Well, it's got some decent recipes, but it really doesn't go into very in-depth informaiton about juicing itself. It's mainly a recipe book, many of which are taken from the Juiceman's book, which were taken from Dr. Norman Walker's books. These recipes have been around for 50+ years, and there's nothing new or revolutionary about this book. Perhaps if I didn't hear the book as hyped up as it was, would I think otherwise. I put this book down with gaining little or no valuable information from its content."},{"Title":"The Joy of Juicing: Creative Cooking With Your Juicer; Completely Revised and Updated","review":"I see that some of the other reviewers have completely missed the mark. Gary Null has dozens of other books teaching you step by step how to be healthy and tons of advice for specific illnesses, but that information is not available in this book. Why? There is a simple reason for that. This is a COOKBOOK!! It starts out with juice and shake recipes and then it continues with other recipes using your juicer. There is a section for breakfast foods, soups, salads, dressings, sauces, dips and spreads, main dishes and desserts. Most of the recipes I have tried so far have been incredibly delicious. I said most because I did not like the Carob Fruit Bars, they were too sweet for my taste and too moist, as for the Almond Butter Cookies, the batter was too dry and grainy and did not form into dough but the taste was good, it just needed more liquid. As for the great tasting recipes, let me start with my mom's favorite, the Fruit and Nut Cookies ... she can't believe they are made without sugar, dairy or eggs! The dates were difficult to use at first, but now I chop them in tiny little pieces and they're a lot easier to use. The Date Fudge Brownies taste great with the Cocoa Coconut Frosting and Heavenly Roasted Nuts and because I'm Vegan, I used Maple Syrup in the recipes instead of honey with excellent results, and besides, I've never liked the taste of honey in baking. The Carrot Walnut Cake is out of this world. The Classic Vegetable Stock is the best I've ever made as well as the Spicy Texas Chilly and Lentil Burgers, and I could go on and on and on! Oh, did I mention the Creamsicle and Mango Fruit Pops? Yum!! As for my non-vegetarian friends and family, I have cooked the Salmon with Teriyaki Sauce and the Swordfish with Basil Oil and have been subject to rave reviews!! I have to admit that I've used this little recipe book more than any other recipe book in my collection. The ingredients can be easily found in any regular supermarket and for vegans, certain ingredients can be easily converted with wonderful results, except for the fish of course, but then again, most of us have to cook for other people in our lives who are not vegetarian so that works out perfectly.Enjoy this book, it's one of the best!"},{"Title":"The Joy of Juicing: Creative Cooking With Your Juicer; Completely Revised and Updated","review":"Mr. Null is renowned for being an expert in his field. His expertise and insights are often invaluable. However, in his book, \\"The Joy of Juicing\\" his experience appears to be overshadowed by generalities and a lack of research. For example, in the opening sentences, Mr. Null recommends that readers purchase a centrifugal juicer despite the fact that there is plenty of research showing that centrifugal juicers are not the best choice when compared to single gear and twin gear juicers. In addition, there is scientific research showing that centrifugal juicers create static electricity during the juicing process that kills vital enzymes and nutrients. Centrifugal juicers are also not the best choice for many fibrous types of greens since overheating can easily occur.The balance of the book is dedicated to recipes that are categorized by courses. While the recipes sound interesting, it would have been helpful for Mr. Null to explain why the recipes are beneficial for the prescribed ailment or purpose for which they were intended. Examples include juices with names such as \\"Beauty\\", \\"Fountain of Youth\\" and \\"Brain Juice.\\" Also, in the section on \\"Soups\\" and \\"Main Dishes,\\" Mr. Null juices certain vegetables prior to boiling them. Considering that there is much research showing that nutrients and enzymes are killed after heating above 118 degrees, it makes no sense to extract a juice and spend up to 15 minutes boiling it to death."},{"Title":"The Joy of Juicing: Creative Cooking With Your Juicer; Completely Revised and Updated","review":"After seeing Gary Null on PBS and reading many of his books, I began juicing to improve my poor health. Rather than carry around his thick books, I was looking for a juicing companion which I can keep in the kitchen near the juicer which would tell me which produce would help which ailment and specifically all the helpful vitamins, minerals, etc, how and why it would help, as in his other books. This is just a recipe book like so many others on the market -- not at all what I wanted and expected from Gary Null. He needs to write a new book, \\"Juicing for Your Health,\\" or \\"Juicing to Live Forever,\\" something to that effect to address our specific ailments, and for the already healthy, how to live healthy forever by juicing, tell us how much and how often we should juice for what outcome, how long does it take to experience some results, how to add a 'boost' and where to purchase them, etc. Tell us in baby steps how often and what to juice to improve particular illnesses. Many of us have more than one malady and I think I could figure out on my own how to incorporate or combine specific juice recipes to help more than one condition, for example, fibromyalgia, insomnia, hair loss, and chronic sinus headaches. Juices to avoid colds and flu would be helpful as well, for instance, my child is chronically ill with ear, sinus infections and various mild allergies and I juice for her to boost her immune system and avoid missed school days but I was hoping you could be more specific in what I could juice to help her. I would be interested in what could boost her brain power with her learning disabilities. I also attempt to juice for my pets but I feel I'm juicing blind without a specific guide, all I know is that onions, grapes and grapeseed extract can be lethal to pets. I look forward to a BETTER juice book, one I know Gary Null has the knowledge to put together, this one was a waste of time and money and such a disappontment! I would purchase a juice book by Gary Null which told me what a recipe would do for my family's health, photos are always nice, too. Got it, Gary Null? This book definitely missed the mark! What we need is information on juicing from all your books combined into one, I'm not interested in recipes without knowing why it would help and how by listing nutrition facts for each produce and/or each juice drink. My dad juiced briefly and stopped because it caused diarrhea, this should be addressed with how to avoid it when it would go away, etc. Gary, we need more info. Even if a recipe tastes good I don't want to bother if I don't know why, how and what it would help. A whole section on weight loss? why not a whole juice book on improving health to prolong life and diminish illness?

Last Christmas I went home to be with my parents, and I was looking for recipes that we could all share as a family.My folks knew that I had become a vegetarian, but they were careful about saving me the non-meat portions of their meals and preparing me lots of salads. This was very sweet, but I wanted to find some meals we could share together, (and evangelize them a little, too.) In the local health food store I found Gary's Joy of Juicing recipe book that he had done in collaboration with his daughter, who is a chef. The lasagne we had that afternoon was delicious, and even my dad, a real meat and potatoes kind of guy, really liked it.In addition to the food recipes there are delicious fresh juice recipes. Sometimes I have a little trouble being creative with juicing, but I get a little tired of the standard carrot juice with parsley and lemon that I usually prepare.

I picked up this book because I needed something to push me to begin juicing and to have a bunch of recipes to keep it interesting. --- This book has more than helped in both areas, I keep it right next to my juicer in the kitchen and I never get bored with all the tasty juices I make!! There's also some other juice recipes for soups and other things that are great as well. An invaluable book!!!"},{"Title":"The Joy of Juicing: Creative Cooking With Your Juicer; Completely Revised and Updated","review":"This is my fifth juicing recipe book. I got all the books I purchased from Amazon and was not sure if I'd find what I was looking for if this one didn't work out. I was not looking for something that was just about fasting or cleansing or detoxification. Many of the books about juicing take a seriously holistic approach which is wonderful if that's what you want.We make our own juice simply b/c buying the organic fruit and making it has turned out to be cheaper than buying organic juice. (We go through a LOT of juice). So from making all this juice, I was generating a lot of pulp. I didn't want to just toss it. It contains fiber, nutrients, and taste. I was able to use some in muffins but wanted more creative and diverse ways to use it. I think this book has that. It has seven different categories of recipes and I am looking forward to trying several of them.The two I've tried so far are the Tropical popsicles and a Watermelon Raspberry popsicle. Who knew you could use the pulp in the popsicles too?Mostly I am looking forward to trying the sauces and dips once the veggie garden starts to bear."},{"Title":"The Joy of Juicing: Creative Cooking With Your Juicer; Completely Revised and Updated","review":"The title is misleading.

That is exactly what it did for me when I learned the Option Method 17 years ago. On this great intro to the Option Method, Bruce DiMarsico dispells the mystique around unhappiness by exposing the notion that the experience of unhappiness is always based on what someone believes... often erroneously. Questioning the belief(or judgement or assumption) can effectively vaporize the unhappy conclussion. Hearing one of Bruce's original lectures on Option rekindles the fire in me to spread the word to other happiness-seekers. Do yourself a favor... get this tape and let yourself out of YOUR prison of unhappiness. If I can do it, anyone can!"},{"Title":"Bruce Di Marsico Presents the Option Method","review":"Bruce Di Marsico presents wonderful ideas about how we are the creator of our own personal happiness. The beliefs we hold determine the feelings we experience in any given situation. This tape explains the Option Method - a simple, non-judgmental questioning of your beliefs and whether or not they support your happiness. A simple and insightful tape. Thank you, Bruce! And, thank you, Debbie.."},{"Title":"Bruce Di Marsico Presents the Option Method","review":"For most of us this is the first opportunity to hear the voice of Bruce Di Marsico, developer of the Option Method. The Option Method is a process using a handful of questions to examine our beliefs, more particularly those beliefs we have about why we are \`unhappy' (letting that word stand for any emotional state we don't like). On this tape, Bruce Di Marsico speaks about what might be called the Option philosophy lying behind the Method. The radical suggestion is that, on examination, we can find no valid reasons for being unhappy. Yes, put like that it may sound a bit glib. That's one reason it's a delight to hear the case being made in Bruce Di Marsico's voice, a voice which conveys an inherent reasonableness, as if it were the voice of what common-sense ought to be."},{"Title":"Bruce Di Marsico Presents the Option Method","review":"This tape is a rare and beautiful example of the legacy of Bruce Di Marsico. His gentle, kind demeanor, his tone of genuine feeling as he offers almost humbly the incredibly liberating message of his creation, the Option Method: these are treasures that I can only recommend with all of my heart. I had the opportunity to study with Bruce and was blessed to hear his words and be the object of his loving questions. That experience transformed my life. So, to have this tape available is exciting because I know that others will be drawn to look more closely at what the Option Method might have to offer for them. Fortunately, a book of Bruce's writings will soon be available. Those who would like more information can look at my books at amazon.com or those of Mandy Evans, to get an understanding of what the Option Method is all about."},{"Title":"Bruce Di Marsico Presents the Option Method","review":"Certainly worth listening to and sharing with others. The best part is that Bruce doesn't deliver a big spiel, telling us how we should go about reorganizing our lives, but instead shares some simple (as in not over-the-head philosophy) observations and musings.As Bruce himself puts it, what he really wanted to do was leave us with a question, &quot;Is our unhappiness really necessary?&quot; (once again, the nice thing is it is the question he wants to share, not the answer). If one stops and think about it, as he obviously did, it's a very profound question. I hope you have enjoy it as much as I did."},{"Title":"Bruce Di Marsico Presents the Option Method","review":"I personally found this tape starightforward and revealing, much like the option method itself. After learning the method from various other authors and finding it VERY useful and practical in everyday experiences, its even more clearifying to hear it described from the one who 'invented' it!

Thanks Bruce!"},{"Title":"Bruce Di Marsico Presents the Option Method","review":"Bruce Di Marsico was an extraordinary man who developed a simple, yet profound method to help people deal with their problems. His method is taught and practiced by hundreds of people all over the world and has changed the lives of many, many more. Yet very few people had the opportunity to hear his words first hand. In this tape of one of his earliest lectures, in 1973, he shares his vision of the possibility of perfect happiness, even in a world that is rocked by turmoil and uncertainty. If you are looking for a way to find peace in these extremely troubled times, spend some time with Bruce Di Marsico. It could change your life."},{"Title":"Bruce Di Marsico Presents the Option Method","review":"Option method is truly a way of putting thought into feelings. I think it basically encourages to think before we commit to certain idea, and ideas lead to beliefs, beliefs lead to feelings and emotions. Option method is a way to pause, think and take a rational decision, which would most possibly lead to better emotions and therefore happier life.Bruce di marsico says that happiness is an option, and we have to choose it, by thinking through what lead to unhappiness. There are however, certain things which we have to feel unhappy, and are un avoidable.This is similar to cognitive therapy, where mood disorders, depressions, anxiety are treated by changing our feelings by rational and positive thinking. I would recommend Mind over mood, if you like this video by bruce di marsico.This is just my opinion, and I like any comments or suggestions, because I am still learning."},{"Title":"Bruce Di Marsico Presents the Option Method","review":"Please let it be known that this is a 1973 recording.

I cannot imagine what my life would be like had I not had that opportunity, so I am especially glad that everyone can now hear these simple, powerful ideas from the man who originated the Option Method, himself, Bruce Di Marsico."},{"Title":"Selected poetry and prose (Rinehart editions)","review":"There are countless collections of Shelley's poetry, of course, but this is the one that introduced me to his work. While best known for such short poems as the justly celebrated \\"Ozymandias\\" & \\"Ode to the West Wind,\\" there's far more to his genius. The longer narrative poems are bejeweled, dazzling pieces that convey his philosophical & political thoughts in a structure of memorable images & lines.For instance, his first such poem, \\"Alastor,\\" is a spiritual autobiography of sorts, depicting the doomed journey of the outsider, driven by his vision of transcendant release from the mundane sphere, even if the only path leads to & through Death. As a visionary work, it is superb.Both \\"Queen Mab\\" & \\"The Revolt of Islam\\" examine the nature of & need for revolution -- again, in both political & philosophical terms. Far from the image of the ethereal poet divorced from the social forces & injustices of the day, Shelley emerges here as fiercely involved with them. He pursues these ideas even further in \\"Prometheus Unbound,\\" struggling with oppression & tyranny, both human & divine.But his most sublime poem, at least to my mind, is his elegy for Keats, \\"Adonas.\\" In these lines, all aspects of Shelley's nature & interests intertwine in one golden braid of beauty & thought. It deepens & ripens with every re-reading over the years.Harold Bloom provides an insightful overview of the poet & his work in a fine introductory essay, which is reason enough to seek out this particular edition. Poet, skeptic, radical, Shelley not only remains an exemplar of the Romantic, but a remarkably timely thinker even now. Most highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Where Loyalties Lie","review":"This is an excellent book. It almost ended me up in divorce court though.

The main characters are Dujen, Travis, Liza K., and James James. Because he is a smart young man, James James is my favorite character. In my own life I try to be good and kind to others. James James is like this, he is always considerate and thoughtful.I liked my book.

It's about a family who don't have a house yet, because they don't have enough money to build a house. The father was in another country, doing business around the world. He doesn't even know what's happening to his family. Many people say that they don't have house. Well they are, but the mother says that they were on a vacation. She always said that every time because she doesn't want people to know it. So now, their daughter named Liza K., is an adventures girl. She knows all the places in the forest. She even has an alligator friend. Now, she and her friends must save the forest from the people who want to destroy, but then, her alligator friend lost. Now, she's on an adventure to find the alligator and stop the destruction of the forest.I think this book is good because it tells everybody how important the forest is to us.

George uses adjectives in a way that makes the students' imagination work. Their pictures to illustrate scenes are clear. Their writing also improves as they try to model her writing style."},{"Title":"The Missing 'Gator of Gumbo Limbo: An Ecological Mystery (Eco Mysteries)","review":"This fascinating novel is for anyone who has ever fallen in love with a wild place, with a wild animal, or who is concerned about our jeopardized natural world. Only Jean Craighead George could write such a comprehensible and informative children's book about nature. While they're not JULIE OF THE WOLVES or MY SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN, Ms. George's Ecological Mysteries Series are sure to be enjoyable for any naturalist--inspiring and educational. In THE MISSING 'GATOR OF GUMBO LIMBO, Liza K. Poole lives with her mother and some eccentric neighbors in the heart of the Florida Everglades. (Anyone who was born to live in a tent and fish for food will be envious of this &quot;wild&quot; lifestyle.) When the woods peoples' &quot;dragon&quot;, a regal alligator, disappears, they begin to try to track down the great beast, especially Liza K. A ranger is after the gator, for he has been frightening nearby home-dwellers, and should be shot. Liza K. and her unique friends--including a talkative African gray parrot-- go through a series of clues to find out where the gator has disappeared to. The ending, I admit, is slightly disappointing--the threat of the ranger seems to be forgotten after the gator is found, Liza K. and her neighbors must abandon their way of life--but all in all, it's a fine read. The other Eco-Mysteries should be kept in mind--WHO REALLY KILLED COCK ROBIN?, in which a boy tries to solve the mystery of his clean town's feathered mascot; THE CASE OF THE MISSING CUTTHROATS, quite a lot like THE MISSING 'GATOR; and THE FIRE BUG CONNECTION.

While you still can.For those who are familiar with underground comic books, Patrick Rosenkranz has provided an amazing amount of background information about the creators and the times that produced what could be viewed as the trashiest and/or the most significant cultural artifacts of the second half of the 20th Century.Unlike previous histories and articles that simply reprint the more or less shocking comic pages and regurgitate the same old information, misinformation and opinions about the hippies and their graphic art, Rebel Visions is based on Mr. Rosenkranz own interviews and correspondence with the first wave of underground comix creators. In lengthy footnoted quotes, the artist/writers are finally allowed to tell their own strange and wonderful stories. And by following the stories organized in yearly chapters, I cames to understand something of the birth, bloom and demise of a phenomena that never made the transition to mainstream product or the 1980s.Rebel Visions also presents a significant amount of previously unpublished art for the connoisseur as well as an exhaustive index for the scholar.A word of warning: these comic books are not, and never were, intended for children. Most of the comix displayed and discussed in Rebel Visions were all about breaking taboos, about freedom of expression in the face of a repressive mainstream culture and not about tittilation. That came later. If you're interested in cartoons, graphic art, the counter culture, art, politics, the sixties, propaganda, freedom and censorship, as well as the usual sex, drugs and war, check it out."},{"Title":"Rebel Visions: The Underground Comix Revolution, 1963-1975","review":"At a time when a museum like the Guggenheim is reduced--as of this writing literally--to emptying the paintings from its walls to make \\"room\\" for a new exhibit of essentially next to nothing...a couple lying on the floor simulating a kiss and a few actors hired to ask long-suffering museum \\"viewers\\" annoyingly trite questions, such as \\"what is progress?\\" one begins to wonder what art historians of the future will think of late 20th century/early 21st century \\"art.\\" What will become emblematic of our times when our times are long over? What will remain? Will nothing remain? I mean, you have to have something to see, right?\\"Rebel Visions\\" makes a strong case without so much as raising the issue that what might very well be considered the most important art of our age was that being produced in the underground comix movement of the late 60s/early 70s, and which still continues in various incarnations today. As fine art moved from distortion to abstraction to minimalism to conceptualism to what some might argue is little more than flim-flam chicanery cloaked in elitist pseudointellectual gobbledygook, the disdained creators of such work as filled the pages of Zap! and Young Lust and Raw, to mention just a few, might in the meantime actually have been producing the \\"real\\" fine art of our time.As the so-called \\"real\\" artists turned their back and raised their noses at mere \\"illustration,\\" as they disdained the world of things in their canvases, and eventually disdained even the canvases themselves, as they \\"thought\\" up concepts instead of making images, and as they jockeyed for notoriety and government grants and invitations at all the swell parties, guys like R. Crumb, Robert Williams, S. Clay Wilson, Rick Griffin, and Art Spiegelman were drawing--yes, actually drawing--and the stuff they were drawing directly reflected and directly influenced the culture of late 20th century America.This shouldn't be all that surprising insofar as comic book elements made their way into the paintings of Warhol, Lichtenstein, and a whole bunch of other established fine art types. And before that you've got George Grosz and Max Beckmann. Take a look at their works and tell me you cant see them as akin to comic book panels. While the Julian Schnabels of the world party, the folks in the underground comix movement were actually doing the grunt work, walking the walk, and usually doing it without much appreciation and even less financial reward.Ach! Listen to me blabbering on about art history like EH Gombrich! I know nothing about it--what I know about art history couldn't fill an Idiot's Guide. What I do know is that I like blobs of paint thrown all over canvases as much as anyone; I swoon over string, nails, crushed cigarettes, dirt, poop, yesterday's lunch, and whatever else spray-painted over and glued onto billboards of plywood just as much as any art critic at the New York Times. I'll even nod appreciatively and chuckle knowingly along with the rest of the cognescenti when some downtown goofball paints a box of toothpicks white, sticks them in his nipples, and photographs them in the pitch-dark with a pinhole camera.In other words, I'm no phillistine!And I like minimalism...I love minimalism...as an anorectic, I am minimalism incarnate!But when it reaches the point when a museum empties itself out and asks people to pay admission to look at its bare walls I start to think I'm being taken for a fool.Listen, when \\"fine art\\" gets to the point that youre literally looking at nothing then the eye starts looking for stimulation. A superhero, a talking aardvark, one of those jittery Crumb characters...anything! When it's been so long since we saw anyone actually take a pencil and put marks on a page that resemble something we recognize that we begin to suspect that no one remembers how to do it, when art no longer seems to be making any attempt whatsoever to reflect and comment about our lives and the world we live in, when you need a card full of philosophical rigmarole written by some tenured academic to explain the blank space on the museum wall as a work of art and not, as you originally suspected, the spot left behind when a painting was removed for cleaning- then you begin to think that maybe when the fork in the art road was reached between representation and abstraction, we took the wrong road...or maybe just went too far down the right road.No matter. Just the fact that that the US government tried to shut down the publications featuring these mere schlockmeisters, these adolescent smut peddlers, these underground comic \\"artists\\" should tell you something.Aside from all that, \\"Rebel Visions\\" is just a lot of fun to read. And it's inspiring too. It makes one envious of the exciting times, the camarederie, and the commitment to engaged art that these guys had--and that is so lacking in today's art world. It shows you just how much people will do, the lengths they will go to do it, the sacrifices they'll make and for no discernible reward...if they love what they're doing.These guys were, and in many cases, still are, true artists of the first rank. And I wouldn't be at all surprised if in a hundred years from now they will be regarded among the foremost of our time."},{"Title":"Rebel Visions: The Underground Comix Revolution, 1963-1975","review":"This is an all-new edition, following the 2002 hbk, but Fantagraphics don't flaunt the fact.

There are also lots of examples provided, which are very helpful for those who are visual learners.This is a very good textbook and I would recommend it to anyone who is learning organic chemistry."},{"Title":"Organic Chemistry: Structure and Function","review":"I used this book for a two semester course in organic chemistry. Of all the textbooks I have read, and believe me I have read a LOT, this is among the top 3 of all time. The authors clearly explain the material and the order of the chapters is great, starting with a quick overview of chemical concepts, then going into haloalkanes, alcohols, alkenes, alkynes, specroscopic methods, and finally some more advanced reactions and functional groups like carboxylic acids and their derviatives as well as a few ending chapters on biochemical topics like amino acids and carbohydrates. This book is great for a student who has never had exposure to organic chemistry as it presents the most fundamental reactions for a given functional group as well as clear descriptions. One thing I really enjoy about this textbook is the summary of reactions at the end of each chapter which allows you to look up a reaction easily. Another thing I really like is the problems that are placed directly in the chapter, which have answers in the back of the book; these make sure you really understood the material you just read.Note: pick up the previous edition if you can, its much cheaper and is nearly identical to the newer edition; however the problems at the end of the chapters may be different(?)."},{"Title":"Organic Chemistry: Structure and Function","review":"This book is simple to understand even amidst all the details it provides.

This 516 page commentary of Exodus presupposes the divine nature and inspiration of the text. While Durham gives information about sources of the finished text (Source Criticism), he approaches the text of a &quot;Canonical&quot; method, dealing with the text as it has come to us in its current form. His emphasis is on extracting the theological meaning of the text as opposed to defending or debunking various theories about the historicity of the book or particular events within it. For example, Durham doesn't get caught up in the debate about where the Red Sea was, or if this was a real historical event. He focuses on the meaning of that event for Israel, and the latter Christian community that would also consider the event apart of their faith heritage. Durham uses his own translation which provides a hosts of insights about the original language uses in the canon. This book will be a valuable resource for scholars who are searching for a reliable example of Canonical Criticism of Exodus. It will also be helpful for the pastor or Bible teacher who seeks greater theological understanding of Israel and her dramatic beginnings."},{"Title":"Word Biblical Commentary Vol. 3, Exodus","review":"This volume is certainly required reading for an in-depth study of Exodus, but it is far from the only reading one will have to do to gain an informed knowledge of the text (this is true of every commentary, but especially true of Durham). Durham has many excellent points and is very quotable, particularly in the \\"Form/Structure/Setting sections.\\" He interacts with a wide range of scholarship, which is helpful when doing research and trying to track down sources. His rendering of the Hebrew is also very good, and often more can be gleaned from his translation notes than in the actual \\"Comment\\" section.Unfortunately, the eager reader will also find considerable weaknesses. Although he mentions many views on the various issues, he rarely interacts with them. When he does, it often takes the form of simply dismissing the relevance of source critics for his purposes, rather than stating whether such views are probable or improbable, and if so, why. Also, his actual \\"Comment\\" sections are often woefully brief. More often than not, he groups three to six verses together, mentioning only one or two very general things about them, and then moves on.I have been helped by owning this commentary, particularly in finding ideas as to how to express what the text is saying. But if you want to really get a grasp on what is out there in Exodus, you will also need Enns, Sarna, and Childs (although the latter expresses a style that he has abandoned in recent years). Of course, even then you will still need a hefty amount of articles, etc, to really stay current (IVP's Dictionary of the Pentateuch is helpful). Durham's WBC by itself won't satisfy."},{"Title":"Word Biblical Commentary Vol. 3, Exodus","review":"John I. Durham is a professor of Hebrew and Old Testament at Southeastern Baptist Seminary in North Carolina and the author of many scholarly works on Old Testament studies, including this volume in the Word Biblical Commentary Series.Of the Volumes in the Word Commentary that I've read or consulted, Durham's treatment of Exodus ranks among the best. One of Durham's greatest joys in preparing this commentary is the fact that he is required to make his own translation of the Hebrew text. His skill and enjoyment in this area certainly shine through as he jumps from wooden translations, to phrases that capture the spirit of the Hebrew (as opposed to the literal translation), with all his translation decisions explained in his translation notes. I learned more about Exodus than I expected from reading the translation and notes!As for the commentary proper, I am pleased to find that John Durham is easily one of the most readable contributors in the Word Series--he seems to know when a point needs more explanation and when he's \\"beaten a dead horse.\\" I was also pleased to find that Durham, a respected scholar in an academic setting, was able to briefly cover \\"Ivory Tower\\" theories about certain portions of text, but then have the wisdom to put such theories in their proper place. He often mentions an academic controversy or debate, but then does a great service to the reader by putting the debated portion of Scripture in its proper theological context.This last point is perhaps the most valuable aspect of this commentary--the author never forgets the major theological themes and points in the book of Exodus. Whether the text is about Ten Plagues, Ten Commandments, Tabernacle Furniture, or rebellious Israelites, Durham always puts these portions of Scripture in context--theological and historical. He is one of a shrinking number of Old Testament authors that actually has respect for the textus receptus.While this commentary has many strengths, it also has some disappointing weaknesses. The first among these is the absense of any New Testament applications. Durham begins by pointing out that Exodus is the third most quoted OT book in the New Testament (running behind Psalms and Isaiah), yet does not make the connections between the Testaments. Whether a portion of Scripture is quoted by Jesus, Paul, etc., or whether Messianic prophesies are apparent (Passover, the table in the Tabernacle, Moses' arms being supported in a crucifix position, etc.), Durham ignores it.A second disappointed aspect of Durham's commentary is the amount of respect and credit (and space) he gives to source-criticism and \\"later editors\\" theories. At many points, it is very difficult to tell if Durham actually BELIEVES that some of the events recorded in Exodus actually happened. He clearly does not believe that Moses wrote the book, but he does believe that the Lord descended onto Mount Sinai, but he's not sure if the Tabernacle and furniture actually existed. It often seems as if Durham deliberately avoids taking a position on historical reliability and the like. If, in the Introduction, he stated that he is simply giving an overview of others' ideas (see Beasley-Murray's commentary on John), that would be one thing. However, Durham makes no such claim and the reader is left wondring where the author's religious convictions lie.In all, this is a solid commentary on a difficult and diverse book of the Bible. While there are flaws, the book's merits far outweigh them. I recommend this book."},{"Title":"Word Biblical Commentary Vol. 3, Exodus","review":"After thoroughly enjoying Gordon Wenham's commentary on Genesis, also part of the Word Biblical Commentary series, I had great expectations of John Durham's commentary on Exodus. However, I was disappointed. Durham has almost no discussion of the historical background of the story and little on the literary structures within the text. He focuses almost entirely on his translation of the text and, frankly, as a Hebrew reader and speaker I find his translation extremely inelegant.Still, the commentary provides some interesting insights and excellent bibliographic material."},{"Title":"No Baloney Sandwich (A Dolphin book)","review":"Judging by the title and cute illustration on the cover, I first thought this was a humorous book.

Sidebars with/ instructions on how to fry an egg, make marinated artichoke hearts, make dressings/season mixes and many more make this an interesting read.Simple, easy to follow instructions make this a great book for the inexperienced sandwich-maker that wants a little something more than mayo, meat and cheese on whole wheat."},{"Title":"The morphology of human blood cells","review":"The book we received was a photocopy of the original.

This is going in my Library and I will revisit it often."},{"Title":"Six Battles Every Man Must Win: . . . and the Ancient Secrets You'll Need to Succeed","review":"There are few things I like less than Christian books and programs that offer easy answers, for nowhere does God promise that living for Him will be easy. It seems, though, that the Christian world just laps these books up. Those dealing with Christian living seem to be particularly prone to \\"easy-answerism.\\" Fortunately bestselling author Bill Perkins avoids this concern in his new book entitled Six Battles Every Man Must Win. Based on the Biblical account of King David's mighty men, this book seeks to address the cultural bullies that continually attempt to steal men's hearts. Perkins offers insight on how men can set their sights on God's will for their lives and escape the destructive behavior that is keeping them from being warriors for Him.\\"This book was written for men who...are tired of living like spiritual weaklings. It's for men who believe they were created to be warriors but aren't sure how to fight or what they should be fighting for. It's for men who want to lock on their purpose for living. And it's for men who want to learn ancient secrets from some of the greatest warriors of the Bible: David's special fighting force, the mighty men.\\"For many years our society has told men to cultivate their gentler side and to suppress masculine distinctives. After many years this influence has begun to shape men's identities. Satan builds on this doubt, this disillusion, doing all he can to convince men that they are not warriors at all and that they can play no part in the spiritual battle that rages in this world. Six Battles Every Man Must Win serves as a wake-up call to men who cannot or will not see this conflict.\\"We must wake up. We can no longer deny the reality of the angelic conflict in which we're combatants. We have an enemy who hates us and seeks our destruction. We must discover the secret of masculine strength that's rooted in Christ.\\"Churches, rather than combating the emasculation of men, has contributed by molding the church to create an atmosphere that appeals to women more than men. This process began when men started to forsake their role as the spiritual leaders in the homes and it soon spread to the church. Even Jesus has been given an \\"extreme makeover\\" so that those characteristics he no-doubt possessed that women object to have been downplayed in favor of His gentleness and compassion. As this has happened, the church has ceased teaching godly masculinity so men are unable to resist our society's misconceptions about manliness. The two greatest deceptions are that you are what you own and that you medicate pain with sex. When men lose sight of God's standards for manliness and adopt the world's standards, they give Satan exactly what he is looking for - their hearts. So what are men to do? They are to stand their ground! \\"Recognizing you are engaged in a spiritual battle and deciding to stand your ground are crucial first steps.\\"The subsequent six chapters outline six battles every man needs to face in order to win this spiritual battle. The battles are: Fight for your identity, fight for personal holiness, fight for your family, fight through pain, fight for your friends and fight for a strong faith. Each chapter is based around the struggle and triumph faced by one of David's mighty men. Perkins draws practical, Biblically-sound application from each of their victories. The author avoids attempting to provide easy answers. Like any battle, the battle for holiness of character can be won only through great effort. Instead of easy answers, he provides a solid base of application the reader can build on as he acknowledges and then joins the fight.The book closes not with final answers, but with a final challenge. \\"...enlist right now to fight in the six battles and discover firsthand how God can transform you and use you to strengthen your family and other men. The battle is raging as you read these words...Grab your sword and enter the fight.\\" The book ends with a challenge to begin living a life of greater holiness before God; a challenge to commit my life, my time and my efforts to His cause. It ends with a call for me to be the warrior God intended me to be so that with His help and for His glory I can win the battle that rages all around me and defeat the one who seeks to steal my heart.If I was forced to find a complaint about this book I would say that I was a bit disappointed that it was merely 140 pages long. Several of the chapters provided only an introduction to a topic that I would have liked the author to examine in greater detail. Of course many of the chapters could (and sometimes have been) books of their own so this is probably not practical. I would also have liked to see more exposition of the passage the book is based on. Though most believers have some level of knowledge about David's life, I'm sure many of the references will be lost to readers. Before reading the book I would recommend reading at least 2 Samuel 23: 8-23. For the full story read most of 1 and 2 Samuel.Two things that initially drew me to Perkins' books are his honesty and passion. He draws on many incidents from his own life, being sufficiently honest to use his experiences as examples of behavior others should avoid. He writes with such passion that I could feel the genuine desire he has to see men emerge as the warriors God intended them to be. His passion is contagious.A book that provides many \\"aha\\" moments (as promised on the cover) as well as many opportunities for reflection and discussion, I would recommend this book to men who are seeking to honor God with their lives and are willing to accompany Him into battle."},{"Title":"Six Battles Every Man Must Win: . . . and the Ancient Secrets You'll Need to Succeed","review":"I love this book. My husband owns it and I was intrigued by the title so I picked it up. My first thought after I read it was that every church should buy this book in case loads and give it out to every man in their congregation. This is exactly the book that I was hoping would be written. I talk to alot of women, and I keep hearing over and over again a heartfelt desire to see our husbands quit the complacency and passivity that seems to plague the modern Christian man.Bill Perkins' book is an easy read with great stories to illustrate each point. He doesn't use technical language or deal in theory. Every point is clearly made with practical application that can be implemented today. This is definitely a book for any man, especially the men in my life. And, I think that women should read it too. It has certainly given me a window into the way a man's mind works and the struggles that they face. I feel that I can pray more effectively now for what my husband is facing.

The six battles listed include:1. Fight for your identity2. Fight for personal holiness3. Fight for your family4. Fight through pain5. Fight for your friends6. Fight for a strong faithEach of the battles made sense, although I couldn't really relate to the family fight as I'm not married. However I'm sure that many men could relate to it.I was most impressed with the chapter on fighting through pain. Bill nails the internal struggle that Christian men go through when dealing with pain. Temptation always starts with a baby step, disguised to seem like nothing at all. However it always leads to a slippery slope.I enjoy Bill's idea of \\"buddyship\\" or the need to have male friends. Bill lists a number of reasons why it is important to have male friends, but like the majority of the book, he doesn't give practical advice regarding how to develop relationships. I really would have liked to have seen more practical advice regarding what to do, not just what I should do.Regardless, this book is a good easy read. I didn't find it life-changing but it was a good review of issues that need to be dealt with as a man. 4 out of 5 stars."},{"Title":"Six Battles Every Man Must Win: . . . and the Ancient Secrets You'll Need to Succeed","review":"Hello, my name is Daniel.

There are quotes on the bottom of each page and several pages of quotes at the end.What are some of the things I gained an insight into?Time. We all have the same amount but we don't all use it the same, an interesting look at how we deal with time.Creativity. What is the difference between being creative and simply following the crowd? How can we &quot;steal&quot; ideas yet still be creative?Learning. This was perhaps the most important chapter. Do we really learn to learn or do we just memorize facts and figures? How learning, continual learning, is so important.Supporters. The people we surround ourselves with.Does the idea of an &quot;honest&quot; thief sound like a contradiction? An oxymoron?

Hector expects Moira to bring money as a dowry that he can use on their failing farm.Moira wed Hector to escape her home, but she honestly thought she married a wealthy landowner. In spite of the lack of new capital, at first everyone is happy with the marriage as Moira adds a dimension of happiness into their lives. However, over the years as the family fiscal crisis worsens and Moira seems to be in a constant state of pregnancy, Hector blames everyone, including the &quot;deceitful&quot; Moira, for his troubles. How will the lack of nurturing from the angry, cold Hector impact everyone else in the family, especially as they reach out for love?THE DESERT CROP is the last novel from the great Catherine Cookson, who passed away last year. However, the story is a tribute to the talent of one of the hall of famers of romance writing. The story line is vintage Cookson, taking place in her usual time and universe, and involving individuals and a family struggling to cope with pending disaster.

After her death in 1998 her estate released this last book. As always she gives us strong characters with loving ways, drama, death, murder, class struggles, and even a bit of lust and loving along the way.Set in Northeast England we are entertained by the comings and goings of the Stewart family. Patti the rebellious daughter, and Daniel the subservient son, manipulated by a father Hector Stewart who is evil and pathetic. After their mother's death, Hector finds he hasn't the money to run the farm, so is forced to marry an Irish woman with the promise of an inheritance.I love how Cookson is able to take the reader into her world and make you want to return to it.

It covers a period of time and shows how people lived in those days. It was very interesting."},{"Title":"The Supremacists: The Tyranny of Judges and How to Stop It","review":"I'll make no apologies for thinking highly of Phyllis Schlafly. Regardless of your politics, you have to admire the energy of someone who could obtain a law degree, raise 6 children and home school them, be highly active in the political arena, do a weekly radio program, author countless articles and books, and then deliver this book as she approached her 80th birthday. Love her or hate her, she isn't showing signs of slowing down.And, as I said in the title, you will either love this book or hate it. In fact, as I read through the 20 existing reviews here on Amazon, there was an almost binary pattern of how people responded to this book:Category A: Supporters of Judicial Activism.These individuals believe that the role of the Supreme Court is to act independently of the Legislative branch in not just reviewing and applying law, but in actually enacting new laws or amending existing ones. These individuals are either ignorant of or cheerfully ignore the Constitution's separation of powers along with the only means of amending the document (Article V), preferring instead to allow a group of 9 people in robes to effectively amend the Constitution. These individuals believe, with Al Gore, that the Constitution is a \\"living, breathing document\\" that is to be constantly interpreted and re-interpreted in light of evolving sensibilities - not via a formal amendment process or enactment of new laws through the Legislative branch, but through the unaccountable actions of the Supreme Court. As one might guess, these individuals give the book 1 star and a scathing review.Category B: Opponents of Judicial Activism.These individuals believe that the role of the Supreme Court is to act independently of the Legislative branch in reviewing and applying law, and although the Court may find a law to be unconstitutional, they may not make or amend laws. These individuals believe that the Constitution should be strictly interpreted according to its plain language meaning and its original intent. These individuals also understand that there is only one manner by which the Constitution shall be amended, and it is found in Article V. As one might guess, these individuals give the book 5 stars and a glowing review.It saddens me that instead of reading this book and judging it on its logic, its merits, and its extensive citations of court cases, the negative reviewers immediately assume the author is some type of shill for right-wing politics who selectively chose facts to support her premise. I beg to differ. She is presenting a very logical case that effectively dismantles the arguments that insist the Constitution and our history supports the notion of Judicial Activism. She shows where Judicial Activism started. She shows how and why it has grown. She shows the effects of Judicial Activism such as how the Court has made new laws, imposed taxes, and created new \\"rights.\\" She clearly explains the difference between Judicial Review and Judicial Activism. She explains that Marbury vs. Madison was actually a model of judicial restraint, not judicial excess, and that it was later Courts that incorrectly applied and interpreted Marbury to eventually arrive at today's unchecked Judicial Activism. And she does this without ever once resorting to right wing politics. She merely uses the Constitution itself and a variety of Supreme Court decisions to make her case.I, for one, believe it is an airtight case. She shows us that while some may passionately support Judicial Activism and believe that the Supreme Court's activism has actually resulted in a better country, those people cannot find that Activism power granted to the Court anywhere in the Constitution's language or intent.In summary, take a look at categories A and B above. If you're in category A, don't bother reading this book unless you have an open mind, are willing to accept the Constitution as the supreme law of the land, and are willing to subject your pre-conceived notions to what the Constitution actually says. If, on the other hand, you're in category B, you'll find this an excellent book that gives voice and credence to your beliefs.As a footnote, if the topic of judicial activism and constitutional law interests you, I highly recommend the book \\"The Tempting of America\\" by Robert Bork. He does a masterful job of treating the subject and provides considerably more depth than Schlafly on the topic. Combined, the two books make an excellent primer on the topic."},{"Title":"The Supremacists: The Tyranny of Judges and How to Stop It","review":"In this day and age when Truth is questioned, the source/author of a book is important indeed. If one believes that God alone is Truth, then one can read with confidence, The Supremacists. The author, P. Schlafly, is on God's Wavelength.The Left have sought for more than 50 years to control our nation. They cannot do it by the ballot box so the revolution is therein by judges, as we have seen in the past decades but even more so in the past years (Mass), judges making rules/laws whereas they were meant only to INTERPRET the laws.Their revolutionary rulings have and will continue to cause a great divide in the Culture War, which will define us as a nation that will live forever, or go down the sad pages of history as so many nations before us have gone, e.g., Ur. of the Chaldees, Babylonia, Persia, Alexandria, Egypt, Rome, mighty Rome, she merely disintegrated from within.History is making its torrential mark on the world, and let us not be asleep while it rages."},{"Title":"The Supremacists: The Tyranny of Judges and How to Stop It","review":"Schlafly has certainly done her homework, and presents a number well-researched cases with attention to specifics. Certainly her career as an attorney gives her considerable insight into the judicial process.However, her conclusions are flawed and filtered through her own bias, almost to the point of making it seem as if she has a vendetta against jurists who don't rule according to her own narrow viewpoint when they simply rule based on precedent and the letter of the law.Her hypocrisy is that she believes that the only right way is her way, and would take away the freedoms of others in order to impose her own rigid definitions of protected speech, separtion of religion and state, and so on.Certainly there are problem judges in this country, and some of her examples rightly point this out. But we can all take comfort in the fact that Schlafly is not a judge, else she would be at the top of the \\"Supremacist\\" list. And the way to stop her, is to stop buying her sad, short, overpriced books. Because taking away her right to author and sell them (as she has advocated doing to others in her books, columns, and newsletters) would be hypocritical."},{"Title":"The Supremacists: The Tyranny of Judges and How to Stop It","review":"Schlafly here considers these \\"tyrannical\\" judges to be \\"supremacists\\". Supremacists you ask? What kind of supremacists might she be talking about? Are they supremacists who enforce the Bill of Rights? You might know what I am talking about. These are the obviously sleazy people who allow all sorts of people to \\"voice their opinions\\" and express themselves through artistic freedom. Obviously these \\"supremacists\\" judges are rogue defenders of the Constitution and Schlafly believes that the First Amendment only applies to wholesome speech.Now that my sarcastic portion of this review is over with, I will get to the bottom of the barrel here. Schlalfy, points out that video games are being protected by Supremacists judges who unjustly hold up the Bill of Rights in order to to allow the industry to spew violent material across the United States. Why stop at video games though Schlafly? There's a boatload of movies and violent books that you might miss, no right-wing pretend dictator like yourself would be complete without burning a book or two, right?"},{"Title":"The Supremacists: The Tyranny of Judges and How to Stop It","review":"THIS IS ABOUT HOW THE JUDGES INCKLUDING THE SUPREME COURT WHO ARE CHANGING THE MEANING OF THE CONSTITUTION AND MAKING LAWS THAT ONLY CONGRESS SHOULD BE DOING.

If you believe in losing the Constitution and turning this country into a theocratic dictatorship, then buy this book and join the losers."},{"Title":"The Supremacists: The Tyranny of Judges and How to Stop It","review":"Predictably, Schlafly latches onto the Right-wing delusion that someone has to stop these darned activist Liberal judges before they destroy the whole country. Never mind that these judges are doing their jobs; namely, they are interpreting law in accordance with precedent. Schlafly commits the all-too-common egocentric error of reviling any law or decision that doesn't conform to a narrow, regressive, and repressive interpretation of \\"the founders' intent\\" as viewed through the lens of modern Conservative insanity.The author makes no mention of the fact that when judges' \\"activist\\" decisions coincide with Conservative agenda, these judges are praised for upholding the law. Schlafly, like many of her contemporary demagogues, seeks desperately to paint Conservatives as the victimized minority charged with defending the country against encroachment of modern ideas, when in fact they are a radical and dangerous sect already controlling the three branches of government and the press.If Schlafly feels that the matter is so grave as to require desperate action, then perhaps she should consider that it is the preponderance of backward-thinking Conservative judges and legislators, not to mention an anachronistic executive administration, that is to blame for the destruction of the system.If you long to convince yourself that forward-thinking judges are this country's greatest problem, then you might enjoy this book. But if you recognize that the country can't languish in outdated and regressive thinking, then this book is of no use to you."},{"Title":"The Supremacists: The Tyranny of Judges and How to Stop It","review":"As to be expected of a book endorsed by Edwin Meese and George Bush, this book talks about how to permit right wing fascism by undermining the balance of power afforded by the Judicial Branch. Phyllis is in her typical form, blasting judges for such things as ending segregation and protecting human rights. Like another reviewer said, past the title there is nothing new. If you want to see where people like Reverend Pat Mahoney, Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell get their ideas of how to destroy this country by breaking down the balance of power so that they can build a murderous Theocracy, this book is for you."},{"Title":"The Supremacists: The Tyranny of Judges and How to Stop It","review":"I knew mrs Schlafly's ideas from reading her columns at townhall, and this book therefore taught me nothing new.

If you feel that our Judicial system is flawed because it is not being held accountable - wouldn't that be an argument for more checks and balances not less?So then what is this really about? I believe that the author is afraid of social evolution (as evidenced by her other books.) Although I don't understand why she is - without it she couldn't be an author, lawer, columnist, AND be the mother of six. Anyways, she would like to replace our judges with know it alls like herself. She does a good job of presenting the facts that back up her agenda, but she misses any evidence of how the system that she proposes would be doomed to fail. After all, history shows us the ugly death of all previous Theocracies. If you are afraid of moving forward, this book is for you. If not save your money for a book with more balance."},{"Title":"The Supremacists: The Tyranny of Judges and How to Stop It","review":"I first discovered Mrs. Schlafly about two years ago when I caught her, quite by accident, on a news program speaking about her infamous book THE POWER OF THE POSITIVE WOMAN. I laughed. I thought it was a joke. Too bad it wasn't--I've read that one too. Mrs. Schalfly does it again with her most recent book, telling only one side of the story and basing her argument on the Word of God, to which she apparently has more authority than anyone other than the attendees at the Last Supper. This book is definitely worth a read--it shows the serious conservative flaws with the cry of &quot;activist judges!&quot; Once again, all she's really done is shown the world that what she's saying really isn't worth saying at all. But God Bless America for recognizing her right to say it. Read it, but don't buy it. Check it out from your local library."},{"Title":"The Supremacists: The Tyranny of Judges and How to Stop It","review":"This book is an excellent summary and analysis of our current constitutional predicament. Even if Mrs. Schlafly's legal and historical arguments are incorrect--and I don't believe they are--it is at least a problem that the behavior of the courts in recent decades has become such a source of division. We need a way out of this mess, and we won't find it by being complacent.The previous review speaks for itself. For every person on the Right who is annoyed by challenges to his unexamined opinions, there is at least one such person on the Left.Is it really so obvious, for instance, that there is no problem with the Supreme Court seeking &quot;precedents&quot; for its opinions in the legislation and case law of foreign countries? Is it irrational to wonder whether one judge should be permitted to nullify laws passed by a majority of citizens--based on his divination of the &quot;motives&quot; behind the law? Are we so sure that this is what the Founding Fathers had in mind--or that our judgment is better than theirs?"},{"Title":"The Supremacists: The Tyranny of Judges and How to Stop It","review":"Phyllis Schlafly masterfully presents the core problem in American government today: there are no checks and balances when it comes to judicial power.As an attorney I know from experience that there is one rule that trumps all other rules: judges do as they please. We have a Nevada supreme court which ruled that an amendment to the Nevada constitution was, effectively, unconstitutional and therefore refused to enforce it.There is no doubt that judges see their branch of government as superior in authority to the legislative and executive - combined. They do not recognize the other two branches of government as legitimate checks and balances to their own power.The Supremacists is a compelling review of the problem we face today, Phyllis Schlafly sets forth some useful ideas to reverse our slide into judicial tyranny. Her only fault is that she does not go far enough."},{"Title":"The Supremacists: The Tyranny of Judges and How to Stop It","review":"Great book. This is the only book that correctly identifies judicial supremacy as the core of the problem with the courts, and gives practical suggestions on what to do about it. For example, we don't need a constitutional amendment to stop same-sex marriage, because Congress can just withdraw court jurisdiction to DOMA (Defense Of Marriage Act). This book clearly proves that the courts do not need to be making law in the way that they do. It all started in the Warren Court about 50 years, and the bad, activist, anti-democratic decisions have been the result of erroneous thinking about the constitutional role of the courts."},{"Title":"The Supremacists: The Tyranny of Judges and How to Stop It","review":"Well, this is the best time to review this book as it's now clear that, at least for the next four years, we will have fewer \\"supremacists\\", or judicial lawmakers, writing our laws rather than interpreting them. Only through the courts has the left been able to succeed in pushing through its cultural agenda. Schlafly reviews a suprising number of cases in this book to illustrate the way in which judges have been become more powerful forgers of government than the legistlators that we actually elect. Her case is strong and the book is very readable; however, I would recommend waiting until the paperback comes out as the book is far too short to be worth full price. It was a helpful primer though for those of us with only fading memories of Marbury v. Madison and ex parte McCardle."},{"Title":"The Supremacists: The Tyranny of Judges and How to Stop It","review":"One can hardly think of a better author to take on the judicial activists. Phyllis Schlafly has been a dogged defender of freedom, and the matriarch of pro-family activism for four decades now. Both as a mother and a lawyer, she is well qualified to speak on how the tyranny of the courts is stamping out our freedoms and laying siege to our families.Her thesis is simple. For the past fifty years liberal judges have moved beyond the strict interpretation of law to the creation of law. They have become legislators, and have sought to impose their leftist bias on the rest of the community. The rule of law has thus been replaced by the rule of judges: judges who are unelected and unaccountable, foisting their vision of the good society on a hapless citizenry.Instead of viewing the US Constitution as a document that meant certain things by its authors, the activists speak of a \\"living and evolving Constitution\\" that can be taken to mean different things at different times. The original intent of the framers of the Constitution is jettisoned and trendy interpretations are read into the documents. The judges in fact are writing their own biased opinions into the law.But the American system of government was meant to include a clear separation of powers. In addition to the judiciary, there was the legislative and the executive wings of government. Not only was the judiciary not meant to be in the business of creating laws, but it was also designed to be the least powerful of the three branches of government. Schlafly shows that in many ways it now has become the most powerful.Indeed, this book shows that our judges have imposed taxes, dismantled laws that protect internal security, rewritten laws on the conduct of elections, and redefined the institution of marriage, to name but a few examples of judicial activism.Moreover, they have invented so-called rights to such things as abortion, same-sex marriage, and public funding of pornography. As Schlafly rightly notes, such social and political policies should be made by our elected representatives, and not by our unelected judges.Schlafly documents how this momentous change to our governance has come about. She notes that the infamous Dred Scott decision of 1857 really started the ball rolling on judicial tyranny. The Supreme Court made this pro-slavery decision by striking down a Federal law which forbade slavery in certain parts of America. Abraham Lincoln, the champion of emancipation, was appalled at the decision, and the attempt by the Court to make public policy.Nearly one hundred years went by before a new bout of judicial activism erupted, this time under the Warren Court. Chief Justice Earl Warren wasted no time in asserting judicial supremacy, with a number of established laws overturned, and controversial social upheaval initiated, as in his challenges to school prayer and obscenity laws. The trends started by Warren have pretty much continued unabated during the past five decades.Schlafly charts this half century of activism, with detailed chapters on such things as the courts' promotion of feminism, pornography, and its all-out assault on the institution of marriage. Concerning the latter, this book makes clear that both liberal judges and homosexual activists know that their agenda will never be implemented by the ballot box. The will of the people must be side-stepped by the use of judicial activism. Thus the war against marriage that we are now embroiled in.In addition to various state judiciaries rejecting the will of the people on the marriage debate, the federal courts as well have waded into these debates. Justice Scalia has bemoaned the activism of his colleagues, saying they are making the Constitution and the nation unrecognisable.Schlafy reminds us that homosexuals can marry just as anyone else can, but on the same terms. Everyone is equally banned from marriage because of certain age, relationship, and sex requirements. The truth is, most homosexuals do not want marriage. What they do want is full public acceptance and approval, and they are using the activist courts to achieve their aims.Schlafy concludes this volume by offering some proposals to stop the judicial supremacists. These include allowing Congress to take its impeachment powers seriously, and to work to restore the balance of powers with its system of checks and balances. Above all, ordinary citizens must take an interest in the courts and court decision, becoming informed on how America was meant to be governed. They must become involved, and raise their voices about these unwelcome trends.And this book serves as an important rallying cry to that end. In order for \\"we the people\\" to be truly sovereign, the warnings of this book need to be widely declared and heeded."},{"Title":"The Supremacists: The Tyranny of Judges and How to Stop It","review":"I totally agree with Phyllis Schafly and I gained better insight into the whole judicial process and the long-term disastrous social effects of judical inperialism by those who make up law and precedent from their own minds and ambiguous feeling.Phyllis takes you through watershed judical pronouncements bysubject and summarizes simialr cases to give the reader a focused understanding of rulings by subject. If you are in a hurry and are looking for a quick, but telling understanding in diverse areas of law--this book is helpful and a good primer for those who want to an introduction to the originalist or texualist view point of judical interpretation.I bought the book because I am doing research on abortion and I needed a practical grasp of the underlying social and political climate that coalested into the convuluded judical reasonings behind that fateful Roe decision. I feel that this book, rounded out my view and I gained a fuller understanding of the interrelated issues.Men In Black by Mark Levin gave a chronoloical approach to the devolution of the renegage court--where Pat Robertson's Courting Disaster gave the religious and social context of the constitution's framers to give tremendous depth of understanding into the thinking and background of that brilliant God-given documentation. His book peers into the soul of the constitutional writers and I gained a new revelation and appreciation of the indispensibility of the Christian faith as absolutely critical to the success of our nation.This book rounded out my understanding, reinforced introductory legal concepts so I was better able to grasp the guiding principles and reasonings of the clandestine supreme court."},{"Title":"The Supremacists: The Tyranny of Judges and How to Stop It","review":"The author is one of the most potent grassroots politicial activists in the country over the last generation, so she does generate controversy, and her effectiveness inflames the passions of her opponents which probably accounts for most of the one-star ratings.Okay. But what about the actual merits of the book? The author is also an attorney by training. She has researched the subject well and supports the premise with a clear and cogent survey of the history of judicial activisim and the mischief it has caused. For those who have had enough of judges overreaching the duties of their office and snatching legislative powers away from congress and state assemblies, this book is a refreshingly candid look at what's wrong, how we got into this mess, and constitutional remedies to get back on track. I always appreciate the glorious combination of brevity and clarity, and this book does not disappoint.Many people are unaware that the constitution grants Congress the power to legislate exceptions to the court's jurisdiction (i.e. tell federal courts what they can and cannot hear). Mrs. Schlafly's development of this idea is worth the price of the book alone."},{"Title":"The Supremacists: The Tyranny of Judges and How to Stop It","review":"This book is another in a long line of evidence that many of our jurists are going stark raving mad. Except for the three bad liberal reviews ahead of this one( one of which wrote a five star review for that old cuss, Leo Buscalia's latest \\"advise to the lovelorn and those that will never find love because they are crazy\\"...seriously, does anyone still read Leo?), the other reviewers seem to realize this. The question is what can be done and I agree with the author... it's tough particularily when congress and the Prez don't seem to want to do anything about these judicial zanies... Remember that California got rid of Rose Bird and two other state supremes for their refusal to apply the death penalty, actually flaunting doing their duty in front of the people for ten years, daring them to do anything about it...the people did, and Rose was out and even then she never \\"got it\\". Get this book...you need it to fight the liberal virus of \\"gonna get ya\\". One way or the other, they mean it."},{"Title":"The Supremacists: The Tyranny of Judges and How to Stop It","review":"In addition to being one of the most effective grass-roots leaders in America (she is credited for defeating the ERA among other things,) Mrs. Schlafly is also a briliant scholar with several advanced degrees, including a law degree. However, this book is easily readable to the average person. It is factual, well argued, and concise. She diagnoses the problem of judicial tyrrany, and offers practical, well needed solutions.The book has twelve chapters. Three chapters review how judicial supremacy got started, and how it grew. Eight other chapters examine eight important political issues, and how judges have illigitimately inserted their own policy preferences for the clear words of the Constitution. She shows how judges have acted to censor religious expression, undermine U.S. sovereignty, redefine marriage, foster feminism, promote pornography, interfere with elections, and even levy taxes (a chapter is devoted to each of these topics).The best part of the book though, is the last chapter, entitled, \\"How to Stop the Judicial Supremacists.\\" This chapter alone is well worth the cost of the book. She gives 10 action steps that people can take to restore the Constitutional Republic,and curtail judges. One of the most important actions she recommends (and others are echoing this plea,) is that Congress must limit the jurisdiction of courts, which it has full power to do, under the Constitution. Another well needed remedy would be for Congress to stop funding the ACLU, and its legal war on American values. I personally was shocked to find out that my tax dollars go to fund this dangerous group of bullies.We as citizens cannot simply continue to think that the solution to judicial tyrrany lies in getting the \\"right\\" people appointed to the courts. That notion used to be applied to kings. \\"If we can only get a good king, monarchy should be supported,\\" it used to be argued. No. The genius of the Founding Fathers was that they invented a way to peaceably get rid of bad leaders. However, we have now become brainwashed into thinking we must accept Supreme Court decisions as royal edicts with no way to veto them or remove justices from their lifetime appointments. Phyllis Schlafly points out the already available means by which the out-of-control judiciary can and should be made more accountable. I hope this book inspires average citizens to become more active and restore government by the people."},{"Title":"The Supremacists: The Tyranny of Judges and How to Stop It","review":"With the looming battle over the Supreme Court confirmation, I find Phyllis Schlafly's book The Supremacists a useful tool to educate readers about the growing problem of judicial activism.Mrs. Schlafly correctly sums up the ideology of these \\"legislators in black robes\\" by quoting Supreme Court Justice William J. Brennan:\\"The Supreme Court has been, and still is, called upon to solve many of the most fundamental issues confronting our democracy, including many upon which our society, consciously or unconsciously, is most deeply divided, and that arouse the deepest emotions. Their resolution, one way or another, often rewrites our future history.\\"Mrs. Schlafly is exactly right in calling this arrogance. Schlafly illustrates that our form of government is established on a genius system of checks and balances. This means that, despite what Judge Brennan thought, no single branch of our government \\"can solve many of the most fundamental issues\\". Each branch of our government must keep the other in line.Mrs Schlafly also quotes Brennan in saying that \\"evolution of constitutional law has been, in fact, a moving consensus.\\" In saying this Brennan is trying to tell us that our Constitution changes with the culture and times. That doctrine of course defeats the very reason for having a Constitution. Schlafly makes it clear that these judges on the Supreme Court, lower federal courts, and state courts have as much duty to follow the Constitution as those elected by the people.Schlafly finishes her book by offering solutions to remedy judicial tyranny. She emphasizes the need for Congress to reign in the judicial \\"supremacist\\".I highly recommend this book to those who are concerned about this growing problem"},{"Title":"Overlanding","review":"A really good read about an extraordinary job by an ordinary bloke. The book is no nonsense and unputadownable. I highly recommend you give it a go."},{"Title":"The Pie and Pastry Bible","review":"What can I say, I am a collector of cooking books. I buy at least once a week. When I bought the Pie and Pastry Bible my baking lifestyle change. I kissed the books a hundred time. My english is limited but I still able to bake successfully. Thank you Rose. I can get rid all my cooking books and buy all your books. I just made my first time Tiramisu and I ate them all too."},{"Title":"The Pie and Pastry Bible","review":"I made the pumpkin pie recipe just by following the directions to the letter and--what a disaster. It said to bake the pie on the floor of my oven. This caused the pie to get done way too quickly, the crust started to brown too much before the custard was done, and the butter from the crust oozed onto the oven floor. The pie was overdone and the bottom crust burned black. I had bought The Cake Bible and Christmas Cookies and loved using both books with fine results, but this recipe was a mess. Just can't understand what happened. I've had a lot of baking experience (45 years or so), and I don't usually fail. Probably the other recipes are great from other readers' comments, but be careful with this one."},{"Title":"The Pie and Pastry Bible","review":"If you bake pies or tarts you have to get this book. I have never been able to make a pie crust worth eating. Following the step by step directions for her basic pie cust, I made my first (successful) apple pie and received raved reviews!I have tried at least a dozen pie dough recipes and this is by far the easiest and best-tasting. I would have given this book 5 stars if it had more color pictures of the finished product.I'm at the airport posting this review and looking forward to my long flight now that I have this book. Halfway through I simply cannot put it down. [...] Oh, gotta run or I'll miss my flight!. Highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Pie and Pastry Bible","review":"I am not a \\"serious baker\\" that you apparently need to be to enjoy this book. I just like to make pie. The crust recipes in this book are disappointing to me because it sucks all the joy out of making a pie. The first time I tried to make a crust the way the author recommends for the basic pie crust, it was such a pain that I decided never to do it that way again and stick with my grandmother's old-fashioned techniques. 1) Trying to roll out partially frozen butter is basically impossible. 2) There is no reason to put the dough in the refrigerator for 30 min - 3 hours between each step. Start with cold ingredients and then put the dough in the refrigerator before rolling it out and you minimize shrinking just as well. 3) What a waste of gallon bags and plastic wrap. 4) It was no better than my grandma's pie crust, which always comes out flaky. Grandma just knew how to \\"feel\\" the dough and make sure it has the right consistency and moisture... and that is the art that won her so many pie contests. My mother and I also substitute milk for water and add a tablespoon of sugar to give a sweeter flavor for fruit pies (this was a tip from a friend who was a baker). When reading, I got the sense that the author did not have a good teacher for making crusts, and so became overly analytical about the process in trying to figure it out herself. However, there are some good tips about the chemistry of the dough that I will take into account.That said, the filling recipes are great (though a red currant filling seems like a bad idea considering all the seeds). I made the american apple pie using a lattice top and it was the most delicious apple pie filling I've ever had (I used transparent apples, which I've never used before). I think the technique of concentrating the juices was the reason it tasted so flavorful, and I will always do it this way in the future. The apricot pie was wonderful, as well. I am planning to try all the pie recipes in this book, but I will probably find other texts for some of the other pastries because if it's anything like the pie crust, it will be too complicated and strange for me to get a feel for what is and isn't necessary without previous experience."},{"Title":"The Pie and Pastry Bible","review":"This is a wonderful book -- I just wanted to call attention to an error in the Chocolate Cream Pie recipe. The ingredients list calls for 3 cups of milk, divided. In the recipe it says to add 1/4 cup milk to one part of the recipe, and use the remaining 3 and 3/4 cups for another part. Obviously, this would equal 4 cups rather than the 3 listed in the ingredients list. We have no way of knowing which is the right amount. I am hoping the author or publisher will answer this review with a correction. In the mean time, if you want to make this pie (fabulous and easy, by the way), I split the difference, using 3 1/2 cups of milk in total, and it came out wonderfully."},{"Title":"The Pie and Pastry Bible","review":"I've been baking for more than 30 years, and I thought I did OK - as did my family. But there were a lot of answers to questions that I hadn't even known I had in the Pie and Pastry Bible, and some new techniques that really have made a difference! I'm not enthusiastic about the way the book is set up, because I have to keep flipping back and forth from the filling to the crust until I get her crust recipe memorized. There are some recipes that are quite simple, but are presented in a complicated way. However, the information is very, very complete, and there are many entertaining comments and lots of recipes for any level of training and experience. I like it - and she makes a better pie crust than I do!"},{"Title":"The Pie and Pastry Bible","review":"The crusts you make with the help of this book are magical. My husband looked at me and said this is absolutely the most wonderful thing I have ever eaten. Even the bottom crust is flaky and gives the most satisfying crispy sound as your fork dives in for one more delectable, scrumptious bite."},{"Title":"The Pie and Pastry Bible","review":"When I discovered Pillsbury readymade (pre-rolled) pie crusts in a local grocery store's cold case, I started making pies again for my pie-loving husband. THE PIE AND PASTRY BIBLE is rather famous for its great, detailed instructions on making the perfect pie crust, but I use this book for its equally great pie filling recipes.Recently I made an absolutely scrumptious blackberry pie, the \\"secret\\" being author Beranbaum's recipe that calls for a few tablespoons of lemon juice and lemon zest. She also cautioned--quite correctly--that the quality of my finished pie would depend on the quality of the blackberries used. My second blackberry pie was delicious, but not quite as scrumptious as the first, because I combined farmer's market and grocery produce department blackberries, instead of using only fresh blackberries from the farmer's market. This book has recipes for all of the classic pies (e.g., apple, berry, lemon meringue, banana cream, pumpkin, chicken pot, quiche), and for many variations and other varieties. There is, for example, a recipe for making Napoleons (one of my favorite pastries)! The author's folksy text about her early experiences, and her serious experiments, with pie making is another pleasurable \\"plus\\" factor with this book.Mine is the Kindle edition, which is quite satisfactory when viewed on a 1st Gen Kindle Fire or 8.9\\" Kindle Fire HD tablet. The 70 color photographs from the original hardcover edition are missing, but the charts and line drawings are there. (The charts are very small in a Kindle Keyboard.) To navigate, I use bookmarks at the recipes I've used, at the Table of Contents, and at the Index. The Index is very detailed, and has working page links to the indexed recipes and information.If you could have only one book of pie recipes, this one would be an excellent choice. Two other pie recipe books that I like very much in Kindle editions arePie: 300 Tried-and-True Recipes for Delicious Homemade Pie(another comprehensive reference work), andPillsbury Easy as Pie: 140 Simple Recipes(a great book with simple recipes for classic pies made with Pillsbury readymade pie crusts)."},{"Title":"The Pie and Pastry Bible","review":"Definitely a good reference book great recipes and many pointers many different types of pie shells if you're a pie maker or simply want to make your own pie shell this book will not dissapoint"},{"Title":"The Pie and Pastry Bible","review":"The Pie and Pastry Bible explains in fabulous detail how to make a wide variety of crusts and fillings. It covers wonderful things I've not seen explained elsewhere, including the first recipe I've encountered for Chocolate Croissants. This book will appeal to modernist cooks and those with an international outlook because it provides measurements in metric in addition to those in standard imperial units.The 70 page discussion of crusts at the beginning gives the reader a good picture of the level of expertise available to those who work through this book carefully. Towards the back you'll find good discussions covering ingredient-specific techniques. The too-brief photo section includes gorgeous open-faced apple and peach pies that look like roses, and novel ideas like the use of bubble wrap to produce \\"honeycomb tart.\\" I like to go light on flour, so my greatest interests were in the sections on fruit, chiffon, and custard pies. Your interests will differ.I rate cookbooks based on the number of recipes I find interesting. By the time I got one third of the way through, I'd marked more recipes than in any other cookbook I've perused. So there aren't enough stars for me to describe this no-holds-barred 674 page collection of desserts. Since I don't usually eat dessert, it's hard to imagine how long it would take me to test out more than a sample of these appealing recipes. Still, the Pie and Pastry Bible belongs on the bookshelf of every excellent dessert baker."},{"Title":"The Pie and Pastry Bible","review":"The flaky cream-cheese pie crust recipe alone is worth the price of the book. Additionally there are other excellent recipes and techniques. Everything is very clear and fail-proof. There are recipes for various types of pie, struedel, danish, and savory pastries like quiche and empanadas."},{"Title":"The Pie and Pastry Bible","review":"Good content, lousy lay out. This reads more like a newspaper than a cookbook. A tart for example, would have you flipping through various parts of the book to get the directions for the crust and the filling. Takes a lot of time to flip back and forth. Probably not too bad for those that like to research and flip back and forth. I gave it a three because the content is rock solid. But the lack of photos and the flipping through several sections of the book deducts two stars."},{"Title":"The Pie and Pastry Bible","review":"I bought this book because I loved Rose's Bread Bible and I wanted to make really good pies and pastries. Before using this book I had not had a lot of experience making pies, I had made a couple apple pies and pumpkin pies, but they were all kind of blah. Not anymore!! Even with my little experience Rose transformed me into an awesome pie baker!! After I made my first pie from the Pie Bible, people were telling me it was the best pie they had ever had in their life! Now, I have to warn you, her pies do take a while to make. In many cases it's an all day (or multiple days) affair. However, I promise you, if you diligently follow her instructions, the results will be worth it!"},{"Title":"The Pie and Pastry Bible","review":"Mme Rose's book is one of the best cooking books around! All is complete: the details are absolutely incredible and all the tips are real and effective. Plus the section \\"understanding\\" gives an extra level of comprehension on what you're doing. No wonder why she spent all these years experimenting and trying all the possible ingredient combinations.If you want to climb up to excellency in pie and pastry standards, it's the guide you need."},{"Title":"The Pie and Pastry Bible","review":"I discovered RLB when I decided to make my own wedding cake. After finding The Cake Bible, I never looked back. My guests still tell me it was the best wedding cake they ever tasted.While chatting online one day, I admitted that I wasn't very good with pastry. Someone teased me about it; I got ticked off and decided to make myself a pastry expert. Whom else would I turn to but Rose?Thanks to this book, my pies and pastries are flawless now. And do try making your own strudel using Rose's instructions; thanks to her detailed instructions, it's easier than you'd think. Once you've mastered it, your friends will love you and your enemies will fear you.To echo other reviewers, this is not a book for those who want something quick and easy, but for the cook who wants to know how and why things work. If you're willing to put in the time and effort, you will be rewarded with superior results."},{"Title":"The Pie and Pastry Bible","review":"I have been baking for many years and own tons of books. But with this one I have truly mastered some things. The pie doughs are incredible, and although the explanations are long, they can be shortened if you have some experience. I don't ever put the butter and flour in the freezer, but use ice water and very cold (from the refrigerator) butter and keep the processing to a minimum. And they turn out EXCELLENT. This is definitely a book to have even though there are some recipes that might not be exactly what you are looking for or expecting, but then I think no book will do that. And her Brioche recipe is totally worth the price of the book."},{"Title":"The Pie and Pastry Bible","review":"I just finished my first pie out of this book, and although it was quite time-consuming, it was truly delicious. The book holds so many wonderful recipes, that I can't decide on which one to try next, and with Rose's detailed instructions you just can't fail, even if you have never made a pie before. More pictures would have made this a five-star book.."},{"Title":"The Pie and Pastry Bible","review":"Ms. Beranbaum is the dessert chef's dessert chef. This is a superb book for serious home cooks and professionals. While I might not give this book to a beginner or casual cook, I would definitely recommend it to anyone interested in dessert making who wants to improve their skill level in a dramatic way."},{"Title":"The Pie and Pastry Bible","review":"I am a good cook, but I don't often make pies. I bought this book (because I have The Cake Bible by the same author and I love it) and made 2 pies from it. The second pie I made, I submitted to my company's pie-baking contest. I won first prize! If this cookbook can do that for me, it can do that for anyone willing to follow its instructions.Truly, the author gives you everything you need for success: great recipes, great instructions, and helpful explanations of WHY you are doing what you are doing."},{"Title":"The Pie and Pastry Bible","review":"The recipes are delicious, and directions are thorough, as other readers have noted. I have owned this book for several years, and have one complaint. No recipe is all on one page or even consecutive pages. Once you find what you want to make, you have to flip back to the pastry part of the recipe. Then you have to find the cooking directions for the pastry. Then you flip back to the item you want to bake. Sometimes, in the course of that recipe, it says to use a particular technique and refers to another page. I made a pecan tart with wonderful results (and many compliments), but had to find information in no fewer than four different parts of the book to accomplish this. This book is only for people who are very good readers who follow directions well and are not easily discouraged."},{"Title":"The Pie and Pastry Bible","review":"I asked for this book for Christmas. I made my first pie ever (apple pie) and it turned out perfect! I was very pleased because I didn't expect it to turn out at all since I'm an inexperienced baker. I plan to make more of the recipes. It's definitely a book worth having in your cookbook collection."},{"Title":"The Pie and Pastry Bible","review":"I learned so much from reading this book. Beranbaum not only explains every step in her recipes; she also inspires and directs you to the perfect ingredients. The many charts about quantities, pan capacities, etc. are invaluable for making many things besides pies and pastries."},{"Title":"The Pie and Pastry Bible","review":"This book is excellent. As stated in other reviews it is not for the casual baker. It is for serious people trying to perfect an art form. I have researched pastry making from pie to croissant quite seriously and this book was still able to impart very valuable insight into the details of why things work (or don't work) the way they do. I was especially relieved at the inclusion of mass measurements, which in the era of cheap digital scales, is de rigueur for any serious pastry chef (see p.656). Some people complained about the recipes not \\"working\\". I haven't tried any yet and am not going to discard my own standard pastry recipes, however the insights provided by the clear explanations are valuable to anyone. Even if you disagree with the approach, the rationale is always explained so you can make up your own mind about how you want to develop your baking. Of course, this isn't the level of sophistication normally found in a casual baker. I would say, however, that if a novice was starting out without a clue and knew in advance that they were going to be serious (opening a restaurant, let's say), this book would be a terrific place to start. I wish I had been able to read it before my first ill-fated baking experiments. Although this book is definitely broad in range, it is not absolutely comprehensive. Things I would have liked to see were a history of pastry and a discussion of various regional styles. I also haven't found a listing of all the recipes. The table of contents is very general and the index is very specific. And being English, I immediately looked for Cornish pasties which have their own peculiar issues. I did find its South American cousin, the empanada, but the explanation reveals the author is just getting familiar with this kind of dish. I didn't find any mention of boeuf en croute, although there was a wrapped meatloaf. Hopefully that helps you calibrate the level of detail you need in a book about pastry. In all the recipes looked pretty appetizing."},{"Title":"The Pie and Pastry Bible","review":"I'm a student for patisserie and cooking (in culinary arts) and I really loved this book and the author.She did a very well research on the topic, and there are a lot of options for everyone for plenty of pies - even if you dislike any of the recipes or pies alternatives. She explains a lot more know-how than our textbooks would bother.Also: you should't be scared of the scale, for it is a easy thing to handle, don't be afraid of it.Thank you Rose for all the time you spend on this book."},{"Title":"The Pie and Pastry Bible","review":"I recently acquired this book... As I love baking. It is almost overwhelmingly full of information. Almost to the point on not knowing where to begin. I think a person should sit down and take the time to dig in and read it. As I haven't had the book that long yet I can not comment on the whole thing...but I did find what I wanted...The reason I purchased it in the first place and so I am very excited to sit and read and try out some of the recipes it has to offer. It is well worth having on your shelf if you are any kind of a baker at all. If you do not want to pay retail... you certainly can find a clean 2nd hand copy as I did, and save yourself lots of money. The one that I received looked brand new with the dust jacket and all."},{"Title":"The Pie and Pastry Bible","review":"I cannot tell you how much I love this book. I received this recipe book as a gift years ago and have used it extensively ever since. This is the ONLY pie crust I use now. I use the basic butter recipe and it turns out great every time. I have gotten tons of compliments over the years on my pie crust and each time I send up a silent thank you to Beranbaum. Now don't get me wrong, this book is not for everyone. Baking is a tough art that requires much attention to detail and let's face it, TONS of practice. This book is really for someone that at least knows the basics and wants to improve upon their skills and the quality of their crust/dough. If you are just starting out, make this a book you work up to. Lots of people have complained that this \\"bible\\" doesn't have enough recipes or enough variety. To me, these people are looking for an encyclopedia of pie, not this book. To me a \\"bible\\" lays out the ground work, the basics, so that you have a good knowledge of how everything works and some good basic crust/dough recipes. Then you can go out and build upon this knowledge. If you are serious about baking, this book could really help you. If you are a whip it up in 20 minutes kind of person, this isn't really for you."},{"Title":"The Pie and Pastry Bible","review":"I am a rabid fan of Roses cake bible, heavenly cakes, the pie & pastry bible, and also her bread bible!

She obviously has devoted her life to the perfection of baking and her enthusiasm is infectiously palpable in every book she has written. The Pie and Pastry Bible is another beautiful book absolutely crammed full of tempting recipes. Just like her other books, some of the recipes in Pie and Pastry Bible are classics while others are her creations. Admittedly I have not tried to recreate the elaborate gateaux or fancy cakes in these books but all the recipes I have tried have turned out very well. So far, I have only tried the Sweet shortcrust pastry and classic American Apple Pie from the Pie and Pastry Bible but I have earmarked lots of other recipes to try. While some may find that her recipes are daunting in the level of detail and precision, I love them for exactly that reason. She demystifies the methods and ingredients of recipes in a way that I have not seen anyone else do and to my mind provides a mine of information to benefit bakers of all levels."},{"Title":"The Pie and Pastry Bible","review":"Rose does it again! I have only just begun to indulge in this book, but have found everything so far to be as expected...spectacular!

Keep up the awsome work!"},{"Title":"The Pie and Pastry Bible","review":"Just when I thought that The Cake Bible was the ultimate culinary experience, Rose Levy Beranbaum strikes again. I just bought a copy for my mother who taught me to love and bake my own pies from scratch. She lays it all out for you, step by step, and never leaves you hanging. Not only are there wonderful decadent recipies for pies of all kinds, but also for savory breads as well. How do I feel about this book? To paraphase a famous saying -- you can have my Pastry Bible when you pry it from my cold dead fingers!"},{"Title":"The Pie and Pastry Bible","review":"One hates to throw stones at something that will become beloved by many people, but this is one of those cases. The author has spent a lot of time (years in fact) testing and developing recipes for this book. All of the results are contained in this baking cookbook, in glorious and extensive detail. There is so much information, in fact, that it is difficult even for the experienced baker to wade through so much information and detail. It contains everything you could possibly want to know, and a whole lot more.If you like the Cake Bible, you will love this one about pies and pastries. It is just as complete and thorough. If you a serious home baker, you will find this cookbook indispensable. If you are a professional baker, it is an excellent resource; for example, she describes half a dozen very saleable Danish pastries from the same dough. For the rest of us, however, I must cast a disapproving eye. I doubt that the average home cook will be able to successfully pick his/her way through the material in this cookbook.Like its predecessor (for which, see) on cakes, it is extremely finicky. It contains an astonishing 75 pages just on pie and tart crusts. The procedures for the former involve an unusual process that makes the dough in a zip lock plastic bag. The recipes are so long and complete, that it is easy to get lost while following the recipes, since this involves quite a bit of jumping around in the text. Also, the layout of the ingredient table is not always clear: some recipes have multiple components, and the division between them in the ingredients' table is not always clear just by looking at them (often, you have to read the recipes to see where the divisions are). The pictures have page numbers for the matching recipes, but the recipes do not have page numbers for the matching pictures.It does have some nice touches. The ingredient lists both volume and weight, leaving not doubt as to the correct amounts. There is a brief but enlightening exposition on the similarities of puff pastry, croissant, Danish, brioche, strudel, and fillo. The chapter on Equipment has many useful tools and insights not found elsewhere.On the down side, there are a few editing mistakes: on page 204 there is a reference to page 627 (the correct page is 672), the Creamy and Spicy Crab Tartlets does not list a substitute for tobanjan, the ancho chile powder for Baked Empanadas can be bought premade, the directions for roasting bell peppers for Roasted Red Pepper and Poblano Quiche could be better, Love for Three Oranges says not to use Seville orange zest but a subsidiary recipe she calls for this exact ingredient, the instructions for slicing salmon for Coulibiac needs a diagram, the duxelle mixture for Beef Wellington probably does not require the listed 60 minutes, a proof box for Whole Wheat Croissants can be made easier by simply inverting a large cardboard box over the dough, and the chapter on Ingredients needs to be re-edited and re-organized with more titles (for example, vanilla is in the Thickeners section, but does not appear in the index, gold leaf appears under the Gelatin section and is not listed in the index either). Also, a more detailed Table of Contents would make this book a much more valuable reference. For these reasons, I recommend waiting for a second edition of this book that (hopefully) will have these mistakes corrected.Like the real Bible, it contains a mountain of information of which only a tiny portion will ever be used, but will be used extensively. If you are developing recipes for publication, or one of those people who supplies all of the pies to the county fair, then this book is for you: an extensive and reliable manual for the assembly line production of baked goods. For the average home cook, I suspect that this book is a little too much. It is, however, a welcome reference to the troublesome task of baking and pastries. They say that one can never have too much information, but in this case, I am not so sure. On the other hand, your chances of success following these recipes are very high."},{"Title":"The Pie and Pastry Bible","review":"First off: If you are a home baker that bakes sometimes and uses general cookbooks (i.e. Betty Crocker), this book is not for you. If you are someone who gets angry and frustrated over detailed instructions and is not patient enough to read a recipe throughly before beginning, this book is not for you. If you are someone who cannot pay attention to detail and is not meticulous and careful while baking, this book is not for you.This book is without a doubt, for the hardcore, highly experienced baker. As a professional baker, I find this book indispensable in my work. It's extremely detailed and thorough--just how it should be. Rose doesn't write her books for the novice baker--other writers do that.All this being said, there are some editing errors (not the fault of Rose), and everyone using this book (as well as The Cake Bible and The Bread Bible) needs to download the updated book erratas [...]With the updated corrections, the book is better than ever."},{"Title":"The Pie and Pastry Bible","review":"This is a cookbook for the perfectionist. If you like to understand exactly why things work the way they do so that you can be in control of your baking projects, then this is the book for you. If you get excited at the thought of being empowered to create pastries more delectable than the very best you have ever tasted at the finest gourmet pastry shoppes, then you owe it to yourself to get this book.If you'd rather not be bothered with too many niggling details and just want something quick that reliably comes out OK, even if you use the wrong type of flour, then stick with the Fannie Farmer Cookbook.Be warned. These recipes generally don't have much margin for sloppiness built into them, the way ones from other cookbooks do. That's why they taste so good when they are done correctly. You should read all of the background information on a topic before you start baking. Rose's backgrounders are interesting, helpful, well-written and will make you a better baker. At the absolute minimum, you must follow the recipes to the letter. No substitutions or shortcuts whatsoever can be allowed unless you've read all the background information so that you know *exactly* what you are doing.I can see only two legitimate grievances. The structure of the book is sometimes a bit scattered, which often makes it necessary to flip through to a half-dozen different places to get through a single project, and, (although this is not a concern for me) Rose makes no mention that I can see of what sort of adjustments one might make to achieve perfection at 9000 feet above sea level, and I could see how someone up in the Rockies might run into some difficulties.I can only think of one other &quot;downside&quot;: Your own baking will spoil you for anything else."},{"Title":"The Pie and Pastry Bible","review":"I'm new to pastries and have been using this book for about 6 months. It's like having a graduate course in baking and I feel it's the book to buy if you're only going to buy one. And if you're going to buy more than one, it's still the book to buy. I've noticed that some of the reviewers complain that there's too much information. Difficult for me to understand how there can be too much information if your goal is how to make great pastries. The book is complete. You don't need anything else."},{"Title":"The Pie and Pastry Bible","review":"I have used Beranbaum's &quot;The Cake Bible&quot; for several years and once I got used to the lay-out [intimidating to begin with] found it really good for special occasion cakes. So I decided to splurge on &quot;The Pie And Pastry Bible.&quot; First off, the reviewer who had trouble with the zip-lock bag technique is not alone: nobody can afford that many bags, and nobody can make ANYTHING decent in the kitchen at that level of frustration. I found the famous cream cheese crust came out dense and a bit soggy with fruit fillings, though it does work really well with Kulibiac [Coulibiac]. Mostly, though, I don't think Beranbaum's methods function as well in this book as they did in &quot;TCB&quot; - a birthday cake is an occasion in itself - I'll allow two days to make one. Apple Pie or any fruit pie is what I make for dessert while the roast is roasting or the stew is stewing. I don't want to spend half the afternoon whipping from one section to another under those circumstances. So for piecrusts I'll stick to Jacques Pepin, or Cooks' Illustrated."},{"Title":"The Pie and Pastry Bible","review":"I asked for this book for Christmas and ended up staying up all night reading it straight through like a novel (porno actually) And I had made 4 peanut butter tarts before New Years. This book will join The Cake Bible as the only book I need to maintain my reputation as a serious baker. Very detailed and sometimes time consuming recipes, but they always work, and they always meet with rave reviews! Plus its just SO PRETTY!!!"},{"Title":"The Pie and Pastry Bible","review":"I was a pie-making wannabe. I bake 6 or so a year, and couldn't ever understand why they were so inconsistent. Sometimes the crust was great. Other times, the dough would break in half as I was moving it to the pie plate. It would taste great, but I was forever patching the stuff on the bottom to eliminate the obvious problems. Decorate the edges? You must be kidding, as I rarely had edges. Too thin, too thick, whatever.When I read the first few pages of the book, RLB guarantees consistent results. Just what I wanted. And it works perfectly, even if you do take an occassional detour from the detailed instructions. 4 pies now in the last month -- every one had perfect crusts that rolled out beautifully, could be easily placed in the plate, could be manipulated easily for decoration and were yummy as all get out. Delicious beautiful and utterly professional. The best cookbook purchase I have ever made.Yes, the phrase \\"easy as pie\\" no longer exists, but my the time I made my third pie, the prep time had declined remarkably. (It's still longer than any other pie or tart recipe you've ever made, though)."},{"Title":"The Pie and Pastry Bible","review":"Rose has pie and pastry baking down to an exact science. Her recipes are very exact, they specify ingredients frequently by brand name, baking techniques, and even which bakeware to use. I find that if I follow her recipe EXACTLY, the results are spectacular. However, following her recipe exactly takes a lot of time, if you take any shortcut, or delete a setp, then the results are less than average. I recommend this book for people who want excellent results and are willing to invest a lot of time, effort, and money in their baking. Rose's instructions are very precise, so I think all levels of cooks could use this book successfully. I would not recommend this cookbook for anyone who wants to spend less than an afternoon baking a pie or pastry."},{"Title":"The Pie and Pastry Bible","review":"Whether you are a novice baker or an old hand around the oven, this cookbook will never cease to amaze. Recipes are highly detailed but do not let this intimidate you. Each step takes you carefully from preparation to plating. Ingredients are list three ways: by volume, ounce, and in grams. Not only is the appropriate bakeware to use listed but this book also shows a picture of it to remove any doubt.Beyond the recipe you'll find variations, storage information, pointers for success, and what she call's \\"understanding\\". These understanding notes may explain why an ingredient was handled in a certain way or a particular cooking technique was used. For insteance, in the recipe for \\"Peaches and Cream Tart\\" she explains that the acid in the peach juices keeps the custard from curdling at the higher than usual baking temperature.I am not a pastry maker. I don't pretend to be. With this cookbook however, I not only felt confident, I felt more knowledgeable about the subject. It felt like each recipe I tried was another lesson in the art of pastry making. Rather than just following a recipe, I gained experience that I can use in the future.This is one of those books that will definitely get filthy with repeated use. That's the greatest compliment that can be shown a cookbook and its author."},{"Title":"The Pie and Pastry Bible","review":"The cream cheese pie crust recipie alone is worth the price of admission to this book. I had never made an edible pie crust before I tried this one. Directions are explicit and step by step.The recipies for pies and tarts are wonderful. I've never had a failure using this cookbook."},{"Title":"The Pie and Pastry Bible","review":"This is a very good book with useful tips. I tried baking my pie on the floor of the oven like she suggests. The first time it turned out amazing. Every time since it has burned. Anyone have ideas why this happened? I have tried reducing the temperature and the crust comes out nice and golden but seems a little tougher to me."},{"Title":"The Pie and Pastry Bible","review":"The cookbook is very nice and the receipes are great. Pictures are appealing and the summer fruit that is being harvested right now will be used in dinner party pies and to share with coworkers."},{"Title":"The Pie and Pastry Bible","review":"I was surprised at how BIG this book is - 674 pages NOT counting the index. The recipes are well written and easy to follow with detailed instructions. I love that she gives the ingredient measurements in Volume (cups, etc.), Oz. and grams. And the hints!! Now I feel like I can tackle anything from pie crust to Napoleons to Steak and Kidney pie with confidence. I've actually spent a few hours just reading through parts of it. This book belongs on the shelf of every woman/man who has even the slightest interest in baking!"},{"Title":"The Pie and Pastry Bible","review":"This is an in depth cookbook detailing why certain steps are performed and in what particular order. If you had issues with prior pie baking experiences, this book will help you to figure out what you were doing wrong. I recommend it for anyone who really wants a comprehensive understanding of Pie and Pastry baking."},{"Title":"The Pie and Pastry Bible","review":"If you really want to know how to make great pastry/pie crust, or if you want to understand how it works, then get this book. As with her Bread and Cake Bibles, RLB does an encyclopedic job of explaing pies/pastries while sharing her enthusiasm for them. She even admits to liking pie more than cake!"},{"Title":"The Pie and Pastry Bible","review":"Doing one thing and doing it well is often better than doing many things either averagely or poorly. The Pie and Pastry Bible does one thing and it does it extremely well. Rose Levy Beranbaum breaks down all the secrets to making pie and pastry as well as many variations. Too many cookbooks are pretty but not really informative. This one is not one of those, it will get constant use over the years in my kitchen. I know this because it will take me a long time to work through all the recipes. It will be worth it though."},{"Title":"The Pie and Pastry Bible","review":"This book will be of extreme good use by new cooks and revered by old cooks with excellent instruction and upper crust receipes!"},{"Title":"The Pie and Pastry Bible","review":"Last week I recive the Pie and Pastry Bible and I've already try out three recipes with good result. The children absolutly loves the Peanutbutter mousse pie and me and my husband hacve the pear and ginger cake as a new favourite."},{"Title":"The Pie and Pastry Bible","review":"This book has answered many questions I have had regarding which crust to use with which type of filling. I have already tried several of the recipes and they have all been hits!"},{"Title":"The Pie and Pastry Bible","review":"This really is a glorious book, a must-have for any serious baker. Her cream cheese crust is unparalleled in my experience for achieving the perfect flaky texture of a pie crust. And the chocolate-peanut butter tart has quickly become a family favorite. Detailed recipes are a great help for the relative novices out there. For the more experienced cook, you can easily incorporate many of her ideas and tips without taking too much extra time. And I've been known to take a few shortcuts too, still with excellent results.It's quite helpful how she provides ingredients by weight or measure, something that's rare for an American cookbook. And her tips on understanding what's happening &quot;behind the scenes&quot; of the recipe appeal to the amateur chemist in me.I also own the Cake Bible by Beranbaum and, while it is the cookbok that won awards, I far prefer the Pie and Pastry Bible. The recipes suit my taste better and are much more likely to elicit the &quot;oohs&quot; and &quot;aahs&quot; that good cooks love to hear."},{"Title":"The Pie and Pastry Bible","review":"I've had this book for over a year and I must say that as time goes by, I am less and less impressed with this book. I have no problem following instructions yet it took me three tries to get some of these recipes to turn out. I never got her sweet nut crust to work. I used the recipe from &quot;In the Sweet Kitchen&quot; instead and the crust came out perfect.And some of the recipes are not nearly as imressive as they look. The only recipe that I've made that received any &quot;wows&quot; from my guests was the tiramisu tart, and that wasn't until the third time I made it when I made significant changes to the recipe. A few of the recipes were huge disappointments.I would highly recommend &quot;In the Sweet Kitchen&quot; or the Cindy Mushet book instead."},{"Title":"The Pie and Pastry Bible","review":"This is a great book to learn from. If you are going to take the trouble to make your own pie crust, why not learn to make the best possible one right off the bat? Take the time to learn it correctly, and it will become easier and easier with each one you make. Eventually, the book can be left on the shelf. Pie is my absolute favorite dessert in the entire world, but it can be my least favorite if it is not made well (as is often the case in the U.S. I am sorry to say). I watched my husband eat most of a cherry pie that I made last night from the season's first cherries with a certain joy I had never seen him express when eating pies that I made from online recipes or simple cookbooks. The details in this cookbook for chilling the dough, not overhandling, and using the best ingredients were great. The pictures in the book are also very inspiring. Thanks to the author!"},{"Title":"The Pie and Pastry Bible","review":"First of all, this is NOT a book for those wanting to make something up quick. If you want a quick and easy dessert, go somewhere else. If you enjoy the process of baking and (even more so) the pleasure of eating homemade goods, this book is for you.The piecrusts (as other reviewers have noted) are not the easiest. But, they do come out very well. It is possible to use the freezer bags as noted (only one is necessary per piecrust recipe). On the crusts, I recommend using the food processor method. Also, I noticed that it takes a lot less time to bake the crusts than the time recommended in the book. I have never had them become soggy either. Brushing on the egg white after you bake them helps to prevent that.As for the time-consuming quality of the recipes, be prepared to spend a long time on any one of these. On the Strawberry Lover's Chiffon Pie (my first pie ever to bake and the first from this book), I spent around 9 hours over a two-day period. I just made the Apple Crumb Pie, and it took probably five hours though a lot of that was dead time (i.e., baking or chilling times when I could be doing something else). Before making any of these recipes, carefully read the instructions to get an idea of how long they take.And, the photography is excellent. It makes you want to make every single one in the book. The Pumpkin Pie and Honeycomb Chiffon Pie are coming up next (that is, after some recipes in her Cake Bible).The recipes are meticulously detailed. If you follow them EXACTLY, you should get good results. If you take shortcuts or decide that something isn't necessary, you'll get less than perfect results.The recipes range from traditional favorites like cherry and apple pies to more exotic pies (like the Honeycomb Chiffon pie and Tiramisu). Recipes for savory pies (like Shepherd's Pie and Chicken Pot Pie) are also included.This is my second favorite cookbook after Rose's The Cake Bible."},{"Title":"The Pie and Pastry Bible","review":"Every time I use this book I look at my wife, shake my head in wonder, and say simply, &quot;Rose knows.&quot; Her attention to detail is unsurpassed, and her instructions are clear. The book has many great recipes, although not quite as lavish or sophisticated as some books, but plenty impressive by my guests' standards. Her explanation of chemistry and technique is top notch.This is one book -- the other is her Cake Bible -- that can truly call itself a bible."},{"Title":"The Pie and Pastry Bible","review":"I have used this book on several special occassions. I don't even have to do a trial run before I present the final dessert, because I am confident that every recipe in this book will turn out just as promised. Easy to follow instructions, and ingredients that you find at your local grocery store---what could be better! By using Rose's recipe book, I have become the automatic dessert maker in my family....especially when it comes to pies."},{"Title":"The Pie and Pastry Bible","review":"Rose Levy Beranbaum uses her knowledge as a food scientist to perfect the art of baking. It helps you understand the methods behind baking and how to manipulate them to create amazing pastries. This book is as essential as The Cake Bible only better because she covers more ground with this book- everything from pate a choux to basic pie dough."},{"Title":"The Pie and Pastry Bible","review":"The recipe instructions are inconsistent and ridiculously overcomplicated. &quot;Great&quot; pumpkin pie, for example. The instructions say to bake the pie directly on the oven floor. If you have a gas oven that heats from the bottom, you are getting nothing but a burnt pie (thanks for a Thanksgiving failure, Rose). Designer Apple Pie is nice, the trick of boiling down the apple juices is slick. But the cream cheese crust? I've had better results from the Joy of Cooking recipes. Her recipes are too fragile to be reproduced consistently. If you are off by a degree in the oven, or off by a minute in the timing, forget it, your pie is ruined. Other pie recipes are less sensitive. Working with her crust recipes is like walking on eggshells.I've been making pies for 20 years. I can't say the details that make Berenbaum's recipes so complicated make her pies much better than ones I've made in the past from other cookbooks. Very disappointing."},{"Title":"The Pie and Pastry Bible","review":"As a formally trained &amp; accomplished baker and long time fan of The Cake Bible, I love Rose's latest publication. I have baked many of these recipes and all have been wonderful. I love making pies just to try new recipes (and now have many new friends to help me eat them). Thank you Rose for my ever widening hips!"},{"Title":"The Pie and Pastry Bible","review":"Having heard Rose speak on Public Radio about the value in baking homemade pie for family and guests, I had to order the book if only to have the Flaky Cream-Cheese Pie Crust recipe, which Rose said, &quot;...is the soul of this book.&quot; I was impressed when I heard her say she'd tried the recipe 50 times to get it exactly, scientifically right. I am happy to report I tried the cream cheese crust, open-faced fresh blueberry pie yesterday, and it was worth every puttering step. Absolutely great! It looked just like the wonderful color photo provided in the book and tasted fabulous. Rose's book answers every possible question a baker could have about ingredients, storage, problems, you-name-it! What could be a lost art for those of us who grew up with European-born, stay-at-home expert baker moms, Rose's book is indispensable. The mystery and science of my childhood's translucent apple strudel dough is included in this great book. She's translated pinch-of-this, handful of that into very exact weights, measures, and procedures for any kind of putsy pastry, but DOES offer her recommendations for brand mixes for when you're in a hurry."},{"Title":"The Pie and Pastry Bible","review":"This is a terrific cookbook for a seasoned cook with a lot of time for preparation-intensive, step-intensive recipes. The few items that are photographed are beautiful and true to the recipe. There is excellent information on the &quot;science&quot; and &quot;technology&quot; of pastry making that is really useful. The storage information and resources for difficult to find ingredients is also great to have. The recipes are quite detailed and I really appreciate the fact that she offers ingredients by measurement and weight, as I much prefer cooking with a scale. However, the first two recipes I tried had errors--one SERIOUS measurement error (the Chocolate Cream Pie recipe), and the other two are errors in steps or in referring to an incorrect recipe as part of the main recipe (Lime, Kiwi, Blueberry Tart). The Creme Anglaise recipe appears to be egg-yolk heavy (especially compared to other tested recipes) and may or may not be an error. Needless to say, I was less than thrilled to have to figure out what SHOULD have been printed in the recipe, while I was scrambling to get them finished in time for a party. I now know to try these recipes waaay in advance of actually needing to make them! This is definitely NOT a cookbook for someone who is in a hurry...many of the steps for normally simple recipes are quite complex and tedious. If, however, your goal is to really shine--many of the desserts in this book are incredibly impressive, and all have been delicious. The Lime Curd used as a base for the Lime, Kiwi, Blueberry tart was so good by itself that I had to make a second batch for the tart!"},{"Title":"The Pie and Pastry Bible","review":"Good recipes, easy to follow instructions but just a few pictures. I think that an author as famous as Rose Levy should spend a little more in pictures."},{"Title":"The Pie and Pastry Bible","review":"This is clearly a very thoroughly-written book on a subject that is often intimidating to American cooks. It will be an essential addition to any serious baker's collection, but I wonder if it will be approachable by the average cook. The recipes can be very lengthy, with little picky steps that could be side-stepped by someone with a bit more familiarity with technique. However, her pie pastry is incredible, and though challenging, is well worth the effort. Everything I have made from this book has received high praise from my guests, too. Just don't plan to whip something up from this book."},{"Title":"The Pie and Pastry Bible","review":"She is a master of baking. Have tried several recipes...turned out great. With the beautiful photos, I plan to be baking for a long time!"},{"Title":"The Pie and Pastry Bible","review":"I've had this book since year nought. But I have never made anything from it. Having said that I currently have cubed butter and a flour mixture in the freezer. My first stab at making pie from this tome. Obviously my rating of 2 stars does not reflect the quality of the recipes. It's reserved for the wonderful folks at Scribner. I think Ms Beranbaum might be the world's most gifted cake/pie/bread maker but she certainly needs a bit of help when it comes to picking a publisher. My 'Cake Bible' fell apart very quickly as the pages couldn't wait to detach themselves from the feeble spine. This has not happened to my pie bible coz as I said, I've never used it. The sections are not very well organized and having to refer back and forth is annoying. A couple of those built-in bookmarks (like the Gourmet cookbook) would have been so helpful. Anyway, I can go on all day but other reviewers have beaten me to it."},{"Title":"The Pie and Pastry Bible","review":"I bought this book because it was referred as being a breat book on pies - I needed to make a great chocholate torte. But, the book does not have a chocholate torte so having the book, I tried other recipes like the Apple Pie and the &quot;Grand Canyon Pie&quot;. I made several mistakes and as a software engineer who is quite capable of following instructions, I found this a miserable book for instruction but a great book in terms of a glossary. There are not enough pictures in the book - I like to see what the author is trying to convey - take the &quot;Grand Canyon&quot; for example - wouldn't this be a great pie to have a picture of ? No, the author does not describe or show how it all comes together - even though its probably a great looking pie.If you like chocolate, or lots of pics, skip this book. I agree with other reviewers on less than positive reviews. If I had as much talent as the author, I would have done much better on the book - for example, tell the reader what is needed before starting and show details (drawings if you don't have a digital camera) of what you are trying to convey - pie and pastry making is 95% visual and the author does not go into great detail here. She falls (no pun) where ALL authors of baking fall (because they are not great writers I guess) - in that they don't put themselves in the readers shoes, i.e. &quot;I never made this before - so I hope to see an example&quot; shoes of the reader and assume that we know what comes next. I expected a book I guess as a bible (as other bibles demonstrate) to show me everything about pies I buy in fancy restaurants but I did not find this to be the case. Not even a receipe on a chocolate rasbery torte, shame on the Author."},{"Title":"The Pie and Pastry Bible","review":"After reading just a couple of her receipies, I discovered this book is not for the faint at heart when it comes to baking. Although when I watched her on an early morning program, I gathered there was a more balanced experience of receipies. Her citation of types of flour is simply more information that I was interesting in having and boardered on what one might call flour snobbery. So far, the only method I have regularly incorporated in my pastry baking is her reference to chilling. So as all is not down the pastry funnel, I will pick and choose a few more receipies now and then to try."},{"Title":"The Pie and Pastry Bible","review":"i love this book and i get very fast from seller after i have been order"},{"Title":"The Pie and Pastry Bible","review":"This book has some good baking TIPS, but many of the recipes simply do not work. I'm a fairly experienced baker and don't seem to have this kind of trouble with other books."},{"Title":"The Pie and Pastry Bible","review":"The book is good. The crust instructions are great. The author recommends 2 tbsp of starch for berries pies. I made four blackberry pies with two and more tbsp of starch, and it was still runny, fool of juices on the botton, doesn't matter how long you bake. There is no way it would work. I was dissapointed until found blackberry pie recipe on allrecipes.com with only 4 reviews, and it was the best berry pie I ever had. Add 3 to 4 Tbsps of tapioca instead to all her recipes. Also she recommends to add 2 tsp of lemon zest. I add a pich, and it was very much enough. The author says that she tried most of her recipes fo up to 50 times. In other words: it is not a bible at all, take it as a bse and experiment yourself. Otherwise it has many interesting recipes, will try."},{"Title":"The Pie and Pastry Bible","review":"Don't waste your money on the Rose Levy Beranbaum Pie and Cake Bibles. She unnecessarily complicates the recipes, and the instructions are not easy to understand. After hours of pains taking effort, the results are quite often NOT GOOD at all. I'm a very experienced cook, and have been disappointed each time I ventured into one of her lengthy and obtuse culinary ordeals."},{"Title":"The Pie and Pastry Bible","review":"...put this book on your shopping list, but then LEAVE it there for a while, get yourself a more pedestrian introduction, and practice for a while before presuming you are ready for this tome.I recently thought to teach myself pastry-making from scratch using this book. Mistake! Halfway through another night of carefully cutting unsalted butter into &quot; cubes, wrapping them individually in plastic wrap, putting 2/3rd of them in the fridge and the rest in the freezer, all the while muttering &quot;Ours is not to reason why...&quot;, Ms. Beranbaum's lovely photo on the back cover got decorated with a short moustache that makes her look a little like .. eh ... let's be polite and say &quot;Charlie Chaplain.&quot;I'll leave it to others to sing this book's well-deserved praises. If you just want to get dinner on the table, it is not for you. I recently spent eight hours over three nights making her chicken pot pies. The result? My wife fainted clean away, and my teenager actually lifted her head out of her plate and pronounced (as close as I can approximate): &quot;Snumpf!&quot; A month later, my wife still gets a bit wobbly when she thinks of those pies, but I mostly remember the two nights of fish sticks that preceded them. It is not really fair to judge this book harshly because it didn't suit my purposes at the time, but there are some other real problems with it. Most glaring are the mistakes. In a book as PRECISE as this one, the many mistakes really should have been weeded out before publishing. I've only made 5 recipes so far, but 3 of them had mistakes ranging from &quot;orphan&quot; ingredients to nonsensical instructions.The biggest disappointment is the dearth of savoury recipes. Completely lacking a sweet tooth, 90% of the book is of no interest to me. Yes, it is an American book, but anything calling itself a Bible should be more inclusive. Where is that glory of British cuisine (oh pipe down, you bloody Colonials...), Grosvenor Pie?Enough badmouthing, though. When my nest empties in a few years, I'll delight in taking a whole weekend to explore a recipe or two (hopefully using a new, error-free edition), and in the meantime, I now at least COMPLETELY understand what I was doing with those cubes of butter."},{"Title":"The Pie and Pastry Bible","review":"I should start off by saying that this cookbook is not for someone who wants to throw together a pie quickly. This cookbook has recipes that take a little work, but are definitely worth the effort! This book is entitled \\"The Pie and Pastry Bible\\" for a reason - it is a bible for spectacular desserts that taste like they came from a pastry chef. I've had plenty of pies from bakeries that haven't tasted nearly as good as the ones in this book.Most of us have probably eaten pies where the crust was just functional - meant to hold the filling in, but really tasteless. How about pie crusts that could stand on their own without the filling? The crusts in this cookbook are that delicious! They may take a little effort, but the results are spectacular.This cookbook is a wonderful source of recipes if you really want to impress someone. You will be amazed to discover that you, too, can make terrific pastries. Rose's directions will walk you through it step-by-step.Bottom line - I absolutely love this cookbook, but I admit it may not be for everyone. However, if you are a serious baker, this one should definitely be on your shelf!"},{"Title":"The Pie and Pastry Bible","review":"I have devoured this book ---- I have truly enjoyed reading it. If you enjoy the&quot; Why&quot; behind baking you will love this book. This is an excellent reference. Better yet, I got raves on the cherry pie that I made. I'm buying her book on cakes and cookies TODAY!"},{"Title":"The Pie and Pastry Bible","review":"I can always rely on Rose! I have read the book and made many of the recipes. The cream cheese crust is the best--tender and flaky. My husband doesn't like blueberry pie, but he thinks the open-face blueberry pie is outstanding: it combines both cooked and fresh blueberries. The double strawberry pie with a layer of cream cheese mixture is also A. Passion fruit ice cream is incredible, but you must get the puree from the sources section. However, I wasn't thrilled with the crumble topping she suggests as an alternative to a top crust. And, as with all fruit pies, they're only as good as the fruit you put in them. She recommends the Lindt Excellence bittersweet chocolate for various recipes (peanut butter tart, brownie puddle) but I find that Americans seem to like a milder chocolate flavor. Lindt is great, but I wouldn't use the super bittersweet chocolates. If you want rave reviews, and you can spend 2 days on a pie, this is the book for you! Next I'm trying Concord Grape Pie with Peanut Butter ice cream!"},{"Title":"The Pie and Pastry Bible","review":"It's simply amazing! The recipes here never fail! I recomend this book to everyone, but remember:patient is everything.If you are the kind of person that not use to follow each detail that the recipe calls for, go to the supermarket and buy something frozen."},{"Title":"The Pie and Pastry Bible","review":"Crust: Whether you like a butter, shortning, cream cheese or combination crust is undoubtedly a matter of personal taste. (Except that the author clearly has it out for shortening crusts which I have always found to be delicious). This book touts, and relies heavily on, a cream cheese crust. Although it rolls out quite nicely, I don't really like the taste of it. That may be because vinegar is one of the ingredients, and I always end up tasting a hint of it in the crust. Maybe its just my tastebuds. However, I would not buy this book for the crust recipes as many of them also contain vinegar and, again, I can always taste a hint of it. I make plenty of pies, and there are crust recipes out there that don't require the amount of time and preparation these do with equal or better results in many cases. But I am always willing to try a new one! If you like a butter crust and don't mind an unusual method of preparation try searching \\"One Pie Crust to Rule Them All\\", which I recently found and tried with good results.Pie Filings: The actual fillings have been delicious! There are some real keepers in the bunch, and many more I have yet to try. The Lemon tart with blueberry topping is outstanding and my hands down favorite! The apple \\"rose\\" tart is beautiful and really not very hard to do - but oh, so impressive to present!I like this book for the actual pie filling recipes, but I have turned to other recipes for my crust. I gave it 3 stars because the crust is, in my opinion, the heart of the pie - and to be a great pie book, the crust recipes should be fabulous too."},{"Title":"The Pie and Pastry Bible","review":"First off i love rosie she is the best...i have all her cookbooks and they truely are my bibles for cooking and baking...I use the Pie and Pastry cookbook all the time ..And everyone loves my pies and the butter pie crust is to dye for...I have maded alot of the pies and they all have come out great .....so if you are looking for the prefect pies and crust this is your book..."},{"Title":"The Pie and Pastry Bible","review":"The Pie and Pastry Bible by Rose Levy Beranbaum is one of my favorite cookbooks. It's definitely the one I use the most, as is obvious from my version's dog eared and splattered pages. This book contains a section on crusts from which I learned to make excellent crusts.

Every one I have showed it to has ordered it. If want to know everything there is to know about pies and pastries, then you have found the ultimate! GREAT"},{"Title":"The Pie and Pastry Bible","review":"I have only just discovered &quot;reader reviews&quot; and want to thank you all from the bottom of my heart for the wonderful thoughts you have shared about my work. I also want to address the people who are having trouble with one of my all time favorites--the lemon meringue pie. There is no mistake in this recipe. More yolks result in a thicker filling not a thinner one UNLESS they are not brought to a temperature of over 160 degrees fahrenheit to destroy the amylase--an enzyme which will, within hours, thin out the filling. Since the rest of the filling is boiling hot when contacting the yolks, this should ensure that the yolks get heated adequately but evidentally in some cases this must not be so. Perhaps the yolks were cold from the refrigerator. SOLUTION: As a safeguard, after adding the yolks, bring the mixture back to a boil. I promise it will not thin out if you do this! The cornstarch in the mixture will protect the yolks from curdling so don't be afraid. It's too good a pie to miss! All the best, Rose Levy Beranbaum"},{"Title":"The Pie and Pastry Bible","review":"When I heard that Rose Levy Beranbaum was coming out with a new cookbook, I was very excited. The author of the Cake Bible and Rose's Christmas Cookies, she is known for her excellent recipes and very detailed instructions. Her new book, The Pie and Pastry Bible is no exception. The book contains not only 315 delectable recipes for pies,tarts, quiches and pastries but also has sections on techniques, ingredients,and equipment. She extensively covers these topics explaining, for example,how to make the perfect pie crust by giving step-by-step instructions on how to blend and measure flours, roll, cut, shape and bake the crust. In every recipe, if you follow her instructions to the letter, a three star dessert will be your reward.In reviewing The Pie and Pastry Bible I made the Lemon Pucker Pie, Brownie Puddle, Great Pumpkin Pie, and the Open Faced Designer Apple Pie. Every recipe turned out and tasted wonderful. It is obvious that Rose Levy Berenbaum has tested every recipe to ensure perfect results. This book however, is for the professional or serious baker. To go through this amount of trouble to make something, you must really know and appreciate quality. This is not the sort of book you buy if you want to make something quickly as it could easily frustrate the novice baker. For example, making the apple pie involves many steps. The apples are first cut, mixed with ingredients, macerated for 30 minutes to 3 hours, and then placed in a colander to drain. The liquid is reduced and then re-added to the cut apples with cornstarch. This does result in a wonderful apple flavor, but is it worth the effort? When I weigh the extra time and effort involved, I would rather sacrifice a little taste and make it the old-fashioned easier way. Rose Levy Beranbaum has aimed for perfection and this takes a lot of time and much effort. This is a great book for the serious baker who wants to make perfect pies and pastries and understand the science behind it. The recipes are given in both volume and weight, which I appreciate. She gives storing instructions for every recipe and pointers for success. At a list price of $35.00 it is a great textbook."},{"Title":"The Pie and Pastry Bible","review":"As someone who had tried various pie-crust recipes over the years and never gotten it quite right, reading Berenbaum's aptly named bible was a revelation. The complex and rather unorthodox techniques for cutting in fat into the flour had me skeptical at first but, having tried several of the various crust recipes in this book, I will never make a crust the easy old way again. If you want to make consistently perfect, by which I mean delectably tender and flaky, crust, this book is for you. The cream-cheese crust that Berenbaum calls the soul of her book is alone worth the price of the book.In addition, there's the fool-proof technique for ensuring an apple pie in which the juices cling just so to the apple slices yet puddle just a little on the plate -- no more runny apple pies. The multi-step technique, which involves macerating the apple slices, draining the liquid that forms, and boiling down the liquid to a syrup before baking, is time-consuming, but the results are worth it. I tried the apple pie recipe, and my husband rated it a 10! I am one reader who will never again simply toss the apple slices in sugar and bake, on the off-chance that the liquids might (or might not) reduce enough during baking.The book is invaluable also for the understanding it gives the reader of how the various ingredients in pie crust work, e.g., why the addition of baking powder to pie crust is a must for flakiness, why the crust dough needs to be kneaded harder and longer to make it strong enough to wrap around a meat loaf or the filling of a turnover, etc.I could go on and on about the merits of this book. Although I wish no one else would read it so that I could be the only person in the world (besides the author) who can make marvelous crust, I cannot help thinking this is a book that should not be kept a secret."},{"Title":"The Pie and Pastry Bible","review":"I hate to be a party pooper, but as much as one hopes to love this book, it was just too poorly written and edited. It has many terrific ideas for someone who has baked pies before, but for a newcomer like myself, the defects are pretty glaring. I bought the book because I love \\"The Cake Bible\\". But this time, the editor went to press before finishing her work, and I bet she's responsible for wasting many thousands of hours of her readers' time, considering how popular this book is.In order to make crust using this book, you have to flip back and forth between many sections: the dough recipe, the rolling instructions, the laying out of the dough, and the baking are all in different places, in the wrong order, and not clearly labeled. I can see why this happened, because the rolling and baking are similar for different dough recipes, and she didn't want to repeat the same instructions over and over. But at least the sections should have been in order! Additional stories and comments are intermixed with the instructions, which makes it hard to follow the instructions once you find them. Different dimensions are given in different places for the size of the rolled dough you need. Sections headings are not consistently formatted--sometimes a new subsection is in the same style as the heading that started the section.I'm a professional scientist and university professor, and I love to cook. I don't think I have any special impairment following instructions. The other reviewers who liked this book surely had the same experience, unless they knew ahead of time what they were doing, so I say to them: stop recommending this book so highly, except to experienced pie and tart bakers!For making pastry the first time, I would use \\"The Way to Cook\\" by Julia Child instead, which manages to give all of the necessary instructions very clearly, in the correct order, in about two pages. Then buy Beranbaum's book and read it at leisure if you want inspiration and expert knowledge, and you don't mind an error here or there.I hope there will be an easier-to-use second edition of this book. The tart I made was truly delicious, but the process made me angry. I'm guessing that the author or editor or publisher decided their deadline was more important than a final week of editing. What a shame."},{"Title":"The Pie and Pastry Bible","review":"Now this is what folks mean when they talk about a definitive book. I will never have to purchase another pie and pastry how-to. This book covers it all with a depth that satisfies all questions. If you love Alton Brown and judiciously read all of the Cooks Illustrated background testing info, this book is for you. I am so happy with this book that I am not just looking up specific recipes, I am literally reading it as if it were a novel. (I am a curious cook.)For the novice pie and pastry baker, you may think this will be too overwhelming for you. I think this is written in such a way that you will \\"get it\\" and thus start out making things correctly. For the experienced, this book is a problem solver and is the road to perfection.This book contains more than 300 recipes. There are more than 15 recipes for pie crusts plus variations. With that said, obviously not every pie under the sun is here, but there is enough information for you to make improvements on any recipe that is not covered.This book is so close to perfect, I gave it five stars. However, I do have some criticisms. First, this book needs to better catalog the recipes. The table of contents lists simply the chapters, such as fruit pies, tarts, custard pies etc. The chapters delve into the subject without listing the recipes. I would prefer that each chapter had a mini table of contents that listed individual recipes.My second criticism is the altering of classic recipes to suit her personal tastes. I realize this is completely subjective, but if she were a Southerner, I wouldn't have to continue to hunt for recipes for chess pie and coconut custard pie. This is the same criticism I had of the Cook's Illustrated baking volume too. However, we're talking about two or three recipes in each book that I don't agree with, so the books were still worth the purchase.Speaking of Cook's Illustrated, if I had to choose between this book and Baking Illustrated, I would go with this book. If both are an option for you, get both. Cook's does a good job of balancing flavor with speed. The bible series seems to be all about flavor with little regard to speed.My last criticism is a minor one and I realize it is as subjective as the author's taste when writing the recipes; I find the language and recipe structure awkward at times. I think the Williams-Sononma Collection, while not the most exhaustive collection of recipes, is the best example of recipe writing.I wanted to make pie crust from scratch for Thanksgiving, so I paid rush shipping charges to get this book here and it is worth the expense. I made a test basic flaky pie crust and it came out perfectly.[....]"},{"Title":"The Pie and Pastry Bible","review":"While I have found Rose Levy Beranbaum's other major tome &quot;The Cake Bible&quot; a source of nearly unending frustration, &quot;The Pie and Pastry Bible&quot; is a triumph. I can think of no other pastry book that comes close in either breadth or depth. Every pastry topic is covered in detail, and most recipes work as advertised, at least in experienced hands. Like the author's other books, everything is spelled out in glorious detail, and ingredient measures are given in both weight and volume. Most important, the formulations seem battle-tested, and I approach them with far more confidence than the recipes in &quot;The Cake Bible.&quot;The pie crust recipes are outstanding, and I like the fact that the finished pies are designed to slip out of the pan so you can serve them from a cutting board. The fruit pies are innovative and an extensive table takes the guesswork out of adding starch thickeners. The puff pastry, croissant, and Danish formulas work as advertised, and they produce a final product that simply cannot be bought. [Note: The King Arthur Green Mountain Gold flour recommended for the croissants is no longer available.] The food processor-based cream puff pastry is a wonderful improvement on the classic. Of course, there are a couple of clinkers (I wouldn't make the Buttermilk Chess Pie again), but my batting average with these recipes is higher than usual.As other reviewers have noted, potential buyers should be aware that this is not a book for beginners. Pastries are among the most demanding of kitchen products to begin with, and the recipes in this book are often complex. As the author herself points out, pastry is a matter of technique. It's far easier for someone to show you how to make puff pastry than it is for a book to adequately describe it to you. In addition, yeast pastries, like croissants and Danish, take a more advanced kitchen than that required for other baked goods. Heat and humidity are principle players -- not just the ambient weather, but the fact that one moment you need a cool spot with low humidity to roll dough, and the next you need a warm spot with high humidity to rise it. That's not an easy combination to achieve in the average home kitchen.Add to these inherent difficulties the author's willingness to espouse any technique and ingredient that will enhance the product, and the result is a collection of recipes that are often challenging, even to the well initiated. Simpler pastry recipes can certainly be found, but my experience is that something is usually lost in the process. Therefore, I recommend this book highly, but with qualifications. Experienced bakers will profit, but beginners could well find these recipes, and the kitchen requirements for following them, maddeningly complex."},{"Title":"The Pie and Pastry Bible","review":"This book can be great but only if you have a lot of time to invest in making a pie or tart. And, while Rose does do a masterful job of teaching the fine art of pastry making (and it is an art!) I think complete novices would be better off making do with a simpler book for awhile. But for those really serious about pastries and pies this book can be terrific. There are many recipes for different kinds of pastries as well as many different kinds of pie fillings. The directions are detailed and the illustrations mouth-watering. I enjoy it more than The Cake Bible because I don't find the recipes quite so exotic and so am able to use more of them, more often. Just be prepared to spend the entire afternoon or evening making one pie. On the plus side, if you follow Rose's directions, the time will certainly be time well spent."},{"Title":"The Pie and Pastry Bible","review":"One would expect such an authoritative volume on baking to come from a chunky Frenchman with a very tall toque and an accent you can cut with a pastry knife, not from the ever so sweet and coy face smiling at you from the back of the dust jacket of this very large book on a very serious subject. But, this book from this author should be no surprise at all, as it is the middle volume on a trilogy that does for baking what Tolkein did for epic fantasy in \`Lord of the Rings'.Before I even start to talk about the virtues of the book, just consider the difference in content you are receiving from Rose Levy Beranbaum's three books when compared to Ina Garten's three cookbooks. For a 30% addition to the price, Beranbaum is giving you approximately 300% more information. Another comparison is to compare Beranbaum's 2000 pages with the very authoritative sounding \`King Arthur Flour Baker's Companion' weighing in at a mere 607 pages. That is just to put these works in perspective.To most newbies, cooking may seem relatively easy, but one glimpse at what you need to make a decent pie crust has most novices running to the megamart refrigerated cases for those premade Pillsbury pie crusts. First, you have to pick the right ingredients. Can I use all-purpose flour or should I use pastry flour. Can I use King Arthur or should I use White Lily? Should I use butter or vegetable shortening or lard? Should I add vinegar or not? Should I add an egg yolk or not? Then, you have to be concerned about the weather. Is the barometer rising or falling? Is the air humid or dry? Then comes the technique. Do I use a pastry cutter or do I use my hands? How long do I work the flour and fat before adding the liquid? How much do I work it after adding the liquid? How long do I rest it before rolling it out? How do I lay the crust in the pan to avoid shrinking? What kind of pan do I use to bake the pie? Do I blind bake the crust for this pie? How long do I bake? What do I look for to know the bottom crust is done?I'm exaggerating a little because many of these variables are usually well enough in control that they don't ruin a pie. But, every variable offers a way for things to go wrong. Now, millions of people, myself included, have successfully made good pie crusts without having read Ms. Beranbaum's book, but millions of people, myself included, have made pie crusts which just didn't make the grade. Rose Levy Beranbaum tells you why, and gives you all the information you need to avoid each and every problem.One of the very few problems I find with Ms. Beranbaum's work is that there is so much information, it is difficult to whip out a simple recipe or find the solution to a simple problem without literally studying the information for some time. But, the only thing that means is that this book, however good, may not be for everyone. For the casual baker of pies, I strongly recommend Wayne Harley Brachman's \`American Desserts'.Ms. Beranbaum's book is for the serious baker and for people who really like to read about baking in order to troll for ideas and projects. The depth of information exceeds virtually every other work I have seen so far. Where other books give you measurements by both weight and volume, Ms. Beranbaum gives you measurements in both Metric and English system units. Where others recommend a fat to use, Ms. Beranbaum explains why the fat of choice should be used and how to make intelligent substitutions with various kinds of ingredients. While I have not yet read Shirley Corriher's book \`Cookwise', Rose gives me the same kind of intimate knowledge of my ingredients and techniques as I would expect from Shirley. Rose even quotes Shirley's recipe for Southern biscuits as the model recipe for same.Speaking of biscuits, if I were to write a tutorial on pastry making, I would probably start with biscuits. As Beranbaum points out, the techniques and results when making biscuits stand you almost exactly halfway between pastry crusts and cake making. I would add that it also puts you very close to the bread baking world, with a product where the time between cracking open the flour canister and pulling the finished product out of the oven can be less than 30 minutes. This makes biscuit baking a perfect intro. to baking in general. Needless to say, Ms. Beranbaum covers biscuits with her usual thoroughness.I would very strongly recommend this and all of Ms. Beranbaum's books on baking as a perfect second book on their respective subjects. As a first book, get \`Baking with Julia' and follow the directions with the diligence of a Viennese pastry master. Very highly recommend to those in love with baking. How can you possibly resist so sweet a smile on Ms. Beranbaum's face as she kneads her dough on the dust jacket?"},{"Title":"The Pie and Pastry Bible","review":"Like The Cake Bible, this is a very detailed, incredibly researched book. Ms Berenbaum tolerates nothing short of perfection. If you're interested in EXACTLY how to make the perfect pie crust or puff pastry, this is for you. If you find analyses of Heckers flour vs King Arthur mind-numbing, you might want to pass it up and go back to the baking chapter of The Joy of Cooking.Although it's geared towards the more serious baker, it's useful for novices too, as the instructions are very detailed and she goes to great lengths to explain why she does everything she does (this is good for bakers of all abilities, because some of her techniques are nontraditional).Many of the recipes are time consuming, but they are worth it--gorgeous to look at and delicious to taste."},{"Title":"The Pie and Pastry Bible","review":"When I heard that Rose Levy Beranbaum was coming out with a new cookbook, I was very excited.

I think the scientific explanations are interesting, but just skip them if you don't have time to read a treatise. Also, I found it REALLY helpful to carefully read the recipe--the day before you start baking, if possible--so that you're not stuck waiting for butter to freeze or fruit to macerate when your guests are starting to arrive! The results are spectacular--the pear tart was perfection and I've never had any of my attempts fail, which is more than I can say for both Bon Appetit and Gourmet recipes."},{"Title":"The Pie and Pastry Bible","review":"This book tends to read at times as though it were longing to be classified as a science text. This is not necessarily bad. I found it very interesting to read about what makes a good pie crust: a low protein flour for tenderness, the proper fat blending technique to ensure flakiness, adequate chilling to ensure minimal distortion during baking, etc. She is very thorough and covers EVERY aspect of making pies and pastry. However, the results and the experience of using this book in the kitchen don't quite live up to the anticipation.While the fillings are generally about as delicious as they come, there are a few serious errors (I was very careful about measuring and using an accurate thermometer, and the Lemon Merangue Pie still came out like Lemon soup, twice), and the techniques required to acheive these results can be VERY time consuming. If I'm going to spend this kind of time, the recipe better be accurate. In a similar vein, the recipes for sauces, ice creams, and danish produce wonderful results. But again, do not underestimate the amount of time involved in producing them.The verdict on Rose's pie crust is more problematic. Have you ever tried kneading and pounding pie crust in a ziploc bag? Try it and watch everything stick to the inside; I don't care how cold she says it should be. It sticks and is a mess. Also, she seems to be striving for the ultimate in tenderness for her pie crusts. But using a combination of soft pastry flour, plus vinegar, plus baking soda, plus a two step blending technique (a technique which, minus the ziploc bag, can be very good) results in a crust that is, in my opinion, too tender. It loses some of the crispness that makes that makes pies, especially fruit pies, so wonderful. Also, watch out for that blending technique. If you pound a portion of the butter into the dough with a rolling pin like she says, unless you know what finished dough should look like, the butter pieces may very likely remain too large and will result in them separating out and melting during baking. Another disaster; trust me, it happened.This is a good effort, but is only for someone who loves pies and pastry and already has a good knowledge of baking which will enable them to slightly modify certain problematic techniques and recipes."},{"Title":"The Pie and Pastry Bible","review":"Please be aware of an error regarding the lemon meringue pie on page 178. The recipe reads &quot;8 (eight)eggs, separated yolks.&quot; I followed this exactly (questioning this as most recipes use 3 or 4 eggs at the most);however in a book entitled the &quot;Bible&quot;, one does not question the authority. This mistake spelled disaster; the pie looked beautiful but was simply egg soup. I trust this will save someone from a similar disaster."},{"Title":"The Pie and Pastry Bible","review":"I never make a pie or pastry crust using anyone else's recipe.

I followed all of the instructions perfectly for the apple pie. After several hours of preparation, using a baking stone covered with foil, a temperature of 425 degrees (preheated for 20 minutes), etc., the pie was just okay. The bottom crust browned but was soggy, the filling tasted good but was undercooked. I reduced the liquid from the macerated apples to just above the 1/3 cup recommended. However, it never bubbled out of the top of the crust and didn't thicken in the pie (I used the cornstarch on the apples as instructed). If I had cooked it any longer (10 min. longer than recommended didn't help), the pie crust on top would have been shoe leather. The top crust was delicious and flaky and looked beautiful. I did learn to fill the pie pan with the crust and refrigerate it before cooking to prevent shrinkage and produce flakiness. I plan on trying another recipe in this book in the future but I know now to devote my entire day to each recipe. I can't imagine baking tons of holiday pies with so many steps to take for each one.

I have been consistently disappointed with the seven recipes I have made from this book. I followed the directions carefully but a crust that the author raves about as her favorite was dry and crumbly and lacked flavor. Several fillings were similarly lacking in flavor.

The only thing worth noting is that Levy Berenbaum isn't very good with the heartier cakes, as the concentration on centerpiece creations should have tipped me off to. The carrot cake isn't terribly carrot-y or hearty in the way I'd hope for, the banana bread is a light banana cake, and there's no gingerbread recipe. However, the variety of well-explained basic cakes, rolls, creams, icings, and fillings, the explanations of the differences among the various recipes, the wealth of confections assembled from the building blocks, and the recommendations for storage make this great as a baking playground for those looking for fairly refined results.

The story starts in near Lukang when KMT soldiers steal the god from a family and he is sent to bring it back. Much of the story focuses around an American newsman stationed in Taipei and how he learns Nationalist Taiwan is not what it seems. The true story behind the fiction is that Sneider met Ed Paine, an eye witness to the 228 massacre and Paine hooked Sneider up with his interpreter. The history is fuzzy, the places are not where they should be, but the story is more an allegory of 50's Taipei with the dreaded race track and deaths.

While I appreciated the thorough coverage of Thompson's adventures (and mis-adventures), I believe that it would not entertain the unconverted. Most non-fans or newcomers could probably best spend their time simply reading Humphries' reviews.One problem that I had with the book is the author's insistence on repeating certain phrases or ideas to describe Thompson's enigmatic position in the industry, or to express the difficulties in his personal life. If I saw Thomspon ... along with two or three other artists of the genre, for that matter ... referred to as &quot;a bard of the bedsit&quot; one more time, I think I would have closed the book and not re-opened it.What strikes me when reading this author's work and I've read two of his books) is that he should: conduct all of the interviews that are used in his work (his skills in this area are very strong), utilize all of his knowledge as a fan and fact-finding skills to compile discographies, etc., and find himself a far better editor, or link with a writing partner who could check him for repetitiveness and verbosity; both of which became more problematic as the book wears on."},{"Title":"Richard Thompson: The Biography","review":"This book is worthwhile simply because it is the only one out on the subject.

Mostly he makes a fair fist of remaining objective about Thompson's work, though he does get on the soapbox from time to time to air his own views.The real problem with this book is that there's no real revelation. Some people might be surprised to know that RT is fond of scrabble, cricket and gardening (the anoraks amongst his fans knew all that already), but that's about it really.The real problem - and it's not really the author's fault - is that Thompson, apart from his music, is a very ordinary person. English post-war middle class upbringing, two marriages, one divorce, one religious conversion (which hasn't coloured his work in the long run). Still touring hard in his middle age but there's no sex and drugs, no groupies, just a bit of scrabble at the back of the bus. Where's the best seller in that?So full marks to Humphries for trying and full marks to the very private Thompson for agreeing to go along with it all, but unless you're a Thompson completist save the cash and buy the CDs instead. That is where all the truly remarkable things about Richard Thompson are to be found."},{"Title":"Richard Thompson: The Biography","review":"This book rates down there with Chris Murphy's Miles To Go as one of the most amatuerishly written biographies I have read. Most of the other readers' reviews here, and especially the Kirkus review, touch on my frustrations, but I think they are being FAR too polite. Yes, it's the only bio of this musical genius, so I guess the intention was good. But unfortunately, the author apparantly thinks that HE is part of the story! There are lots and lots of personal opinions, recollections, critiques that have no place in a bio purporting to tell the life story of its subject. The admittedly good interviews often were strung back to back without editing, then followed by a passage by the author retelling the same facts just discussed by the subjects. The ramblings and redundancies became so tedious to me that I was not only tempted to put it down, but throw it at the wall. Only my love for Richard Thompson prompted me to plow through it.OK, I admit that the pictures are worth having, but you will probably learn as much from the booklets included in the 2 excellent RT box sets. And you will have the pleasure of listening to Richard's wonderful music.It IS the only available RT bio, and a lot of work went into it. If you're a fan you're going to buy it anyway, and you probably will be glad to have a copy. The intentions were noble, so I'm raising my rating to 2 stars. :o)"},{"Title":"Richard Thompson: The Biography","review":"If you're reading this it's probably because you are a Richard Thompson fan. And if you are a real fan, you should get this because: 1) There are no other Richard Thompson biographies (books) 2) It has good reference material in the appendices (although inevitably it's out of date) 3) No one's going to get rich off of writing a Richard Thompson bio, and we should support whoever makes the effort, espcially when it's not THAT expensive 4) You will find out something(s) you didn't know [Afghanistan &amp; &quot;Shoot Out the Lights&quot;; scrabble; &quot;Walking on the Wire&quot; was before the breakup] 5) This book looks like it might be going out of print. Get it while you can. HOWEVER: A good biography makes the person come alive; it succeeds as a story on its own. This doesn't make it on that level. (Yeah, it does have an index [required] but the index didn't have Pentangle, mentioned several times in the text...) SO there's my Caveat Emptor. The passersby could bypass this with no worry; but if you're a fan...."},{"Title":"Richard Thompson: The Biography","review":"I am a fairly recent (since 1989) fan of RT, and I've always wanted to know more about him as a person and artist. The interviews are good, especially the ones with bandmates and his current wife and ex-wife, however the politics and album details really bog down the reader. I appeciate context, but sometimes it was too much. Still, the book was fascinating in parts and I recommend it for fans."},{"Title":"Richard Thompson: The Biography","review":"Humphries concentrates on the history of Thompson's recording career. That involves him in a double reduction: life and work are largely reduced to career, and career is largely reduced to recording career. The result is woefully narrow; the book could have been called GENIUS AS MARGINALITY: PROBLEMS IN THE MARKETING OF RICHARD THOMPSON. To make matters worse, Humphries has a weak grasp of the difference between achievement and reception: the reader who wants to know which albums to buy will find that she is only told which ones have been well-received.(Clive Gregson: \\"I don't believe that Richard has ever really been that bothered about making records. It's not the real thing for him.\\")Yet there are interesting quotes here, both from the articulate Thompson and from his perceptive wives, friends, colleagues, and critics. Their voices made the book a pleasure to read."},{"Title":"Richard Thompson: The Biography","review":"There isn't much information out there about Richard Thompson. As such, this book fills in a lot of empty spaces for me; however, compared to similar books about other musicians it is pretty tame. The best aspect of this book is that it had the cooperation of the subject as well as many of RT's friends and fellow musicians which many similar books do not. Overall, it is a nice book about a very under-rated musician."},{"Title":"Richard Thompson: The Biography","review":"Although most likely meant for his small cadre of fans, &quot;Richard Thompson: A Biography&quot; will not disappoint anyone unfamiliar with the name or the art of Herr Thompson. Learning about the personal life of an artist can swiftly degenerate into a cesspool of false modesty and self-aggrandizement, not to mention a &quot;That song came about because...&quot; mentality that can weary terrifically even a die-hard fan. Humphries' book shys away from this and actually focuses on the subject, and not just his work. Although I didn't see much use in his reviews of each Thompson album, his exhaustive interview material with both Mr. Thompson and his lovers/friends/family/colleagues is priceless in trying to come to some sort of understanding of someone who normally shirks from any sort of self-revelation. Not the best musician biography ever written perhaps, but essential for Thompson fans, and a good read for any fan of rock n' roll."},{"Title":"Untitled Epic Poem on the History of Industrialization","review":"When i read this book for a class project i was amazed with it when i realized it was written in 1962.

We become great leaders by reading about the lives of great leaders and examining the thoughts of great leaders. That's why quotes are so great. They capture key thoughts in a way that is elegant and easy to learn from.This book is short. What it lacks in length it attempts to make up for in depth of meaning. The quotes are divided into sections: Character, Courage, Compassion, Wisdom, and Inspiration are just some examples of key themes that these quotes are grouped into.The quotes tend to rely heavily on Emerson, Antoine De Saint-Exupery, Plato, and Theodore Roosevelt. While there's probably a hundred or so great leaders quoted in this book, certain figures have multiple quotes throughout. Most all the quotes are excellent choices, with some surprising individuals quoted.The only reason I give this book a 4 is because, in my humble opinion, the compiler should have devoted some more quotes to Eastern thinkers. With the great contributions in the areas of leadership by thinkers such as Sun Tzu and Musashi, it's a shame that only Confuscious, Gandhi and Lao-Tzu seem to have made it in here. Still, it's clearly a reflection of the strong western background of the compiler.If you're looking for clear and motivational thoughts on leadership, this book is a great find.

Each page featured no more than five quotes, and contained plenty of open space that allowed me to jot down my thoughts, comments, and observations.The challenge with any collection of quotes is that each collection is limited by the personal preferences of the compiler, and the value of any collection is determined by each individual reader. I was familiar with many of the quotes (from my years of collecting quotes), and enjoyed many of the quotes that were new to me (they will be added to my personal quotes database).This book contains enough good quotes to make it a valuable addition to anyone's leadership-related library, and its length and organization made it a perfect public transportation commute companion."},{"Title":"Leadership Through the Ages: a Collection of Favorite Quotations","review":"This is a small but interesting book about the thoughts of various leaders throughout history. It is sold as a companion book to Giuliani's best selling book, Leadership (two volume set). The book is introduced by Rudy Giuliani who has put together a collection of over 250 inspiring leadership quotations from individuals like Lee Iacocca, Will Rogers, Martin Luther King, Abigail Adams, Eleanor Roosevelt and many others. Giuliani explains why he compiled these quotations by saying, \\"...leadership is mostly a skill that people learn. They learn from their parents, from their friends and colleagues, from their teachers, and from their clergy. But leaders also learn from leaders they've never met - by reading about them\\".These quotations are organized in 20 subject chapters and include titles like character, compassion, vision, conviction, action, inspiration, failure and teamwork. Some of these quotations are well known but others are unique. Leadership Through the Ages is intended to provoke serious thought and reflection. Here are a few examples...Example moves the world more than doctrine.- Henry MillerThere are two ways of spreading light: to be the candle or the mirror that reflects it.- Edith WhartonA leader should not get too far in front of his troops or he will get shot in the ass.- Joseph ClarkLeadership Through the Ages is the kind of book to read when you are sitting by a crackling fire on a cold winter eve.

Even as I think of it now, I feel the hair rise on the back of my neck. The evil in the book does not chase after you--it waits for you to come to it, and invariably, you do. In that sense, the title THE SATANIC MILL is unfortunate--you expect the mill to be Satanic; in Russian translation, the book was called simply KRABAT (the main character's name), and you did not quite know what to expect.The story begins as a young boy named Krabat, somewhere around present-day Eastern parts of Germany, falls asleep wandering, and dreams of ravens crowing. Their message is for him to go to the mill some miles away, to sign up as an apprentice. Which he does, of course, and soon learns that it is no regular mill. (Nor is it quite Satanic, actually--for it is not Satan who runs it). He may stay, or he may go; if he goes, he will learn magic from the Miller himself. Of course, he stays--and becomes one of the apprentices, who turn, at their Master's command, into black ravens. All peachy so far--until the cleverest (and the kindest) of all the apprentices dies an unnatural death--but not before having made his own coffin and dug his own grave.In the (happy) end, of course, Krabat will have to choose between love and good and fairness--and magic. Between being a regular boy and a powerful Miller himself; but such a choice will not come to him easily--and he will have to fight for his life, and that of his love.My favorite characters in the book were the idiot Yuro and the Great Pumphut, who gives the Miller a run for his money. The story is very creepy (or I think it would be for a 13-14 year old; I know it was for me), poignant and beautiful."},{"Title":"The Satanic Mill","review":"It is a shame that this book is out of print... find a copy if you can! Although it contains very little gore or violence, it is one of the creepiest books I have ever read. It is an excellent account of the manner in which evil attracts and then enslaves the will. Krabat learns to use extraordinary power at the mill, yes, but only at the price of enslaving his being to the evil miller. The manner in which the miller dominates the wills of his workmen is truly horrifying. Since magic is ultimately about power and domination, it can only be defeated by its opposite, self-giving love. Krabat finds this salvation in the humility of a village girl.This book is the alternative to Harry Potter that I have been looking for as reading material for my kids. It is surely creepy, but not too creepy for 12 year olds and up. The Potter books treat magic and evil as something trivial that can be toyed with impunity. The Potter kids find they can defeat the most horrifying evils with a few magic tricks and a little cleverness and courage. Evil deserves more respect than that, because it is far more dangerous and powerful, working primarily through corruption of the will. Preussler is a master at depicting this process, with the miller breaking the wills of his apprentices through pointless work. Eventually, the men are so dominated that they acquiece in their own deaths, literally digging their own graves.This is a wonderful book. It leaves the reader with a lasting impression of the dangerousness and horror of evil, as well as the power and joy of agape - self-giving love."},{"Title":"The Satanic Mill","review":"I first read this book when I was a kid, and have re-read it several times since. I gave it to my husband as a gift, and although usually he is not too thrilled with the books I pick, he loved this one.Krabat, the protagonist, is a young orphan who starts working as an apprentice at a mill where black magic and witchcraft are at work. The miller has made a deal with the devil, and each year one of the apprentices has to be sacrificed by the miller to keep his side of the deal. Some of Krabat's friends end up dead. Krabat, however, finds salvation through his love, a singer from the nearby village. She is able to rescue him from certain death and put an end to satan's reign, even when the miller casts an evil spell, because her love for Krabat is stronger than witchcraft.Otfried Preussler accomplished a miracle with this book: It has a captivating storyline which has the power to keep even adults fascinated, while at the same time the book sends a strong ethical and moral message about temptations and the power of love.There aren't too many children's books out there which can bridge the gap between adult readers and children. This one does. And it does it exceptionally well."},{"Title":"The Satanic Mill","review":"I read this book as a child about 25 years ago, and it seems as if it was just yesterday. I read the German version which is simply titled 'Krabat'. I think the English title might prevent people from buying it, and that's a real shame. This is a very special story that I look forward to sharing with my children."},{"Title":"The Satanic Mill","review":"The Satanic Mill by Otfried Preussler is a great book to read. It is about a begger boy called Krabat who gets called to a mill in a dream. The mill is also a Black School. He met a female singer, and they both fell in love. Krabat wanted to leave the mill, but to do that the Singer (the book did not give her name) had to pick him out while he and all the other miller's men were in the form of ravens.This book is very creepy, mysrerious, and unpredictable which, I think, is great.

As I read it, I feel carried away to that time, I feel I am in the mill with them, I feel I have the same powers they do... that is how well written this book is. I think what I enjoy the most is the camaraderie that exists between the book's characters... This book teaches great lessons on trust, friendship, and self-confidence.

They sing songs for local towns people for mere pennies, and eat and sleep in the barns of the local farmers. He was not always a beggar boy. His parents died, and living with the local pastor was just too much on him, so he ran away.Krabat is plagued by dreams of a voice, telling him to come to the mill in the Kosel of Fen, although he knows not where this is. He ignores it for the better of two days, and on the third day he decides he must go to this mill. On arriving at the mill he is met by the Miller, he informs Krabat that he will be his apprentice, and gives him room and board. He awakes in the middle of the night to eleven ghostly faces, claiming they are the Miller's journeymen, and for not to fear because they will not harm him.It is not long before Krabat realizes that things are very strange here at the mill in the Kosel of Fen, and he's determined to find out what is going on. It is not right for young men to be able to do magic, although it is quite helpful at times, and he must know everything that is happening, and why.This was yet another book that was dropped into my hands by a friend from work. He insisted that it was an excellent book, and that I just \\"had to read it\\". I picked it up not even two days ago, and started digging into it. I soon realized, that yes, it was good. I enjoyed the aspect of magic from this book, although there was quite a lot of repetition, and that began to grow annoying for me. The book is set into three parts, each being what goes on in Krabat's three years of being at the Mill. Each part was basically the same, although characters changed, and some events were a little different, or just explained more. I had to give this book a 3 for rating, because yes, I did like it, but it's not something I could say I loved."},{"Title":"The Satanic Mill","review":"Krabat follows his dreams to a mill.After some time at the mill he tries to escape."},{"Title":"Polymath","review":"John Brunner's novel Polymath, written early in his career, is a gem and highly recommended. This tale about survival on an alien planet by shiploads of refugees escaping from a home world with a star going nova is not very original. In these types of stories we are confronted with, well, the usual: deadly flora and fauna, hostile climate conditions, boisterous settlers and inadequate resources. Brunner uses these familiar themes to create, yes, a fascinating backdrop, but the interaction of diverse character types makes this book exceptional. John Brunner is, in my estimation, a brilliant writer of Science Fiction whose body of works has disappeared from bookshelves since his untimely death in 1995. This book is an excellent introduction to a very underrated writer. Note to readers: there are two versions of this book one published in 1963 and one in 1974. The edition published in 1963 is shorter and substantially different than the 1974 version. This review is based upon the 1974 edition."},{"Title":"Polymath","review":"Two lifeships crash on an uninhabited planet, and their passengers must struggle to survive.The storyline is fairly simple adventure/survival, with lots of detail.

The Repairmen of Cyclops"},{"Title":"Polymath","review":"I ordered this Kindle edition to replace an original paperback which became overly worn with reading and age. However, the e-copying process went horribly wrong. Many misspelled words (distracting and confusing at times to the story), punctuation marks are misplaced at times, and some lines have incorrect words (warfp). Was the original text scanned or retyped into text? Perhaps Amazon could hire me as a proof reader of their Kindle sci-fi books!OK, all that aside. This story is about survival on a hostile planet when things keep going wrong. Brunner's original story is interesting and typical of the times in which it was written (Atomic post WW2 era) and reflects both ideology and old world values. The story is based upon how would a group of citizens, suddenly thrust onto a new world, have to cope with internal strife and conflicts and everyday struggles of survival. It's short on character building, but loaded with fast-paced dialogue and scenes which keep the reader moving along from start to finish."},{"Title":"Polymath","review":"After their sun goes nova, two groups of survivors find themselves marooned on a faraway planet. Cut off even from each other, the two groups follow two distinct paths: one attempts to organize itself around more or less democratic structures and the other descends into \\"Lord of the Flies\\" savagery. The majority of the action in the first part of the novel revolves around showing how difficult it is to maintain a civilized social order in the face of extreme deprivation and hardship. Each of several main characters reacts differently to the situation, and these personal dramas also fuel the novel's development. From the p-o-v of this female reader, the sub-plot involving the female characters was incomprehensible, truly, I could not understand what was supposedly happening to them nor why they reacted as they did. None of the female characters came across as particularly well-developed. But once the two groups encounter one another again, the book loses this more interesting, multiple perspective and focuses on one individual, the eponymous \\"Polymath,\\" a genius-in-training, and his personal quest to unify the survivors. In the end, the book's message \\"planet-builders dare not fail\\" is simply not universal enough to rank this novel a permanent place on my bookshelf."},{"Title":"Polymath","review":"Standard SF fare from 1974. In my opinion, Brunner had his best novels before this time (Zanzibar '69 and Sheep '72, for example). Original idea of stranded unprepared colonists/refugees, which allows for millions of different scenarios to play out. But the written plot feels too molded rather than loose, free-flowing. It was so written that everything was stacked-up to end up the way it did; there was no fluidity or compromise. And again (as it seems to be a key SF ingredient from the 60s-80s), I must say characterization of women through sexualization is a cheap cop out for any writer. Brunner wrote terrible one-dimensional female characters in Polymath. Thankfully, the SF ideas (mainly, the Polymath career idea) were original enough to rescue this book from a 2-star rating."},{"Title":"Polymath","review":"Brunner is rightly famous for his masterpieces Stand on Zanzibar, Shockwave Rider, and the Sheep Look Up. However, his earlier pulpish sci-fi such as Polymath is actually a pretty good survival tale on a very interesting planet. Secondly, I did not find its slight disturbing nature annoying at all, perhaps since I have managed to read Sheep Look Up and tons of Philip K. Dick. Yes, Captain Gnomes is unbelievable (but are the villains in 8/9 of fiction?) however Devia and Lex are suprisingly well rounded for characters for such a brief book that probably took Brunner a few months to write. For its one hundred and fifty four or so pages its a suprisingly good read. 4/5"},{"Title":"Polymath","review":"Yes, this type of story is a staple product of scifi. But it's an important staple.John Brunner fleshed out an amazingly complicated and intelligent character - Lex - who is a polymath (essentially a savant planetary engineer). The story centers around his leadership of a coastal colony of survivors on an unknown planet 70 light years from their own star system after their sun went nova. This leadership is sharply contrasted with the failed leadership within a second castaway colony on a plateau some miles from the coast.This is scifi at its best, where Brunner shows us how humans react in times of need, in close quarters, in novel situations, etc.The TV series Stargate Universe was an attempt to do this. So was the season where the Battlestar Galactica survivors landed on a planet for a year, and were ultimately overrun by the Cylons. But this novel came before those TV storylines - and Brunner did it right.I highly recommend this story for anyone who enjoys this brilliant author. The Crucible of Time is another of his novels, entirely different from this one, which I also HIGHLY recommend."},{"Title":"Polymath","review":"YOU have to pay attention within [this] one, THE simple, you dont want to think much about .

At the very least they \\"entertain\\" this rider in a diversionary alternative to that reality. I recommend them otherwise, as well, especially to soothe the savage beast, ha, ha. Great reads, people!"},{"Title":"The Greatest Cat Stories Ever Told","review":"After starting to read the first of many stories in this book. I closed it and didn't read the rest. I do not like fiction because fiction is a story made up in someone else's head. I thought these would be true stories. So if you like fiction, you will like this book. If you want true cat stories, which I prefer, this is not for you. It's my own fault being disappointed in this book merely because it is fiction. I guess it's a good book, again, if you like fiction."},{"Title":"Personality Projection in the Drawing of the Human Figure","review":"This is a good book for a starter in the topic of personality assessment through drawings."},{"Title":"Lost Treasures #3: The Teddy Bear Habit or How I Became a Winner (Special Promotion): Lost Treasures: The Teddy Bear Habit - Book #3","review":"I had this book (1973 edition illustrated by L. Lorenz) as a child and recently dragged it out to read to my 9-year-old son at bedtime. He typically prefers nonfiction (yes, we read that too), but I thought he might like this one. He's loving it! I've had to explain a few things -- like the late 60's slang sprinkled through, and why live TV was such a big deal, and George's dad's obsession with Jackson Pollack -- but he gets it, and we've had some great discussions about popular culture, modern art, self-confidence, placebos, and what makes a family. We are both amused by George's frequent exaggerations, like \\"Pop would have me drawn and quartered on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, and tortured on opposite days.\\" And then, of course, there's the gripping story of George's run-in with jewel thieves. Will he get out of this alive? Will the teddy? Will George ever become a winner? Of course -- and so is this book."},{"Title":"Lost Treasures #3: The Teddy Bear Habit or How I Became a Winner (Special Promotion): Lost Treasures: The Teddy Bear Habit - Book #3","review":"This is a great book to read.

Somehow Collier makes his character believable despite George's young age.I love the humor in the book; the crazed bohemian artist of a father, the strange world inhabited by child performers and their dreadful parents, and criminals who can never seem to do anything right.The illustrations by Lee Lorenz are wonderful.

In my 20s, I re-read it and considered it great source material for a cool movie! George would be a really relatable kid (a latch-key kid before the term existed) and the comic book angle is very current. (Imagine a \\"Garbage Man\\" movie!) And what about Wiggsy!

His book of newspaper columns and features is very readable and one you can put down and pick up to choose a subject from the different categories in the index.The book reflects the views of someone who obviously has spent a lot of time dealing with national and international issues.

He writes cleverly, as he talks. The book is a series of short essays, covering the many years of this man's remarkable career,and discussing a wide range of topics. He discusses with considerable insight his experience with the famous and the infamous in Washington DC, and elsewhere, encountered over a lifetime of being an\\"insider\\" among the politically powerful in the Beltway. Most of the commentaries are fascinating, and many involve the authors experience with persons we have all read about in the national news. The number of prominent people the author has had interactions with is astonishing. It will be interesting to see if his political predictions come true, but his reasoning and the insights behind it leave one thinking...He might just be right! I would certainly recommend his book as a most interesting read."},{"Title":"Summer and Winter and Beyond","review":"summer and winter and beyondby clotilde barrett1982from introduction \\" The words \\"Summer and Winter weave structures\\" bring to mind certain old American coverlets. These were often woven in blue and white or natural. The cloth has a plain weave foundation for which the fiber is cotton, linen or both. The pleasing geometric patterns are woven with an indigo dyed wool. The pattern weft makes short floats which appear either on one side or the other of the foundation cloth. These floats are held down with great regularity by certain warp ends which are called the tie-down warp. Often the colored pattern weft floats more frequently on one side of the coverlet than on the other. This accounts for the lighter and darker sie of the coverlet and for the name Summer and Winter.The popularity of the weave must be related to its tremendous design possibilities, especially if the weaver has a loom with more than 4 harnesses. The name Summer and Winter may be American in origin, but the weave structure is found among a variety of ethnic cultures. Summer and Winter is unusual in Sweden, but it is often seen in Findland where it is named \\"kuvikas\\". Certain Navajo Indian double-faced rugs and saddle blankets have the structure of the weft face Summer and Winter weaves without tabby.........\\""},{"Title":"Multicoloured Mayhem: Parenting the Many Shades of Adolescents and Children With Autism, Asperger Syndrome and Ad/Hd","review":"Jacqui Jackson is a single mother with seven children, four of whom are autistic.this is not a sob story about the difficulties she faces but one which shows people that living with autistic spectrum disorders is all about embracing the positive.

His grandfather, who brought him up, was in Parliament when Napoleon was still Emperor. The downfall came with WW I: empires fell apart and communism conquered a big part of the world.His visit to Russia in 1920 was a turning point. The country appeared to him one vast prison with cruel fanatical jailers full of contempt for liberty and democracy. The economic power was in the hands of an oligarchic State, a dreadful engine of tyranny.His credoIn a world of famine, wars, oppressions, tortures and morbid miseries fostered by gloomy creeds, B. Russell remained an outspoken optimist: \`I find many men who seem to be in love with misery and death, and who grow angry when hopes are suggested to them. They think that hope is irrational. I cannot agree.'For him, what the world needs is security against extreme disasters (wars), abolition of extreme poverty, growth of tolerance and the greatest possible opportunity for personal initiatives.PortraitsG.B. Shaw: a controversialist and iconoclast whose own opinions were chaotic.H.G. Wells: a liberator of thought with imaginations about possible societies.Joseph Conrad: a novelist about tragedies of loneliness.G. Santayana: made BR abandon the belief of the objectivity of good and evil.A.N. Whitehead: the extraordinary perfect teacher.Sidney and Beatrice Webb: Fabianism was, in a nutshell, worship of the State. They considered marriage as a social institution designed to fit instinct into a legal framework.J.S. Mill: the champion of liberty against tyrannical morals and unjust power.D.H. Lawrence: a would-be despot emphasizing sex, for in sex alone he was compelled to admit that he was not the only human being in the universe.Lord John Russell: an aristocratic reformer, worshipping a goddess called Liberty.Orwell's 1984: a world as a prelude to universal death.Descartes: \`I think, therefore I am' is a bundle of errors. It means not more than: \`Descartes is a series of which the members are thoughts, therefore Descartes is a name.' Matter and Mind are series of events (not things) connected by causal relations.Linguists: make philosophy trivial and are excusing ignorance of mathematics, physics and neurology.Fichte and education: The aim of Fichte's educational system was to destroy freedom of the will and produce mental slaves. What he mainly wished to be taught was the superiority of the German nation.Mankind's most urgent question to be answered: Shall we put an end to the human race or shall mankind renounce war?This still highly relevant book is a must read for all Bertrand Russell fans and for all those interested in the fate of mankind."},{"Title":"Principles of orchestration: With musical examples drawn from his own works","review":"Just what I was looking for in an orchestration book, the translated words of Rimsky-Korsakov.

While the book does detail some decent recipes and contains some basic tips for the novice cook, it also provides instructions of a different type, that of cooking up some romantic love. The main theme of the book is that if the co-ed cannot cook, then she cannot catch and keep a man. The book is damn funny with chapters titled such as \\"Day Dreams Do Come True\\", \\"Men Love Meat\\", and my favorite chapter \\"Is He a Fisherman?\\".

Book is filled with examples from all areas that ease comprehension and make the book enjoyable to read. Specifically enjoyed the treatment of risk as more than the classic &quot;potential to do harm&quot;, but also includes &quot;opportunities for gain.&quot; The chapters on cost and schedule risk management are refreshing, informative and through the use of examples allows the concepts to be easily applied. At times the book can be whimsical, adding to the readers enjoyment. I most strongly recommend this book to engineers who want to sharpen their engineering and project management skills."},{"Title":"See It and Say It in German","review":"Have lived in Germany and Austria several years. Used this book when I initially moved to Germany and literally was comfortable speaking after only 3 months! I recommend this to all my colleagues who travel abroad. Also, anybody who is serious about learning a language must realize that classroom instruction is very purposeful to get you in the right direction for both pronunciation and grammer, but sitting down and learning on your own is unquestionably the absolute only way to really learn a foriegn language (I speak 3). This book RULES!"},{"Title":"See It and Say It in German","review":"I too, like the previous reviewer, have never regretted buying this book. I've since moved on to other texts, audio, and so on.

I've been learning German for just over two years. This book has been a great help, and has not been frustrating in the least. It's set up to where you can just open it to any of it's pages and start learning. It's not arranged to where you have to go from front to back. I have many tools to learn German, but this is one of them that truly shines out. Das ist ein gutes Buch! Kaufen Sie es. This is a good book. Buy it."},{"Title":"See It and Say It in German","review":"This book is good for begginers and people who are going to a german speaking country and have only a short time time to learn some german. This book starts you off with some german pronunciation then you start to learn phrases in german and they are shown with pictures to help you remember them. After a few pages you have 10 questions to see what you have learned and if you should move on. You also learn how to conjigate verbs whether they're past, present, reflexive, regular or irregular. There are also glossary's for restaurants and hotels and at the end of the book there is also a german to english glossary. This book does have it's flaws like it doesn't have the informal forms for 'you' they only use the formal forms. If you don't learn du for you singular and ihr for you plural then you won't understand what someone might be saying and you wouldn't know how to conjigate the verbs properly when you want to use informal language.You might also be confused because ihr has other meanings besides you. This book also doesn't use the es-tset which is a letter that isn't in the english alphabet. It looks like a capital B but in it's place they just put 2 ss's which is how you pronounce it but if you come across it somewhere you won't know what it is and it will confuse you. This book also doesn't explain too much about grammar so it leaves you with some questions.So if you want a book to learn some german fast or you just want to see if you might like it then this is the book for you. On the other hand if you want a book that really gets into learning german then you should look elsewhere."},{"Title":"See It and Say It in German","review":"This little pocket book is very useful to go along with whatever German language course you're taking.

Without it I doubt I would have come this far. I met my longtime German penpal many years later and got to try out my German with him. He was impressed with my pronunciation. I highly recommend this book as well as the other editions for French, Spanish and Italian."},{"Title":"See It and Say It in German","review":"See It and Say It in German is undoubtedly a useful and informative conversation course for beginners that has helped me along in my endeavor to learn the German language. I've worked through this paperback a handful of times and still gladly refer to and use it. It contains a total of 256 pages. Margarita Madrigal and Inge D. Halpert are the authors of this guide--both of them are internationally well-known language instructors. See It and Say It in German was initially released in 1962. When it comes to the contents, there's a pronunciation guide, conversation lessons, a traveler's handy word guide, a grammar section (containing a list of verbs and exercises), an A-Z German-English vocabulary section, and an index. See It and Say It in German contains two learning methods that have been successfully used by thousands of students: the word-and-picture aid and the ready-made vocabulary. The words, phrases, and sentences are shown with drawings that explain their meanings. Ready-made vocabulary provides the learner from the beginning with words and phrases that look and sound like their English equals. As for the conversation lessons, each page includes one lesson. Actually, you don't have to work through the lessons starting from the beginning; you can randomly go to whichever lesson that you want. Other material that is included within the conversation lessons section are exercises to test your progress, everyday expressions, a page on telling time, a page consisting of a list of regular verbs, another list of verbs on two pages, and a composition on Vienna. The traveler's handy word guide contains words that are used in restaurants, hotels, and stores. Also, numbers, family terms, colors, days of the week, months of the year, seasons of the year, and parts of the body are featured. See It and Say It in German is a good, user-friendly paperback that I find to be helpful."},{"Title":"Reality","review":"Kingsley interprets the writings of Parmenides and Empedocles in a different way than the usual mainstream traditions. Easy to follow and understand without all the intellectual jargon, also very enriching. I enjoyed this book and think it deserves the 5 stars. Some philosophers will disagree with his handling of the texts and interpretations but he shines a new light on a tradition that has otherwise been stagnating, and one that is refusing to accept new fresh ideas or theories. I would qualify him as a \\"modern\\" philosopher and his writings as \\"modern\\" philosophy. A definite read for all those with broad minds and horizons."},{"Title":"Reality","review":"Aphrodite; She who binds so freely & beautifully not even the Gods know they are bound nor are they capable of recognizing it. Surely we can nowise come to our senses as they've been filled to overflow with th sound, light & fury of \\"the real world' with all it's societal conventions & trappings that pull us closer to Her& bind us even more tightly.That's the path most of us in the West tread- sometimes reluctantly but then other times gleefully as we close in on new car, higher social status, or some other form of material attainment. Most just rumble along this path with the herd taking what scant pleasures get too close to escape our desperate grasp & allow the path to dictate the terms of our aquiessence; \\" Paris Hilton is a Star!/OldNavy makes Fashion/GeorgeBush is a president\\". The sheeple nod & go along, convinced that the world is outside themselves.I mean no judgement- I was there too. I used to think that being a caucasian/hetero male meant I always had better ideas than any woman or minority in the room & if one of them used a word I wasn't familiar with, I just assumed it probably was NOT a real word.The only thing that can pierce the veil is Death.Hekate/Persephone; She who holds the keys to Death & rebirth is the one who cuts through bindings- ALL of them & the more tightly you have wound yourself in illusions, the more merciless She seems to you. \\"We're all in control, until we're not\\" as the saying goes & then happens a breakup/divorce, loss of job, wealth, or most dreaded- health. Suddenly, all those things which were the axis upon which your world turned, (what the neighbors/your friends etc. thought of you, getting into \\"the right school\\", owning a pair of Jimmy Choos et al) must be abandoned & your old identity burned. Her force separates the dissimilar & makes like things go together & contact upon themselves in Her Helish cold. And it is here we learn to reconcile ourselves to the many Deaths we all experience throughout Life which preceed rebirth.Reality by Peter Kingsley is a transmission- possibly for ANY who can read (&reread;) it start to finish, but surely for those who've familiarized themselves with ancient symbolism & \\"the occult\\". If you're looking for practicality, checkout the Chilton's car repair manuals. It's unlikely that humans were meant to evolve toward practicality- it's just one of the first rungs on the ladder of development- important for sure but a poor arbiter of value in matters of higher learning.I look forward to several subsequent rereadings."},{"Title":"Reality","review":"The book is based primarily around two Greek characters, Parmenides and Empedocles, but others are mentioned. Peter Kinglsey offers a new view of their teachings whose thought has guided Western civilization since its inception.He goes on to say that scholars have misunderstood their teachings, and offers plenty of evidence in prolific notes at the back to justify his claims.The primary aim of the book is to guide the reader through the poems written by Parmenides and Empedocles. Peter offers not only a new translation of the texts based on knowledge of Greek, but guides us to their esoteric meanings, in the hope that these will influence the seeker in a way to help them to come to a realization of Truth or Reality as he calls it.Peter offers the view that these two were teachers in a long line of esoteric teachers whose access to higher understanding started even before the Greeks; came through the Greeks, to the Egyptians, then the Romans and others, then to Islam where it is currently embodied in Sufism. Today Sufism has a Western component as well as the Islamic version. However, some organizations are genuine, some are not.For me, it was a thoroughly good read, even if a little long at 559 pages not including the notes! I would recommend the book to those who are seeking either to get some direction in their spiritual search, or to those who are interested in the above two characters, and need fresh insight into their teachings."},{"Title":"Reality","review":"This is the book I was looking for in Highschool, but never found, it not having been written yet. So, I started writing it myself. I am still writing, and then a friend points out its existence. Better than mine, and as if a commentary on mine. Excellent work. Only those who have spent a large portion of their lifetime asking the right questions will realize this book has many of the right answers, and, expressed very succinctly. what I took 20,000 pages and 20 years to find, he condenses beautifully to his first 100 pages. Awesome. Sublime. Profound. Genius unrecognized as such in his own time. If you think it is too long, you have no idea how short it is; you are too immature for the subject and should indeed go with your gut feeling and not bother to read it and go watch Paris Hilton or The Jonas Brothers; such greatness you are not worthy of."},{"Title":"Reality","review":"Reality is long and repetitive for a good reason. The repetition helps the author as he is constantly expounding upon how reality was perceived and experienced by Greek philosophers who were also mystics. The book is written for a general audience and the writer writes as simply as possible, using the modern form of mostly short chapters and eliminating unnecessary language and academic techniques. My favorite part is when he talks about incubation, which can be seen as the Greek mystical form of meditation, and it's relation to Apollo. He presents some interesting ideas which rival many modern ideals of Greek philosophy, especially in terms of logic and rationalism. Does logic merely refer to that which is seen and presented in a \\"regular\\" since of living? Did the Greeks not give into mystical ideas of reasoning like the Indians, Persians, or Egyptians? Kingsley would say no to both questions. Kingsley is a brave man that stares academic stiffs in the face and says \\"read again\\". Kingsley is a writer that does not embarrass or insult people of the past by thinking of them as primitive or outdated. Sure, some smug guy brainwashed by school will look at a book like this and laugh, thinking it doesn't have enough footnotes or ego strokes for college kids. With that, they can be referred to Kingsley's earlier work- Ancient Philosophy- where he barked up the textbook tree before. This is something different. This book is about addressing the reader honestly and respectfully. I'm glad I read it after reading \\"In The Dark Places of Wisdom\\".Another book that seems like a good read is Burkett's Greek Religion."},{"Title":"Reality","review":"If you feel like challenging yourself with letting Kingsley reshape your thinking process, about the world around us, and how we really perceive it and why then this is a read for you. He urges the readers to rationalize their way out of the ordinary way of thinking and invites to the origins of logic and origins of sacred tradition. Essentially he does what Parmenides and Empedocles tried to do through their poems only in more detail and in a language that we mortals are able to understand. He reveals the truth through trickery which we are accustomed to which we call life and is the only way we know how to communicate. This might seem like gibberish but should make sense upon reading. Looooved it."},{"Title":"Reality","review":"I finished this book the other day and as soon as I digest it a bit, I will read it again. To me this is a very important book.For someone interested in witchcraft and shamanism this is essential reading."},{"Title":"Reality","review":"Reality was a wonderful confirmation of what I already have found out for myself in daily life. The vast majority of people in the world are stupidly sleep-walking through life. This book will wake them up if they have the courage to read it."},{"Title":"Reality","review":"Peter Kingsley has written a beautiful book. It's a masterpiece of scholarship, a landmark in classical studies and the history of philosophy. But more importantly, it's one of those rare books that can so alter the way you look at the world that it changes you, stays with you for the rest of your life.In Reality, Kingsley presents two titans of early Greek philosophy in a startlingly new way. Parmenides and Empedocles, so crucial to the foundation of western philosophy, logic, cosmology, and science, were, he argues, mystics. They were ecstatic healers, shamans, sorcerers whose poetry was suffused with humor, trickery and magic. They were initiates in a long and all-but-forgotten line: the native mystical tradition of the western world. And the incantatory poems of these initiates were, quite literally, initiations: initiations into a greater reality. But Kingsley doesn't just talk about and around these things. His particular genius is that he lets the words of these ancient sages speak directly to the reader. And like the great teachers from Zen, Taoist, Sufi and other mystical traditions, these masters from our own western tradition still have something to say to us today. Their message is tremendously subtle but tremendously powerful. It has the potential to upend our lives -- and renew them. This book is a wake-up call from the great beings who created the world we live in.Reality offers a powerful antidote to the prevailing scholarly approaches to Parmenides and Empedocles, which treat them as dry rationalists. Aristotle himself and other ancient intellectuals are largely responsible for this view. They rationalized and bowdlerized Parmenides and Empedocles, essentially remaking a pair of mystics in their own image. They have been followed by a sizable, though not unanimous, contingent of classicists and historians of philosophy, right down to the present day. But Kingsley breaks down this history of distortions and shows us an altogether different view.To say that the West's most important early philosophers were mystics, and to suggest that western civilization is heir to as grand a mystical tradition as anything found in the East: these sound like extraordinary claims, because they are. But what is so fascinating about this book is the rather humble, even mundane, ways in which the author establishes his points once and again. He offers a meticulous and artful translation of the ancient texts. He pays attention to the little details. He refuses, for instance, to translate certain words in a way that would be more readily understandable, but would not be the most natural sense in Greek (a practice that is disturbingly common in other translations of the Presocratics). Frequently this results in a word that sounds odd or an image that is startling. But throughout the book, Kingsley confronts strangeness head-on, instead of taking the well-trodden route of other interpreters: that of converting the bizarre or unusual into the ordinary. Kingsley stays with the riddle, taking his interpretive cues from the strangeness itself.It's rewarding to watch how much he is able to accomplish in this way, and is, in and of itself, an education in how to do a close, respectful reading of a text. He does this in the most down-to-earth manner imaginable. For example, he will situate a perplexing word in the geographical context of the writer, identifying it as a reference to a local religious tradition or as a bit of regional slang. In other places he adduces strangely ignored archaeological evidence that has direct bearing on the text. He draws out the connections between an image or turn of phrase to Greek myth or to the epics of Homer, showing how it is being used as poetic shorthand to make a very specific point. In context, the strangeness begins to speak in its own voice. Meanings, allusions, puns and double entendres emerge from the text. Kingsley's exegesis gains persuasive force as the pieces of the puzzle fall into place to make a perfect fit.Though Kingsley's talent for understanding these texts is singular, and his style and tone are utterly his own, he is not, as some reviewers seem to imply, coming totally out of left field in his work. Rather, he is building on a large and venerable body of academic work, as evidenced by his extensive endnotes. Dodds, Diels, Burkert, Cherniss, Detienne and Vernant have documented and commented on many of the major themes of this book: the shamanistic elements in Greek philosophy, the criticism of the doxography of Aristotle and Theophrastus, the importance of such key concepts as mtis and apat in Greek mystical thought. Kingsley simply goes much further than the rest, making use of recent discoveries and applying his knack for tying together disparate strands of evidence into a coherent and cogent narrative.If a radical revision of the history of early western philosophy was all Kingsley was offering in this book, that would be plenty. But he's giving us so much more, because the texts that he translates and expounds were mystical texts, carefully crafted to lead readers out from their illusions and into the still heart of reality. As he writes of Empedocles, who was famed, among other things, as a healer, \\"...[H]is main concern was not just to free people from illnesses. It was to free them from themselves. He wanted to heal them from their illusions about time and life and death.\\" Reality puts the reader in direct contact with the liberating power of these ancient texts. This book doesn't just initiate us into a deeper understanding of two culture heroes. It lets those great beings initiate us -- into reality. Through Kingsley, Parmenides and Empedocles speak again. Once more, they offer the West their timeless gift: the chance to wake up, to see the real nature and purpose of our existence, and to live consciously and in service to life."},{"Title":"Reality","review":"A thick book that I found a bit difficult to read through until the end because of Kingsley's elaborate writing style.But as someone who is very familiar with the tradition of The Fourth Way (G.I.Gurdjieff, P.D.Ouspensky etc.) I had no problem recognizing what this book is all about. Those old Greeks were teaching the same thing. RS."},{"Title":"Reality","review":"Read this book once. Then, read it once more. Have you heard 'her' yet? If not, then stop at the fork in the road and wait, with all your senses lit, and expect a peek at Reality. It's there, right Now. By the way, don't read this book... do it."},{"Title":"Reality","review":"I bought this book because I have always suspected there was more to presocratic philosophy than the classic textbook approach. For example, in Diogenes Laertius several of these philosophers are described as weird mystical figures or even having supernatural powers. Also I read somewhere that the greek word for \\"thinking deeply\\" means literally \\"keeping your diafragm stretched\\" (or something like that), like in some yogic meditation exercise. So Dr. Kingsley's book seemed interesting enough to me.And it is an interesting book, I don't dispute this. The problems are 1) that the author tries too hard to reach an unrealistically wide audience and 2) that his ego is way too big.The first problem shows first in the big font used for the text and the about 50 blank or near-blank pages used to separate chapters, sections, etc. If the book had been designed in the usual way it would take about 300 pages only. But, more importantly, the text itself is handicapped by the removal of serious explanations or even footnotes (they are all lumped together at the end of the book, but there are no references to them in the text itself) that could make a casual reader uneasy, but that are fundamental for judging the validity of its contents.The second problem is manifest in the structure of the book and in the language used throughout. Why does Dr. Kingsley think his reconstruction of Parmenides philosophy/teaching has any practical relevance for anyone? If you had any spiritual/mystical leaning, you have many options nowadays, some of them representing long traditions, with precisely established teaching methods and vast selections of literature. Why would anyone take what amounts to a mere conjecture and build a mystical system out of it? Ultimately, what we are presented with is Dr. Kingsley's point of view, not Parmenides, not Empedocles, and, no matter how much I want to agree with him, I would not take it as the basis of my personal philosophy. I think Dr. Kingsley should have tried a more verbose exposition of his hypothesis, and dropped the \\"self-help\\" angle.Besides, there are some affirmations that look quite doubtful to me, like the continuous link he tries to establish between Parmenides/Empedocles and the Gnostic and Hermetic movements. How, When, Who? I thought it was pretty well understood that those had more in common with neoplatonism and, later, with kabbalah. There may be some Parmenidian influence, who knows, but I would expect it to be indirect and generic. I would consider the Western/Eastern thought mutual influence a much more fruitful line of research. In any case, more substantiation is needed.On the positive side I could say many things (after all I have rated it with 3 stars) but I will mention only two: that the book gave me many ideas to ponder about, even some inspiration, and that it is the best book I have found so far on the topic of presocratic philosophy reinterpretation (but I really hope this is more my fault than its merit)."},{"Title":"Reality","review":"I bought Kingsley's 'Reality' in the hope that it would offer insight to a major pre-Socratic philosopher, and maybe even tie his thought into modern phenomenology and human Being.Unfortunately, the tone, style and method of the book make it very difficult to take seriously. Why?For one, the book is in desperate need of editing. A good half of the text could simply be discarded without any material detriment to the content.This is in large part because the text drips with Kingsley's personal whining about the Western intellectual tradition and his wish that it were simply less rigorous than it is. Every other paragraph seems to be a lament that 'we' are intellectually deficient in one way or another, or are naively not open to one or another assertion. Before long, I discovered that I could quickly identify paragraphs of this repetitious lamentation and simply bypass them without losing the thread of his exposition. For someone who claims that, \\"...there is no time at all to spare\\" in recovering Parmenides, he is extremely wasteful of both his and the reader's time.Another issue are his sparse \\"Notes\\" and complete lack of footnoting. For someone who purports to advance his ideas on linguistic, cultural and archeological evidence, he certainly invests very little time in referring to his sources or evaluating alternative views. Advocates will argue that he provides frequent references to the Parmenides. However, these references to the text offer little to support his wider claims of context and interpretation. That is a great pity because every now and then he gets around to asserting something very interesting. However, it is often difficult to accept his assertions seriously when they remain unverifiable.In a similar vein, Kingsley often makes vast leaps of argument, taking sparse evidence and pushing his conclusions far beyond any reasonably supportable boundaries. In short, he has written a work of fantasy, based on a small rump of real evidence.This, ultimately, is why there are few notes. This, ultimately, is why much of his text is a lament that 'we' in \\"the West\\" - by which he really means 'you' - are not open to wide ranging and unfounded assertions.What Kingsley really wants is for his reader to accept his assertions as a revelation. Unfortunately, his own prejudices, style and method undermine reception by an interested but rigorous reader.I would only recommend 'Reality' to someone who wishes to be entertained by a sort of dreamy mysticism, though Kingsley explicitly denies that this is what he offers.The book will not satisfy anyone interested in a serious consideration of its purported subject matter. There are numerous better books on Parmenides and the pre-Socratics, including: Cordero \\"By Being, It Is\\"; Popper \\"The World of Parmenides\\"; Coxon's \\"The Fragments of Parmenides\\"; Detienne \\"The Masters of Truth in Archaic Greece\\".

He would entitle it the following: \\"On the Making of So Many Doctors\\"."},{"Title":"Reality","review":"For over half a century many people in the West have looked to the Eastern world for spiritual insights and practices. There are many reasons, but many, including the Swiss psychiatrist and philosopher Carl Jung, have suggested that it is difficult for Eastern practices to take root in the Western mind. Many of us have never been taught that there is a vigorous Western mystical and contemplative tradition that goes back thousands of years and existed even before the Christian era.This book is about one of them.Most of us would probably agree that there are many ways of knowing, the power of reason being but one of them.Some books are to be understood by the use of this reasoning, by making sense of the data, the meaning and interpretations of the author. Others create images in the mind and stir the emotions. There is yet another group - and it is by far the smallest - that communicates at many levels, producing shifts and insights in the reader. You can enjoy Shakespeare for his masterful use of the English language, or for the ways in which his words suggest and conjure profound meanings. More than one person has found that Shakespeare has the power to transform and change them.This is Peter Kingsley's third book about the ancient Greek philosophers Parmenides and Empedocles and it is most definitely in that third group. It is his belief that over the centuries rational philosophers have edited, distorted and corrupted their work by ignoring the non-dual mystical and shamanic origins of their insights. So what we have is a neat and tidy rationalism, rather than the profound and challenging works that would mark the beginning of a process of initiation.Kingsley could have played it safe, and produced an academic treatise. Instead he decided to re-create the works of the philosophers as they were meant to be. So the book is mystical, subversive and passionate: it is an intense and direct appeal to the reader to enter a transformative path of initiation. It is a direct esoteric transmission of a teaching that has been largely forgotten or emasculated by later writers who only understood parts of it.Most people, even those involved in spirituality, have been lead to believe that the only ways to achieve insight and enlightenment are through meditation, prayer or perhaps by using mind-altering drugs. But it was not always so, and we have many traditions that are alive and well today, in which the path of enlightenment and initiation involves challenges to the mind and the ego. Even one of the great sages of the last century, Sri Aurobindo, did not sit and meditate. His spiritual practice was writing. The whole of Kingsley's book is an invitation to awaken, and for the person who is ready, he provides the tools for doing so. Not through sitting and thinking, or through stilling the mind, but by trying to come to terms with what he has to say. And then will come the stilling of the mind and the understanding. It is rather like a huge kan.Kingsley overturns centuries of scholarship, and you quickly realize that he is trying to turn the reader inside out in the process. The philosopher Parmenides held that our rational sense of familiarity is an illusion that has to be challenged. Echoing him, Kingsley says near the beginning, \\"if you want to keep a grip on what you know, you will have to dismiss what I say.\\" He translates the Greek word \\"Noein,\\" not to mean \\"Thinking,\\" but to mean a \\"whirlpool of subtleties,\\" that implies a direct intuitive perception beyond the senses. The implication is that this direct perception allows us to the see beyond separation and duality to understand the Universe as it is, whole, interconnected and undivided.Another piece of mind twisting comes in the section on Empedocles' two principles of Love and Strife. Kingsley proposes that Love traps the soul in matter, while Strife sets it free. This is similar to the Gnostic concept that love, pleasure and sex can make the soul forget its real identity by drawing it into incarnation. In Kingsley's interpretation these Greek philosophers believed that the development of witness consciousness: being able to watch the mind and its perceptions, is a step toward releasing the wisdom that has been waiting at the root of the world for more than two thousand years. This could have come straight out of any piece of Eastern teaching about non-duality, but he claims that it developed independently.And what are the implications for this non-dual view? It is that in the end reality perceives itself through you. The notion of personal transcendence has to be re-framed: if all is One, then there is nowhere that we need to get to. The ultimate Reality lies within us, and the methods of these Greek philosophers were designed to awaken us to that realization. The trouble is that even after this extraordinary work of scholarship and insight, not all of their methods are available to us.Reality is a large, thick and demanding book and not everyone will be ready for it. If you skim the surface, you will miss the point of it. Understanding the book and the treasures that it contains is an experiential rather than a rational process. But be warned that Reality requires stamina and perseverance if you want to go on the inner journey that it reveals."},{"Title":"Reality","review":"Peter Kingsley's book \\"Reality\\" is that rare kind of book that comes along every once in a while that will kick the legs out from under you and leave you precariously holding onto the thread of the reality that you once took for granted. But do not read it unless you are ready to live without the reassuring substance of the material world and the cozy little circle of thought that we in the West have built for ourselves, cutting off the otherwise disquieting pieces of our experience that cause us to question our surety that we have got it right.Kingsley, who is a master philologist, takes us on a voyage to rediscover the man Parmenides and the man Empedocles -- not the abstract Pre-Socratic Greek philosophers of crusty old books, but the men who were more than just philosophers. They were participants in, and indeed prophets of, a sacred tradition -- a way of life -- that existed for hundreds of years, perhaps longer, and which, according to evidence presented by Kingsley, was shared across the known world, at that time. In short he presents the human sacred tradition that predated what we now call the \\"West\\" and the \\"East.\\" And he presents it as a story that will sweep you along, if you are open to the truth about these men, and leave you gasping at the treasure that was stolen from us in our march to rationalism.In the ontology of Parmeneides, uncontrived and elegantly expressed in his poem which Kingsley provides a more accurate, contextual, translation of, is a foundation that has tremendous ethical and practical implications for human society and what it means to live a human life. For over 2,000 years we have stubbornly refused to see the holes in the fabric of Western Materialism. And I think it is fair to say that nothing would survive a reanalysis that took into account reality as Parmeneides presents it to us. Kingsley shows us how this tradition, which Parmenides and Empedocles shared, is in fact the foundation upon which our Western intellectual tradition is built; a fact which has been successfully pushed into the background or glossed over -- until now.Kingsley's work presents a fundamental challenge to the edifice of Western intellection as it strips the past of its convenient shrouds and lays bare an imperative to once again contemplate the Sacred in Philosophy and in our lives. It is not just the clarity that he brings to the works of Parmeneides and Empedocles that lends a powerful force to this \\"striping bare,\\" but that he connects disparate cultures in a once-widespread, shared, sacred way of life that existed before the transistor and integrated circuit. But beware: Kingsley is not some latter-day prophet bringing the Good News to us here in the 21st Century. Rather, it is up to us to take what his scholarship offers and find our way forward. The work of Parmenides and Empedocles represent an esoteric tradition which requires committed study, but which provides us all that we need, now that Kingsley has given them back to us.James CorriganAn Introduction to Awareness"},{"Title":"Reality","review":"In \\"Reality\\", Peter Kingsley makes a convincing (at least to the philological layperson) case for the presence of a non-dual mystical teaching right at the inception of the tradition of Western rationalism. Written in a somewhat poetic style that demands and rewards slow reading, the beautifully printed and presented text gradually clears away what Kingsley sees as the multitude of interwoven misconceptions that have veiled a simple, precise, yet subtle meaning in the fragments that have come down to us of Parmenides and Empedocles. He also traces the echoes of traditions stemming from these two ancient philosophers down through later history (although this is not the main focus of the work).One of the most amazing insights Kingsley offers is revealed in his reading of the central \\"practical\\" teaching given by Empedocles to his disciple in one of the Empedoclean fragments - the practice of \\"common sense\\". We are accustomed to thinking of this term in a somewhat Blimpish way. According to Kingsley, the practice of common sense was actually a way of \\"pointing\\" to that which, common to all the senses, both \\"perceives\\", and is, Reality; a teaching startlingly reminiscent of the teachings of non-dual Advaita.(So startling is the similarity that one is tempted to wonder to what degree this book represents a kind of special pleading, which is why I give it only 4 stars. There's an ever-so-faint whiff of histrionics in this book that makes me ever so slightly suspicious. One would very much like this book to be true, but to what degree it represents a kind of sophisticated intellectual hokum that only experienced academics could see through, is a question only an experienced scholar could answer; unfortunately, that scholar would have to be as experienced in both philology and mysticism as Kingsley apparently is! Has Kingsley just made it all up, cobbled it together out of his own experiences and his readings of Eastern mystics, and read his conglomeration into those texts? It really doesn't seem so to me, but I'm in no position to judge.)"},{"Title":"Reality","review":"Peter Kingsley is a man who believes he knows what is Real. In Reality, he is passing his knowledge through the mouths of two famous pre-Socratics that lived in Southern Italy ~700 BC. Parmenides and his follower Empedocles were Pythagoreans and, according to Kingsley, iatromanteis - healer-prophets and sorcerers who combined techniques of shamanic ecstasy with what eventually became, through Plato, the disciplines of philosophy, rhetoric and logic.Kingsley dissects a famous Parmenides poem, pointing out evidence ostensibly suggesting that the poem - thought by most scholars to represent a foundation of what was to become \`logic' - is in fact an account of a mystical journey and a blueprint aimed at guiding the \`mystes' on his/her own descent into a shamanic Underworld. Kingsley stands on increasingly firm ground with respect to his hypothesis that Greek philosophy originates in shamanic practices. Greeks encountered shamanism from Central Asia through their contacts with Scythians and Thracians as well as through Persian 'Magi'. Plato himself talks in Phaedo how \\"first prophecies were the words of an oak\\" and that \\"everyone who lived at that time found it rewarding enough to listen to an oak or a stone, so long as it was telling the truth\\". Pythagorean descent into the underworld was apparently practiced through \`incubation', a form of shamanic \`dreaming' first practiced by the Sumerians (the Sultantepe fragments), Babylonians (the stela of Nabonidus) and Egyptians, later to be inherited by Gnostics and Hermetics.Kingsley seems to be comfortable with ancient Greek texts and provides a number of novel (idiosyncratic?) translations of key terms such as logos, mythos, elenchos and metis (awareness) which seem to have had different meanings for the pre-Socratics than they did for classical Greeks. He also provides a number of intriguing readings of fragments from the Illiad to support his translations.Kingsley's approach also has a number of disconcerting elements mainly to do with classical scholarship as we understand it. While he lets us know, in literally dozens and possibly hundreds of places, that he, PK, is first person to ever correctly interpret these pre-Socratic texts whereas other scholars had it all wrong, direct references to these \`others' are unfortunately very skimpy. Attribution is not PKs forte. Many important contributors are never mentioned. Heidegger, who had a similar approach and in fact seems to have had many of the same general ideas is not even mentioned in the text. More worrisome is PKs need to adapt pre-Socratic ideas to fit his own theory rather than what we know from the ancients themselves. If Kingsley's interpretation disagrees with Plato, Aristotle, Plotinus and Plutarch (who one would imagine knew Parmenides and Empedocles rather well), Kingsley simply tells us the information these ancient guys provide about P and E is wrong - because of their jealousy (Plato), ignorance (Plutarch) or their self-promoting philosophical agendas (Aristotle, Plato and Plotinus).There are many extremely interesting pieces of information here about the ancient Greece. I personally liked the chapters on Phocaea and those describing links between pre-Socratic texts and Sufi orders of the 9th century. The Sufis apparently held their own \`Empedocles circles' and used Empedocles' ideas as a foundation for their alchemy and \`magic'. The speculation about the role of the shamanic underworld in Pythagorean practices is in itself a supremely interesting and juicy subject matter. One has to give credit to Kingsley for his boldness and idiosyncrasy, as well as for his decision to eschew a classical scholarly approach for a more poetic, and evocative one. One has an impression that his main motivation for writing the book was less a desire for promoting scholarly dialogue than teaching the reader about the foundations of what constitutes our reality and techniques one might use to liberate oneself from the bondage of the preconceptions and expectations foisted on us by our fellow man. I liked that.Finally, one has to acknowledge the tricksterish quality of \\"Reality\\". The book meanders the reader through a maze of ideas, metaphors, allusions and alliterations designed to evoke an altered state, a poesis where things are seen as what they are as well as what they feel like. And those feelings are like a veil drifting in the wind, never making it clear whether they reveal or conceil, enlighten or deceive. I liked that as well."},{"Title":"Reality","review":"This is not your ordinary book. As Kingsley writes on page 315: \\"If you look, you will see that everything you hear or read is meant to entertain; amuse; inform; inspire...this book offers nothing of the kind...all the details in it are just a trick...what it does offer is the space for you to create a nest in it, make yourself at home...the reality behind these words is quite different, I can only remind you, from whatever you are able to understand through thinking.\\" It would be the most dreadful of mistakes to think that this is another New Age self-help book, or another learned tome.What Kingsley offers instead is an esoteric transmission--he is doing exactly what the texts he describes did--offering words that are like seeds; words that, if treated rightly, have the potential to grow into something magnificent and beautiful.Elsewhere in the book Kingsley writes about the extraordinary lengths that professional magicians had to go to in order to protect people who are not ready from a direct encounter with the divine. Kingsley is no different from those magicians. He knows whereof he speaks. And his words are veiled. If you read this book as if it were just any book, you will likely miss the point. As some of the book's reviewers so amply demonstrate, if you are not ready for what this work has to say, rest assured you will remain well-protected from it.So look again, look more closely. I'll say it again: this book is an esoteric transmission. There are worlds within this book--the whole cosmos is there waiting for you. There is a sacred space inside all of us just longing for what this ancient tradition has to offer--keep it open, keep it clear, and you just might find all you could ever need, more than you could ever imagine, inside it one day. But try to think about it, and you've already lost it; disrespect it, and it will leave you. This is not a book merely to be read. It is meant to be lived.

But his poem was not simply to be appreciated for its clever prose and beautiful form. Instead it provided an enticing invitation to the reader to share the experience that bore it and heed it's challenge to Truth.Centuries have passed, and the invitation lay unanswered.Enter Peter Kingsley, an accomplished, credentialed scholar who has managed no small miracle - to bring these ancient mystical experiences into a modern day consciousness. Or perhaps it is more accurate to say that Kingsley takes our modern-day consciousness to the ancient mystical world of Parmenides.Regardless, it is a powerful cultural exchange.This book is revolutionary in it's bold mastery of that feat alone as evidenced by the stir it has caused among Kingsley's academic peers. He adheres to the proper dress code by donning the cloak of academic acceptibility through extensive research, a hefty bibliography and a broad historical contextual knowledge of cultural influences that animate Parmenides' world.Yet Kingsley's revelations do not seem entirely of this world.They instead seem to have been born of the deep conviction and heartfelt dedication to Truth of one who must surely have bridged this gaping hole in our philosophical/mystical lineage through his own incubation-like experiences, however brief his glimpse behind the veil. And perhaps this, more than academic credentials imparts the powerfully transcendent Truth that resonates throughout his thesis.At least it seems unlikely that Kingsley's vantage point could have been achieved simply by intellectual means - through research alone - no matter how comprehensive the material or insightful the interpretation.Given that our culture's topsy-turvy academic criteria for establishing Truth does not value such experiences in it's formulation, but instead relies on separation from experience, an objectification that is untarnished by the imperfections of our common humanity, it would seem unlikely that any academically trained author would call attention to this 'imperfection'. But the folly belongs to those who assume such a separation could provide a reliable reflection of Truth, let alone be achievable within the natural laws which bind us all.If this hunch about Kingley's experiences is correct then there may be important implications in the very existence of Reality (the book) for our culture. I wonder if such a book could have been written and received without a broad experience in common with Parmenides and his connection to divine consciousness?If, in order to reap the benefits of Kingsley's writings, one must first hold a similar vantage - at least some awareness derived of experiential knowledge that provides the foundation upon which Kingley's interpretations can take root and illuminate the ancient precident laid out by Parmenides - then who is his audience?The book is clearly not meant for those who measure the unmeasurable with leaden weights and circular intellects.In that context this is the most encouraging and remarkable revelation of all! Kingsley's revelatory interpretations of ancient text and poems could not have been so well received within the collective were its message unrecognizable. Instead it has struck a chord in empathetic resonance with a shared and transcendent knowledge.So perhaps despite itself our culture has, in however limited or clumsy a way, made itself ready to at last receive this dormant seed. Perhaps we have, in subtle and imperceptible ways, been fertilizing an inner landscape made barren by centuries of neglect and ignorance. Lands that can nurture closer union with divine consciousness through the careful cultivation of the inner stillness at the core of the process described by Parmenides and the embrace of holistic principles within a non-dualistic reality. Kingley's work seems to offer an important confirmation of this readiness, while providing a reunion with our profoundest roots. He is an Alex Haley for the colorless intellect in search of a soul.Could it be that Kingsley has provided 'empirical proof' that our inheritance survives still in a centuries old seed?Ponder that!"},{"Title":"Reality","review":"Absolutely brilliant!

Reality as a (hermeneutic) text is highly readable, even entertaining to the extent it answers questions from a learned writer. The 2nd part was also a complete surprise as it deals with far more than Parmenides and situates him in tradition."},{"Title":"The Far Islands and Other Cold Places: Travel Essays of a Victorian Lady","review":"Elizabeth Taylor, one of those indomitable Victorian women who hiked their skirts and explored where even tough moderns would pause, faced the wilds of northern Canada and of the Faroe Islands. The miserable weather etched the inhabitants but didn't faze our guide.Taylor was neither a sentimentalist nor a cynic but saw clearly and wrote straight. Trained as an artist and enamored of nature--especially birds and flowers--Taylor appreciated people who lived closest to her beloved surroundings. By her account, they responded to her interest by inviting her to share their hard-bitten lives and without pretense, she accepted their invitations.Taylor financed her economic travels by writing for middle class magazines, like Frank Leslie's, and for outdoors magazines where a female byline was a rarity. These essays come from those published pieces and some journals archived in her hometown, Minneapolis. A descendent has assembled the collection, but the task had real literary and cultural value that counts for much more than familial duty.A book about places few of us ever would want to visit became for me a book full of passages worthy of reading to friends. A description of the whale hunt, for example, rings with authority and subdued horror. Elizabeth Taylor emerges as her own modest heroine, and her quiet, gemhard descriptions stay alive long after the book is finished."},{"Title":"The Far Islands and Other Cold Places: Travel Essays of a Victorian Lady","review":"Interests in Victorian Age travel was not only confined to Britain but also to Europe in general and North America in particular.The travel essays of a Victorian Lady were begun by Elizabeth Taylor in 1886 and ended with a total of 39 articles.

(Full disclosure up front: I am the author of \\"The Encyclopedia of Daytime Television,\\" and Ms. Cassidy generously quoted my work in her book, but I had nothing to do with her writing it.) Using a scholarly approach but writing for a general audience, Ms. Cassidy makes insightful judgments on a wide variety of shows aired daily on CBS and NBC and how they impacted the homemakers who watched them (ABC did not have a full daytime lineup until late 1958, and most of its shows were flops, so understandably the author did not focus on that network).Ms. Cassidy uses a variety of sources for her notes on shows, from a great interview with Art Linkletter, who brings out all the affection he obviously had for hosting his \\"House Party\\" show on CBS from 1952 through 1969, to internal network programming notes from archives. The latter are particularly effective in illustrating how sensitive officials were at the time in trying to come up with programs that appealed to women without condescending to them (imagine that nowadays). The memos from NBC executives to producers of the now-forgotten \\"Glamour Girl\\" beauty hints show on how to improve the series amid reviews charging it with exploiting its participants are amazing all by themselves.There's more than that in the book, of course. Perhaps most affecting, maybe even disturbing, are the observations the author makes about the leading \\"femshees\\" (program hostesses) of the time and the prejudices they faced from worried executives and sponsors. Kate Smith's obesity made advertisers feel uneasy about having her plug products intended to make women pretty, which led in part to her cancellation just a few years after being the #1 show on daytime TV. Arlene Francis had to \\"dumb down\\" her intelligence on \\"Home\\" in order to have housewives identify with her as both a saleslady and an interviewer of experts on family life. And Bess Myerson had to fight anti-Semitism as well as sexism just to be allowed to do little more than model furs on \\"The Big Payoff.\\" Ms. Cassidy uses examples verbatim from copies of the shows she saw to emphasize her points, and they are excellent.If there is any drawback to this book, one could carp about the lack of coverage of soap operas in depth. However, the serials were nowhere as pervasive on the network schedules then as they are now, and most were only 15 minutes long in the 1950s. It was the informational and variety programs which dominated the landscape the majority of the decade, and Ms. Cassidy is right to focus intensely on them.It may be hard for a daytime viewer of today to accept that there was a time when NBC did live hour-long drama presentations each day on a series called \\"Matinee Theater,\\" but it really happened. So too did shows by Dennis James, Garry Moore, Arthur Godfrey and many others. \\"The Jerry Springer Show\\" and the endless rounds of paternity tests on \\"Maury,\\" among other excesses, could not have been imagined then.Yes, folks, there was a time where executives worried about how to cater to the needs of daytime viewers rather than pander to the lowest common denominator as they tend to do with daytime shows today. If you doubt that, read \\"What Women Watched\\" to have this justified and put into proper persective for you, and maybe even somewhat sorry about how far we have NOT come in daytime programming 50 years later."},{"Title":"What Women Watched: Daytime Television in the 1950s (Louann Atkins Temple Women & Culture Series)","review":"What Women Watched is an absorbing look at daytime television programming in the 1950s. As the decade began, less than 1 per cent of American households owned TVs, but by the end of the decade, 88 per cent had TVs in their homes. Author Marsha Cassidy explores how women in the post-World War II era were portrayed and how they were targeted as consumers.Evening programming had sorted itself out quickly, with shows that appealed to the whole family: dramas, westerns, quiz shows, sitcoms. But daytime programming, not unlike many women after the war, had a hard time defining its role. Many local stations didn't even broadcast during the day. How could the advertisers ignore a market as large as the housewives of America? Many sponsors thought that they couldn't compete with radio because housewives busy doing their chores couldn't spare the time to sit in front of the TV. That's why many of the first daytime shows were variety shows imported from radio that featured music and chat, but nothing visually compelling. The first TV soaps were only fifteen minutes long, for fear that women wouldn't sit in front of the set any longer than that. Locally produced shows usually featured homemaking topics such as cooking, parenting, and sewing.As the decade progressed, the networks hit their stride and came up with successful daytime shows.

Many of the plays were original productions, others were adapted from Shakespeare or modern playwrights. By all accounts, it was a classy show, but it simply could not compete with the increasingly popular soaps. Strangely enough, soap operas were slow to get going on television, because they were still so popular on radio, and the network executives didn't want to risk transferring them to TV, where they might not work as well. In fact, soaps didn't work well at first on TV, because the producers forgot that it was TV and they just had people sitting around talking.

Bredin does a masterful job of assembling all the primary facts of the Affair, introducing and describing all the major actors, and analyzing both the situation that made the Affair possible in the first place and the effects it had on France as a whole. If in the end the account lacks the small degree of passion and moral vision that could have rendered it a masterpiece of historical writing, the dispassion and deliberateness that he employs in his narrative are perhaps appropriate to a tale full of too much passion and too much irrational activity.One of the most striking features of Bredin's history is the amazingly small role that Captain Alfred Dreyfus himself played in the Affair. Not only did he not engage in the activities that caused his being tried for treason to begin with, he was not a major actor in the events that unfurled in the four years following his conviction. Dreyfus, in fact, was almost completely unaware of the Dreyfus Affair as it raged in France, dividing the nation and almost provoking a Civil War and inspiring a military coup d'etat. For most of those in the military who soon realized that Major Walsin-Esterhazy and not Dreyfus was the person engaged in espionage, and that therefore Dreyfus was innocent, Dreyfus's sufferings were utterly unimportant compared to the honor of the Army. Dreyfus the person dropped out, and Dreyfus the innocent victim became a potentially more dangerous threat to the Army than Dreyfus the supposed spy would have been (or Esterhazy the actual spy was). Ironically, after Zola's famous J'Accuse was published and the Affair gripped all of France, Dreyfus again was forgotten as a person. He became, instead, a symbol that the opponents of the Army and the Church could use as a weapon to attack those entrenched institutions. Indeed, when those who were more concerned with Dreyfus the individual rather than Dreyfus the cause, such as his brother Mathieu and his attorney Edgar Demange, undertook actions that were more beneficial to the individual than the cause, they were roundly criticized. Both sides seemed willing to make Dreyfus a martyr.The most painful parts of the book are those that reveal the depth and irrationality of the anti-Semitism of the supporters of the Army and the willingness of the Church and masses to espouse the most paranoid fantasies about the Jews during the Affair. No individual supported Dreyfus's cause on the merits of the case in these person's minds, but only because the Jewish Syndicate had paid them off. Every piece of evidence either exonerating Dreyfus or incriminating either the Army or anyone else was declaimed to be a Jewish forgery. The Dreyfus Affair becomes in this way almost a prequel of the events that were to transpire on a few decades later in Nazi Germany. During Nazi occupation, France would cooperate with the extermination of its Jews to a greater extent than almost any other occupied country.The social effects of the Affair in France are incalculable. If there had been a struggle since 1871 between Republicans and Monarchists, there never was one again. France had unquestionably become a Republic for good, and the political power of the entrenched institutions of privilege--the Army, the Church, and the aristocracy--was shattered for good. Never again would &quot;the saber&quot; truly threaten civilian rule. On the negative side, the Affair also unleashed all the latent anti-Semitism that lay dormant or inactive in the French populace. Many writers have noted that Jews enjoyed a higher standing in French society before the Affair than afterwards. Bredin does an excellent job of noting not merely the main facts and events connected with the Affair, but its aftermath.The book serves also as a cautionary tale. In a time in the United States (where I live) where Civil liberties are under constant threat from the government that is supposed to be their guardian, the story of the ignoring of the rights of an innocent individual and the willingness to elevate the needs of the military and the state, this bit of history has an astounding relevance. As George Santayana famously said, &quot;Those who do not learn from mistakes of the past are doomed to repeat them.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Affair , the Case of Alfred Dreyfus","review":"I first read a concise account of the Dreyfus affair in William Shirer's &quot;Collapse of the Third Republic,&quot; where it was treated principally as the story of the &quot;incredible irresponsibility and venality of the Paris press.&quot; From Shirer's acount, I found it hard to understand how so much willful stupidity and dishonesty could endure for so long and survive so many assaults by reason.Bredin makes the answer all too clear. Of the principal players in this horror show, Dreyfus himself comes across as painfully ordinary -- perhaps because the speed of his court-martial, degradation, and incarceration on Devil's Island left him arguably the least informed Frenchman on the details of the his conviction. The bitter image of Dreyfus, incommunicado in a stucco hut while France was tearing itself apart, is clearest and most poignant for me.It is also the story of incredibly amateurish and unprofessional intelligence services leading France and Germany ever closer to disaster by their ludicrous escapades. But the stories of the incredibly frivolous Maximilian von Schwartzkoppen, who tore up secret correspondence and threw it into a wastebasket to be emptied by a concierge in French service, or the crude and duplicitous Hubert Henry are small potatoes indeed in the general panorama of madness on the eve of a new century in the City of Light.Bredin also makes clear the isolation of a few honest men -- Henri Picquart, Emile Zola, and a few statesmen -- in a turbulent riot of righteous scoundrels, conspiracy theorists, and terrified politicians (sound familiar?).Also made a little -- but not much -- more comprehensible by Bredin is the stubborn unwillingness of the officers of the French Army -- even those who knew or suspected details of the fraud that had sent Dreyfus into exile -- to countenance the simple admission of error and restoration of justice that would have done credit to French institutions. But senior officers had woven a tangled web of lies that finally bound them in rote denial, and may ultimately have prepared the way for disasters that eventually devoured the Republic.Read this book, and read it carefully. Then watch an investigative report on television, and check out the background for yourself. It's scary."},{"Title":"The Affair , the Case of Alfred Dreyfus","review":"Unfortunately, one seldom finds history as engrossing and artfully composed as Jean-Denis Bredin's \\"The Affair.\\" As an American with scant knowledge of fin-de-siecle France or the proceedings against Alfred Dreyfus, I was surprised just how quickly and completely absorbed I was by this book.There are several distinct reasons to recommend reading \\"The Affair.\\" First and foremost, it is an incredible and sobering story. The plot is filled with so much drama, so many eccentric and historically significant characters, bizarre twists of fate and intrigue that by the time you reach the denouement of Dreyfus' acquittal it is nearly impossible to believe that what you are reading actually happened.Second, even with a century's worth of perspective, there are still many debatable points about the Affair. For instance, it has been often repeated that had Dreyfus not been Dreyfus, he would have been Anti-Dreyfus. Bredin explicitly rejects this thesis, but after reading his book I must respectfully disagree. There is much about the Dreyfus Affair that is alternatively poignant, ironic, and tragic. That Dreyfus was personally imbued with and adhered to the principles and cause of his chief adversaries - namely a devotion to hierarchy and order, an unflinching loyalty to the Army and his superiors, and fervent nationalism - is one of them. Ultimately, whether the traitor was guilty or not was beside the point. During the course of the Affair, the Old Regime and its honored institutions, the Army and the Catholic Church above all, were pitted against the agents of Revolution. The Dreyfus that Bredin describes would never have deserted the cause of the Army and national honor to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the radical leftist elements that made up the Dreyfusard community.Finally, the Affair also serves as a cautionary tale for modern readers. The themes that dominated late nineteenth century France - the imminent threat of war with a long-time rival, agitated nationalism in the wake of a national tragedy, reactionary xenophobia and racial profiling - are not foreign to early twenty-first century Americans. It is important to remember that the Dreyfus Affair began quite accidentally; it was the mood of the nation that served as the tinderbox that lit the conflagration. There was circumstantial evidence pointing to Dreyfus as the author of a letter written to the German military attach&eacute; in Paris. That evidence was further supported by prejudice that expected an Alsatian Jew to be a traitor. When the French General Staff embarked on their mission to fabricate evidence against Dreyfus, it was with the complete conviction that they had the guilty party and merely wanted to ensure that he was appropriately punished. That first legal transgression, which seemed rather innocuous at the time, was the root of the conflict, for in order to save itself from that first indiscretion greater illegalities had to be committed. It is not impossible to envision something like this happening domestically in the United States in the course of the War on Terror. Let us pray it never does.Few books have as much to offer as \\"The Affair.\\" It is a truly superlative work."},{"Title":"The Affair , the Case of Alfred Dreyfus","review":"This book is the best, by far, most complete, and most satifying book I ever read on the fantastic and fantastically interesting Dreyfus affair.

It was better than any historical fiction because it is so unbelievably real. Yet, the book reads with the tension of a plot which could not have been crafted better by a Dostievsky or Hugo. If the subject interests you, I say- read this book!"},{"Title":"The Affair , the Case of Alfred Dreyfus","review":"I found Bredin's book to be most useful while doing a project on the Dreyfus Affair and its impact on the Zionist movement; namely, Herzl's personal experience of the Affair and how he utilised the Dreyfus Affair as the pinnacle of antimsemitism in Europe to propagate Zionism.Not only does Bredin focus on the logistics of the Affair with intricate details of the main players and day-by-day accounts, but also uses the impact of the Affair on France and on the world to in a sense show what can be learned from the past, which is what history is all about anyway. A considerable amount of pages is devoted to Theodore Herzl who witnessed Dreyfus' military degradation and humiliation; there were excellent quotes that I could use as evidence of historiography and a summary of Bredin's view.As with any event, there are always ramifications on the individual, the group or the country, which Bredin takes into account thereby widening the scope of the Affair into something of which any reader can take heed."},{"Title":"The Affair , the Case of Alfred Dreyfus","review":"This is an excellent overview of and introduction into the Dreyfus case and the transformation of French society at the end of the 19th century.I began the book without knowledge of the details of the affair or of the political background in France at the end of the 19th century: this had no effect on my ability to become immediately fully immersed in the book.The writing is superb - no doubt thanks to an excellent translation by Jeffrey Mehlman. It is succinct and engaging. The book may be intended for academics, but frankly it flows like a thriller - this was a welcome bonus. This is quite remarkable given that the author constrains himself to reporting only that which his sources verify (which I have to laud - the book abounds with non-intrusive and encouraging endnotes; this, btw, explains why some characters may appear underdeveloped - the book is not a novel). And even though the book is full of quotes, this is a plus - they lend the book credibility; and in any event, they do not detract from its flow. At the same time, although the book is meticulously researched, the research never gets in the way of a story - it frankly left me in awe because an author writing a book of this complexity had to read scrupulously to present this level of detail.I have only minor issues with the book, which do not prevent me from recommending it, however. First, I would have preferred to be spared references to what would eventually happened years later - I prefer that the author would leave me in suspense when reading. Second, I don't really understand why some very important facts are contained in footnotes - the footnotes often contain very interesting information. Third, the book should have provided some insight into how the judicial system worked at this time - it mirrors in no way the American one. But then again, the book was written by a Frenchman in French, and not for Americans, so this absence is understandable. Still, I would have liked to know whether the French judicial system permits hearsay evidence, because most of the evidence presented during the affair came from hearsay evidence.So, to summarize, buy it and read it. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Affair , the Case of Alfred Dreyfus","review":"I agree with all the other reviews- this is certainly a comprehensive account, sympathetic, etc. There are 2 things I feel make it more difficult than necessary to really sink one's teeth into this account. First, too many people who are listed as having taken public stands are merely names. One really has to know a lot about the history of France in this period to put these people in their perspectives. Second, which is related to the first, is the absence of a real historical perspective in terms of what else was going on at the time in France, in Europe, or elsewhere. So while we get a LOT of detail about the Affair itself, and background information on Dreyfus, Alsace-Lorraine, French anti-Semitism, and relations with Germany, the chapters dealing with the impact on French public opinion lose some of their impact because the Affair dominates to the point of almost excluding all else."},{"Title":"The Affair , the Case of Alfred Dreyfus","review":"I love Piers Paul Read's erudition. He began THE DREYFUS AFFAIR by going back to the French Revolution, as he went back to Mohammed and the founding of Islam in his THE TEMPLARS. We learn lots of historical tidbits. For example, he discusses duels, an immensely fascinating subject when done by Read, informing us, along the way, that de Lesseps, of Suez Canal fame, married a second time at age 64 and fathered 12 children on his young wife--of course, de Lesseps was French. We learn too that Dreyfus, a married man, had mistresses. The trial and the degradation make one literally sick to the stomach, and the conditions of imprisonment, remaining deplorable even to this day, is one of the shames that France is ever incapable of remediating. One has to force oneself to read through the suffering on Devil's Island, but through it all this incredible man, Dreyfus, never lost faith in his country's final judgment. He was blessed with a wife--qu'il avait pourtant tromp&eacute;--and with a brother equal to van Gogh's. What is extremely upsetting when one reads of Dreyfus's fight for survival is the knowledge that most of his descendents--most Jews--would eventually be totally exterminated, a reason, among others, why Americans, in their vast majority, believe that present-day Jews must be protected at absolutely all costs. And what to say about Zola: a French god, today lying in the Panth&eacute;on, the greatest honor open to a Frenchman. Another hell of a good book on Dreyfus is Jean-Denis Bredin's THE AFFAIR, a book I've read 6 times because the story is so well told and so moving. In fact, I'm awarding it 5 stars to Bredin as well as to Read. (Read's book has more information, but Bredin tells a more fascinating story.) If you're looking for comic relief, after all the disgusting and dehumanizing attacks on Jews (especially well described in Read's book), then I recommend the absolutely wonder THE DREYFUS AFFAIR by Peter Lefcourt. My own books can be found on Amazon under Michael Hone."},{"Title":"The Affair , the Case of Alfred Dreyfus","review":"The Dreyfus Affair had ramifications which ring into the late 20th century.

Well, Sorrel does tell us what he saw during the war, much of which he spent as adjutant to Lt. General James Longstreet. And in that capacity, he saw a lot. Near the end of the war, after Longstreet was wounded at the Wilderness, he was given a command of his own. Not long afterward he, himself, was seriously wounded.Written at the suggestion of his wife while he recovered from an illness, the general gives a ground level view of the war as a young soldier. Although privy to many decisions made by his superiors, he was not in on the decision making. Sometimes there is a certain naivete about his observances.This more personal view of the battles and times between would be of interest to any student of the Civil War. It is a valuable story, if only for his view of the controversial Longstreet."},{"Title":"Recollections of a Confederate staff officer","review":"Excellent book for someone trying to obtain insight into characters of the conflict. Sorrel is candid and generally does not fall into the &quot;hero worship&quot; that many Confederate Officers did when writing their memoirs.He makes it very clear throughout the book that his observations are his own and may be flawed when viewed historically (and some are).Very easy reading -- not a lot of Victorian memorializing and generally flows well.

The fruits of over 40 years of vigorous Biblical scholarship, Pauline Eschatology is the last work we have from Vos's pen; and it is undoubtedly his most substantial contribution--his magnum opus. The most important developments that Vos makes are the connection between the Apostle's soteriology (doctrine of salvation) and his eschatology (doctrine of the last things). His chapters on the Resurrection and the Eternal State are brilliant. Based on penetrating exegesis, Vos insightfully works out Paul's Christological perspective of salvation, focussing on the objective acts of the Lord's death and resurrection as they inaugurate the new creation, the age to come, and relates that to the individual's personal salvation. Vos further delves the Apostle's pneumatology (doctrine of the Spirit) and demonstrates how the Spirit functions in his central message of salvation.The appendix, &quot;The Eschatology of the Psalter,&quot; is truly inspiring, opening up for his readers the Psalmist's God-centered piety and God-oriented hope.Oriented toward the more scholarly audience, Pauline Eschatology is an invaluable resource for pastors and students alike, but is not completely beyond the grasp of the interested reader. If you pick up only one book on Paul, this one should stand at the top of your list."},{"Title":"The Pauline eschatology","review":"'Revelation could make use of the pre-established harmony which it had itself laid at the basis of its scheme.' p 43Geerhardus Vos raised the curtain when he insisted, 'to unfold Paul's eschatology is to set forth his theology as a whole', p 11, specifically in terms of the two ages, namely, this age and the age to come. The essay which defined Vos' eschatology was printed under the title 'The Eschatological Aspect Of The Pauline Conception Of The Spirit' (printed 1912). The seminal thoughts found there Vos later elaborated on to successfully publish his plenary tour de force in 1930, which marked a stage of development in the theology of Pauline literature not yet known, and hitherto not yet equalled.In Scripture the rapture and renewal of the earth is subordinate to the resurrection - not preceding the resurrection, but said to follow on the resurrection. In fact, our Lord and Christ explicitly stated: 'I am the Resurrection and the Life.' The dispensational hermeneutic specifically misinterprets the singularity of the revelation to be revealed in us, as Paul deals with in Romans 8:18-19. At issue is not just the rapture, as is misleadingly proposed by Tim LaHaye, but a much fuller climactic event. The whole of creation is on tip-toe to see the sons of God revealed, as the inanimate creation anticipates its own renewal, following instantly upon the resurrection of all the dead. With remarkable foresight Vos deconstructed the exegetical excesses of the popularLeft Behindalliance. No other Pauline work has so successfully delimited the patently diverted modern interests of resurrection theology.In OT times 'eschatology' was connected to the Hebrew word, aharit; rabbis would usually introduce the teaching of the messianic age with this specific word, which literally translated means 'hindmost' or 'after that'. Says Vos of the NT usage: 'Acts has but one instance of the use of the phrase, 2:17, and this is a quotation by Peter from Joel 3:1, where the Hebrew does not contain it, but simply says 'after that'. But this easy substitution [Gk: 'and it shall come to pass in the last days'] proves that the formula was thoroughly familiar in early Christian circles. Apart from Paul, the other NT references are: Hebrews 1:2; James 5:3; 1 Peter 1:20; 2 Peter 3:3; 1 John 2:18; Jude 18.' p 7NT believers markedly differ from OT Jews in that they distinctly view themselves already to be living in the 'last days', or the epochal 'after that', or in the 'times of the Gentiles'. The Greek word predominantly used for 'last' is the word eschatos, and for the 'times' [Gk: chronos] and 'epochs' [Gk: kairos] (ESV), Christ reserves exclusively to the knowledge of the Father (Acts 1:7). When related to the plan and purposes of God in history, both the Hebrew and Greek terminology strongly imply that the consummation of such a plan is wholly under divine control and inevitably certain, eventuating in the great and Johannine 'last day' of the Lord. How Vos leads us up to the eternal state is, inevitably, an accomplishment identifiable of true genius. You can try and put a gloss on the rapture, but in the end the reality is unavoidable.'The very name 'coming aeon' [Gk: parousia aionos] is not merely expressive of futurity, but also carries within itself the element of direct successiveness.' p 25'The main structure of Jewish Apocalyptic is embodied in our Lord's teaching as well as in Paul's. And further, 1 Thessalonians 4:15 shows that in an important point of his eschatological program Paul was directly dependent on a word from the Lord.' p 281 Thessalonians 4:15'For we say this to you by the word of the Lord, that we who are alive and remain until the coming of the Lord shall NOT precede those who are asleep.'Vos' aim was to show the clear teaching of Scripture through the denial of chiliasm in refusing to admit this section of Scripture does not teach the rapture or a millennium: 'The use of the verb 'precede' is taken as proof that the question was a mere question of precedence. Paul denies the precedence in the particular form in which the Thessalonians imagined it. There will be no later or earlier as regards believers, no discrimination between the living and the dead as to sharing in the provisional Messianic kingdom. All will be brought by God to be with Jesus at His coming.' p 247 Vos then permitted 'the infallible rule of the interpretation of Scripture is Scripture itself' and introduced into the equation the analogous 1 Cor 15:52 to add more weight to the scriptural import of the all-inclusiveness of the resurrection: 'We shall all be changed...at the last trump, for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible.''It is true that the descent is suspended, only it is not interrupted.' p 136Also most discernible is Vos' interest in the rendering of the eschatological events in too literal a fashion, betraying a misplaced zeal. Says Vos:'It were wrong undoubtedly to reduce all the things mentioned to the rubric of figurative language... On the other hand we should not overlook the equally obvious fact, even with the fullest intent of accuracy, the apostle had to avail himself of a fixed medium of language, which left no room for a margin of over-literalism, and whose interpretation by others, while seemingly in full accord with the words recorded, nevertheless may introduce an ingredient of inadequacy when compared with the actual intent of Paul...missing in reality...his true conception.' p 142This is the correct interpretive method to be applied to the resurrection passages. Sequence must be established according to their co-ordinate, or subordinate place in redemption - and not by manner of an over-literal hermeneutic, giving precedence to certain catchy words, when clearly sensationalism is not called for or indicated by proper exegesis. This is the full Pauline conception of the resurrection, at complete odds with the rapture agenda, which is hereby seen to be negligible in applying faithfully the whole counsel of God found in Scripture, leading those who essentially subscribe to a 'gap theory' directly to faulty teachings like, i.e. 'two comings', 'two elects', and 'two resurrections'. The resurrection-theme Vos held as central to recreation: 'As a fact, and that a fact not lacking doctrinal explanation, it is, next to the cross, the outstanding event of redemptive history.' p 147"},{"Title":"The Pauline eschatology","review":"The Pauline Eschatology, is quite simply what the apostle St. Paul says about the end times. With a title like that, it caught my interest. This is one of the more readable Vos books, he is quite dense (hard to read.) It helps if you start from beginning to end while reading any of his works, however it tends to pick up a few chapters in.I don't have a firm grasp of the material he is putting forth in his work, but it tries to put forward his knowledge of the Greek and Hebrew into a historical interpretative prospective; meaning that he will break down what words mean in the original language and what it meant at the time of the writing. It is not an account at modern translations, but just how somethings can be lost in translation, or how people view what something could mean to us today forgetting what it could have met to the early church.It isn't a book you can read through in a weekend. It helps to take a little bit at a time. It is not going to radically change your theology or anything like that, however it is wonderfully interesting. I would give this work 5 out of 5, however because of the difficulty in reading this, it deserves a 4 out of 5."},{"Title":"A Groovy Guide to Decorating Your Room: 501 Ways to Make it Happen (A Signet book)","review":"This was the little book that started it all for me when I was 13!

( Wagons West Series No 7 )","review":"Dana Fuller Ross' panoramic saga of America's great expansion into the western territories is some of the most intelligent, well written historic fiction I have read. &quot;Colorado&quot; is Book 7 in a series of 24 novels which truly bring history to life during one of the United States' most important and fascinating periods.In 1858, some eight years after the beginning of the California Gold Rush, gold was discovered in the Colorado country. Once again, it was boom or bust as hoards of gold-hungry men swarmed to Colorado, bringing with them many of the same problems that had plagued California before it became a US territory. The North and South were drifting further apart, endangering the Union. The issues went far beyond free vs. slave states. The increasingly industrialized North and the predominantly agricultural South had been developing opposing views on almost every aspect of what constituted US society.General Leland Blake, a veteran of the first wagon train to blaze the Oregon Trail, was called to Washington by President Buchanan. The gold, discovered by southerners from Georgia, was found in the wilderness of Colorado, a place claimed by no state or territory. Geological reports favored finding considerable gold within the next year. The President wanted to secure Colorado country for the Union. He also needed to know approximately how much gold was available. If Civil War broke out, the gold would be of great value to finance the conflict and help to secure a Union victory. Buchanan sends Blake to Colorado with a geologist, both men's wives, and a lawyer. Since the southerners are not to know of the presidential mission, it is to be kept absolutely secret. Blake is to pose as a retired General. His group is supposed to be on a financial expedition to assess Colorado's mineral wealth for future investment.Many of the characters from the first six books appear in &quot;Colorado&quot; and new ones, both historical and fictitious, are introduced. The author gives these characters tremendous depth and illustrates how life in the new land, along with new responsibilities, changes them and effects their relationships. Chet Harris, another wagon train veteran, goes to Colorado along with his partner Wong Ke, to see if they can repeat the mining success they had in California, where they made their fortune. They join with newspaper publisher Wade Fulton, of the Colorado Tribune, to form a voluntary citizen's constabulary to provide law and order. Colorado promised to be as bad as California was, in terms of violence, crime and murder. Lovely Susanna Fulton, Wade's daughter and newspaper editor, solves the mystery of the &quot;Grey Ghost bandit.&quot; Lt. Andrew Brandon, son of the Oregon Trail wagon train master Sam Brandon, and many others also have a part to play in &quot;Colorado.&quot;The history, characters, plot and subplots in this novel are some of the most exciting and dynamic so far. I love history, and while I have read and studied this period in America's development, I have learned so much from reading these seven &quot;Wagons West&quot; books. I plan to continue until I read them all. A wonderful reading experience.JANA"},{"Title":"Colorado !

( Wagons West Series No 7 )","review":"I have read this particular volume which is just one of many sequels on the Holt family saga spanning at last two centuries from the pioneering days of the New World. The stories are amazingly credible. While the stories are fiction, the framework is firmly anchored on historical facts. While the sequels have varied plots and settings, the stories revolve around the Holts and the pioneers of various enthnicities whose courage, honor, selflessness and industry have carved the great nation of America. The wagons west stories are all very fascinating - adventure, humor, pathos, suspense, romance, and drama are all there, presented by the author with sensitivity and good taste that has made the wagons west book series wholesome and knowledge-enriching. The stories have very positive impact on the reader because the author has successfully kept the virtues highlighted while still realistically showing the dark side of men. The stories are universally inspirational in the sense that wagons west glorifies the good attributes of the characters as human persons regardless of their color and creed. The wagons west stories do not only tell the readers how the West was won (as there are so many stories written on this already), but conveys to readers a message that love and justice has no boundaries and out of these virtues - great men and achievements are made. Dana Fuller Ross is a patriot in writing these books. America should thank him for making people appreciate more the value of the American history and its legacy-one that has shaped America's role as the world's leading champion of freedom and justice. I have actually read at least twenty of the Wagons West volumes and still completing the set. My high recommenation, therefore for this particular volume applies to the rest of the series.

Roy Vickery of the Natural History Museum in London has done a vast amount of research to produce this very readable volume.While most of the book consists of an alphabetical list of plants by their common or folk names, it has two additional, and excellent, features. The first is an introductory section titled \\"Plant Lore Studies in the British Isles\\" which establishes a very useful context both for the book itself and for further study of the topic. The writings of most of the earlier English herbalists depended largely on sources from Continental Europe, but from the time Gerard's \\"Herball\\" was published in 1597 more and more local uses of plants were incorporated. By the end of the nineteenth century many of the books on local plant uses were merely repeating previously collected information, mistakes and all. More recent work has seen the careful collection and referencing of folklore related to plants.The second excellent feature is the comprehensive bibliography. It's easily the most comprehensive and wide ranging bibliography I've seen in a readable book for lay people. If you want to do further research there's no better place to start than here.The alphabetical listing of plants give their common names from diferent areas of the British Isles, along with their uses and common beliefs about the plant. It's interesting to note that some of these are remarkably constant throughout the country, while others vary widely.The Oxford dictionary of Plant Lore is like a breath of the British countryside and a reminder of simpler times and a closer connection to our natural surroundings. It is without illustrations but it is a thorough and sensitive compilation of beliefs about plants."},{"Title":"Hard Hat Area","review":"My son loves this book-- it takes you all around a big building site with Kristin the iron worker apprentice.

The condition is great and my grandchild will enjoy it very much I'm sure!"},{"Title":"Nostromo","review":"Often regarded as Conrad's masterwork, Nostromo is also Conrad's darkest novel, filled with betrayals at all levels and offering little hope for man's redemption. A novel of huge scope and political intrigue, it is also a novel in which no character actually wins. All must accept the ironies which fate has dealt them. Setting the novel in the imaginary South American country of Costaguana, the story centers around a silver mine in the mountains outside of the capital, Sulaco, vividly depicting its allure and the price each character pays for its success.When Charles Gould, returns from England to claim and reopen the rich silver mine he has inherited from his father, he has good intentions-- to provide jobs for the peasants and contribute to the economy of the town at the same time that he also profits. Soon, however, he becomes obsessed with wealth and power, and as the political climate gets hotter, he must pay off government officials, bandits, the church, and various armed revolutionaries to be able to work. Each of these groups is vividly depicted as working for its own ends and not for the good of the people, and with their goals focused on the real world, these characters have no self-awareness, nor do they develop it during the novel.In contrast to these \\"unrealized\\" humans, Conrad presents several characters who develop some self-awareness through their experiences. Nostromo, a local legend, is a man of principle who has always kept his word. Martin Decoud, a newspaper man, is a nihilist who has editorialized against the revolution, though he has yet to test himself. Dr. Monygham, captured during a past revolution, broke under torture, and is now seeking absolution by fighting against this revolution. And the good and long-suffering wife of Charles Gould, Dona Emilia, spends her time helping others.When Nostromo agrees to protect a load of silver from revolutionaries by taking it out to sea, Conrad provides a bleak commentary on idealism and human nature. The conclusion, which includes a love story that feels tacked on, reveals Conrad's darkest self and offers little hope of change and even less hope for man's redemption. Rich in atmosphere, vibrant in description, filled with characters representing all walks of life and philosophy, and set in a country where revolution is a way of life, the novel is full of dark portents and bleak political outcomes.

There are many books to be found about individual artists and designers of the period, but hardly any cover the era from as broad a perspective as this one.

I feel lucky to have read the book early in my children's lives, since I now have some specific tools for helping my child become socially confident.The author makes it clear that social issues arise early, and can stick with a child for life.

Although this was an ambitious and ultimately futile attempt for a developing nation to undertake, the Brazilian experience, then and now, did impart useful lessons for other nations, both developing and industrialized, which seek to optimally use the domestic resources available to them.The book begins with an introduction that puts forth the reasons behind Brazil's bioethanol push. Brazil, a large, equatorial nation, has long had a substantial agricultural base, and has sought to use biomass as a means to achieve a high degree of economic independence and a modicum of energy security. The authors of the book wanted to impart the lessons learned in the early stages of the Brazilian bioethanol program, in the hopes that other developing nations would follow their lead.The greater book is organized into ten highly readable chapters covering everything from the various ways in which ethanol can be made to the history, organization, objectives and terse economics of the Brazilian ethanol economy. It turns out that Brazil has a very long history in ethanol production, and only in the last twenty-five years or so has the country seriously pursued the production of ethanol for large-scale fuel consumption.From the book, we learn that Brazil is in many ways a technological pioneer and innovator (something infrequently associated with a developing country), from its long history of using ethanol as a transportation fuel to its continuous improvements in the processes associated with ethanol production. The first two chapters of the book explain the how and the why of ethanol in Brazil, and deftly lay out the reasons and the natural resources that could be utilized in large scale ethanol production in Brazil. The third chapter explains the bureaucratic organization and the political forces behind the Brazilian bioethanol program. Political and govermental forces would later become two of the chief obstacles to the subsequent expansion of bioethanol in Brazil. Chapters four through six impart a general introduction to the ethanol production process and discuss the perceived benefits, largely environmental, of fuel ethanol. Chapter seven dredges up the old dichotomy of crops for food or fuel, and discusses the environmental impacts that large scale bioethanol production can have. Chapter eight tries to make a case for the lesser developed countries to utilize a part of their agricultural production for bioethanol synthesis.Chapter nine takes a look at the future of bioethanol in Brazil, and imparts a rather ominous outlook. The book, written in the early eighties during the Brazilian bioethanol industry's infancy, cites a host of barriers to fuel ethanol, such as public indifference, producer concentration within the existing industry, a tortoise-like bureaucracy, among others. The tenth and final chapter presented an update on the situation as of 1982, a recessionary period in Brazil and the world. Even then, their ambitious program was running into problems, notably stalled growth, feedstock supply disruptions, capacity constraints and the like, but the authors remained optimistic nonetheless.If anything, given the way this unprecedented experiment has turned out, this book definitely serves as a blueprint, as well as a cautionary tale for those who advocate the use of agricultural crops for the production of fuels and chemicals. In addition, the text has considerable value as an introductory reference on bioethanol production. However, it may be difficult for those in the temperate nations to find useful lessons from the Brazilian experience, given that the country has many climatic and natural resource advantages, such as abundant sunlight and rainfall, good soils, excellent climate, and abundant natural resources. Finally, given Brazil's large land mass and small population, its failure to make a bioethanol program using an ideal sugar source function from a technical standpoint really gives a sense of foreboding to other attempts underway globally using lignocellulose for large scale ethanol production.Overall, this book is an overview of a variety of topics surrounding bioethanol, from policy to technology to economics and environment. Those readers who are more interested in up to date information about bioethanol technology may want to read CE Wyman's, Handbook on Bioethanol: Production and Utilization."},{"Title":"The Collector's Edition of Victorian Lesbian Erotica","review":"This is the first book I have ever purchased on Amazon that I had to return. It seemed to have been written by a man, there was not one scene that did not include some type of phallus. I am a fan of Victorian tales and classic from writers like Jane Austin, this book seemed to be written by someone from modern times trying to speak with the syntax and semantics of Victorian times. I would not recommend this collection to anyone who likes sensual and sexual play between women. There were some scenes with incest and rape. I did not get very far in this book, about the first 5 stories, in an attempt to find something worth my time. I returned the book the very next day after receiving it in the mail.Take a look at it in a book store before you purchase it to varify my words."},{"Title":"The Collector's Edition of Victorian Lesbian Erotica","review":"Surely this book is a joke; a very bad joke. I am quite familiar with Victorian Literature and am quite familiar with so called lesbian tales of sex and I am quite familiar with the differences in the way women and men write each. This was written by a man, have no doubt! The Pseudo Victorian style was probably put together in the late 1960s or 1970s when such books seemed to be all the craze. As has been pointed out, there is the problem of incest and rape involved in some of the stories. This is a normal \\"guy thing.\\" I have no doubt that a local yokel frat boy would love this sort of thing, and to be honest, that is just who it was written for. Do not waste your money on this one, nor your time trying to read it. Neither is worth it. A person could take a copy of The Pearl, switch a few words around, and come up with something better than this...what ever it may be. I do not recommend this one and really rather resent the publisher trying to pass this one off as Victorian Lesbian Literature....it is far from it."},{"Title":"The Collector's Edition of Victorian Lesbian Erotica","review":"I seriously question the validity of these stories as real Victorian writing. As another reviewer mentioned, there are no background and bibliographic references whatsoever. I would at least expect approximate dates and publishers of the original texts.My guess is that they were written by a man familiar with Victorian erotica, but some time after the era ended. One clue is that one story describes the woman as a \\"lesbian,\\" a word which didn't come into popular use until well after the Victorian era. Sexologists began using it in 1889, but it is really doubtful that a writer of common porn would be aware of the most recently published scientific writing.On the other hand, the stories are entertaining as some ridiculous little pieces of erotica."},{"Title":"The Collector's Edition of Victorian Lesbian Erotica","review":"For those readers that love lesbian erotica and want to vicariously experience the naughtiness then this certainly is a great book ....The essence of Victorian erotica has always been 'no holds barred' as far as sexual encounters were concerned and the elements of pursuit, capture and ultimate sweet sumission make them the best of the erotica genre. Also, as in this book, many of the greatest stories were written by that famous author 'Anonymous' ... HMMMMThe first story in this book, 'Caroline', we have our young innocent heroine going off to a girls boarding school with the daughter of a family friend. Although she may have come from a repressed household it certainly didn't take Caroline long to teach haer what she really really liked.The sencond story, 'Susy', probably one of the shortest in the book a young waif of a grl is taken into the household of a wealthy lady of society where we find that expectations of grooming her in the world of sapphic love were not really that necessary.This book has 16 short stories and weighs in at a whopping 590 pages..... and .. because it is an antholgy of great Victorian erotica the reader may find some stories 'interesting' while others are so hot they will cerrainly 'rock your boat' ....."},{"Title":"The Collector's Edition of Victorian Lesbian Erotica","review":"I just bought the book \\"The Collector's Edition of Victorian Lesbian Erotica\\" and \\"The Collector's Edition of Victorian Lesbian Erotica\\" from Amazon.

The tone of the book was a bit pedantic and stiff and so I found it a bit hard to to get through.

This book documents a way of life few non-Indian people were privileged to see. The bison shaped the culture of these tribes, the tribes usually killed only what they needed and used all parts of the animal. The various tribes of the plains husbanded the bison herds and the land on which they grazed to insure the survival of this essential source of food and shelter. The buffalo hunt was accompanied by supplication to the spirits and shaman of the tribes and was participated in by all, though only men killed buffalo. The job of others was to clean the kill and cure the meat and hides. The author describes more than one hunting technique. Also, he explains how the Indians developed into skillful horsemen as they evolved from hunting on foot to the use of wild horses.The slaughter of bison populations as whites encroached upon and gradually took over Indian lands resulted in the end of a way of life and the near annihilation of the Plains Indian Tribes in the 50+ years from around 1830 to 1888.The book is illustrated with reproductions of original paintings and drawings of the period by artists such as George Catlin and Karl Bodmer who were adventurer-artists traveling alone, or nearly so, through regions that only a few fur trappers and traders had seen before this time.Freeman has crafted a book with a balanced combination of illustration and information. His book would surpass the most rigorous standards for great nonfiction. It presents information objectively and without bias or opinion and uses beautiful works of art for illustration - the art of both the white and the Indian, from the period under scrutiny. It explains a way of life that has been lost yet does not belabor the point, marginalize the people, or sentimentalize the topic. I would recommend this book highly. It could be used for art projects in schools as well as for factual writing assignments. The author has written other respected informational books for children, e.g., Lincoln: A photobiography, and another about the Wright brothers."},{"Title":"The Life of the Prophet Muhammad - Volume 2: Al-Sira al-Nabawiyya (Great Books of Islamic Civilization Series)","review":"Ibn kathir's the Life of the Prophet Muhammad (Peace Be Upon Him) is one of the celebrated works in the respective field. As a Muslim theologian, he successfully captures various events unfolding in the Arabian Peninsula that necessitates the advent of a messenger from God. He then goes into sketching the Prophet's life before he is endowed with the mission to establish the religion of God. This volume (which is the first of a four-volume series) comes to an end when the Prophet starts preaching the new faith to the polytheistic Arab and some of them start listening to him.Even though the book is very informative, ibn kathir, resorting to the practice of his era, provides as many narrations as possible to relate a single anecdote. He even mentions the chain of narrators from whom he related the story. Though his style is an indispensable tool for a Muslim scholar to discern the authentic reports from the false ones, it, however, affects the smooth reading of the material. In addition, ibn Kathir often leaves the reader in the dark, regarding the authenticity of a story being told, and thus, making it accessible to a scholar only.There are a number of works on the life of the Prophet (PBUH) that relate the authentic stories alone. Ar-Raheeq al-Makhtum and When the Moon Split - both by Safiur Rahman Mubarakpuri; Muhammad Rasulullah: The Apostle of Mercy by Abul Hasan Nadwi are some good books on this subject.Anyway, this book is worth having in your library as a reference to the life of a great Prophet!"},{"Title":"Frommer's South Africa","review":"We visited South Africa for 20 days in July 2000, driving from Cape Town to Kruger.

Mixed in with also a bit of spying at the beginning and Poirot's wit and wisdom this book is fabulous and has an unpredictable but fruitful ending!"},{"Title":"Cat Among the Pigeons (Red Badge Detective)","review":"Agatha Christie, it is not often recognized, was a very good writer. Although her books never achieved the skin-tingling creepiness of John Dickson Carr, the best of the &quot;Golden Age&quot; mystery writers, and though Carr's books are perhaps more re-readable, the writing in Christie's best books (the 30s, 40s) was often as good as any other writer of the period.She was also as good at writing cloak and dagger books as well as convention detective mysteries, though these books are not generally as well known.&quot;Cat Among the Pigeons&quot; should be one of her cloak and dagger books. It veers into John Buchan territory with revolutions in foreign coutries and smuggled jewels. It is not, on the face of it, a Poirot novel. When he makes his appearance near the last third of the book, he is a welcome addition to a plot that's beginning to collapse under its own weight. Instead of being a novel of espionage or a novel of detection, it tries to be both. The result is a novel with three murders, but all of them coming late in the narrative and therefore bunched together. Because the set-up is so long, Poirot is forced to make some quantum leaps beyond his normal logic, that seem more like inspired guesses than deduction. One wonders why he was necessary at all.The book is set at a girl's school and there are many extraneous characters. Christie helps us with her usual page of character descriptions at the start, but many of the names remain little more than names.Christie was a good writer. She normally got to the point and didn't string plot threads together until her books got oppressive. And the two genres she tried to mix in this book could have been combined in a longer, more complex novel. An earlier introduction to Poirot might also have helped. He is anticipated, but, curiously, is never mentioned prior to his introduction and comes out of the blue.It looks almost like two books that have run together. Christie normally didn't waste more than one good plot on a book, but here she has the jewel story, which would've made a crackerjack espionage novel along the lines of _The Secret of Chimneys_; and the murder mystery, in the last half, that would've made a fine, typical Poirot novel. A young detective who goes undercover in the book would've made a fine solver of the jewel story.Too, many of the elements of this novel seem borrowed. The young detective's superior comes off as a lethargic version of Carr's H.M., for instance.However, one warning: there is an element of the jewel plot that you will guess almost immediately, and wonder why Christie was so obvious with it. Further reading shows that to become more complex, and the reason she wants us to guess it early seems to be so she can take a sudden left-turn with it. But the element itself is not, it turns out, very important to the plot and she can allow us a few pages to think we're clever.If you are a long-time Christie fan and want to read all her books, _Cat Among the Pigeons_ is a must; if you're just starting Christie, you might want to read a dozen or so others before getting to this one."},{"Title":"Cat Among the Pigeons (Red Badge Detective)","review":"This 1959 novel begins in a fictional mideastern country.

Various unusual occurances begin to take place at the school, strange visitors, unusual behavior among the staff and then murder and kidnapping.One of the students uncovers part of the secret and decides that she needs outside help so she contacts Hercule Poirot. Poirot, of course, resolves the mysteries both large and small that have been plaguing the school.There are more characters introduced in this novel than is usual in Christie's work which makes this one of the more challenging of her work to figure out. There are several subplots woven into the action that things confusing as well. This is a departure from Christie's usual 'cozy' stories of village life or house parties. It is more of a thriller than her usual work, some of her most sympathetic characters are killed and Poirot only appears at the end of the novel. Even so it is a very enjoyable mystery and one of my personal favorites.We are also treated to an update on the Summerhills, old friends from a previous book, MRS. McGINTY'S DEAD. Mrs. Summerhill is a friend of one of the students' parents. Poirot is delighted to hear that although Mrs. Summerhill's house is still disorganized and her cooking is generally deplorable she makes wonderful omelets, a skill that she learned from him."},{"Title":"Cat Among the Pigeons (Red Badge Detective)","review":"Whose work are we actually reading at this point? There were already major differences in punctuation, word choices, and scene breaks between the original Collins and Dodd Mead editions of this novel. There were further differences between the Dodd Mead editions republished by Random House/Avenel and the Dodd Mead editions republished by Simon & Shuster/Pocket. There are further additions still in the recent Signet, Berkley, and Leventhal and Black editions. For every publishing house putting out her works, there seem to be a new batch of editors altering Agatha Christie's words and the sound of her voice. Here the publishers at Collins, dissatisfied with their own earlier efforts, put still more distance between author and public with a \\"New Ed\\" edition. What's the matter with these publishers? Whose voice do they think we want to hear when we sit down to a novel by Agatha Christie? And what will she sound like twenty years from now? It's frightening that her estate has failed to see the importance of guarding her words as she wrote them. Please tell me I'm not the only one here who senses that a crime has been committed."},{"Title":"Cat Among the Pigeons (Red Badge Detective)","review":"I first read this book when I was twelve, about the same age as the main characters in the story. Some of the motivations of the adults seemed murky to me, but the children, especially young Julia, were all spot on! Good work writing about children, as is typical of Agatha (CROOKED HOUSE) Christie."},{"Title":"Cat Among the Pigeons (Red Badge Detective)","review":"An English pilot for a Middle Eastern ruling prince just managed to hide a fabulous fortune in gems somewhere in his sister's room, just before the prince was overthrown in a revolution. The unsuspecting sister returned to England with her daughter, just in time for the girl to start in Meadowbanks, an &eacute;lite girls school, where a female cousin (& fiance) of the deposed prince, was also arranged to attend.Several interested parties had been on the prowl searching for the gems, the pilot's efforts had not been as clandestine as he had hoped. With new girls, new teachers, and also a new young handsome male gardener, was it a wonder that some residents of Meadowbanks felt as if there was a hidden cat among the pigeons.Agatha Christie painted an excellent picture of an English public school going about its daily business. There were staff as well as students who were trying to get use to a new environment. There was a headmistress, who having successfully established the school according to her vision after years of struggle, was considering passing the torch to the next generation. There were old faithfuls among the staff who were less prominent but had heard and seen much of what others missed.Meadowbanks was probably Agatha Christie's of what an ideal school should be like.Having got the background set, Agatha Christie got down to business with the first murder, the victim being a rather unpopular new staff in the recently completed Sports Pavilion. Readers would have been given enough outright hints before this as to what would be of interest in the Sports Pavilion. The object of the mystery quickly turned from recovery of the gems to the discovery of the murderer.Midway, a second murder almost threw the investigators off-track, and a third murder was committed before Hercule Poirot who was called in late in the game seriously got down to business.Mystery readers could find little fault in way which the authorities set about trying to find the culprit, but it took bringing back a student's mother from Anatolia to trap the murderer.All the while, Christie managed to maintain a light hearted atmosphere despite the deaths in the story, with occassional injection of humour and wit. She included important and interesting roles for the diverse characters from students to faculty to police to parents in how the mystery was played out. This is truly one of her most readable book."},{"Title":"Cat Among the Pigeons (Red Badge Detective)","review":"Cat Among the Pigeons is a book that shows what Agatha Christie can do. It is a well-written page turner. The plot is exciting from beginning to end and the characters are all interesting. The only small problem with this book is the numerous amount of characters.

The fact that this has to do with a school and the possibility of the murderer being one of the children was paticularly horrifying--but not out of Dame Christie's reach.In fact, I was expecting this to be focused on a more psychological view-point, something reminiscent of Endless Night or Crooked House. However, this was nothing more than a harmless novel with murder, murderer, and motive--the only difference its being in a school. I suppose the only reason I gave this 4 stars is because I was quite anticipating something different. But who can blame me?

Slueth extrodinaire Poirot makes an unusally late appearance but, this serves to only highten his effectiveness and our interest. Ms. Christie's masteries include the ability to make us like and even care about characters in as little as 2 or 3 sentences. By doing this she clouds our judgement on motive, deception, and the ability to deduce what only becomes obvious after another classic Poirot confrontations with the suspects.

The Special Branch and local police try to solve the string of murders among the schoolmistresses, but it takes Hercule Poirot's little grey cells to see through the disguises and subterfuge and bring all the loose ends together.

Agatha Chrisitie is my favorite author and she will always be!I Recommend you read this one!"},{"Title":"Cat Among the Pigeons (Red Badge Detective)","review":"This was one of Agatha Christie's &quot;not so good&quot; books. Thankfully there aren't many but they do exist. Perhaps she should not have mixed genres (spy thrillers and crime). Mind you, there isn't a James Bond chase scene in the book but the opening pages takes the reader to a fictional Arab nation on the verge of a coup d etat and sees its young prince exchanging ideas with his English pilot on how to smuggle out the royal jewels.I am not spoiling anyone's surprise when I say the deaths in this novel are connected directly or indrectly to the jewels (which have ended up in a girls school, by the way). The three murders all come rather late in the book and as such the revelation of the culprit by Poirot feels rushed.Yes, the book is touted as a &quot;Hercule Poirot mystery&quot; although we only get to see him three quarters into the story. Since almost all of the investigation was handled by the local inspector, an undercover Special Branch officer and a very intelligent girl, it would have been better if they tied it all up with no need for Poirot to show up.All in all, I was not impressed with Cat Among the Pigeons. Those new to her work should start with other titles as this one may turn them off Agatha Christie, who was a good mystery writer actually. Her mystery novels usually ends with the reader (me, in this case) gasping and going, &quot;Damn! She's good.&quot;This one didn't. Nuff said."},{"Title":"Cat Among the Pigeons (Red Badge Detective)","review":"Really, I don't think Cat Among Pigeons is considered one of Agatha Christie's best works. How can it be? The story starts very slowly, with no real narrative hooks in the plot at all. There are superficial facts about characters in the book that really don't affect the story at all. It just fill up pages. Then, the murder of the gamesmistress is discovered near the middle of the book, which I think is another mistake. How can you expect the reader to keep on reading when they figure out that the actual murder is a long time coming? Then, the famous Hercule Poirot (who is the only reason that I read this book) is introduced very lately into the book.I think another reason that I really didn't like this book was because there are so little suspects in the book. I mean, you can right off the bat count off numerous people. Plus, there are many who were incapable of actually commiting the main murder, and this also eliminates many but a few.All in all, I was disappointed by Cat Among the Pigeons. If you are looking for a real Hercule Poirot thriller, look for Murder on the Orient Express or The Murder of Roger Ackroyd."},{"Title":"Cat Among the Pigeons (Red Badge Detective)","review":"This is one of my favorite books from Agatha Christie's later years. Her grip of story telling, plotting and planning is still strong. There is some humor in the narrative and amusement is provided by many of the characters.Agatha Christie tries her hand at the girls' school setting here. Older reader will suspect that she was well-acquainted with similar settings chosen by A A Milne and Dorothy Sayers, and that she had been brought up on the once popular school girl annuals. Of course there needs to be a raison d'tre behind the series of murders that occurs at the school and this is well narrated also.I have mentioned the narration several times. It is an element that helps explain this writer's phenomenal popularity. She gets the timing right. Other writers in this genre produce more elegant prose but somehow fail in this regard.At this time in her career, Agatha Christie was experimenting with narrative methods. She attempted the \\"quick scene change\\" method here, and brings it off with skill and flair. She also, at this time in her career, frequently milked the situation where something was briefly glimpsed in a mirror, or a familiar face briefly glimpsed at a great distance. Watch out for these occurrences as you turn the pages to reach Hercule Poirot's final revelation of just who is the cat among the pigeons."},{"Title":"Cat Among the Pigeons (Red Badge Detective)","review":"Cat Among the Pigeons by Agatha ChristieBlack Dog & Leventhal, 1959297 pagesHercule Poirot Mystery4/5 starsSummary: Meadowbank School is an outstanding school for young girls which is suddenly rocked by the murder of the new games mistress. Was she too curious for her own good? Does it have some connection to the recent revolution in a Near East country? (Hint: yes) Never fear: Hercule Poirot and his little grey cells are on the case.Thoughts: The book opens with a four page list of the characters, which I read hoping to get set for reading this. Instead it overwhelmed me and I had to just keep reading in order to be able to follow it. There are a lot of characters, mostly female because the actions takes place at a fine girls' school. The opening is very confusing as it shifts from Meadowbank to that Near East country to two females who connect both places. Headmistress Miss Bulstrode of course made me think of Millicent Bulstrode of Slytherin but luckily she's a much nicer person and Eileen Rich is consistently described as ugly although I cannot fathom why that's relevant to the story.There seem to be long passages where nothing is really happening. I found it easy to read and I was motivated to finish it. Interestingly Poirot doesn't show up until basically two-thirds of the way through the book. Yet he solves it fairly easily by picking up on a few strands. I didn't solve the murder (er murders) but I don't mind. I should have noticed something was up about that person but I didn't connect it fast enough. I also thought there was going to be a romance (I like the little romances Christie sometimes throws in) but I was wrong.Overall: A fine outing although somewhat confusing and less engaging than Christie's best.

I simply HAD to be reading Cat Among the Pigeons, no matter what else I was reading at the time. I would alternate between two different Agatha Christies and this one, and it actually lasted about a year! That's my testimonial to how absolutely perfect Cat Among the Pigeons is.And what makes this book so great and worth the money? Well, for one thing, Agatha did a flawless job of capturing atmosphere in this book. Ramat doesn't even exist, I don't think, yet I could feel myself there, feel the heat, practically see the opulence of the unfortunate young prince's palace, and feel the current of danger and imminent disaster present in every Ramat scene. I have no idea how she did it, because she was never one to give readers a lot of local flavor. And now, here is Agatha Christie making us feel the heart of an IMAGINARY CITY!The same goes for the girls' school. I could clearly picture Meadowbank in my mind, with its lazy afternoons and young students concerned more with boys and hiding places for cigarettes, than the relationship between Iago, Desdemona, and Othello.The characters could reach out and tap you on the nose, they are made so perfectly. There are no faceless, plastic people in this novel (not that there always are in other Christies.) I've often mentally applied Christie's wonderful description of Ann Shapland's hair to other people in my life: &quot;hair that fitted her like a black satin cap.&quot; And even though there isn't much else to Julia Upjohn's physical description besides having a freckled face like her mother, she forms a distinct appearance in my mind because of Christie's description of her personality. I don't want to give too much away, but I'll say that she's the kind of girl that Poirot would respect.And last but never least: How is the actual 'mystery' part? Well, as other reviewers have said, you will have NO IDEA who 'did it.' I can guarantee it. Truthfully. Honestly. You will pause for a second in that wonderful Agatha-Christie-Stupor while it soaks into your head. So don't worry about that part. Agatha didn't miss with this book. The shock effect for this one is one of the highest I've actually ever felt, higher than Death on the Nile, and actually getting up there with Roger Ackroyd and Orient Express. I'm serious! That's how surprising this mystery/thriller is.To sum it all up: The atmosphere is great, the characters are great, the mystery is perfect, and oh yes! I nearly forgot! The thrill factor is VERY high! There is one particular scene toward the end (it involves a chair; that's all I'll say) that will make you AT LEAST a little paranoid that there is someone watching you. Very creepy and very well done. That happens many times throughout this book.Cat Among the Pigeons is one of the best. To be fair, it is THE best of all the mystery/thrillers. Buy it and enjoy it!"},{"Title":"Cat Among the Pigeons (Red Badge Detective)","review":"This is definitely one of Christies best novels, right up there with Death Comes as the End, And Then There Were None, and Murder in Mesopotamia.Yeah, ok, she might not be a literary genius, but she definitely has genius of a kind. She practically invented this type of detective novel (i'm not counting Conan Doyle. Why? Because i hate his ludicrous novels), using the brain, whilst at the same time creating great character sketches.She doesn't develop her characters loads, but then, that is NOT what her novels are about. they're about enjoying a great puzzle. And boy, can she construct a great puzzle! The one here is probably the bestm in that is lacks Hercule Poirot for about the first three quarters (some of her best books were those which were without Poirot or Marple). through that she was able to create a good psychological detective story, then bring Poirot in at the end to tie it all up neatly and provide the solution.The climax is great, and probably one of her best. I read this when i was about 12, and was not at all versed in the workins of a detective novel, in that it is the least likely person who did it. I just enjoyed the read, and was gladly surprised when i found out the identity of the culprit. No doubt, those with mroe experience would have been able to spot the killer straight away. However, this remains one of her best novels, and one which i will enjoy reading again and again."},{"Title":"Cat Among the Pigeons (Red Badge Detective)","review":"this is a really good Agatha Christie.

And after a more than thirty year hiatus I have found the reading as fresh and entertaining as ever. The author has an engaging style that holds the attention throughout the writing, and this is certainly evident in \\"Cat Among the Pigeons\\". From the first pages the reader is provided with a detailed and intimate acquaintance with the physical setting as well as the characters, and this is developed and carried throughout the ensuing pages.

Mystery is not a genre I read a lot of, but Christie is so well-known I thought I'd give it a shot. Many novels do have elements of mystery in them, of course, particularly in hiding certain plot points or motivations until the end, so I am familiar with the conventions. I find that mystery, like many other things in life, is at its best before everything is revealed. Monster movies are always scarier when you don't see the monster than when you do. Cat Among the Pigeons is no different. I think it has a satisfying reveal, but Christie cheats a little to throw us off track.I like Christie's writing style. She sprinkles plenty of wit and humor throughout her storytelling. There is a general feeling amongst the characters that there is a cat among the pigeons. Somebody doesn't belong, but nobody can put their finger on who. The reader will have their guesses, of course, based on evidence and hunches. Christie throws out plenty of red herrings, and it's our job to try and see past these distractions. I had an idea of who the murderer was, but I was proved wrong. At first I was okay with this, but as Christie revealed more details I felt like she cheated. Something happens that leads us off the trail of the killer, and while there is motivation behind this something that happens, it is nonetheless difficult to believe it would happen. I will leave this vague so as not to spoil anything for you.Other than this, there was plenty to enjoy. The description of the workings of Meadowbank were fun to read, as was getting to know the key characters like Miss Bulstrode, who seems to amaze everybody, even the narrator. The introduction of Hercule Poirot feels random, but I guess it is necessary to solve the mystery. The early scenes in Ramat were also effective. There's a brief moment of interesting political discussion that took me off guard. The prince of Ramat can't understand why his people want to rebel against him. He wants to enact welfare programs to help his people, where his father was a murderous tyrant. Yet they want to oust the nice one. He's hurt and bewildered by these developments. It's as though his people aren't ready for a progressive leader just yet. The prince is left wondering the same thing as Miss Bulsrode - why murder at all?"},{"Title":"Cat Among the Pigeons (Red Badge Detective)","review":"I admit that I like old-fashioned books like Agatha Christie's. For me this was not a \\"typical\\" Christie book, which is probably one of the things I like about her so much - I find that often, her books are not quite what I expect them to be. In this case, a coup in a Middle Eastern country, a missing sack of precious jewels, and murder at an exclusive girls' school in England mix for a fun and fast read. I like the way Christie does international intrigue; and it's also interesting to see how the unrest in the Middle East of the 1950s continues today.Another interesting thing about the book is that Hercule Poirot doesn't show up until the last third. As much as I like Christie, a little bit of Hercule goes a long way. (I often find the mysteries in the Hercule books \\"better\\" than the mysteries in the Miss Marple books, but I do enjoy Miss Marple's company more.) So, this was just the right amount of M. Poirot for me. As usual, he asks his crazy questions, like \\"Did anyone notice her knees?\\", that turn out to be quite useful in uncovering the mystery.Something else I noticed was Christie's wit. Interestingly, I don't usually think of Christie as in the \\"witty\\" category, but there is a nice sprightliness in the book that keeps the pages turning. The characters are well drawn, too; I know there are critics who complain about Christie's \\"lack of characterization,\\" but the personalities at the girls' school are very nicely drawn. Overall, I enjoyed the mixing of the genres here and found CAT AMONG THE PIGEONS to be a pleasant summer read. Of course, it's not one of her very greatest (like TEN LITTLE INDIANS, MURDER ON THE O. EXPRESS, ROGER ACKROYD) but it's not one of her pretty bad ones (like ELEPHANTS CAN REMEMBER or POSTERN OF FATE).Enjoy - and if you have a teenager who likes mystery, get him or her into trying Agatha Christie. A great way to help teenagers become lifelong readers."},{"Title":"Cat Among the Pigeons (Red Badge Detective)","review":"Agatha Christie (1890-1976) is generally thought of a mystery novelist, the creator of Hercule Poirot and Jane Marple--but she varied her output from time to time, writing several celebrated plays, numerous short stories, and occasionally turning out a novel that was more of a thriller than a mystery. Such is the case with the 1959 novel CAT AMONG THE PIGEONS, which begins lightly enough among school girls attending the famous Meadowbank school in England and then unexpectedly seques to a revolution in the middle east, stolen jewels, a kidnapping, and three murders.Although most of the story plays out at Meadowbanks, the plot pivot is in the middle east, where revolution threatens progressive Prince Ali Yusuf. In an effort to protect himself and at least part of his fortune, the prince gives his personal pilot, Bob Rawlinson, an extremely valuble package of jewels and asks Rawlinson to find a way to move them to England. Rawlinson agrees and hides the jewels among the luggage carried by his unwitting sister and niece, who are visiting the area but are scheduled to return to England shortly. That same day Rawlinson and the prince attempt to escape the country on an airplane, but sabatoge causes the aircraft to crash and both are killed. It becomes apparent that the jewels are not among Bob's sister's luggage; the must therefore be in the luggage of his neice, schoolgirl Jennifer. To further complicate matters, Jennifer is not the only student at Meadowbanks with a connection to prince Ali Yusuf; his cousin, Shaista, is a student as well, and it seems likely that the jewels will find their way to her.No sooner are the girls settled at Meadowbanks than not one but two murders occur. Fortunately, Jennifer has a sharp-minded school friend named Julia Upjohn, daughter of a woman who worked in military intelligence during World War II. Julia soon realizes that there is a problem, unravels the story of the missing jewels, and after an inspired guess locates them as well. But now her own life is in danger, and Julia wastes no time in going to the celebrated Hercule Poirot, who produces a final solution--but not before a third death ensues.CAT AMONG THE PIGEONS is not among the first rank of Christie's novels; although she clearly had fun writing it, and writing similar novels, her gifts did indeed turn more toward the intricate plotting required of her mysteries and less toward the action-adventure required of a thriller. Even so, it is a very enjoyable read--for both fans and newcomers a like. Recommended.GFT, Amazon ReviewerIn Memory of Floy Bennett"},{"Title":"Cat Among the Pigeons (Red Badge Detective)","review":"Agatha Christie choses an illustrious girl's school as the setting to Poirot's latest mystery, though Poirot himself is not a major player in the proceedings, appearing for the first time well over halfway through the book. Instead most of the action centers around the staff of Meadowbank School, and its tone resembles that ofthe Tommy and Tuppence storiesconsidering its emphasis on espionage and international politics.Mrs Bulstrode rules over Meadowbank School with pride and competence, having established it from virtually nothing many years ago with her college Miss Chadwick. The two women now run the most exclusive girl's school in England, though unbeknownst to them, events are happening on the other side of the world that will have a huge effect on the school. When a cache of precious rubies goes missing from Ramat after an uprising against the monarchy, special agents across the globe narrow their search down to Meadowbank School thanks to a link between the Sheikh of Ramat's English pilot and a young student at the boarding school.Secret international forces converge on the school, leading to a cloak-and-dagger mystery, with plenty of secret identities, buried secrets, hidden jewels, and of course - murder most foul. When an unpopular teacher is found dead in the new Sports Pavilion the police are called in, but none of them have any idea as to the purpose behind such a killing. Only one thing is certain: that one of the school's staff is involved; the proverbial cat among the pigeons.Setting the story in a girl's school was an enjoyable change of pace, as Christie deftly paints the interrelations between a suspicious staff and the excited girls, all with their own secrets, opinions, viewpoints and understanding of the world around them. Though the characters are not particularly well-drawn (and a few are simply names on a page), the atmosphere of a school is well-handled and lends the book an added sense of danger considering the close proximity of so many innocent lives. In many ways, this is a \\"woman's book\\", given its emphasis on gossip, blackmail, mothers and the allure of jewels.Sometimes too many things - like the jewels' hiding place and the reason behind the focus on the school - are telegraphed too early, and as blasphemous as it may sound, I felt that the gradual uncovering of revelations were better handled in therecent television adaptation starring David Suchet, as well as being better paced in general thanks to Mark Gatiss's screenplay.\\"Cat Among the Pigeons\\" is certainly not Christie's best Poirot novel. Perhaps by this time she was running out of steam, not to mention struggling with her well-documented frustration with the fastidious little Belgian. Devoted Christie fans will want to finish \\"Cat Among the Pigeons\\" for the sake of completion, but newcomers to Christie's work may wish to start their reading experience elsewhere - say withThe Mysterious Affair at StylesorThe Murder of Roger Ackroyd."},{"Title":"Cat Among the Pigeons (Red Badge Detective)","review":"This is the first Agatha Christie I have read after my class was required to read a mystery novel written by one of the authors during the Golden Age of Mystery. I have to say, I was impressed. It was a little slow at the start, but it is to be expected in most of her books. Once the first murder occurs, though, things pick up pretty fast. This takes place in one of the best girls' schools. But what happens when the best girls' school has a murder? Is it the best?See if you can find out who the killer is!"},{"Title":"Cat Among the Pigeons (Red Badge Detective)","review":"I absolutly loved this book. Although Hercule Poirot doesn't come in untill closer to the end of the book, this is in my oppinion one of the best Agatha Cristie's and it will keep you guessing to the last page."},{"Title":"DAWN SONG","review":"You're going to hear a lot about Michael Marano's debut novel, Dawn Song. You're going to read all about how literary it is, how intelligent, how beautifully written, how subtle and scholarly. Okay, all that's true, but I'm here to tell you how hard it kicks butt.This book rocks. It's gripping, fascinating, bizarre, and most of all, scary. Set in Boston in the bitter winter of 1990, Dawn Song is the story of a desperate battle between two major princes of Hell. Both want supremacy over the Earth; Belial, the Unbowed One, seeks to obtain souls through eloquent entrapments and sensual conquests of human weakness, while Leviathan, the Enfolded One, just wants to infect the world with brainless violence. The Unbowed One sends a beautiful succubus to the Earth to carry out his will and spread his influence, which she does with innocently evil gusto. Many humans become entangled in her web of sex and soul-devouring death, including Lawrence, a nave young gay man, and Ed, a brilliant, troubled professor of theology. When the nightmarish Enfolded One (who has basically caused the Gulf War by rolling over in his sleep) gets wind of the succubus's many horrific accomplishments, he reaches out into the human world, possesses a hapless teacher, and the brimstone really hits the fan.Dawn Song has all the good stuff. Sex, violence, beauty, madness, terror, paranoia, love, hate, hope and despair. Rest assured, you'll be taken on an emotional roller coaster as soon as you crack the cover. And you'll be scared. Will you ever. One of the most horrifying aspects of the whole story is the fact that (although you find yourself rooting for the sensual Unbowed One) no matter which one of the demonic lords may win in the end, we, the human race, are hosed. It's like the difference between being eaten by Hannibal Lecter or Leatherface. One may serve you up on a silver platter with a glass of Chianti, the other on a TV tray with a bottle of Yoo Hoo, but either way, you still end up et. It's not a ple! asant thought, and it gives the book a creeping aura of menace that sets the reader on constant edge.So check it out. Dawn Song will stretch your brain in directions you've never dreamed about. Just don't plan to sleep well for awhile."},{"Title":"DAWN SONG","review":"Dawn Song is a brilliant debut, superbly written, intelligently plotted, and skillfullly peopled with a most intriguing array of characters. It's chilling, and inspires such abject awe.... A magnificent tale of dark magick and human interrelations."},{"Title":"DAWN SONG","review":"It is frightening how good this book is. For a first book this has got to be one of the strongest releases ever. Michael Marano does a wonderful job of capturing the snobbish and desperate attitude of the typical Bostonian. His approach to demonology and the landscape of Hell is fresh and believable. There are a lot of characters to keep track of but they each have a unique personality which makes them all quite memorable. A fine book. I can't wait to see what he does next."},{"Title":"DAWN SONG","review":"It took me a while to get really &quot;into&quot; this one. However, I was really hooked from page one because I just couldn't put it down. The writing is lyrical, nearly poetic, the images created are haunting. The novel introduces a series of characters on a variety of levels; nothing is truly as it first appears in this novel. The Succubus is such an incredible character; she is erotic and dangerous without any other motive than to fulfill her purpose for coming to earth. Her image will stick with you throughout this read. The dialogue is intelligent and realistic, the images are sharp, and the plot keeps building throughout the novel. This is a must-read for the intelligent horror reader."},{"Title":"DAWN SONG","review":"Beautifully and thoughtfully written, Michael Marano obviously knows both theology and horror, a combination which has alternately fascinated and terrified readers throughout the ages. Not only will DAWN SONG thoroughly capture the reader, it will educate and enlighten. This book is meant for strong-hearted, intelligent readers who want to think about what's going into their minds and prefer to challenge their ideals. A stunning first novel, and I'm eagerly looking forward to Marano's next novel."},{"Title":"DAWN SONG","review":"I have read people comparing this to the &quot;Vampire&quot; series and I disagree. Ms. Rice will take entire chapters to make you feel like you know a person in her books. Mr. Morano, by using characters based on ordinary people with ordinary emotions and real life reactions to those problems, has been able to make each person in the book seem &quot;real&quot; in a few short pages. Not to mention that the main charecter of the book, a succubus, a _demon_, becomes something you root for. She is what she is and does not try to find &quot;meaning&quot; in her being &quot;evil&quot; like Ms. Rice needed to do for Lestat. I liked the Lestat books, but I would not put these two together."},{"Title":"DAWN SONG","review":"This novel is a succubus in itself. Its intense brooding darkness contained a subtle style and atmosphere that produces in the reader a new strain of melancholy. It reminded me of the best of Ellison and Ligotti and moves the genre to someplace that demands to be called &quot;Literature&quot;, yet doesn't forget its roots."},{"Title":"DAWN SONG","review":"What is realy surprising about this book is that this is a first for Michael Mirano. The characters were very believe-able and well developed. The plot was well thought out, original, and took unexpected turns at times. You have to read this book to really appreciate it! It is a real page turner! Gripping and suspensful."},{"Title":"DAWN SONG","review":"Michael Marano is quite a talented writer. The greatest strengh he reveals in his first novel is character development. Whether the character in question is one of the novel's major figures or one of the victims in the supernatural war being waged in the streets of Boston, Marano spends time to fully flesh each character out, so that the reader really gets to know the character well. This is particularly effective when Marano makes the reader begin to like a character, just to have him killed by a demon three pages later. In addition, because there are so many well-thought-out characters, it's difficult to tell who the hero of the novel is, or whether there even *is* a &quot;hero&quot; in the standard sense.The plot is thought-provoking as well. When two demons battle for world dominion, who is the &quot;good guy&quot;? Marano deftly avoids the plot pitfall of bringing in God to quash the demons and restore everything to normal, which was refreshing. Instead, the tensions keep mounting until the novel's end, which makes for compelling reading. I had to finish the book in one night because I couldn't go to sleep without knowing what was going to happen next."},{"Title":"DAWN SONG","review":"I must state my prejudices up front: I've known Michael for twenty years, but in a way, that makes me even a harsher critic, because I know what he's trying to do, and I know if he's pulled it off. I'm not surprised to learn that he has. Most of the other reviews have told you the plot, so I won't bother. What I will get into are the pieces no one has picked out, the overriding metaphors of banality in sex, in life, in the need for a place. The succubus is nothing without her soul, a being trapped between bad and bad, yet the cruise to find her soul is nearly worse. She loves her victims in a way that nearly no one else could, made more poignant by the fact that her victims themselves are unloved. She *is* the madonna-whore, the prostitute who needs love. Yet every tender touch, every bit of physical empathy leads to death. The AIDS metaphor, the love = death. This novel is a world of hurt, knifing you in the chest, but only killing you with a thousand little cuts, subtle and in-your-face at the same time. I'm proud of you, my friend."},{"Title":"DAWN SONG","review":"DAWN SONG is hard to &quot;review&quot; as most books are reviewed in that it is such a refreshing deviation from the norm; it is moody, clever, mind-bending, and completely enthralling. It is a novel of dread and terror, yet in a class by itself, so that I hesitate to use the genre &quot;horror.&quot; Certainly one I'd recommend, and highly, to those tired of the cliched novels of fear that come across as &quot;movies we've all seen before and can quote the lines and pinpoint the time the cat will jump out at us.&quot; This is so thick with style it literally becomes part of the plot itself. This is a book in which you submerge yourself, you get sucked into, as if in a surreal and terrifying dream. Laced with the supernatural and contempory front-page news, this is a must! Check it out! And congratulations to the author for the well-deserved awards!"},{"Title":"DAWN SONG","review":"Genuinely frightening story of unforgettable 3-dimensional characters in combat with devils. Beautiful and disturbing, this dark tale will stick in your mind for many years."},{"Title":"DAWN SONG","review":"An interesting story, but the author tried to do too much in 400 pages. Too many characters and too many voices resulted in a somewhat awkward tale full of flat, one-note caricatures. At first, I found it somewhat misogynistic, as the first hundred pages lacked a single female character that wasn't a monster, a nutjob, or a complete waste of oxygen; as I read on, I realized that the male characters weren't any better, there were just more of them. Being un-Christian, and especially un-Catholic, I just didn't \\"get\\" a lot of the horror aspects of this book, either. Ho-hum, the Succubus is killing someone else now, next? This is the author's first novel, though, so maybe the next attempt will be better. Not a horrible book, but not compelling enough to take with me to finish on a plane."},{"Title":"DAWN SONG","review":"Michael Marono is a superb writer. His style is beautiful. His descriptive prose is original and does nothing to deviate from the story, in fact, it enhances it. My problem with the book was that there was simply too many characters. It got real annoying trying to remember names and storylines. Plus, I hated when the author would begin a new segment with three or four paragraphs of descriptive writing without informing the reader of who the heck he was talking about. Dawn Song is a good solid story that comes across as convoluted at times."},{"Title":"DAWN SONG","review":"I see I'm chiming in late with a review of Dawn Song, published in 1998, but I just recently discovered it. I read the other reviews with interest and agree with most. This is kind of like Ann Rice meets Martin Amis with a strong nod to TS Eliot and Yeats -- all of which makes for a compelling if wordy read, an apocalyptic vision with a unique supernatural twist where evil battles evil and good is just as elusive and undefinable as it seems to be in the \\"real\\" world. The succubus is by far the most interesting character in the book, and the best anti-hero I've read in a long time. Evil and blood thirsty, she is nevertheless sympathetic, and I found myself, strangely, rooting for her in the end. The human secondaries don't feel as well developed or nearly as interesting. The writing is often lovely but just as often a bit self-conscious and overdone. Although I did consider that perhaps the author's reliance on simile and metaphor reflected the notion that nothing is exactly as it seems - hence, one thing is like another, but not quite what it should be at first glance.Anyhow, while not a gripping read, and not scary, this is certainly an intelligent, unique and worthwhile read. I was disappointed not to find anything new by the author."},{"Title":"DAWN SONG","review":"Having both pros and cons about Michael Marano's first effort, if I could give it 2 1/2 stars I would because that's where I saw it - right down the middle.On the positive side, I found it to be an extremely interesting concept, reminiscent of the Book of Job because here are two &quot;spiritual&quot; (?) beings watching humans deal with what is being thrown at them from outside their own realm. Two demons battle for dominion on earth. I found the characterization to be exceptional, containing the kind of detail that usually is the domain of Anne Rice. Of the main characters, there is Lawrence, a clerk in a bookstore who has come to terms with his own homosexuality, but not his father's death; Paul, a teacher founded in reality who, at one point, encourages a student teacher to fight the good fight, and then a few pages later, decides to quit teaching himself, and finally; Ed Sloane, our resident theological anti-hero. All of these people are drawn in great detail. Also, I liked how Marano does for the west end of Boston - Kennemore Square, Copley Place, Fenway Park - what Rice does for New Orleans. Namely, he paints it as a very dark location. Never in this book did I ever get the feeling that the sun was shining. However, though this tapestry is dark, it is, at times, quite beautiful.Still, as the one armed economist might say, &quot;on the other hand&quot;, there is no force of good in this book. I think the reader needs that in this kind of story. There are no good guys, no guys in white hats, no Lone Ranger to save the town and hence humanity. Rooting for one of the demons over the other doesn't offer much either. Belial, the Unbowed One, operates through his daughter, the succubus, who &quot;heals&quot; people by devouring their souls and then drops pieces of them (the souls) into hell. Nice touch. The other, Leviathan, the Enfolded One, is no prize himself. A sort of reptilian worm, he pulls humanity's chain by initiating events like the Gulf War. Rooting for one these guys over the other is akin to either being garroted or hung with an electric rope: the end result is pretty much the same. Also, I did not find this book particularily scary. We should not confuse slasher-type gore with true horror. For example, one of the demons possess one of the characters and he waits - in the bathroom, no less - to do in a young couple. He waylays them with a mallet, whose craftmanship, I might add, he complains about in the previous chapter. He then decapitates them, spells words with their blood, and then carries their heads around in a plastic bag full of fruit and vegetables. Gross, for sure. Scary, not really.One thing I did wish Marano had more of is dialogue. I feel dialogue really moves a story along. If one doubts me, I would suggest that they pick up something by Ed McBain or Elmore Leonard. I spent too many times with this book re-reading descriptive paragraphs because I couldn't retain what was written. Still, I would have to say that I would like to see more by Marano because this was, after all, a first novel. His knowledge of medieval history and religion should be able to pay better dividends down the road."},{"Title":"DAWN SONG","review":"As a fan of the horror genre I am very often forced to sit through a book by a well known author that although has the major affect of scaring me out of my wits, rarely gets deep into my own personal life. Mr. Marano has succeeded where others have failed me!From the moment I picked this book up, I just couldn't put it down until I finished the story.The story of two Princes of Hell each trying to take over the world was as gripping as it was frightening, and left me wanting more from this author. His style of prose was just amazing.Of course the real good stuff is the emotional roller coaster you get the privilege to be on from almost page one!This book takes you everywhere, from sorrow to hopeful, and taking little pitstops at each emotion along the way.With characters I could really feel for, the struggle for Earth was just a beautiful mix of great insight and moments of pure suspense.Pick it up if you can, it's a great read!"},{"Title":"DAWN SONG","review":"Interesting concept, some interesting characters, but too much. The language gets so heavy handed -- how many similes and metaphors can you take -- and melodrama, boy! At times this book was like reading the worst sections of Anne Rice's Violin over and over and over ... Yeah, yeah, yeah .. I got it already! Move on."},{"Title":"DAWN SONG","review":"I enjoyed the storyline and charactor development. It should have been a 'good read' but was, for me, spoilt by cumbersome presentation and 'arty' expression. I was looking for a story which the theme promised but it got lost in the litteray world. Why can't these writers present ideas and thoughts simply? Complexity does not equate with 'quality'. I also deplore the trend of many a horror novel nowadays having to have a statutary gay component. What's wrong with a bit of plain old spine chilling with a touch of straight on the side?When I finished this story I was not desperately looking for another by the same author! Compare this to &quot;The Stake' or &quot;Crota' which where fun reads."},{"Title":"DAWN SONG","review":"it was well written and i probably would have enjoyed the plot had i been able to follow it. i lost interest before the end and lost the book...no sweat off my back. it was nothing special and it would probably be better going to the library."},{"Title":"DAWN SONG","review":"Dawn Song by Michael Marano is an example of how the horror genre is deftly raised to perfect literature under the skilled hand of a superbly gifted writer. Weaving together the stories of an interconnected group of contemporary Bostonians who unwittingly find themselves drawn into an Infernal power struggle between two of the most powerful devils in Hell, Marano sketches a limitless landscape of beauty and terror, using words to coax colour and beauty from a story that is the definition of bleakness. In the end, redemption--of a sort--is the dawn song. If you ever wondered what makes a story perfect, if you ever wondered what is was to fall in love with, and suffer with, characters born of an author's brilliance, read Dawn Song...with the lights on. This was the definitive millenial novel, the finest horror novel of the 1990s, and is destined to become a modern classic. Dawn Song belongs in the library of every intellectual horror fan, and anyone who appreciates the finest writing currently available to discerning readers worldwide."},{"Title":"DAWN SONG","review":"I was really looking forward to this book only to be hugely disappointed. In every other sentence in every other paragraph was some sort of descriptive phrase &quot;like moths to a flame&quot;; &quot;like bees to honey&quot;, it was soooo boring. Then what was the author thinking by splitting some of the pages into 2 or 3 columns then having a sentence run all over the page??? If you go to the author's website he talks about how to be original in your stories and ideas before you put them to paper.. and the author tries desperately to write this lyrical prose but falls way short. And big deal these demons are causing the ills of the world including the gulf war....please--who didn't see that plot coming a mile away. And my biggest beef with this book is the author's constant use of the &quot;n-word&quot;. It just seemed to me that the author had no idea at times what he wanted to do with his characters. Some of his passages were just drivel. This is by far the 2nd worst book I've read this year. I'm not even going to give this to the library it's so bad."},{"Title":"DAWN SONG","review":"Mr. Marano's story wanders...and wanders... and wanders. His characters don't interact, and their development is pointless. This book is fully 200 pages too long. How long can the demons of Hell just sit and stir to existence and still keep our attention? Not 250 pages! There are some good moments, such as the Succubus inhabiting the mouse, but they are few and far between. The premise of this novel was so very promising -- I was very excited to read it. And I was let down completely.

I was hoping for more of a \\"future of space science\\" tome so that I could find out more about the specific space technologies which will ultimately work. (The shuttle program obviously has serious problems). What I found instead was a collection of scholarly essays, mostly centering on the economics of the issue, to be read by congressmen and policy wonks.There is nothing wrong with that, of course. But personally, I would have preferred something more in line with G. Harry Stine's book, Halfway to Anywhere: Achieving America's Destiny in Space, or at least an essay or two picking up where Stine left off in 1996. I'm especially interested in knowing more about the state of the art of single stage to orbit (SSTO) technology. I didn't find much along that line.What I did find, however, and what made the book more than worth the purchase price was a lucid essay by Dennis A. Tito, the American Businessman who paid his own way to fulfil his lifelong dream of going into space. It was a colorful, competent, and descriptive view of what it would be like for a regular person to go into space. Having been rebuffed by NASA, he went to the Russians who cordially welcomed him, trained him for his \\"mission,\\" and gave him a very expensive vacation aboard the Russian section of the under construction International Space Station (ISS).Tito's experiences and his vision for the future of space exploration were inspirational and uplifting in the wake of the Columbia Shuttle disaster. NASA tried to scuttle Tito's adventure, and that same massive bureaucracy has probably succeeded in scuttling the shuttle program.The solution seems clear to me; we need more free enterprise.

Hayek, Vol 9)","review":"The 1930's were a time when a major research program reached its peak. Late 19th century economists had grappled with capital theory, money, and interest (i.e. Wicksell, Bohm Bawerk). Those who followed (Mises and Lindal) developed capital/interest theory along different lines. But it was Hayek and Keynes who squared off before all other economists to see which line of theorizing could explain The Great Depression.This volume reprints original writings of Hayek, Keynes and Sraffa during the early 1930's. At this time Hayek held the upper hand with professional opinion. Hayek's lectures at the London School of Economics (published as Prices and Production) won him many adherents. Keynes and Sraffa advanced forceful counterarguments, but little changed at this time. The fact of the matter is that both Keynes and Hayek went on to refine their views. Hayek published his Pure Theory of Capital in 1941, where he made penetrating insight (some would say impenetrable) into capital theory. Keynes went on to win over professional opinion with his General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money (1936).Hayek was in one sense more fortunate than Keynes. Keynes won a hollow victory in 1936, as Keynesians (i.e. Hicks, Samuelson, Solow...) quickly forgot about what Keynes actually wrote and recast \`his' theory almost beyond recognition. Hayekians (i.e. Lachmann, Garrison, White) have remained truer to their namesake. It is in this history where this volume has value. Those interested in the history of economics can gain much insight from this book. This time period was critical in the development of modern economics.Somehow the two most prominent economists of the 1930's managed both to lose public opinion as postwar economists turned to a theory of stationary equilibrium that both Hayek and Keynes rejected, and in the name of the latter. Do not read this book to understand the views of Hayek or Keynes. Read this book to see the early development of Hayekian and Keynesian economics. There is a real historical puzzle to solve here."},{"Title":"Contra Keynes and Cambridge: Essays, Correspondence (The Collected Works of F. A. Hayek, Vol 9)","review":"The reviewer Mr. Brady attempts to dismiss the work of Hayek because of his failure to adequately distinguish between fixed and circulating capital, in addition to paying insufficient attention to the role of uncertainty.This observation is admittedly partly true. When Hayek began his work on business cycle theory, he paid very close attention to equilibrium analysis, believing that any explanation of downturns would have to include equilibrium statics if it hoped at all to be tenable. Hayek brought this belief over with him to the LSE and used it to criticize the theories of Maynard Keynes, who failed to incorporate a robust theory of capital structure into his account of economic disruption(according to Hayek). But if Mr. Brady bothered at all to read the excellent introduction to this volume by Bruce Caldwell, all of this would be clear. Hayek increasingly came to abandon equilibrium analysis in favor of a theoretical view that consistently embraced subjectivism and uncertainty. It is on this point that I wish Mr. Brady would have extended his last sentence into a fuller discussion of the fundamental differences of Mr. Keynes and Mr. Hayek with respect to their overall economic outlook given their beliefs in ineradicale uncertainty. Hayek does seem to place excessive faith in the capabilities of the market system, but Keynes, while justifiably remaining sceptical, demands repeated acts of government intervention as the means of avoiding the errors that attend the arena of uncertainty. These two positions are interesting, if only because their discovery of the uncertainty principle led them to adopt positions that occupied two extremes. I believe Keynes was right in attacking neoclassical economics and its program of economic efficiency in the absence of government regulation. But it in no way follows that a theory of chaos and confusion (uncertainty) should commit us to a position or policy of rigid rule-making. Such activity may very well exacerbate this perpetual state of ignorance that we find ourselves in daily. Keynes, with his emphasis on uncertainty, cannot have his cake and eat it too. A consistent application of uncertainty would, in my view, seem to distance us from both a commitment to laissez-faire and government regulation.Anyway, if the above paragraph interests anyone, then this is a book that is worth reading. The debates between Hayek, Keynes and Sraffa are fascinating, and shed considerable light on some of the most fundamental questions of economic theory. Bruce Caldwell's introduction is worth the price of the book alone."},{"Title":"Contra Keynes and Cambridge: Essays, Correspondence (The Collected Works of F. A. Hayek, Vol 9)","review":"This particular volume of Hayek's collected works covers the very important exchanges between Hayek and Keynes over Keynes's theories of investment and capital originally put forth in 1930 in the Treatise on Money(two volumes).Keynes's General Theory(1936) approaches to investment and capital are the same as in the TM except for Keynes's decision to greatly emphasize the importance of the uncertainty of the information and knowledge base(or,in Ellsberg's terminology,the ambiguity of such information and knowledge) in economic decision making concerning future events(about investment in fixed capital subject to technological change and obsolescence) where the probabilities are both unreliable and unclear.Keynes and Hayek have completely opposite positions concerning the differences between fixed capital,subject to the impact of uncertainty in decision making,and circulating capital,subject to the impact of risk,but not uncertainty.Hayek is very clear-there is no fundamental difference between fixed capital and circulating capital:\\"To over-emphasize the distinction between fixed and circulating capital,which is, at best,merely one of degree,and not by any means of fundamental importance,is a common trait of English economic theory and has probably contributed more than any other cause to the unsatisfactory state of the English theory of capital at the present time\\".(Hayek,p.177;see also pp.86,99-100,103-108,168-170,etc.).Hayek's misbelief that he could present a theory of capital that abstracts from uncertainty is in direct contradiction to Keynes's theories that argue[for a modern ,mathematical treatment of Keynes's theories,see any article or book by Dixit and Pindyck on the \\"real options\\" approach to investment projects that are fixed(sunk ,durable capital)]that uncertainty and/or ambiguity is fundamental and any attempt to abstract from it can only result in a very special theory applicable in conditions where there is no uncertainty.This book shows the immense gulf that separated Keynes and Hayek intellectually.While Hayek would later acknowledge the importance of uncertainty after the appearance of the General Theory,uncertainty has NO impact at all in the final conclusions reached by Hayek concerning investment and the business cycle.Since uncertainty makes absolutely no difference in the final decision outcome,there is no difference at all between Hayek and a neoclassical economics based on the Ramsey,De Finetti,and Savage subjective approach to decision making."},{"Title":"Contra Keynes and Cambridge: Essays, Correspondence (The Collected Works of F. A. Hayek, Vol 9)","review":"It is really nice to buy a book about the background story of the debate between Keynes and Hayek. It served me well!!"},{"Title":"Contra Keynes and Cambridge: Essays, Correspondence (The Collected Works of F. A. Hayek, Vol 9)","review":"How can we have any knowledge of the world around us?We possess a tool, reason, which allows our intellect to expand our knowledge of things, to expand our judgements of objective \\"Truth\\" about \\"Reality\\".Reason is at work in any science when the practitioner of the science associates her existing judgements and concepts in order to expand her judgements. Logic studies the laws with which the tool of reason has to comply to arrive at valid expansions of knowledge.Logic is the tool of all sciences. Logic is itself a science. Science is the knowledge of conclusions demonstrated on the basis of some principles which are either assumed as hypotheses or taken from the evidence of experience. The scientific method is the orderly way of arriving at Truth in a given scientific discipline.Realism presupposes, and thus entails for all further judgements, that the real is given to the subject, i.e., given to the practitioner of any science, and that the real is knowable by the subject, knowable at least to some extent, even if that extent is very limited. The realist thesis accepts that the real can be caught by thought. The result of the thing being caught by the intellect is ad-equation between the thing and the intellect, which is Saint Thomas' definition of Truth.Once realism has been accepted as a starting point, once it has been accepted that the real can be caught by thought, one can and must trust discursive thought as a truthful representation of reality, to the extent that reason elaborates or expands its primary knowledge of the real through reasoning in accordance with its own laws. It is the task of the science of logic to describe the laws with which reason has to comply when it, reason, is reasoning in order to expand its knowledge of the Truth.Hayek agrees and accepts the realist thesis.For Hayek, knowledge is based on experience. As man's experience is limited, Hayek has a profound epistemological pessimism which leads him to a kind of stoicism regarding policy. (page 48)Whereas Hayek agrees with realism, John Maynard Keynes does not agree.For Keynes, it is not reality but intuition (page 248) that is caught in knowledge, or that is caught by the intellect when it arrives at Truth through ad-equating itself to or with the thing. His intuitions lead Keynes to thinking in \\"measurable\\" aggregates such as total demand, investment or output and to thinking that empirically established values of these presumed \\"constants\\" would enable us to make valid predictions. (page 242) Such intuitions conceal all that really matters. (page 246) His theories thereby neglect more fundamental \\"real\\" phenomena (page 197) and displace micro-economics by macro-economics. (page 60)Contrast this Keynesian displacement of micro-economics by macro-economics to Hayek's admission that the schemata of micro-economics do not claim to achieve the quantitative predictions at which the ambitions of macro-economics aim. The science of economics should, for Hayek, nevertheless content itself with the more modest aims of the former because we can thereby gain more insight into at least the principle on which the complex order of economic life operates. (page 246)Once Keynes has decreed that it is his intuitive aggregates, and not reality, that are caught by true knowledge, no judgement that the real thing can be caught by the thought of intellect, no judgement that Truth in the sense Saint Thomas defined it is present, is any longer presupposed in ulterior judgements which, the latter, can be based on any intuition, even on an intuition contradictory to the intuition which originally displaced reality.One such intuitions led Keynes to the peculiar fallacy of believing that a general crisis can be averted by extension of credit (page 119), the fallacy of believing that the creation of additional money will lead to the creation of the corresponding amount of goods, although such belief was bound to lead to the revival of more naive inflationist fallacies which we thought economics had once and for all exterminated. (page 243)Contrast this to Hayek's fundamental point that the business cycle is an unfortunate but an unavoidable concomitant of a credit economy. Attempts to eliminate the business cycle are likely to only intensify its effects. Hayek therefore put barriers to what others have done to advance in a path rather than supplying new ideas opening a path to new development. (page 31)Contrast this again to Keynes who knows that something can be done at the level of his intuitive aggregates and therefore believes that it is possible to adapt the amount of money in circulation to what is necessary for the maintenance of existing contracts without upsetting the equilibrium between saving and investing. (page 144)In the long run, we are all dead, aren't we, Mr Keynes?Keynes was however never prepared to accept the implications of credit expansion. He never recognized that progressive inflation was needed in order that any growth in monetary demand could lastingly increase the employment of labour. (page 248)How could, asks Hayek and I paraphrase, Keynes's ideas continue to be accepted once it had become clear that the temporary gain in employment achieved by credit expansion had necessarily to be paid for by even more severe unemployment at a later stage? (page 248)The answer has perhaps something to do with the fact once one gets, like Keynes, the opportunity to get away with the fallacy that it is intuition, not ad-equation between the thing and the intellect from which knowledge then has to be inferred, which gives us knowledge of the Truth concerning the world around us,logic no longer provides the framework through which we filter common-sense data in order to arrive at an objective \\"Truth\\" about \\"Reality\\".At that stage, Keynes can get away with any new intuition even when the disastrous actual (long-term) results of the first intuitions become clear.Science is then no longer the knowledge of conclusions demonstrated on the basis of some principles which are either assumed as hypotheses or taken from the evidence of experience. But the intuitive policy-recommendations of which Keynes had a-priori intuitive knowledge are then being presented as the conclusions from premises based on, or inferred from, principles which are fundamentally contradicted by experience.The scientific method has thereby been repealed and, as a result, there is no more orderly way of arriving at Truth in a given scientific discipline, in this case in economics. The science of economics has thereby been displaced by \\"a\\" political economy, whatever the latter may be."},{"Title":"Contra Keynes and Cambridge: Essays, Correspondence (The Collected Works of F.

Through analysis of two needlework cooperatives' history (and dissolution), and through the analysis of several marriage ceremonies (and stories of the subsequent marriages' success or failure), Donnelly shows how women's actions are grounded in Hmong cultural values and options, even as they make use of the cultural options and interpretations of American society. While traditional Hmong society could be characterized as male-centered-marriage negotiations, for example, were arranged by the male elders of the clans involved, even if the young men had taken the initiative to find their brides-the transplanting of thousands of Hmong to the U.S. has led to the development of more egalitarian and romantic notions of marriage, and to the possibility of greater assertiveness on the part of Hmong women. Yet Donnelly is able to point to folktales in which women do act assertively, so a model for this kind of behavior is available within the Hmong tradition. All cultures contain such seeming contradictions, Donnelly asserts, and indeed, the presence of alternative models of behavior within a traditional culture gives that culture &quot;resiliency that may let that culture survive even traumatic shifts of circumstance.&quot; (191) Thus, even with changing circumstances, language, economic opportunities, education, and religion, Hmong culture contains within it the possibility of continued Hmong cultural identity in the U.S. This is an excellent example of enlightening and sensitive ethnography."},{"Title":"The Cherry Orchard","review":"To me, the play was good as it was.

No translator is credited for this edition. According to the note at the start of the book, the play was initially presented by the Moscow Art Theatre in 1904.The play takes place on the estate of Madame Ranevsky, the matriarch of an aristocratic Russian family that has fallen on financial hard times. She faces the possible loss of her family's magnificent cherry orchard.The play is populated with interesting characters: Lopakhin, a wealthy neighbor whose father was the serf of Madame Ranevsky's father; Firs, an aged servant who longs for the &quot;old days&quot;; Trophimof, a student with lofty ideas; and more. There is a great deal of conflict among the characters.&quot;The Cherry Orchard&quot; is about people dealing with very personal conflicts and crises while larger socioeconomic changes are going on around them.

The subtext carries the story and is about how not to deal with existentialist stasis -- a state of being immobilized by the fear of change, and the complexity of the denial that under lay this fear. It is this fear and the symbolism it invokes that makes the play universal in its depiction of human fear, suffering, and inability to address change; for at one time or another, these too have engulfed us all. It is against this backdrop that Chekov's real talent, comes to the fore: his incredible ability to graphically develop characters and analyze them psychologically with a fine-tooth comb.Chekov demonstrates an uncanny ability to draw out the deepest images of personal psychological angst, and is almost comical in his analysis which is always exquisitely sensitive -even of the most serious of issues such as those that beset this wealthy Russian family. The underlying message is that \\"life must go on\\" whether or not we address reality squarely in the face, or allow it to hit us in the \\"behind\\" as we are on the way out the door, as it did Madame Ranyevskaya and her family, as her creditors came to take away all of her possessions, including her cherry orchard from under her.This is quintessentially Chekov; but it needs to be read several times to weave together the text with the subtext.Five stars."},{"Title":"The Cherry Orchard","review":"I recently saw a production of this and I was moved to tears.

Nearly a hundred years later, the characters are just as real, and one can get just as much out of it. And a hundred years later, they still will be. Because certain things never change in humanity.

On the one it is the story of the characters' relationships to each other. Often in Chekhov there is disillusionment and disappointment, misunderstanding and desire unrealized. Often too the characters have ideas and dreams about themselves which simply do not find their justification in the world. But in all this there is always interspersed moments of tenderness and poignancy, of delicate feeling, perceptions of beauty.On another level there are ' major themes'. Here it is of the Old Order passing and the coming of the new. The 'Cherry Orchard' is the symbol of this. And the purchase of it by the former serf Lopahin is the sign of the transition taking place in Russia. The old order people, Ranskanaya her daughters and brother cling to the older world, refuse to sell it out by accepting the offer to build on it dachas, and connect it with the railway line. But in the end the extravagance of Ranskaya is forced to yield, and the 'Cherry Orchard' is cut down.In the final moments of the play the elderly servant Firs, the true symbol of the one raised in the old order and too deeply connected to it, to ever leave it, lies down and seems to pass away.Chekhov's art is an art of sadness and beauty, of cruelty and change , but above all of human character and feeling portrayed in complexity and contradiction- and in a language of poetic compression deep in feeling."},{"Title":"The Cherry Orchard","review":"With Chekhov providing so many characters as symbols of both political beliefs and separate generations, this play is an effective allegory of the Bolshevik revolution in Russia.

If we hold this play in high regard, then we dramatist's need to reevaluate our standards. Chekhov wrote a play that will make you not care an inch about the character's or their situation(s). For him to think that this is a comedy makes you wonder if he understood the point he himself was trying to make. The characters are pathetic and they'll make you pity them - not because of their predicaments, but because of whom they are.

Should the aristocratic family in decline stick to owning their cherry orchard (representative of the grandiose trappings of Russian aristocracy), or give in to modern commercialization in order to survive? What is the value of tradition, and how many trees should one own? Chekhov will not answer these questions for you, but he poses them in most interesting ways. In addition to wise insights into such fundamental dilemmas, Chekhov also provides a lot of witty banter, and a great slice-of-life view at 19th century Russian high culture. But this is not just a Russian play or a 19th century play; its themes, questions, and prospective answers are relevant for individuals coping with society and history in any place, and at any time."},{"Title":"The Cherry Orchard","review":"The Cherry Orchard was me first experience with Chekhov, and I was surprised at the depth in this 49 page play.

I was confused at a couple people who write that the simply couldn't understand it and it put them to sleep! It's not THAT tough! If I could understand and appreciate it, almost anyone can!What I like most about Chekhov is that he doesn't simplify his characters. He's a realist in this sense. Lopahkin and Trophimof each have admirable and detestable characteristics, just like you and I.

Though I am so far away from the Russian culture and time of this play, the themes of place, tradition, and inevitable change resonated inside of me, and I am grateful to Chekhov for the way he has handled them.The Cherry Orchard is a play about change, and the symbolism is pretty easy to recognize. What makes it stand apart, I think, from a thousand other plays on the same theme is its wonderful sense of comedy, of smiling sadness. Chekhov all his life insisted it was a comedy. As the Cherry Orchard slips away from the Ranevskys, they seem to smile at its going. As they are unable to change their habits -- still lending money they don't have, still spending extravagantly -- they quietly laugh at their own foolishness. The change comes, and they leave, heartbroken -- but embracing the change at the same time, only feebling struggling against it. One feels saddest, in the end, for Lopakhin, the new owner of the Cherry Orchard. He seems to believe he has bought happiness and friends, but is quickly discovering the emptiness of money and possessions, as no one wants to borrow from him, and no one seems to pay him much heed at all.Chekhov paints with a fine brush, and I appreciate that. There is no thunderstorming, no ranting and raving in this work. There is a fine and subtle, sad and comedic portrayal of a family and a place encountering change. It is a heartbreak with a smile.The translation, though the only one I've read, seems good.

However, this adaptation by David Mamet makes the play easier to follow and understand. The play itself is often labeled as a tragedy, but really isn't. As Mamet points out in the introduction to this adaptation, the closest form of drama THE CHERRY ORCHARD's structure resembles is the farce. In fact, if all the characters weren't so depressing, the play would be hilarious. Perhaps that is what Chekhov originally intended, that as we would see the outrageous, pitiful existence of the characters in this play we would laugh at their mopping and folly and strive to make our lives more meaningful.

Dover's incomparably priced edition lacks a little in the readability of the translation, but it's still a nice version of a powerful piece of work.For me, the real strength of &quot;The Cherry Orchard&quot; is its unwillingness to come down propagandistically on one side of any issue. The intellectual and eternal student Trophimof levels a critique against capitalism, but one must bear in mind that it is capitalism that engineers the upward rise of the erstwhile peasant (and now landowner) Lopakhin (and, in the context of this play's being labeled a &quot;comedy,&quot; I think Chekhov codes this rise as a conditionally good thing). Trophimof in fact seems to be granted a great deal of authority by the play, as he complains about the lazy intelligentsia and the useless aristocracy, but, sure enough, not wanting to make things too simple or simplistic, Chekhov has Madame Ranevsky put him in his place. If this is a commentary on turn-of-the-century Russian society and politics (and I think we must read it as such), it is a very balanced, multi-perspectival and complex one.Even the criticism of the play's upper classes--the focus on Gayef's irrational obsession with billiards or Pishtchik's naive assumption that, when he is in the deepest of financial troubles, something will always come along to bail him out--is delicately balanced against the workaholic insensitivity of Lopakhin, who leaves Varya Ranevsky stranded at the play's end and expecting a proposal of marriage from him that is hinted at but never comes. What Chekhov seems to be supporting is not, perhaps, Trophimof's over-intellectualized and propaganda-like insistence on work, or Lopakhin's materialistic actual obsession with work, but maybe a revaluation of the priorities that have led to social divisions and the problematic reactions to them.One crucial translation hitch appears early on, as Gayef passionately addresses a cupboard and praises it for holding, for so many years, wisdom and knowledge and the keys to social betterment. All other translations I have consulted have rendered this &quot;cupboard&quot; as a &quot;bookshelf,&quot; and, to be honest, that makes a lot more sense, in context. Other issues of readability (or the slight lack thereof) in this Dover edition are best seen in comparison to Hingley's imminently readable and enjoyable Oxford UP translation and edition, which, to my mind, remains the standard. This Dover edition's dialogue is occasionally stilted and impenetrable.Still, though, for the price, this copy of &quot;The Cherry Orchard&quot; is unbeatable. It's an impressive and provocative play, and even more so when one is reminded of its original context. It's problematic, of course, to pin events to each other and argue for direct influence, but I have a hard time seeing the workers' uprisings in Russia during the winter of 1905-06 as completely unrelated from this play's release in 1904, which set many of these still vital issues into motion in a very productive way."},{"Title":"The Cherry Orchard","review":"Too often, 'The Cherry Orchard' moves dangerously close to that dread thing, the Shavian 'comedy' of ideas. full of facile symbolism, a schematic narrative arc and obvious allegorical characterisation, the play seems to groan under the weight of characters pontificating on grave matters such as social and historical change, the 'idea' of Russia and the rhetoric of freedom and progress.What saves 'Orchard' is the merciful fact that it was written by Chekhov and not Shaw. Whatever his overall conception of the play's weighty themes - the decline of the aristocracy; the new economic power of former serfs etc. - Chekhov is simply incapable of writing mere mouthpieces, and every character, no matter how monstrous, limited, avaricious, delusive or paralysed (in action or mind), is suffused with the kind of life (flawed, egocentric, perhaps, but human) for which he had a unique, sympathetic, though always honestly satirical eye. it is a tough task to make an audience empathise with a group of silly former slave-owners, but death, loss, change, poverty, personal failure and disappointment are things we have all felt, and we would probably be lying if we couldn't find something of ourselves in most of the characters (I, worryingly, found myself most drawn to the snobbish, immature, enndearingly gauche Gaev).There are too many emotionally loaded, privileged and enigmatic moments for characters to be simply straw targets, and the play is shot through with poignant autobiographical resonances (it was Chekhov's last, written when he was terminally ill). In fact, the one character I found thoroughly dislikable is the one who seems to make the most humanitarian sense, the revolutionary student Trophimof; but his tedious, inhuman sermons about work and the future sound too much like the Bolsheviks whose barbaric utopia would be established less than two decades later.Unlike Wilde, say, or Shakespeare, Chekhov rarely reads very well on the page. His deliberately plain speech can seem flat, and the importance of silence, waiting, time passing with an almost painful tangibility is impossible to convey, never mind the rhythms that become so evident in performance, or the use of sound effects and music (American translations seem to me the best, fluid and not fusty; I read Carol Rocamora's this time). This is why actors treasure him - his plays are almost like sketches, giving them unprecedented freedom to create characters from hints and ambiguities.Another difference between Shaw and Chekhov is that the former's plays are theses or theorems, designed to prove points the author is unswervingly convinced of before he's even written a word. Chekhov is rarely sure about anything, and his plays are liberatingly, if perilously, open-ended. Despite the rigid structures he fences them in, his characters always feel as if they have lived before the play and will continue to, no matter how badly, long after it.It should also be remembered that Chekhov called 'Orchard' a comedy: it is full of characters and scenes tottering from tragedy to farce. Charlotta, the tragicomic governess, full of amazing magic tricks and ventriloquism, yet fundamentally isolated and facing a desperately uncertain future, is perhaps emblematic."},{"Title":"The Cherry Orchard","review":"I first came across this play in an old college literature book that belonged to my mother. My only disappointment in reading it was that I discovered it shortly after the play came out in London at The Royal Theatre...boo hoo I missed it...maybe can find a recording.To me this play was all about avoidence. The historical Russian setting was also incorporated well. I do not know much about the time or place so I can't say much about that though.It carried themes such as: the avoidence of properl dealing with finances,the avoidence of dealing with relationships, and the avoidence of dealing with the past.I know little else then Shakespear when it comes to plays, so the way relationships were handled was a notable difference.The love stories are not typical or satisfying because the characters either do not want to admit they are in love or they are in love with the wrong person...or thing (money).The Russian names did make it hard for me to follow the storyline, so I ended up writing and drawing character sketches so I could remember who was who.The ending was as unique as the rest of the play and although I know enjoyed it, I am still unsure about it all. It seems awkward and unfinished yet polished and complete.Please give this story a try, especially if you are into: theatre,plays,dialogues, etc."},{"Title":"The Cherry Orchard","review":"Anton Chekhov's play The Cherry Orchard is an extremely interesting play that has a duel nature as both comedy and tragedy. However, some non-Russian audiences may have difficulty understanding the sense of futility Chekhov gives it.The plot of the play centers around an aristocratic woman and her family whose fortunes have gone sour. They are about to sell their famed cherry orchard to pay the mortgage.Through the course of the play, the family finds several options to save the cherry orchard, but they do nothing. The estate is sold to a former serf, who doesn't seem to appreciate the cherry orchard and cuts it down.The tragedy is a symbolic one. The aristocracy tries in vain to maintain its social position, while the new bourgeoisie can't find meaning in their new wealth.Bottom Line: The Cherry Orchard is a fantastic play, both to read or to watch, though parts of it get \\"lost-in-translation\\" from the original Russian audience.For more of my reviews, visit trevsliteraryreview.blogspot.com"},{"Title":"The Cherry Orchard","review":"I don't think even a seasoned theatre goer could sit through this play if it were directed a drama. I imagine all the brooding speeches, unmotivated pauses, and the inevitable \\"gloom\\" of chopping down the cherry trees. The comedy is indeed dark, but sheer silliness abounds with the brother and his imaginary pool shooting, the governess and her magic, and foolishness of Madame Ranevsky. Only two moments are purely dramatic and poignant: the reaction of Ranevsky when Lopakhin purchases the estate, and the death of Firs."},{"Title":"The wonderful world : the adventure of the earth we live on","review":"Copyrighted in 1954, this was one of the first non-fiction books I remember owning; years later I decided to try to track down a copy and found that it's just as relevant and enjoyable today as it was then. Probably best suited to youngsters around age 10-12, it would make a good beginning resource for homeschoolers (though probably not if they're anti-evolutionists) as well as a useful supplement to conventional schoolwork. Beginning with the theory of how the solar system came to be, it goes on to combine natural history, geology, meteorology, and the history of humanity in a sensibly blended way that shows how they relate to one another. The information-filled and often dramatic (a hurrcane, a thunderstorm, a tornado, a volcano in eruption) or beautiful (craggy mountain scenes, the Ganges, a lush rainforest scene) paintings and clear, unique diagrams add immeasurably to the book's value. I always think that a book is worth my time if it provides information I can't find anywhere else, and this one does. What's more, adults can enjoy it as a basic text on its subject without feeling they're being talked down to. Take a chance on it; I doubt you'll regret it."},{"Title":"Brief Guide to Ideas, A","review":"You defintely can judge the book by its cover on this book. I really liked it a lot. I used this book as a reference tool to teach my philosophy/ethics class in college. This is defintely not for the serious philosophy student, but a very nice introduction to the ideas that dominated western thought throughout the Greek/Roman world that has come to us today. It also treats postmodernism, and the ideas that dominates today as well.

I am a former fundamentalist, so I might be expected to have an apostate's bias against fundamentalism, but these authors are not only inaccurate but almost comically biased. The authors claim that the fundamentalists' belief in the truth of the Bible is &quot;borders on idolatry,&quot; that fundamentalists are &quot;often parasitic&quot; and define themselves not by belief in their scriptures or truth, but by their opposition to &quot;other approaches.&quot; Instead of examining the mainstream Christian fundamentalist beliefs, the authors simply define all fundamentists as having &quot;a totally closed world view,&quot; and damn all fundamentalists by guilt through supposed association with the Ayatollah Khomeini, David Koresh and the Taliban.Lastly, the title is misleading, especially when sold in secular stores, as mine was. The title would more accurately be, _A Liberal Christian Response to Philosophy_, instead of the current title."},{"Title":"Brief Guide to Ideas, A","review":"The authors did a superb job of bringing the greatest minds in history seamlessly into one book.

The words were first given in 1922 but would be largely appropriate for almost any graduate at any time, even today. Part of the address deals with war because of WWI involving the Scottish people.Another interesting segment was read from a letter written by Admiral Byrd from a tent he knew he and his explorer party would die in, already having frozen feet, no fuel, and no food.Barrie's own words can describe the written speech. \\"They are the roses in December; you remember someone said that God gave us memory so that we might have roses in December.\\" Barrie's talk of growing up, moving on into the world, and achieving through the use of courage is good, like \\"roses in December.\\"Just don't expect Tinkerbell, or Wendy, Peter, Neverland, pirates or any of the characters we associate with J.

Mostly photos, but the text which is there is especially well written and to the point. Exy's chapter on Pitcairn is my favorite - everyone on board was deathly sick except for her and one of the boys, and they sailed the whole ship to safety. She was an amazing woman, and deserves every bit and more of the praise given to the others on board.One captain, three mates, one wife, one baby, a bunch of boys and two girls made the 18 person crew. They set off in 1936 on the 92 foot schooner Yankee to see the world. The ship was like a moving classroom, and all aboard studied and learned all they could about sailing, boats, navigation, geography, foreign cultures, languages, foods, entertainment, art, customs ... the list goes on. This was no booze cruise. Captain Johnson was one of the best sailors in the world, and as the years went by would come to be respected everywhere as one of the most amazing captains ever.The people who signed up were changed forever. They went on to have incredible lives and always remembered the 18 months on board the Yankee. The captain and his wife would go on a total of seven! round the world cruises with kids and young adults. What a way to live! The best of mankind. And going with a one year old boy, that is just the icing on the cake. The pictures of him riding 400 pound turtles around the deck are priceless.The book is filled with great photos. They had an amateur photographer along (one of the boys) who turned out to be pretty darn good. Lots of action shots of the boat and crew, great pictures of the islands and islanders (some pretty ancient cultures) and a whole chapter for the little guy. Captions for all the photos, and a meandering travelogue and commentary by Irving and Electa. 223 pages. The book I have is 7-3/4 inches by 10-1/4 inches, and nicely bound. Date is 1939 by W W Norton and Company, New York.Recommended for sailing historians, armchair sailors, schooner fans, modern cruisers who aren't too spoiled to appreciate how it was done in the 30's, and especially fans of Captain Irving Johnson and his books and videos."},{"Title":"The Cervantes Encyclopedia","review":"Excellent reference guide to anything connected to Cervantes.

Being a Redneck is something that can only exist in North America. They thrive in Canada as well as in the U.S.It is a state of mind that derives from the ability to do things the way one chooses to do them;as opposed to what someone else decides is proper ,convential,acceptable,normal,genteel,correct,or as the Irish would say..\\"bog-standard\\".First and formost ,being a Redneck entails some ,at least, Celtic heritage.That has been culturally developed by centuries of doing your own thing,even if it is directly in conflict with some self appointed establishment.If you don't believe this;then why do you never think of cultural backgrounds of the Jewish,French,Italians,Orientals,Spanish,or any other typecasts when you think of Rednecks? The reason is that it is Celtic territory. And do you know the origin of the term Hillbilly? No,it doesn't have anything to do with HILLiary and BILL Clinton; but from the early Scotch-Irish settlers (Protestant Celtic),who often called their kids Billy or William ,after their hero William of Orange;who settled in the mountains of Tennessee and nearby states.This book is filled with descriptions and drawings of the endless ways to identify a Redneck.I suppose we are all a bit of a Redneck at heart;but Foxworthy is a master at showing what a high level of accomplishment the art of being a Redneck can be taken to---and with pride of accomplishment.How are these for example?YOU MIGHT BE A REDNECK IF---\\"Your mother does not remove the Marlboro from her lips beforetelling the state patrolman to k-- her a--.\\"\\"Your father fully executes the \\"pull my finger\\" trick duringChristmas dinner.\\" (and blames it on the turkey!!)\\"Your sister's educational goal is to get out of high school beforeshe gets pregnant.\\"\\"You actually know which kind of leaves make the best substitute fortoilet paper.\\"If you are looking for some real humor,let Foxworthy provide it!!!"},{"Title":"You Might Be A Redneck If...","review":"Fans of the 'redneck humor' of Jeff Foxworthy as seen on TV comedy shows will be glad to know his one-liner observations about what makes a 'redneck' translate well to text and one-panel comics, too.

And idealist with a bent toward literature, Hugh decides to go into corporate law, after being shamed by his then-girlfriend at a party for \\"going into business\\". Hugh studies secretly for the entrance exams to Harvard and to his Father's surprise, is admitted.This is where the book becomes interesting for today's reader. Hugh not only becomes a successful corporate lawyer, but also goes to work for some of the most odious city bosses, trusts, and robber barons of turn-of-the-century America. Churchill describes in detail how projects are pushed through the legislature by \\"fixers\\" and how the public is deceived by the politicians, who use divisive issues to distract the general public from what is really going on.100 years later, not much has changed, it seems. What makes the narrative compelling is that we see these things from Hugh's perspective - and the self-justifications he uses to rationalize his actions, which benefit only the wealthy and well-off at the expense of the ordinary citizen.His nemesis, Krebs,the poor son of a German immigrant, is a labor organizer, assemblyman, and public interest lawyer, acts as a neat foil to Hugh's ambitions. The novel pits the emerging capitalist class of the late 1800s against the nascent worker's movements of the times.The title is from the biblical parable of the prodigal son, who \\"took his journey into a far country\\".Will Hugh Parent find his way back from the \\"far country\\" and realize his true calling in life? Is there more to life than being successful - at all costs?It is an interesting tale that is still relevant today. The writing style may seem a bit ornate by today' standards, and the first few chapters (and the illustrations) may lead one to believe this is yet another Victorian-era drawing-room drama. But make no mistake, it is a novel with political implications, probably somewhat radical for its era."},{"Title":"Far Country","review":"A slow yet absorbing journey through the life of Hugh Paret yields reflections on life, society, business, and religion that are not only in revolution in the early 20th Century, but linger to the present day.

The story got away from her and she seemed to have struggled with what she really wanted the story to be about. It never seemed to end.

It was about her and her mother and her half-sister whom her father (the pirate) had sent her to live with in England. The hero of the story is almost non-existent for such a long period of time. The poignancy of the story was about this young girl fitting into London society and earning the love of her mother who walked out of her life at birth. Believe it or not, the book turns into an action thiller with the heroine being kidnapped. That is where Ms. Osborne shows her own confusion in where this plot is going.I wouldn't recommend this one - but I would highly recommend another early Maggie Osborne novel called &quot;Emerald Rain.&quot; It shines in comparison and truly shows Ms. Osborne's expertise."},{"Title":"The Universe: Theoretical Physics and Astronomy for the Young Adult","review":"I'm 14 years old and I like science and art.

Humor was not the sole intedned purpose. Though all of the stories are incredibly well written, very few have laugh-out-loud quality. The tones tend to be sarcastic and bitter, yet poignant, as writers talk about the hardships of gay relationships in general and then top it off with their experience with a failed romance with a mentally-disturbed (and sometimes dangerous) lover. Stephen Greco's story, Miss Bankhead at Home, is one of the better works in the collection, as he recounts an ex resurfacing in his life. Peter is a failed actor/model, who's looks have faded from aging and drug use. The romance is unsteady to begin with, but Greco talks about being drawn back in with the strange man, until one night he has a knife pulled on him.Under the guise of humor, some of the writers really give us disturbing stories and we cannot help but sympathize with them and their experiences. In one story, a young man is tries to capture the affections of a sexually-confused but charismatic married man, only to eventually realize that he is being used. Other stories rely on a situational confrontation, such as the surprisingly hysterical story, \\"In the Garden of the North American Cocktease\\". The story starts out very humorous and one cannot help but chuckle out loud to the narrator's witty observations but in the end, we realize that the date with a \\"dream guy\\" could have eventually led him into a very violent confrontation. Erotica writer, Simon Sheppard, lends his talents as well in \\"Going Down, Going Down Down\\", an amusing tale of an online hook-up gone wrong, completed with talk of diaper fetishes and crack pipes.It is unfortunate the only weak story would come from the editor, Kevin Bentley. Kevin knows how to pick his writers well, but sometimes I think he's too scatterbrained to know what to do with so much excellent material. This really shows in his own story, \\"Widow Hopper\\". Bentley tries to do it all - combining real drama, sarcasm and a sex scene that would have been appropriate if the subject matter weren't so bleak. Author's should have more faith in their intended subject matters. Some of the stories featured are very real and very powerful, so we don't need to dillude them with funny cartoon covers and odd humor attempts.Over all, this collection is fantastic. I wouldn't recommend trying to read every story in one night, but rather savor them over several reading sessions. This is a must-have for the disgruntled romantic - documented proof that the one that got away could have been a BOYFRIEND FROM HELL...."},{"Title":"Boyfriends from Hell: True Tales of Tainted Lovers, Disastrous Dates and Love Gone Wrong!","review":"Admittedly, the cover and type font of the paperback edition are misleading. While some of the short stories in this collection are \\"light\\" this is not a humor collection.Rather it is a collection of serious short stories of gay relationships (or tricks) that have turned out wrong.Given that we have that misconception out of the way (and I like both humerous and serious stories), I found the quality of the stories very mixed.Among thos I liked were \\"The Golden Tooth\\" by Barry Adams which was a nice first love with a crazy person story, \\"Double Booking\\" by Steve Nugent, which discusses juggling 2 guys at once, \\"My Boyfriend Brought Home A Rock And Roll Band\\" by Jerry Rosco and \\"My Primitive Man\\" by Donald Hatch.There were more misses though, such as \\"The Smell Of Asparagus Pee\\" by Shaun Levin which I just didn't get at all and \\"Geisha In The Pigpen\\" by Don Shewey which didn't even seem to fit the anthology.If you don't mind skimming an anthology for the better stories, and you grab this used its an OK page turner, but again don't be decieved by the humerous cover and type font."},{"Title":"Encouragement for Living: Daily Devotions","review":"Pastor Mark gives us exactly what the title of this book implies.

I am saddened to think readers may think it is. It is neither humorous nor entertaining. I read it cover to cover looking for merit and found none. I have to give it a poor rating."},{"Title":"Pagan Babies","review":"I had the pleasure of meeting Gina Cascone in SF at Books by the Bay - and she's as engaging and funny in person as she is when she's writing. I didn't go to Catholic schools myself, but all my neighborhood friends did as I was growing up in Cleveland and Chicago - and many of the scenes in Pagan Babies (including the adopting of the pagan babies themselves) ring absolutely true.Until her most recent book, Life al Dente, Cascone has been a children's author, and that voice comes through in Pagan Babies, which I think high school girls who have at last escaped the clutches of the nuns in their elementary schools could easily relate to. Irreverent to the point of blasphemy, Pagan Babies is a loving if scathing memoir of growing up Catholic.I thoroughly enjoyed it."},{"Title":"Pagan Babies","review":"Gina Cascone captures the politics of Catholic grade school students and interprets it for the adult it has trained. The result is tear-streaming laughter from chapter to chapter. It is probably the most memorable and loved work of important literature for this alumnus of Holy Cross School, Class of '79."},{"Title":"Pagan Babies","review":"Right off the bat I should state that I did not go to Catholic school nor was I brought up Catholic. I joined the Catholic church as an adult so I never got to experience anything like tha author details of her childhood. This is part of the reason I wanted to read the book. I love memoirs. I love Catholicism. I love good religious humor. This sounded like a perfect mix of them all.I did find a lot of it humorous including her rebelious nature, her naive misunderstandings of doctrine, meeting her Sisters and other school chums. And while I realize that this is supposed to be read asnd appreciated as \\"the world according to a child\\" perspective, I did have a problem with the fact that the author did not bother to correct herself in certain things now that she is an adult and should better understand. For example, speaking about the Immaculate Conception as being the same as the Virgin Birth of Jesus. Even I, as a new Catholic, know that these are two completely different things.Overall I was pleased with the book but I do have to admit that I got bored near the middle, put the book away for a few weeks and finished it later. Since each of the short chapters were on a different topic it was easy to pick it up and put it down again without missing a thing."},{"Title":"Pagan Babies","review":"The book did bring back pleasant memories of attending a Catholic School. It's too bad that Gina Cascone hated attending a Catholic School. I kept reading hoping that at some time she would say something good about being a Catholic. But that never happened. If I hadn't experienced Catholic Schools myself, this book would convince me that sending your child to a Catholic school is child abuse. I only recommend this book for people who hated being Catholic."},{"Title":"Pagan Babies","review":"This memoir was very, very funny. Cascone has a way with a phrase and a quick delivery that keeps the book moving along, and her description of her classmates will ring true with readers of all denominations (we've all known the Teacher's Pet, the Rebel, etc.)It's a bit hard to know how to classify this book, though. On the one hand, it's a very amusing trip down memory lane. On the other hand, it's a hugely one-sided and even somewhat erroneous picture of Catholicism. Cascone recounts her experiences through the eyes of a child, which is effective given the fact that this is a memoir. The problem is that her discussion of the Catholic faith never grows beyond what she knew as a child. The reader sees the religion through the eyes of a child who is being given very extreme, pre-Vatican II instruction. I'm certainly not faulting her for sharing her experiences and her reactions, and I certainly believe that they really happened. But the book is about an adult who, at the end of the story, rejects Catholicism based on a stunted understanding of what the faith really is. Ultimately, I guess it's a good argument in favor of getting to know faith as an adult before deciding to reject it.In the final analysis, I think this was a very entertaining book, but it certainly doesn't offer anything in the way of real spiritual insight. Don't let it inform your view of Catholicism because there's much more to the religion than you'll find here."},{"Title":"Pagan Babies","review":"A word of advice. Do not lend your copy of this book out. I am so glad they finally reprinted the book. I've lent 3 copies out - never to receive any of them back. This one will not leave my possession. You will laugh until you cry. I too went to Catholic schools and am still a happily practicing Catholic. I have some great memories too. Growing up during the 50's and 60's just does that....like the time I got into trouble for pretending I was a priest and pretending to consecrate Necco wafers. I don't know anyone who could put the laugh until you cry spin on the parochial school stories though. Irreverant, yes. A must-read? absolutely. Ms. Cascone tells her story not because she hated Catholic school, but because she has this fantastic sense of humor. I'd read anything she wrote. I bought sight unseen her book Life al Dente. I read excerpts of it to my Jewish husband in the car this weekend and even he laughed like crazy."},{"Title":"Pagan Babies","review":"This book was a riot and I could see myself experiencing most of what the author wrote about!!!!! What pleasant (sometimes) memories and chuckles I got out of some of the inane situations we experienced as kids in Catholic school with the nuns. However, I would not trade one minute of it! Among some of their most ridiculous customs and forms of teaching us right from wrong, some things stuck and as a result, we came out of our Catholic upbringing as decent and caring individuals (we were afraid to be anything else)! Regardless the book was a riot! Thanks!"},{"Title":"Pagan Babies","review":"this is a funny book one with which I could identify. any one who has attended a catholic school in the 60's or 70's knows where the author Gascone has been"},{"Title":"Pagan Babies","review":"I, too, grew up Catholic. I, too, have hilarious stories of my experiences. How lucky I feel, though, to have been raised to honor and respect my faith. Yes, my old friends and I still chuckle over certain eccentric nuns, over chapel veils and pagan baby collections, but mostly we feel lucky and richer for this experience. Since my patent leather shoe days, I've been widowed (young), lost my father (young), raised six children...no heartache or challenge has been too great, as I have been comforted and strengthened by this two thousand year old faith Gina Cascone so glibly dismisses. Had she remained true to her faith, some of what she says could be taken as good natured fun. She has instead turned her back on Catholicism and puts herself above sacraments and revered practices and beliefs. Her humor smacks of arrogance and ignorance. How sad."},{"Title":"Pagan Babies","review":"What a wonderful job of taking me back to my elementary school time. So many details mesh with my own experience in Southern California.

He shows himself to be proud, horrid, loving, sentimental. It is a small collection of short, powerful stories that span from childhood to young adulthood. He refers to himself at times in first person, other times in third (so you have to pay attention!). Growing into manhood, observing others and being observed. He expresses experiences of personal pride and humiliation with equal relish. Portraits of others in his life are humorous, admiring and at times sad. Hanging out with odd-balls; learning about women. It may have been a simpler time for technology, but the emotional struggles, the economic realities, the physical exertion required in a life in early 20th century Wales were harsh. All-in-all, this book is unforgettable."},{"Title":"Portrait of The Artist as a Young Dog","review":"I would rather read this book than any by James Joyce. Thomas may be remembered for his wonderful poems, but his short pieces are, under no circumstances, to be ignored.Thomas writes of his youth, which is a subject that many writers have attempted to write about, and where they fall short he excells.

Even though I knew of course what happens, I found Mann's retelling quite exciting. He adds such marvelous details to the bare bones of the Bible story. I didn't quite understand at the end, however, why Joseph keeps his mouth shut and goes with the traders, giving up all of his former life and knowing how devastated Jacob will be. (Mann explains this very thing at the beginning of the next book in the series.) Cannot help wanting to find out what compelled Mann to take this Bible story and so wonderfully embellish it. Even though it was written in 1938, it is timeless, as all classics are. I actually think it would make quite a movie. Intend to read the actual Bible story when I finish this quartet. Joseph seems to be maturing from the first book, particularly after he was thrown in the well.

These tools will help you to understand how to write and speak better English, and if they were not enough for you, every &quot;rule&quot; has examples and these examples, in turn, are explained when needed.The book recognizes English is a changing language, so there are exceptions for some rules, but it shows you the most general exceptions and helps you to decide which road you should take.Nonnative English speakers, beware: The book has &quot;fun parts&quot; that could be difficult to understand. If you are not an intermediate or advanced speaker of English, better look for another book.For Spanish speakers:este es un buen libro para practicar y aprender gram&aacute;tica inglesa, pero est&aacute; orientado a hablantes nativos del idioma, no a estudiantes.

This is the best single book I have found in a short, concise and easily readable volume. Fr. Schehr's book could easily be used by any Protestant student just as Catholics often use work of Protestant scholars. This book is appropriate for beginners and long time readers ready to much more seriously explore salvation history. This is another good book for those who believe as does Pope Benedict XVI that there is a knowable truth: Jesus."},{"Title":"The Bible Made Easy: A Book-by-book Introduction","review":"Fr. Schehr opens this outstanding resource with an explanation of the origins of the Bible, the differences between the Catholic Bible and others, and the connection between teachings of the Bible and the Church. He also provides a helpful framework in the form of five \\"major markers\\" representing times of freedom or deliverance for God's people.The material on each book of the Bible follows a clear format, as shown in the following example taken from the Psalms section. In the introduction we learn that St. Ambrose called the Psalter \\"a gymnasium of the soul\\" to indicate its wealth of inspiration to strengthen our faith lives. Schehr expands on that topic briefly, then discusses different types of psalms and describes the layout of the Psalter, adding a chart to summarize. He suggests effective approaches for reading the Psalter. The section closes with a list of spiritual lessons from the Psalms: (1) praying the Psalms gives us strength for the spiritual journey, (2) any human emotion can be the starting point for reaching out to God, and (3) the whole range of life is an occasion to offer praise to God. In addition, the treatment of Psalms and all other books includes \\"On the Clock,\\" an invaluable tool for keeping track. A prominent clock icon is accompanied by keywords and approximate dates for the events in the book and other historical occasions.

It is filled with just about every phrase you could possibly think of, and even has an index of every single word in the whole book, which comes in very useful. It has not only phrases, but also lots of popular single words (such as east, west, good, bad, etc.). One thing that I really liked about it is that it uses the Yiddish alphabet, instead of that stupid romanization that you see in every other modern Yiddish book. For people who can't read the Yiddish alphabet, it has a very nice guide to all of the sounds and names of the Yiddish letters. It unfortunately doesn't contain a thing about grammar or gender of nouns or using verbs, but just the same, this book is extremely useful for the Yiddish learner. I personally think that it is the best book that you will ever find for it's low cost. I would recommend it to anyone of any age that wants to learn Yiddish."},{"Title":"Say It in Yiddish","review":"There aren't many places left in the world where Yiddish is the primary language; exactly why there would be a travel-phrase book like this one is a little bit perplexing to me. Of course, it was published decades ago, and apparently hasn't been reprinted since, so used copies are the way to acquire this little gem. It is organised in the typical fashion on any travel phrase book - basic expressions; greetings and general social conversation; travel expressions concerning hotels, boats, airlines, etc.; useful words about the house; sports, school, professions; and, of course, caf&eacute; and restaurant information. There are also sections for numbers, dates, seasons, and the like.As the introduction states, whenever Yiddish is spoken, it is usually through the lens of dialects - Yiddish not having a solid geographic home in terms of major national or primary language support, the language is (for all its 'traditional' aspects) a rather fluid thing. Yiddish is, unlike English and more like German, fairly consistent in spelling and pronunciation, so once the basic pattern of pronunciation of letters is mastered, the speech is relatively simple to engage. Yiddish has strong Germanic tones despite being written in the Hebrew (Aramaic) script - this phrase book incorporates the original script as well as transliterated pronunciation. Yiddish, like Hebrew, is written and read right to left, but the transliterations are put in left-to-right for ease of English speakers.Yiddish has had a good deal of influence in English through popular use, entertainment and literature, as well as some business and marketplace uses. Yiddish is becoming more popular in recent years, including being used in schools in some parts of North America as an important secondary language.This is a phrase book, not a grammar. It shows the rudiments of pronunciation and provides handy access to ready-made phrases, but does not develop ideas of grammar and syntax, nor does it have any background of history or sociology - like a travel phrase book, it consists of pages of phrases grouped topically, with an index in the back, and sized to fit easily into a pocket.

The book is tiny and designed to fit in a shirt pocket, hence the tiny price.There is an index of words and there are major sections such as \\"parts of the body\\" and \\"business\\" and \\"restaurant\\" vocabulary.The book is very business like and it is apparent that it is intended to be an easy-to-access phrase book for folks new to Israel or any area with a large Yiddish-speaking population."},{"Title":"Say It in Yiddish","review":"Great little book !!

That's a lot of Hail Mary's from a guy that's said quite a few Hail Marys himself. And I would venture a guess that Mr. Berry is not that happy with his roots, which appear to be Catholic. I'm not sure; doesn't make any difference. But, a lot of people in and out of the church aren't too happy. I think that's probably the nature of the God-Man relationship. You believe it and accept it or you don't.So Mr. Berry posits that the Visitations of Mary were in fact real and she spoke to a select few, and the few were not prelates of the church but rather the most common of folk . . . if you believe, that's kind of how it went. And the church revealed part of the conversations heard by the folks . . . but Berry alleges, not all.And what the church conspired to hide was tumultuous. Staggering. Incredible.

We find that there has been a conspiracy by past Popes to cover up a part of \\"The Third\\" Secret\\", which is part of a Marian appearance. This secret part would allegedly contradict present church doctrine.This is a nice work of fiction, based on a good bit of truth. If you like Dan Brown, you will enjoy this book."},{"Title":"THIRD SECRET: A Novel Of Suspense (H)","review":"This is definately a must read for someone interested in Fatima. Steve Berry does an excellent job in keeping you glued to the pages until it's done! I personally don't think he did bad at all for only his what, third book? Great job...a great read...and a great subject in these times of the Da Vinci Code. Espionage, suspense and history combined in a fictional story of intrigue. Buy it...you won't be sorry!"},{"Title":"THIRD SECRET: A Novel Of Suspense (H)","review":"The one thing this author does really well, and we see it in both The Amber Room and The Romanov Prophecy, is combine history and suspense. When it comes to his latest thriller, The Third Secret, there are plenty of both. The main problem, and this is why I only give it 3 stars, is the huge amount of \\"liberal projection\\" Mr. Berry foists onto the Roman Catholic Church. I will not give away the \\"third secret\\", but I will say that he somehow assumes that the message given at Fatima was written by the liberal branch of the Catholic Church. On one hand, I suppose this says more about the obvious chasm that separates the American (and to a lesser degree European church) from her friends south of the equator. With the election of Benedict, and the subsequent moaning and groaning in America, is it clear that there is a divide in the church over basic issues; homosexuality, marriage of priests, women in the church, etc. The best place for this dialogue is not in a work of fiction. I am not Catholic, but even I took great offense at the notion that it is appropriate to project one's person bias onto a historical event and then shroud it in historical truth. I hate this about Oliver Stone and I am disappointed by it in Mr. Berry. This is an author with great promise and I hate to see him obscure history through his own narrow lens. I hope that his next work of \\"fiction\\" keeps this in mind. Stick to what you do well, Mr. Berry!!!"},{"Title":"THIRD SECRET: A Novel Of Suspense (H)","review":"Another Da Vinci Code-like thriller - fast paced of course, but this one is very well written. The Third Secret is driven by the events of the miracle at Fatima, Portugal and a conspiracy in the Catholic Church, if you can imagine such a thing. The intricacies and politics of the Vatican are examined while the story races along, and coming on the heels of the latest conclave and installation of the new Pope just makes this book even more irresistible. Fascinating history, meticulously researched (as always by this author) and spellbinding to boot."},{"Title":"THIRD SECRET: A Novel Of Suspense (H)","review":"The Third Secret is a closely guarded prophesy handed down by an apparition of the Virgin Mary to a young shepardess in Fatima. For years the young girl kept her secret, but it was ultimately written and translated to be kept safe in The Vatican. This novel finds the current pope, Clement XV, involved in a battle over the direction of the Catholic Church. Some are moving for change that allows for priests to marry and have families, some feel that the Church is already too progressive and needs to return to its more traditional dogma. Clement's secrety, Monsignor Colin Michener finds himself in the middle of a battle between these two ideals with instructions to track down details regarding The Third Secret. What he finds are powers stronger than he ever speculated that want the secret to remain a mystery and will go to any length to ensure that it stays that way. During his adventure, he battles his own inner demons and feelings that he finds at conflict with his oath to the Church.Comparisons to DaVinci Code and Angels and Demons are inevitable and not completely undeserved. What is similar is the religious based plot line and the elements of both good and bad that are alleged to be involved in the inner workings of the Catholic Church. However, the writing in The Third Secret is better than Dan Brown's. This novel is not always as fast paced as Brown's, and it does not have as much \\"action/adventure,\\" but the thrill comes from the interplay between the characters instead of during a race from one ancient document or building to another. In some ways this book is \\"smarter,\\" but fans of the Indiana Jones style of fiction may be disappointed. All in all it is facinating to speculate that this type of manipulation and politicing takes place within the walls of The Vatican."},{"Title":"THIRD SECRET: A Novel Of Suspense (H)","review":"This is an immensely entertaining thriller that revolves around the third secret of Fatima, as well as Vatican political intrigues, murder, and mystery. It is a fast-paced, plot driven thriller. So strong is the plot that the fact that the book is short on character development will not disturb the reader one whit. The plot will keep the reader compulsively turning the pages of this skillfully plotted book. While the book may disturb some readers, due to the depiction of some its clerical characters as power hungry and capable of murder, one should keep in mind that this is a work of fiction. Besides, priests are people, too, and, as such they are, no less than the rest of us, subject to temptation.Central to the plot is the papal secretary, Monsignor Colin Michener, who has served the elderly Pope Clement XV for many years. They have an almost father-son relationship, and Monsignor Michener has noticed that the Pope has been acting a little strange lately, making numerous visits to the papal archives. It seems that the Pope has become obsessed with the third secret of Fatima, as he has been given some new information related to it. Consequently, he decides to send Monsignor Michener to Romania on a very special mission, as it appears that all is not what it seems.Meanwhile, back at the Vatican, political intrigues abound, as Cardinal Valendrea, avaricious and power hungry, plots on becoming pope when Pope Clement XV goes to meet his maker. Cardinal Valendrea is extremely conservative and traditional in terms of his agenda for Catholicism. He loathes Pope Clement XV and his stance on many of the issues confronting Catholicism today. He will, therefore, resort to any means necessary to secure that which he most desires. Cardinal Ngovi, the cardinal for Nairobi, on the other hand, represents the new order in Catholicism. He is a close friend of the Pope and is very much aware of Cardinal Valendrea's perfidy and venality. Valendrea and Ngovi represent the two warring factions within the Vatican.When Monsignor Michener completes his mission to Romania, he is then sent by the Pope to Bosnia, to the village of Medjugorje, the sight of visitations by the Blessed Virgin Mary, where, as with Fatima, there are secrets. He is to speak to one of the seers to whom the visitations were made. Traveling with Monsignor Michener is Katerina Lew, a journalist with whom he has a secret past. As events transpire and secrets unfold, Monsignor Michener finds himself drawn into a conspiratorial web. At the heart of the conspiracy is a secret that will rock the bedrock of Catholicism.This is work of fiction that is interwoven with historical details and world events. It is a page-turning thriller that will be enjoyed by fans of \\"The Da VInci Code\\" and \\"Angels and Demons\\", as well as by those who enjoy well-plotted, fast-paced thrillers."},{"Title":"THIRD SECRET: A Novel Of Suspense (H)","review":"I'm certainly no expert when it comes to writing styles, so mine is a \\"common person's\\" review. As the title indicates, I found this to be a fun book to read. It was very easy to follow the story line (didn't get too complicated) and it held my attention in the \\"can't put it down\\" catagory. Some books require you to work at following story lines, characters and so on. This one doesn't. As in another of Steve Berry's books, the plot places two groups of people with their own agendas opposite one another and the author makes it easy for the reader to stay on track by alternating the two sides on an every-other-chapter basis.Some reviewers have accused the author of pushing his own political agendas, but then again, don't most writers do the same? At least to some point? I suppose I'm least offended by his view points as I tend to be on the same side of the fence as he is. Ultimately, even though it does contain facts and speaks of real-life personalities, I see this as a work of fiction, not a set of ideas intended to sway opinions.I'd recommend this as a relaxing escape on a cold winter afternoon or as an excellent summer book. Light enough for casual reading yet containing enough suspense to hold your attention."},{"Title":"THIRD SECRET: A Novel Of Suspense (H)","review":"I wish the Catholic bashing would stop; perhaps a way to do so would be a real 3rd secret. I finished this book just because I took it as total fantasy. If you put aside all the preconceptions about doctrine, Catholic history, etc., and are willing to just go for a ride without expecting the thing to make \\"Catholic sense,\\" the book can actually be rather enjoying in its plot. Of course, the actual 3rd secret (which has been revealed by everyone reviewing the book here) is ludicrous, but entertaining if you can set aside everything else. So it's what you expect; a Steve Berry novel, which has its own universe. You should expect to get what you know you are buying from this author, nothing more."},{"Title":"THIRD SECRET: A Novel Of Suspense (H)","review":"I thought this book was great until it disclosed the Third Secret.It had Suspense,Mystery and Romance,but the ending was Lame!The Author could have used more creativity here."},{"Title":"THIRD SECRET: A Novel Of Suspense (H)","review":"I kept reading past the midpoint of the book, hoping that this was not going to be another liberal-inspired jab at the Catholic church. But, as the end wore on, sure enough all of the liberal jargon found its way in to the final chapters, pro-choice, homosexuality is OK, female priests, married priests. This is suppose to be a novel, but I hate to see an author play fast and loose with factual history to satisfy a political motive. This book is a waste of time. My first Steve Berry read, and my last."},{"Title":"THIRD SECRET: A Novel Of Suspense (H)","review":"This book is rife with misconceptions about the Catholic Church and is a disappointing read for anyone with even the slightest understanding of marian apparitions. The suspense builds until finally, near the end of the book, the missing portion of the \\"third secret of Fatima\\" is revealed. The problem is that the missing portion of the secret is preposterous and unbelievable, making the climax of the book a disappointment.I am surprised that best-selling author Steve Berry would produce a book that is so poorly researched. He has lost credibility with me and I will never read another of his books.Beyond betraying the author's ignorance of the Catholic Church, the book was poorly edited and had many typos. At one point, the name of even one of the main characters was misspelled!While many would find the book's suspense compelling, I thought reading it was a waste of time."},{"Title":"THIRD SECRET: A Novel Of Suspense (H)","review":"I began reading Steve Berry's books in order. The first two were fine. The Third Secret was just absurd. I got almost to the end and just gave up. Very rarely will I not finish a book once I get into it. I can overlook some implausability and use my imagination when reading, but this was just too far. I thought Dan Brown's Demons & Angels was pretty farfetched at the end, but The Third Secret is even worse. I am not particularly religious, so it wasn't that I was offended by the book. I stopped reading Mr. Berry's books for quite some time after this book. I finally decided to pick up with his next book, which is much better so far.I recommend this author, in general, for some light, entertaining reading, but skip this installment."},{"Title":"THIRD SECRET: A Novel Of Suspense (H)","review":"This was my third Steve Berry novel and I have to say that I loved this one by far! Very entertaining, so much so I kept thinking about getting back to reading it while at work! Having visited Bamberg before and lived in Italy I found the novel to be accurate in both the descriptions of the locations and the 'politics' at the Vatican.

If this really is a revelation from God via Mary, why of all things would He choose to reveal these things? Why not a global push towards clarifying religion?2. Since the revelations were so anti-Catholic in the current sense, why wouldn't the main characters think it might be a deception from the devil himself? I mean just because an apparition says she's Mary, you have to believe she's Mary? What happened to faith and why is it necessary to have a sign? If there were obvious signs all the time, we wouldn't need faith.The book had so much potential, but I think Berry blew it in the end."},{"Title":"THIRD SECRET: A Novel Of Suspense (H)","review":"Although an intriguing tale, the author fails to acknowledge that Our Lady's message is one of love and repetence and then substitutes tolerance of sin. Berry's characters are interesting but he takes too many liberties for my liking. A good read but as far as Fatima fiction, I place this book far below Windswept House and Secret of Fatima."},{"Title":"THIRD SECRET: A Novel Of Suspense (H)","review":"I bought this book in hopes that it might compare to Dan Brown's novels with his masterful mix of political intrigue, historical theory and fact, unforeseen plot developments and well-written characters. Conversely, The Third Secret seems implausible, poorly written and simplistic. The story centers on Colin Michener, a believable character, and his inner debate with God and the Vatican concerning his ex-girlfriend and the necessity of ruthless ambition within the Sacred College. Father Michener's wish to reconcile the demands of Catholicism with his own feelings makes him easy to identify with. The novel has a promising beginning, but it fails to develop three-dimensional characters or unexpected plot twists. After all, the story centers around knowledge that God approves of abortion, female clergy, papal suicide and married priests. Not that these things would be bad, but rather extremely unrealistic in view of Catholic dogma. The book also features many typos including multiple misspellings of one of the main characters' names and other common words. I suppose I should have known better when I saw that all of the outstanding reviews on the cover are from newspapers in Wichita Falls, Memphis, Orlando and Roanoke, without a Post, Globe or Times review in sight."},{"Title":"THIRD SECRET: A Novel Of Suspense (H)","review":"I've now read all of Berry's books and although I mostly enjoyed the story lines, I progressively grew weary of how Berry re-writes his own version of Christianity into each one. I realize this is fiction, but each story seemed to try harder to change some truths about Christianity. I read The Third Secret last, and finally have decided to stop reading Berry's books. Writing about Mary, the mother of Jesus, visiting the earth and telling us that heaven approves of homosexuality and that abortion is just fine if that's what the mother wants??? I realize that not everyone believes the Bible. But if you do, these two issues are clearly defined as sin. Interesting that in his \\"Writer's Note\\" at the end of the book, he discusses what is fact and what is fiction...but absolutely fails to mention his own fictional words he put into the mouth of Mary. Decent story until this ficticious third secret is revealed."},{"Title":"THIRD SECRET: A Novel Of Suspense (H)","review":"All novels of Vatican misdeeds follow a tried and true cast of characters, and formula. The good Pope v. the bad Secretary of State; the Pope's confidant - a good priest on the verge of loosing his faith; the conflicted journalist, in this case doing double-duty as the romantic interest (a knock-out, as usual;) and the well placed allies and adversaries of the above, doing battle for the heart and soul of a Church steeped in mystery and locked in crisis - \\"The Third Secret,\\" is no different.The book's opening chapter, a re-telling of the Blessed Virgin's appearances at Fatima is so poorly written (third grade level,) I almost gave the book a toss, but as a true fan of the genre I decided to persevere. I'm glad I did, because Mr. Berry has constructed a page-turner.Though the characters are stock, Mr. Berry has filled them out enough beyond clich&eacute; to make them interesting. If they aren't three dimensional, they are at least 2 dimensional - good enough for a pot-boiler. The villains aren't completely villainous; and the good guys suffer enough turmoil and doubt to ground them.Mr. Berry is well steeped in the inner workings of the Vatican, and gives new twists to the life of the Curia, the politics of the Church's princes, and the mechanics of papal ascension.The plot takes some interesting turns as it revolves around the unveiling of a hitherto missing portion of the third secret of Fatima, hence the title. The secret has caused Pope's to tremble, and if revealed will shake the Church to its foundations. Without giving anything away, suffice it to say the Virgin Lady anticipated today's culture wars, and decided to side with the ultra-left wing of Catholicism. The message turns out to be even more laughable than the jokes that it has inspired through the years, and unfortunately for the novel, suspension of disbelief goes right out the window as soon as the secret is revealed. A pity, because I thought Mr. Berry was on to something bigger than a wish-list of ultra-liberal fantasies.\\"The Third Secret,\\" is a good beach, or airplane read - perfect for the summer - a cut above \\"Angels and Demons,\\" though most everything is; but, because of its d&eacute;nouement, as unsuccessful as any other title in the genre."},{"Title":"THIRD SECRET: A Novel Of Suspense (H)","review":"I was enchanted with this novel. First of all, I am a practicing Catholic who has read greatly about the apparitions at Fatima and Medjugorje.

The characters in Berry's novel were very believable to me.I so much appreciated all of the research that went on to write this novel.The most important part for me in this novel was to really think about what might be in those secrets.

It is a fun read which ties itself up nicely in the end. I find myself so many times getting bogged down with writers for the first 300 pages, they then wrap things up in the final 50 with a style that illustrates they ran out of juice. This is not that way. Great history lesson and full of facts. I love the intrigue of what the Vatican library holds and this gives some insight although only a smidgen of what must be there behind locked doors. Characters are interesting and if you have a weak stomach when it comes to Popes, be careful. They are portrayed as human here folks, same drives, desires and hiccups like you and I.

If an author is going to usehis liberal pipedreams as the basis of novel, at least he could do ismake it much more plausible and entertaining than this.Although I'm not Catholic and have fundamental and profound theologicaldisagreements with Catholic doctrine, it's laughable to assert thatthe Third Secret that Berry finally reveals could cause such a negative impactas he imagines. True, the Catholic faith has a problem because it placesChurch Tradition and the papacy on the same authoritative level as theBible, but it wouldn't take five minutes for a competent Biblical scholarto disprove much less neutralize Berry's \\"revelations.\\"Suppose Berry's plot actually happened. Suppose the messages in thevisions were actually given as Berry imagines. Only someone who hasno Biblical knowledge or skill at simple Biblical exegesis or, on the otherhand, someone who believes special revelation continues today likecharismatics claim, could swallow such balderdash and be deceived (thoughI'm certain many would be). We find in the early pages of the Bible TWO standardsby which to determine if a \\"prophecy\\" is of genuine divine origin. ONE, it must come to pass if it is of a future fulfillment. If it does not, the person is a false prophet. TWO, and it is here Berry fails miserably, is that if the nature of themessage contradicts what is already written in Scripture, or would lead someoneto behave in a manner forbidden by God, the message, and the messenger, is false and is not to be obeyed.Therefore, within Berry's own creation, there is this ridiculous internal inconsistency which makes nonsense of his entire premise.Well worth avoiding the waste of time I unfortunately spent reading this tripe."},{"Title":"THIRD SECRET: A Novel Of Suspense (H)","review":"Don't be discouraged by the negative reviews on this book that you see here on Amazon. Most come from touchy religious types. The setting for the book is the Vatican and the world of Catholicism. The book is well written with good character development, a steadily developing plot and building suspense. A lot of accurate background information is provided pertaining to the Vatican and Catholicism and the story has a historical setting. However, keep in mind this is a work of fiction. The book is an easy read, but offers a lot more interest than many of the currently available books from the volume authors who crank out a couple of books a year.

A must read if you are searching for the next best religious mystery!"},{"Title":"THIRD SECRET: A Novel Of Suspense (H)","review":"I truly enjoyed the suspense and intrigue surrounding the main character's (Colin) search to discover the third secret. I am not sure how \\"real\\" it is, but the backstabbing and inner workings at the Vatican were fascinating.However, many of the plot devices, such as the Vatican Secretary of State using Colin's ex-lover as a spy, and numerous recording devices around the Vatican (shades of Nixon) just rang false, as if the author was really stretching. I didn't get this feeling when I read the DaVinci code, of which this books seems like a second-grade imitation.Most disappointing is the revelation of the 3rd Secret. This was alluded to in previous reviews, so I won't give it away. Suffice to say, it's highly disappointing and will leave you feeling cheated.Don't buy this book, check it out at the library!"},{"Title":"THIRD SECRET: A Novel Of Suspense (H)","review":"Before one starts reading THE THIRD SECRET, it would be a good idea to take a nice deep breath and accept the fact that this is one book that will raise some controversy. The Catholic Church is considered fair game right now, and some of the wounds it has suffered in recent years have been self-inflicted. Accordingly, this tale of entrenched interests versus the humble servants trying to do the right thing seeks, ultimately, to turn faith and logic --- they're not necessarily mutually exclusive --- on their respective ears. So the conclusion of Steve Berry's latest novel inevitably will upset some folks. Fair enough. The thing to remember is that THE THIRD SECRET is a story, a work of fiction, and does not pretend to be anything more, or less. It also is excitingly and brilliantly told, and a terrific read.The backstory of THE THIRD SECRET is in some ways almost as interesting as the novel itself. Berry wrote this religion-tinged manuscript in 1998, and garnered a ton of rejection slips before ultimately selling it as part of a well-deserved three-book deal in 2002. One finds it difficult to understand why this novel wasn't snapped up years ago. Dealing as it does with one of the more interesting controversies of the twentieth century, THE THIRD SECRET is an intricate, well-written tale that undoubtedly will generate discussion and controversy.The title refers to the revelation bestowed upon three shepherd children in Fatima, Portugal in 1917 during a series of appearances by the Virgin Mary. Three messages were purported to be given to the children: the first two were revealed almost immediately, while the revelation of the third was to be delayed. A number of popes read the secret but refused to reveal it. One apocryphal story concerned John XXIII reading it and crying, in seclusion, for three weeks. John Paul II ultimately revealed the secret in 2000, the official explanation being that it prophesied the assassination attempt upon his own life that had taken place some years previously. The thrust of the novel is that the third secret of Fatima is, in fact, something else entirely; that the true secret is known only to each pope (and, as it turns out, to a number of others); and that the successor popes have declined to reveal the third secret because it would shake the beliefs that the modern church holds dear and true.As THE THIRD SECRET begins, Pope Clement XV is deeply troubled by a matter of conscience concerning the secret that brings him repeatedly into the Vatican's private archives where the Fatima papers are kept. Clement sends his trusted secretary and friend, Father Colin Michener, into Romania to seek out one of the only individuals who may know the true meaning behind the third secret. There are, however, malevolent forces within The Vatican who know what the third secret really is and what its revelation will mean not only to the Church but also to its inherent power --- and who will stop at nothing to keep the secret from being uncovered.Michener, meanwhile, is distracted by his own passions, which his vow of celibacy forbids him from satisfying. In addition to his mission, Michener must resolve the issue of why his vocation and his God seem to leave him unfulfilled. Berry balances these issues nicely, keeping his story running along a number of parallel tracks while never dwelling for too long on one scenario while switching to another. The result is a complex, exciting work that is almost impossible to put down.The ultimate revelation presented in THE THIRD SECRET may well spoil the work for some; one wonders if Berry might have been better served to leave the foundation of the secret unanswered for the reader to sort out. But again, THE THIRD SECRET is a work of fiction, well-written and well-told. It ultimately is well worth reading, whether or not the concluding revelations as presented are to one's liking."},{"Title":"THIRD SECRET: A Novel Of Suspense (H)","review":"The author is quite talented; the book well written. The religious history very interesting. There is sufficient adventure, intrigue and excitement.But the central theme, that many core beliefs of Catholicism are at odds with the God it purports to serve, that Mary herself has repudiated such beliefs, and that a progressive pope will shortly put an end to these beliefs, is more than a stretch, it devolves into an anti-Catholic message that is wrapped around a good yarn. This is exacerbated by the depiction of high church officials as evil Mafia type figures who readily engage in heinous acts, including murder and extortion. Yes, some church officials have in the past been guilty of deceit and cover ups to protect child abusers, but this is a far cry from high church officials engaging in conduct rivaling that of the characters in \\"The Godfather\\" series. But if comparing the Catholic church to the evil demonstrated in those movies is your cup to tea, then this book is for you."},{"Title":"THIRD SECRET: A Novel Of Suspense (H)","review":"Being a Roman Catholic, I would advice everyone to read this book (catholics and non-catholics).

It was well written but came off as a little dry to me. One of the things you will get though, is an intellectual thriller that takes a close look at the Vatican and it's possible conflicts within its ranks.From inside: \\"...four basic rules of Vatican survival.

I bought it because I had enjoyed other works by Steve Berry, and I like the genre. Having read the DaVinci Code, for example, I regarded Berry as a more engaging and better writer than Dan Brown. Then I got The Third Secret. It's lame. The anti-Church criticisms are formulaic and without nuance. I found it amazing that, for example, Berry's stridency against Church rules prohibiting Catholic priests marrying offended me because, in fact, I agree with Berry's position. It's just that we was so overbearing in his preaching that it detracted from what should have been his main point...entertaining (not insulting) the reader.The villainous Cardinal, his amoral henchman, the female interest (whose thought processes are completely unrealistic) and, of course, the emotionally torn protagonist are one dimensional and unbelievable.I do not say to not buy another Steve Book...I bought this one because I liked the other ones I read.

A fun read!!"},{"Title":"THIRD SECRET: A Novel Of Suspense (H)","review":"Berry writes a fast-paced thriller infused with history and the mystery of the Vatican. Granted, the intrigue in the real Vatican is probably not nearly as exciting. And Berry's excitement is driven by characters written at stereotypical extremes. I doubt there's a whole a lot of priests like these running around the Vatican (but that wouldn't be exciting, would it?). The revealing of the \\"third secret\\" is a bit of a let down. Just like the Da Vinci Code, it's hard to resolve all that build-up, though at least Berry actually does some historical research, not perfect, but much better than Dan Brown. The Fatima visions, etc., are also an interesting study.The third secret is more of politically statement, urging the church to accept things like ending priest celibacy, allowing woman priests and not opposing birth control. Few would oppose those things, even if they don't make for that exciting of a secret. But Berry then uses the same bad logic that has preserved things like priest celibacy and applies it to abortion and homosexual relations. Sorry, Berry, but Mary didn't \\"choose.\\" She wasn't pregnant yet. She chose whether to be pregnant to begin with. Let's stop pretending the issue is about \\"choice.\\" It's about whether or not killing innocent lives is acceptable. How's this different from saving the orphans in Romania the book talks about? If they are a burden too, why save them? And the \\"ban\\" on homosexuality is more than a theology drawn from Adam & Eve and elsewhere, it's drawn from biological design. How do people miss that fundamental concept? Berry is a good writer, theologian he is not."},{"Title":"THIRD SECRET: A Novel Of Suspense (H)","review":"I agree that \\"The Third Secret\\" is no \\"DaVinci Code\\" or \\"Angels and Demons,\\" but it is definitely worth the read. I bought the audio version, as I travel a lot - and I literally fall asleep at the wheel if I don't have a book going. While \\"The Third Secret\\" moves more slowly than Brown's books, it keeps the mystery moving and engages the listener with more than enough motivation to find out what happens next.Additionally, the narrator for this version, Paul Michael, is amazing. I listen to large numbers of audio books... and I have yet to find someone as versatile and easy on the ears as Michael."},{"Title":"THIRD SECRET: A Novel Of Suspense (H)","review":"I really wanted to like this book. Even when I found gross errors concerning basic Catholic Doctrine regarding confession, infallibility and suicide. Not to mention the idea that Paul VI would send his secretary back into the archives alone and with his Papal Seal. Get real people.As I was reading I had developed the idea (or hope) that Berry would present the third secret as an admonishment to the Curia for their lack of Christian leadership and a call to correct the errors of their predecessors. He had laid the ground work in pointing out that self interest is alive and well within the Curia. He had also pointed to the lack of the Vatican's Christian responsibility regarding the care of those in need.In short, the Vatican leadership of the Catholic Church today, and for centuries (since the time of Constantine), bears a strong resemblance to the actions of the Temple Sanhedrin of our Lord's time. They do not practice Christianity as our Lord taught. They store up earthly treasure for themselves and the Church (under the guise of protection), follow the Letter of the Law (Doctrines and Traditions) without concern to the Spirit of the teachings of Christ in much the same way that the religious leadership of the Jewish people ingored the Spirit of their own laws and worked to contrive their way around the Letter of the Law to satisify their own self interests, all while rationalizing that their actions were for the good of the people.So I was disapointed with the book. I did read it all the way through which counts for one star and I did learn a few things about the orphans in Romania and the birthing homes in Ireland. So that merits another star. But I had the distinct impression when I finnished the book that Berry had a deadline to meet and had to \\"wrap it up\\" and the \\"secret\\" he presented was \\"way off the wall\\" and not even worthy of the slightest consideration.I would not recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"THIRD SECRET: A Novel Of Suspense (H)","review":"I had the opportunity to go to a book club meeting where Steve Berry spoke about his books.

I had read Berry's first novel, The Amber Room, and found it mildly interesting though not very well-written. Berry has improved significantly since then, and I'll probably give some of his other books a try. His writing, though still containing the occasional awkward phrase, is much smoother and more elegant, and his plotting is tighter and well-paced.Berry's research skills are truly impressive; he employs a wealth of fascinating information about the inner workings and politics of the Vatican, and the results are quite convincing. He also includes an afterward that identifies which elements of the plot are factual and which are invented or embellished; compare this to Dan Brown, who brazenly asserts that all of the absurdities in his novels are 100 percent true.The novel's \\"big secret,\\" as revealed in the final chapters, is a bit of a letdown (Berry seems to be taking a shot at the glacial conservatism of Catholicism), but overall it's a fun book."},{"Title":"THIRD SECRET: A Novel Of Suspense (H)","review":"... the first dozen or so pages are crammed chock-a-block with most every anti-Catholic cliche you can think of.

Telling a priest it's okay to sleep with a woman to whom he is not married2. Giving the thumbs up to same sex sexual relationtionships3. Approving of abortionNow, regardless of how you feel about these issues (and yes, I know it's fiction), it's still very, very, very poor form to put what is clearly anti-catholic (and what many would say is anti-Christian) doctrine/ideas in the mouth of Mary.Particularly ridiculous is the idea that Mary \\"chose\\" to have Jesus and so she clearly favors abortion.Aye carumba...Steve Berry should thank God that Christianity is different than many other world religions. If he tried this kind of garbage with some religious figures he'd probably end up having to go underground.As it is, he should merely be ashamed of this insulting, poorly written rip-off of the Da Vinci Code."},{"Title":"THIRD SECRET: A Novel Of Suspense (H)","review":"Monsignor Colin Michener is the personal assistant to the current pope, a man who is his dearest friend and adviser. But for all their closeness, the Pope is keeping a secret from Colin.

Colin's world is turned upside down, though, when the Pope commits suicide. Immediately, men begin vying for the position of pope, but Colin has a different mission. Complete a task the deceased pope asked him to and uncover the third secret of Fatima.There will be no more Steve Berry for me. I had tried three or four novels by this author and I find them to all be the same: contrived, poorly written, ridiculous plotlines, and unlikeable characters. I nearly laughed aloud when reading this novel when the pope committed suicide. It was just ridiculous! The entire story was ridiculous. I didn't care for a single character in this novel and was not impressed by Berry's writing style. I would not recommend this novel to anyone, not even as a library loan."},{"Title":"THIRD SECRET: A Novel Of Suspense (H)","review":"Having read all that Steve Berry has written, I expected much more from this author. The entire book deals with the inside of the Vatican and the machinations and politics behind picking a pope and the various disagreements between people that live and work there. Then you throw in some old time miracles and their interpretaions, without really revealing what they mean until the end, and all you get is a boring book that never satisfies.The reason I entitled this a religious impossibility is because some of the characters in the book, cardinals, the new pope, etc., are so evil and downright criminal, that there is no way they would have not been found out long ago, even assuming you throw out the logic of seemly holy individuals actually engaging in murder, assasination and bribary. Even the good guy is clueless for most of the book. When the end arrives, number one, you're finally glad its over, and number two, you relly don't care about the, hidden for years, prophecy. Read something else."},{"Title":"THIRD SECRET: A Novel Of Suspense (H)","review":"Although an intriguing tale, the author fails to acknowledge that Our Lady's message is one of love and repetence and then substitutes tolerance of sin.

I had read the reviews, but decided to read it myself. I was really impressed. Steve took someone we only hear about - the pope - and made him human. The characters were strong enough for me to get an understanding of what their personality is like. I think the end was a bit much - the part about women priests and married priests I could see, but the rest was a little overboard. All in all, I thought Berry did a good job with the story and it kept my attention. I do not judge a fiction book based upon my beliefs. I defended the Da Vinci Code because it was fiction. This is also fiction, so regardless of how you may feel about what Berry puts in the book please keep in mind that it is make-believe! The Third Secret is entertaining, the characters are interesting, and you will be able to escape into a different world for a few hours. That is why I read books - to enjoy some time away. If that is why you read, you will enjoy this book."},{"Title":"THIRD SECRET: A Novel Of Suspense (H)","review":"I enjoyed Berry's two other novels, despite reading reviews which complained that both books were too far-fetched and improbable. I do not mind suspending reality to read a book or to watch a movie, but this book took things a little too far! I am Catholic, and maybe that is why I found Berry's third secret revealed at Fatima and subsequently hidden by the Church too unbelieveable. There were several parts to the secret, and if Berry would have limited its scope, the book would have been more compelling and believeable. The portion of the secret that deals with motherhood is just totally improbable and Berry just goes too far with it. Also, it is too trite that the villian in the novel is always able to figure out the protagonist's next step. This book starts off well, but attempts to accomplish too much, which makes it difficult for the reader to suspend reality and enjoy the story."},{"Title":"THIRD SECRET: A Novel Of Suspense (H)","review":"If you don't mind the liberal propaganda and the way Berry totally ignores any Scripture that contradicts his agenda, you may enjoy this book. It is a page-turner. However, when the third secret is finally revealed, it is quite anti-climatic after all the build-up it was given. I was expecting something apocolyptic and got the Democratic platform for social policy instead. Conservative Catholics and all Christians who happen to believe the Bible is true will find the book offensive."},{"Title":"THIRD SECRET: A Novel Of Suspense (H)","review":"Sure the \\"secret\\" is outrageous, but then, the same can be said about organized religion in general, so I didn't have a problem with it. I loved the book and thought it had a great plot and was an entertaining read, which I believe is what it was intended to be - hello - fiction! It wasn't preachy or didactic and therefore, in general, annoying as so many other authors seem to be with this and similar subjects (case in point - The Last Templar by Raymond Khoury, OMG, bleck!!!). Taken for what it is - a good page turner - it's one of Berry's best, in my opinion, and certainly inspired me to read all of his novels (this was the first I read), none of which have disappointed to date."},{"Title":"THIRD SECRET: A Novel Of Suspense (H)","review":"Wonderful writer with a terrific background, character development and story style.

I enjoy books that create the \\"what if\\" question."},{"Title":"THIRD SECRET: A Novel Of Suspense (H)","review":"This is a book about Papal politics and Marian visions. It is a great blend between dogma and true religion that is spiritual in nature. Steve Berry captures very well the nature of all his characters and you get a clear idea about the way in which they think. I think the character of Valendrea is illustrated very well and you really get a sense of the kind of man he is just by reading about his day to day interactions. The whole Fatima and Medjugorje visions are described well. The way he has handled explosive debates ranging from marriage of priests, women priests and abortion is done very well and it all comes together well in the end. The only one wish I had was for the protagonist Colin Michener to remain in the church and rise to the papacy some day and also for the actual victory and naming of the one who will become pope. I do not wish to reveal any details, so go read it."},{"Title":"THIRD SECRET: A Novel Of Suspense (H)","review":"An excellent and easy read.

Some of it is pretty stereotypical in its depiction of the outsiders (non-Italians) being good guys and the insiders (Italians) being the bad guys, but someone has to be the good guy and someone has to be the bad guy or there would not be a story.I was a little disappointed that the third secret was revealed at the end. It won't effect the enjoyment of the book very much if you know what the third secret is. Basic the third secret is every liberal American catholic's wet dream. Birth control and abortion is OK, so is homosexuality, and presumably non-marital sex of any kind, as long as there is some kind of love in the equation, and women can be priests.If you buy into the idea that religion doesn't need to take a moral stance, than I guess you will appreciate the third secret. personally, i think the book would have been better off without revealing what the third secret was.Even so, it is a good read, even with a few flaws."},{"Title":"THIRD SECRET: A Novel Of Suspense (H)","review":"Colin Michener is secretary to well-loved Pope Clement XV, and lately he has become concerned about the pope's behavior. He seems obsessed with one of the secrets contained within the Vatican's Riserva, a special room filled with historic documents available only to popes. In 1917, the Virgin Mary appeared to three children in Fatima, Portugal, and Clement XV keeps entering the Riserva to read the documents related to the apparition. Clement is an old man, in failing health, and many believe he is not long for the world. His chosen secretary of state, Cardinal Alberto Valendrea, has big plans for his own papacy, just as soon as the annoying current pope is out of the way. He believes Clement is far too liberal, and Valendrea wants to advance his own highly conservative agenda, not to mention his plans for personal glorification. He will allow nothing to get in his way, and if a few inconvenient people have to be murdered along the way, they're just martyrs for the cause. On errands for the pope, Colin finds himself in Valendrea's sights, and also finds himself conflicted when the one woman he once loved reappears at critical moments. She's been hired by Valendrea to find out what Michener's errands for the pope are all about, but she finds her loyalties shifting back to the man she once loved, even though he once left her for the church.This is a very well-researched novel with plenty of intrigue, but I find that my suspension of disbelief does not translate to religious matters. Catholics or people with an interest in religious practices will likely find a lot of fascinating subject matter in this book, but I fear it was wasted on me. Despite this, however, the book did hold my interest, and the final third was filled with gripping suspense. One big flaw that annoyed me for most of the book, however, was that the reader was left out of the loop. This is one of my least favorite plot devices. Everyone in the story seemed to know all about the Third Secret of Fatima and why it was so shocking, but the author didn't bother to let us in on the details until near the end. That's just bad form. If the protagonist knows, I need to know. Rather than making me want to read faster so I can be caught up to speed, this tactic makes me lose interest in the story. Why should I care what's driving these people to do all the things they're doing if I don't know what it is?Religious differences and that point aside, however, this was a pretty good book. I'm sure some would find the things I did not care for quite fascinating. Steve Berry isn't the best thriller author out there, but he's a solid writer and his books are fairly well-plotted and worth reading."},{"Title":"THIRD SECRET: A Novel Of Suspense (H)","review":"AGHH!!

After reading The Third Secret for a second time, the first being years ago when it just came out (and I had forgotten much of it), I was devastated to learn that you simply had the wrong secret! All along I thought I knew exactly what the secret was that the popes agonized over: that the Virgin Mary wanted the church to revert back to the pastoral church of Christ, drop the gold and riches, the pomp and circumstance, and become once again the true and simple church of God. Take away the power and corruption and concentrate only on the red words of the New Testament. Her request should have been to to return the wealth to the people, and for that reason the popes kept the secret tightly hidden in the vault. Everyone knows that the Catholic Church can't do that! Also, this time I listened to the books-on-tape version and I was seriously disappointed that there was no \\"author's note\\" explaining what was real and what was artistic license. Author Steve Berry obviously did some incredible research on the subject and I'd love to know if his version of the Marian apparitions is accurate.

Buried deep within the Vatican lies the translation of a 'secret' revealed to a trio of poor children in the early 20th century, after seeing a purported vision of the Virgin Mary. Two prior messages were revealed almost immediately, but the Third Secret of the Fatima visions remained locked away for many years...but no more. Having been revealed to the world a few years prior, the third secret still troubles the current Pope, Clement XV. It troubles him so much so that he regularly visits the archive where the translation remains locked away, under orders to be opened by no one but the Pope.The Vatican, like any other agency of great power, holds few truly loyal friends for Clement XV. He entrusts a mission to one of them, Father Colin Michener, to seek out the priest who translated the secret from Portuguese, and question him as to why he feels that the 'secret' has not truly been told, and the instructions of the Virgin not followed.Michener, loyal to his friend, carries out his mission, and obtains an answer from the old priest he seeks, along with the help of his former love, Katerina Lew, a journalist, whom enemies of the current Pope have bribed into spying on Michener to also learn the answer to what troubles Clement so much presently, and position themselves for power within the Vatican once Clement eventually passes on.Moving from Vatican City to Romania, Bosnia, and Germany. The answer to what is contained in the third secret, what the Virgin instructed the church to reveal, and what troubles Clement will all be revealed in the end, and will change the church, and the face of Christianity, forever.Rich in Vatican intrigue and ceremony, fast paced and engaging, Steve Berry's 'The Third Secret' is an enteraining read, and a good early offering from one of todays' best writers of thrillers."},{"Title":"THIRD SECRET: A Novel Of Suspense (H)","review":"To start off with.

In this case, Berry weaves a bits of history, politics, and suspense yarn into a rich tapestry. While the characters themselves are forgettable, the story is timely. It gives an amazing view into the world of religion and politics and how those two go hand in hand. Though this is fiction, it benefits from the death of Pope John Paul as a way to hook readers. Some have said this book would offend Christians, but I think Christians with a sense of understanding the difference between fiction and reality are smart enough to know this is fiction.

It starts just a bit slow, but has a satisfying build-up of suspense and twists so as to make it a reasonable page-turner for those who won't get too hung up on the undertone of criticism for the current Catholic church and its various doctrines. While there are some odd character choices and a bit of inconsitency about how urgent various things are and aren't along the way, I found myself entertained and turning pages and, after all, isn't that really the point of a mass market thriller?

As with this book by Steve Berry they are written as entertainment, they are novels and nothing within them should be taken too seriously. The books must be made plausible or the reader will just dismiss them as nonsense.The Third Secret has everything, travel in Europe, murder, deceit and hidden passion, it is entertaining and thought provoking, but still a work of fiction.

I have little problem with the celibacy issue and female priest issue that he also advocates, but even that does not allow this book to wrap up on a positive note.A great book with a cartoon ending, that ultimately means it is a not so great book.

The \\"protagonist\\" (use the term loosely)priest is charged by the elderly German Pope, whom he serves as private secretary, with investigating the mysterious \\"third secret\\" of Fatima that has remained under lock and key in the Vatican despite the promise of John XXIII and John Paul II to reveal this earth shaking secret from the Blessed Mother.Along the way, the priest gains and loses a Cardinal appointment due to the death of his boss, beds his ex-girlfriend, battles an Italian, conservative, and hence evil Cardinal with designs on the papacy and his cartoonish henchman priest, and finds out the third secret of Fatima which is nothing more than what \\"liberal\\" Catholics have been pressing for since Vatican II.I don't mind anti-Catholic or anti-anything novels as long as they are well written and somewhat plausible. \\"The Running Mate\\" by Joe Klein is an example of an anti-GOP novel that is funny, well written and basically skewers both sides of the political debate. \\"The Third Secret\\" is not very good, unfortunately, and if anyone else didn't guess at least part of the \\"Third Secret\\" by page 125, then they weren't reading very closely.Hopefully this author will write better books. I rather doubt it."},{"Title":"THIRD SECRET: A Novel Of Suspense (H)","review":"To preface: I am not religious and I am politically liberal. This book was terrible! The beginning was up to par with all the rest of the novels you can pick up at the grocery store, which warrants a couple of stars, but the ending was terrible! The third secret was just a bunch of the author's political views shoved into the mouth of the Virgin Mary. I was disappointed that I read three-quarters of a book's worth of build-up only to have such a ridiculous climax."},{"Title":"THIRD SECRET: A Novel Of Suspense (H)","review":"True the first 64 chapters are an interesting read but then you get to the end of Chapter 65 and finally read the Third Secret of Fatima you waited all these pages to see you want to toss this book in the trash! I finished it today and I couldnt help but think this author finished the entire book and then inserted a few paragraphs of very badly written political agenda items and attributed them to the Virgin Mary.

Or, who knew that Our Lady really looks with favor on homosexual acts? These are some of the loopy revelations disclosed in this tawdry excuse for a religious thriller.Apparently the silly season--as Fr. Richard John Neuhaus characterized that period following Vatican II which featured personages such as Matthew Fox, clown Masses, and balloon-festooned vestments--is yet with us. Despite the rout of the progressivist agenda with the pontificate of John Paul II and the election of Benedict XVI, some folks persist in acting as if the Catholic Church will any day now morph into a mirror image of liberal Episcopalianism.If that's your wet dream, this is the book for you. Others will find its earnest iconoclasm initially mildly amusing but oddly anachronistic and, in the end, stupefying."},{"Title":"THIRD SECRET: A Novel Of Suspense (H)","review":"I had looked forward to this book, as I enjoyed \\"The Romanov Prophecy\\" as a fun summer read. Unfortunately, Berry's allowed his religious and social views to turn his latest book into a screed. The hero's antagonist is a cardinal that believes in priestly celibacy and other traditional Catholic dogma, which makes him not merely wrong-headed but a scheming, blackmailing, cartoon villain who does everything but twirl his mustache as he ties the heroine to railroad tracks. The \\"secret\\" that Barry's concocted is intended to be \\"provocative\\" in the model of \\"The Da Vinci Code,\\" but instead the revelation manages to be both hilarious and (there's no other word for it) blasphemous at once. Save your time and your money."},{"Title":"THIRD SECRET: A Novel Of Suspense (H)","review":"Not bad writing, and the plot itself was interesting, however I find Mr. Berry has problems with his characterization. And a serious dislike for the Catholic Church, but that's not for this review.His female leads often start out strong, but then turn one-dimension and flat, contributing nothing to the story save another name. I noticed this in 'The Romanov Prophecy' as well, that his villains seem to be omnipotent. They know things just because and use that knowledge to VERY conveniently to foil whatever the hero is trying to accomplish.Specific to this story, Colin Michener seems more than a little nave and foolish, and I'm not sure how he managed to live, let alone uncover this Third Secret. As to the secret, itself, I found it unbelievable. Again, the suspense was good, but the secret? No."},{"Title":"THIRD SECRET: A Novel Of Suspense (H)","review":"The Third Secret is satisfying to those who like their learning served with a healthy helping of fast-paced fiction. Some of the characters are believable, especially in the early going, but the plodding jog to the climax forces them to act outside of their character to keep the plot moving. Futhermore, the \\"secret\\" revealed at the end is really nothing more than an author's wish-fulfillment that for all this time the Catholic Church has been screwing God's message up, and He finally got tired of it and sent Mary down to set things straight. Taken at face value, it amazing that storylines consisting of man helping God continually get published, when the skeptical rightly wonders: \\"Is God really this incompetent?\\" I am far from Catholic (Free Will Baptist, actually), so all the blather about Marian visitations served as midly amusing sidenotes, but there are those who would put stock into the whole archaic mess, and I would remind them that it's just a story. God needs no helping hand."},{"Title":"THIRD SECRET: A Novel Of Suspense (H)","review":"The Third Secret is another entry in the Vatican intrigue genre. It has the usual elements: Vatican conservatives the usual bad guys vs liberal Catholics the usual good guys. The \\"Third Secret\\" refers to secret revelations given to Marian visionaries at such places as Fatima and Medjugorge, the existence of which is historical fact. If there is any suspense in the novel, it is not with the plot which is remarkably predictable and derivative. The only thing that kept my interest was waiting to find out the actual content of the third secret(s), at least according to the novel's author. In the end, these proved to be rather predictable too, given the author's religious inclinations."},{"Title":"THIRD SECRET: A Novel Of Suspense (H)","review":"I found this book to be an enjoyable read. The plot moved fast enough to keep me reading and the characterization was good. For those of us who find the third secret of Fatima and the prophecies of St Malachy of interest, the author has done a lot of fascinating research into these areas, as well as meticulous research into Vatican protocol - all very enlightening.I would have given the book four stars if the final revelation of the 'third secret' had not been such an anti-climax. For a secret that purportedly caused popes to blanche in fear, I didn't find the fictional revelation in this book to be any more believable than the 'orthodox' version released recently in which it was claimed that the third secret involved the attempted assassination of the Pope. Personally, I would have made the third secret a much more devastating event - especially with the licence of fiction.But all that aside - and I suppose there are some people who would find the revelation depicted in the book to be shocking - I managed to finish the book in a couple of days and would recommend it as a good read."},{"Title":"THIRD SECRET: A Novel Of Suspense (H)","review":"The Third Secret was reviewed this spring in the Florida Times Union. I was intrigued and ordered the book to take on an international vacation. Once I began to read,I would rush back to the hotel each day to devour the pages.

The book's characters were deliciously revealed and the reader is transported to the sites involved. The ending is well thought out and forces the reader to imagine....."},{"Title":"THIRD SECRET: A Novel Of Suspense (H)","review":"I would give it zero stars if Amazon allowed, so in order to write this review I had to give it one, but that is pushing it. Don't waste your time money or brain cells on this one. Just another piece of poor FICTION that rides on the tails of DaVinci Code and Angels & Demons. Steve Berry can't write his way out of a paper bag. Steve the word is \\"anticlimactic\\" not \\"anticlimatic\\". Anticlimatic means you are against the weather! HA (pg 111)I think there is a template out there for bad fiction about the Vatican: add one evil cardinal, one priest who can't keep his vows, one beautiful woman writer, one Pope perceived as being weak, and a few good guys. Give them all impossible tasks, make them all weak, kill a few off in the end, break a few commandments, totally misinterpret scripture....and on and on.Let's get original folks and get off Dan Brown's coat tails, at least he made it interesting. Write something interesting and original for a change.It irks me to believe that some people will think this kind of stuff really goes on at the Vatican.Steve pick up a bible before you write the next one, or better yet stick to what you know.Sorry folks this is just more propaganda determined to make the Church look bad."},{"Title":"THIRD SECRET: A Novel Of Suspense (H)","review":"How many stories can intrigue in Catholic Church spawn?Berry tries to imitate Dan Brown (which is also, admittedly, his own basic style) but he really falls flat with this work.Stock characters: a moderate dying pope, a somewhat secret liberal investigating priest, a conservative Catholic powerful priest/villan who is willing to murder to achieve his aims.It all culminates in a real religious \\"truth\\" that shows that the powerful interests in the Church have really been working against the true will of God (in this case through various Marian appearances) for decades.Not to be a spoiler, but the ultimate \\"secret\\" wasn't all that exciting either. My own personal views are pretty much in line with Berry's so this is far from a political statement. It just wasn't that much from a thriller perspective.This one can be given a pass. The lackluster plot sinks this one."},{"Title":"THIRD SECRET: A Novel Of Suspense (H)","review":"This is the type of book that can kep you up all night reading it, because you just don't want to put it down! While the plot might be a bit preposterous, if you accept the premise that the author gives you, much enjoyment will follow. The book is just about non-stop action, with plot twists and turns on almost every page. There's the usual intrepid hero, and the \\"bad guys\\", but this time they are religious figures doing what they honestly feel is right for the Catholic Church. Ignore the strange \\"prophecies\\" when you read them, and just go along for the ride; it's awesome!"},{"Title":"THIRD SECRET: A Novel Of Suspense (H)","review":"If you are a self righteous Catholic you will probably hate this book and curse it as blasphemy. But, if you like entertaining thrillers, especially those based around parts of religion and even catholocism (as I do), then you will like this book. While this book is not as captivating as say, the Da Vinci Code, it is entertaining and worth a read."},{"Title":"THIRD SECRET: A Novel Of Suspense (H)","review":"Berry weaves an interesting tapestry of fact and fiction about the Roman Catholic Church. The characters are much more human, if a little more sparsely drawn, than those in the \\"Code,\\" and the intrigue is better than the great leaps of faith required by \\"Code.\\"Yet faith is what \\"Third Secret\\" is all about. Some of the sleights of hand, deceptions and plot twists are a bit murky, but the basic story hinges on a flawed priest (although it seems strange that he would claim to have gone twenty years without saying Mass) who, like almost every other featured character, has a troubled past and a struggle with faith.This was a generally linear, straightforward, fast-paced read, with a relatively simple narrative and a few useful sojourns around time and Europe. Berry does not bring out the local color much beyond the pageantry and cloaks of the Vatican and the papacy, but the trips to Rumania, Bosnia and Germany provide a diverse backdrop for plot developments.An early attempt to excommunicate a heretic priest is a bit of a sideshow, a distraction, but he provides a link back to our protagonist's past and, in the end, the heretic appears to be more correct than the conniving cardinal from Florence and his bi-sexual henchman also clothed in priest's garb. By the end of \\"Secret,\\" no priest will look the same to you again, at least not as some distant spiritual figure. At least the transgressions are a welcome relief from the pedophilia and child abuse cases capturing public attention today.The \\"secret\\" of \\"Secret\\" strikes at the very the foundations of the church. For me, the revelation is a wee bit too all-encompassing as a major critique of widely accepted church dogma, a bit too convenient and powerful. But that is what makes the secret worth hiding. In some respects, it would be nice to have a miraculous revelation both simplify and clarify some of the difficulties of keeping the faith."},{"Title":"THIRD SECRET: A Novel Of Suspense (H)","review":"While very little of the action is really in the 'Indiana Jones' realm, the story moves along well, and the level of research and understanding of the Vatican, Catholic rituals, etc was pretty amazing.

Like taking the bible verbatim. With the exception of the ten comandments when was anything said in the Bible or by Jesus as clear as a bell??????That is we, on the left think the Bible was divine inspiration not divine dictation. There is just no way the Mother of God would clearly say all the things the 3rd secret is suppose to reveal and so clearly in the syntax of the day now in the 21st century!!!!!It was an interesting point that the author had Clement be a pope of German birth and the book was probably started long before Benedict's election.

Compared to the Brown books its lowkey version of events makes it actually rather effective. Unfortunately it ends up making the same mistake as the Brown book, its villains turn out more worthy of sympathy than its heroes. In particular the Cardinal Alberto Valendrea, who Barry is determined to paint as such a scoundrel, won my admiration far more than the unhappy Colin Mitchner and his colorless girlfriend. Both the Father and the Cardinal are contesting over the content of the lost Third Secret of Fatima, which in this reviewer's opinion might as well have stayed lost.

First, let me say that if you are Catholic and are not inclined to be open-minded, you probably shouldn't read it, since you will probably be offended.However, if you are open to possibilities and different viewpoints, this book can't be beat for questioning the theological basis for traditional Catholic practices, such as celibacy for priests.The plot opens around the events that took place at Fatima, Portugal in the early 20th century. Three peasant girls were visited by the Virgin Mary and told three secrets, two of which were immediately made public, the third not revealed until 2000. It is this third secret which is the focus of the book, that is, the part of the secret which wasn't revealed by the Pope at in 2000.The main focus of the book is that there are only three people left alive who know the entire contents of the third secret, one of which has great ambitions of becoming Pope. The current Pope and an aging priest in Romania are the other two. The ambitious Cardinal is out to ensure that the rest of the secret isn't revealed.This is all I'll say, lest I ruin the book. I will say that it is at least the equal of DaVinci Code, if not better.

Telling a priest it's okay to sleep with a woman to whom he is not married2. Giving the thumbs up to same sex sexual relationtionships3. Approving of abortionNow, regardless of how you feel about these issues (and yes, I know it's fiction), it's still very, very, very poor form to put what is clearly anti-catholic (and what many would say is anti-Christian) doctrine/ideas in the mouth of Mary.Particularly ridiculous is the idea that Mary \\"chose\\" to have Jesus and so she clearly favors abortion.Aye carumba...Steve Berry should thank God that Christianity is different than many other world religions.

The characters in the book do not keep in character. Not many pious devout priests would just decide to fornicate and not feel any guilt,or overnight completely lose faith. Berry did a reasonably good job of researching the Marian apparitions, and Vatican terminology, but he knows absolutely nothing of Catholic theology.

Or so the public version goes. Steve Berry takes this basic premise and then builds a fictionalized account regarding the possibility that this \\"public version\\" may not be true. Along the way, he ends up giving the reader a crash course in papal intrigue and backroom maneuvering. Strongly recommend this book (besidesThe Rozabal LineandAngels & Demonsfor allThe Da Vinci Codelovers).

However, excluding that, this was a fun read. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"THIRD SECRET: A Novel Of Suspense (H)","review":"For pop lit, \\"The Third Secret\\" is a neat little page-burner. Steve Berry draws us into the palace intrigues of the Vatican, making the social climate of the Holy See positively medieval in its view. Father Colin Michener was an Irish orphan who was raised by Catholic parents in Atlanta. Through close association with German Jakob Volner who ascends to become Pope Clement XV, Michener finds himself as secretary to the Holy Father. Intrigue swirls as Thomas Kealy, a radical priest, who proclaims that priests should be able to marry and have children is put on trial by conservative Cardinal Valendrea. A former flame of Michener's, Katerina, shows up as a reporter and companion of Kealy's. Embers spark and the old attractions are eventually rekindled. Meanwhile, palace intrigue casts Valendrea as a ruthless politico who utilizes the services of Father Ambrosi to spy on all the conversation within the Vatican and use the information to blackmail cardinals. The plot builds as we learn that Pope Clement XV has become obsessed with the Fatima messages and learns that Valendrea when assistant to Paul VI absconded with part of the Third Secret. The chase is then on to uncover this missing knowledge. Other characters like Fatima translator Father Tibor who mans a lonely orphanage in Romania and Jasna who is receiving similar messages from the Virgin in Bosnia come into play. The priests at the top of the Catholic structure are largely cast as politicians whose faith in God is uncertain. This is balanced by Cardinal Ngovi of Kenya who appears to be on the side the good guys and with Michener's assistance brings the action to swift conclusion. The political questions that are raised that priests should be able to marry, homosexuality is not a sin, women should be priests and should also have a right to abortion are certainly valid conclusions. However, where the novel fails is that Berry who understands well the political questions fails to understand the spiritual ones, that a Love-dominated and love-saturated soul will come to their own conclusions regarding personal life issues. So the question of personal religious faith over dominant institutional church is left untouched. So while having little spiritual significance, the book succeeds as a page-turner. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"THIRD SECRET: A Novel Of Suspense (H)","review":"This novel, like the \\"Da Vinci Code\\", like the \\"Prophetess\\" gave me a chance to think, while enjoying a good story. After all, Christ spoke in parables.Religion is perhaps something you accept without thinking, or something you think about. This book is one that makes you think. It does not matter what your conclusions were, just that you have considered them, and made a decision.But, as to the book as a readable adventure....it begins a bit slowly, but draws you into the story. Take a Pope, in his waning days, and his secretary still young. Throw in some Vatican intrigue for the succession (yes, I do believe intrigue exists) and you have a good story in the hands of Berry. Is any of it real, I am not a scholar, so I do not know. What I do know is that it, in its own way made me think. I thank the author for that.People interest me, and I found them in this book. I was always interested and concerned about each of the characters....some I liked, some I did not, but I always hoped that they would be the best that they could be.The conclusion may have been a bit far-fetched, or was it.

Much like \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" the premise of this story shouldn't be taken seriously, but the conspiracy theory aspect is fun to pondr (if only for a second).The basic story revolves around Jakob Volkner (Pope Clement XV), a German priest in his late 70s who was elected as John Paul II's successor and his secretary Monsignor Colin Michener an Irish-born but American-reared priest whose vows of celibacy have been tested--and found wanting.Three years into his papacy, the thoughtful Clement has begun to quietly express skepticism about papal infallibility and the Church's restrictive dogma. Clement has also made repeated visits to the Riserva, a guarded sanctum within the Vatican archives, where sacred and historic documents are stored. Obsessed with the Fatima prophecies, he dispatches Michener to Romania to locate an elderly cleric (Father Tibor) who, in the 1950s, translated three cryptic prophecies, purportedly offered by the Virgin Mary in 1917 for Pope John XXIII. The Virgin Mary revealed herself to the three children in Fatima, Portugal, disclosing three secrets to the eldest, Lucia, who shared the first two secrets soon after their revelation but left the last to be disclosed upon her death. This third secret was released to Pope John XXIII in 1960 and made public by Pope John Paul II in 2000... or was it?Thats the question facing Michener in the wake of Clement's shocking death, as he pursues a twisted trail of clues, crimes, and religious forecasts from Rome to Bosnia to Germany, accompanied by his former lover, journalist Katerina Lew. But making any additional secrets known to the world will put Michener in confrontation with doctrinal reactionaries, led by the ambitious and traditionalist Cardinal Alberto Valendrea, the Vatican's Italian secretary of state, who's determined to follow Clement as pope, even if that requires inventing a few new sins and flouting a 900-year-old prediction of doom for the next pope.Its quite an work of coincidence, especially when read in light of Pope Benedict XVI's succession to the papacyespecially when it comes to the prophecies of Malachy. If you like conspiracy theories and can let your imagination go wild when it comes to religion (remember this is a work of fiction!) then this is a fun, fast paced, and highly enjoyable book to read."},{"Title":"THIRD SECRET: A Novel Of Suspense (H)","review":"This is a well written book that deals with the operation and politics of the Catholic Church, and specifically the Vatican."},{"Title":"THIRD SECRET: A Novel Of Suspense (H)","review":"Steve Berry combines fact and fiction in his Novels.I have enjoyed all of them, but wish he would leave the explicit sex out of them; I would like to share this quality of writing with some in their teens.Linda Muir"},{"Title":"THIRD SECRET: A Novel Of Suspense (H)","review":"Steve Berry has become one of my favourite authors.

What is the Third Secret of Fatima and why did it take the Church so long to release it? While this is a fiction novel it poses some very intriguing questions about religion, faith and what we are told to believe. Great book for conspiracy theorists, the curious and the faithful."},{"Title":"THIRD SECRET: A Novel Of Suspense (H)","review":"This author keeps suspense high. I was surprised that this edition didn't contain the author's notes available in the large print edition. His notes support thestory."},{"Title":"THIRD SECRET: A Novel Of Suspense (H)","review":"I felt this was a great novel for escape.. It took me to places far away, the excitement kept me going, the mystery kept me intrigued, and the knowledge that part of the story had some truths within it kept me from putting it down for very long until it was finished.Succinctly, I enjoyed this read tremendously and will be looking for other Berry books for entertainment.I think many people are jaded by the boob tube and can no longer use their imagination and the words of a writer to allow themselves to be caught up in a story without \\"visual\\" reproductions on a tv screen. They forget that the \\"visual\\" of the mind is more powerful and can be more entertaining because it is only limited by themselves, aided by the novelist.Thanks Mr Berry for a thoroughly entertaining read!!!!"},{"Title":"THIRD SECRET: A Novel Of Suspense (H)","review":"Overall I enjoyed this book until the end, as the \\"third secret\\" is pretty way out there. Generally though it's an entertaining thriller, and as a person who starts many books but finishes few, I was satisfied that I stuck this one out until the end. It did get frustrating as it drew on though, as the author got pretty distanced from the subject matter. Every priest in here was doing very un-priestly things. Even the dialog got more sarcastic towards the end, with lots of smart alec jabs tossed about. Do priests really talk that way? In any case I still enjoyed it and would read another book from this author."},{"Title":"THIRD SECRET: A Novel Of Suspense (H)","review":"Berry's third novel manifests the usual Berry characteristics. He has done extensive research on the inner workings of the Vatican and studied Fatima and related occurences of purported appearances by the Virgin Mary. Berry has said that he seeks to inform as well as entertain; this was certainly true of his two previous novels which reflected substantial research on Czarist and World War II Russia, and it is true here as well. Another Berry characteristic is that his lead characters almost invariable do actions which are so patently stupid that the reader wants to scream--but I guess that is how you get a plot. Like his previous novels, the story moves along at a good clip, although at 372 pages the novel struck me as a bit too long. Berry knows how to write good suspense and keep the reader engaged. Serious Catholic readers may not find the novel suitable, since Berry paints a view of the Vatican much akin to that portrayed in \\"Godfather III,\\" with abundant plots and counter-plots, and clearly makes clear his disagreement with a number of key and currently controversial elements of Vatican policy. Interesting topics handled well and with much skill."},{"Title":"THIRD SECRET: A Novel Of Suspense (H)","review":"This book deals with the ever fascinating subject of prophesies, the vatican church, and corrupt officials. The book does not have a good grip on the suspense it tries to create, but actually aggravates the reader, and frustrates him. The plot is different from the usual 'Da Vinci Code' type books, but it could have been handled much more efficiently. In all, this book is good for reading, but is definitely not a keeper."},{"Title":"THIRD SECRET: A Novel Of Suspense (H)","review":"The Third Secret follows the typical suspense/thriller model. It is adequately interesting to keep one reading. The early pages filled with interesting bits of information about the Vatican's history. However, (And I won't give away the secret) at about page 350, the book takes a dive. Steve Berry apparently thinks that no one will object when he shoves in his personal views on divisive church issues. But whether you agree with him or not, the revelation is completely unwarranted. I suppose Berry was trying to set his religious thriller in the same vein as Dan Brown's \\"heretical\\" books. In the end the book devolves into a treastise of Berry's personal views, presented in a way that debate is impossible. That added to the absolutely deplorable behavior by the story's protagonists (which Berry makes no attempt to challenge) makes this book a disappointing read at best."},{"Title":"THIRD SECRET: A Novel Of Suspense (H)","review":"As a Catholic I guess I could be offended by the \\"third secret\\",however I chose to believe that most of the church standings on most issues are man made, not God inspired. I remember as child waiting anxiously for the revelation of the \\"third secret\\", when it was announced by John Paul 11 I was disappointed, I expected more........and that is how the story goes.I have read all 3 of Steve Berry's books and this is by far his best. But before you get all bent out of shape this, this is just a story, a work of fiction. I really enjoyed it and lovers of historical fiction will too."},{"Title":"THIRD SECRET: A Novel Of Suspense (H)","review":"Selecting this book was a mistake in the sense that I thought it was a Catholic novel. I had recently read Michael O'Brien's most excellent \\"Father Elijah\\" and was eager for another faithful and exciting novel.I got a pretty good sense of where Berry was heading with this about a third of the way through, but was open to the possibility that he might be masking what would eventually finish as a novel true to Church teaching. Not the case. The purported secret message from Mary in this story was not only naive and inconsistent with biblical and Church teaching, it was insulting to one's intelligence and ability immediately see the ridiculousness of such a supposed message. You might as well have expected the reading audience to believe that Mary's message was that she \\"was a Yankees or Dodgers fan.\\" Come on!*SPOILER*That God's message through Mary would, among other things (such as approve of homosexuality, endorse female priests, condone priestly celibacy) supposedly use her assent to give birth to Jesus by the power of the Holy Spirit as a means to assert that a decision to have abortion is along the same plane is beyond what any rational, free-thinking person could believe, regardless of their faith. It is just not a logical jump that can be made without invalidating logic. Mary was never faced with deciding to terminate the human life within her. Her decision was upstream of that - whether or not to be with child.The writing itself was adequate - I'm not going to slam Berry's writing abilities just because I think his message is another form of a wolf in sheep's clothing. It was fine (not great, not poor) and he did a reasonable job of building suspense.Avoid this book. There is an abundance of other suspense novels available and this book can only serve to further assault Church teaching and deceive a few unsuspecting, undereducated Catholics."},{"Title":"THIRD SECRET: A Novel Of Suspense (H)","review":"Each to his own taste, but I wish I'd read some of the negative reviews here before I wasted time and money on this book. The only \\"secret\\" revealed in this book is the author's personal, overt political pro abortion and gay marriage agenda. Seriously, if you are a Christian, do yourself a favor and just skip this ridiculous attempt to make fun of your Christian beliefs."},{"Title":"THIRD SECRET: A Novel Of Suspense (H)","review":"\\"The Third Secret\\" is yet another story spawned from the mythical intrigue of the Vatican labrynith. The Catholic Church and the Vatican, always so open, yet so closed, have always been a hotbed for these stories. Thrown in the elements of peasant children receiving a divine message, and you've got a sure-to-sell story.First, I haven't read the \\"Da Vinci Code,\\" so I can't compare this book to that. But I have read \\"Angels and Demons,\\" and must say Berry's writing style seems as bit as competent, but less \\"flashy\\" than Dan Brown's.A Catholic priest, who has been less than faithful in his vows, and is a close confidant of a German pope, is involved in a continental chase for clues related to missing parts of the Third Secret of Fatima. In the backdrop is a tribune involving an openly wayward priest and soon a new papal election.The story develops well enough, but falters once the \\"true secret\\" is revealed. Interesting how the third message is perfectly tied for the controversies of the early 21st century, and not the time of pre-World War One, where these issues were scarely mentioned.I don't know where Berry's religious beliefs lie, so I wouldn't call the book an assault upon the Church. At least he did have the tact to not directly implicate John Paul II in anything.This hasn't turned me off to Berry, indeed, I'm reading \\"The Templar Legacy\\" now, but I'm not a believer yet."},{"Title":"THIRD SECRET: A Novel Of Suspense (H)","review":"As a Dan Brown fan who had read all of Dan Brown's books, I was desperate to find another author who wrote in the same style and on the same type of topics. I was not disappointed by Steve Berry.This book grabbed my attention very quickly and I finished it in just under a week because I could not put it down. The characters were developed well and very easy to understand. The subject matter, Marian visions and the future of the Catholic church, were also very well described, even for someone who knows nothing about Catholicism or Marian visions.The plot follows a representative from the Vatican as he searches for answers to the mystery surrounding the final of 3 secrets revealed to a young girl in Portugal years before. This leads to upheaval in the bishop's life and in the Holy See. A wonderfully taut thriller considering the subject matter. This could have been very dull, but Berry has written a titillating thriller.All in all, this was by far one of my favorite reads. EXCELLENT! I will be buying and reading all of Steve Berry's books."},{"Title":"THIRD SECRET: A Novel Of Suspense (H)","review":"Well crafted, but disappointing in the banal \\"third\\" secret. The author should have contributed to the reader's aspirations by creating a meaningful uplifting message."},{"Title":"THIRD SECRET: A Novel Of Suspense (H)","review":"The Third Secret is one of three books by Steve Berry that I own, but it's the only one I've read ... and could possibly be the last. I tried to get into this book four different times but could never get past the first 75 pages. The best part of reading this book was that it served the same purpose as taking a sleeping pill. Each time I picked up it allowed me to fall asleep within ten minutes. A better name for The Third Secret would have been Ambien ... The Book. Virtually nothing happened in the limited time I read the book,the plot moved at a snail's pace and the characters did not hold my interest. The old saying about books defintely applies as an argument for not reading The Secret Secret, i.e., so many books, so little time. Do yourself a big favor and avoid any temptation you might have to read this book. It ultimately will serve as a waste of your valuable time, not to mention a waste of your money. The only reason stopping me from giving this book a 1-star rating is my guilt in not spending more time to give The Third Secret a chance to improve. However, for me, the secret about this book was already out of the bag, so to speak. That is, that after 75 pages it was no secret that The Third Secret was a real snoozer."},{"Title":"THIRD SECRET: A Novel Of Suspense (H)","review":"Of all of the Steve Berry novels, this one happens to be the slowest one he's written. It's also, in my opinion, the worst book he's written.While Berry is always detail orientated, here he just gets bogged down in details. Further, he never really seems to get to the point. The \\"climax\\" of the book is really more of a stifled yawn.I have a firm policy about reading a book all the way through... however this time, I almost didn't make it. Too few details, too many threats, too many political \\"intrigues\\" without the excitement to back them up & not enough of Berry's famous nail biting, adventure with death right on the hero & heroines tale.Avoid this one... it's just not that good."},{"Title":"THIRD SECRET: A Novel Of Suspense (H)","review":"This is the second Steve Berry novel I have read, and this was certainly better than the Amber Room. The plot is intriguing and the story held my interest through the end of the novel.The downside to this novel is that the Third Secret isn't all that shocking, and for the second straight novel, there's a five letter word to describe the personality of the lead female character. Is Berry a misogynist or was he going through a divorce while drafting these novels?Also, the antagonists are almost cartoonish. How or why did these individuals become priests in the first place?"},{"Title":"THIRD SECRET: A Novel Of Suspense (H)","review":"Ok. Just where do I start?It seems that the way to sell books these days is to stir enough controversy and hope that the publicity sells it. It used to be political conspiracy theories, these days you take a swipe at major religions of the world.The above is what stopping me from giving anything higher then a 3/5. I admit I enjoyed the cat & mouse game, though not as thrilling as the first time you read the Da Vinci Code. Of the three Mr Berry's books I read, this one I managed to stop the urge to read the last few chapters to find out what the ho-ha is all about.The 'conspiracy' topic seemed rather dated, not too ground breaking (I'm not telling here just in case you do want to get it yourself).In any case, if you need something to buy at the airport bookshop, and need to hold and read something, well... it's ok. You might however finish reading it after you arrived at your hotel."},{"Title":"THIRD SECRET: A Novel Of Suspense (H)","review":"Steve Berry sure knows how to keep you interested ... and thinking! Short chapters, vived characterizations, tightly coiled plot. I couldn't put it down. While some Catholics might take offense at the unfavorable light shed on the denizens of the Vatican, I found my own faith reaffirmed: the Good News remains healthy and life-giving even when human society would distort it."},{"Title":"THIRD SECRET: A Novel Of Suspense (H)","review":"I truly enjoyed a good portion of this book. I read it quickly because I couldn't wait to find out what the Third Secret was. But, I was so disappointed. The secret revealed by the Virgin turns out to be liberal, politically-correct nonsense. I could barely finish the book."},{"Title":"THIRD SECRET: A Novel Of Suspense (H)","review":"I have to say I was sorely disappointed in what Steve Berry finally came up with as the remaining Third Secret of Fatima and the 10th Secret of Medgejgorje.(** Beware plot spoiler coming...if you don't want to know...STOP READING NOW ***!!!.)Sounds to me like he must be friends with Dan Brown. Do they both have some kind of feminist agenda? Or was he looking for something to cause some controversy? I don't know. All I can say is that I was really looking forward to how the book was going to end. Then, when I finally got to the chapter where both secrets were revealed...after reading that, I just shut the book and didn't even bother to finish it. How disappointing. He had to have been able to come up with something better than that weak, lame secret. After reading part of the book, I was interested to the point that I told myself I would go out and buy the rest of his books to read them too. Not anymore. Ugh. The downhill slide I guess started when he had the Virgin Mary telling the Pope he would have to kill himself. I know it's only a book...but come on. It really bothers me when an author has heavenly beings saying things that they (the author) want said. Same goes for why I don't like the Joshua books. Girzone's too sick to be a priest...but he can travel the world selling his books. Doe's anyone else think that's a bit strange? Get real Steve!!! You had a book that could have people on the end of their seat...and you blew it...totally blew it. Very disappointing!!!"},{"Title":"THIRD SECRET: A Novel Of Suspense (H)","review":"I have never been so disappointed with a book.

How tiresome that plotline is!! But the unforgivable sin is the third secret. It is just plain stupid. Any one who knows anything about Catholicism will just laugh off the third secret. It is just wishful thinking by people who want their Catholicism in the cafeteria style. I stopped reading it after that."},{"Title":"THIRD SECRET: A Novel Of Suspense (H)","review":"It is sad that the author undermines what could be a legitimate plot and wastes no time to subdue it by pushing his personal anti- Catholic, pro-abortion agenda, in the most offensive of terms."},{"Title":"THIRD SECRET: A Novel Of Suspense (H)","review":"This book targets some very political issues right at the heart of the Catholic church and then (here's the unbelievable part) one of the Cardinals engages one of the priests to kill other priests to maintain the status quo and ultimately become pope. I'm not Catholic but I just don't think the premise of the book or the actions of the characters were believable."},{"Title":"THIRD SECRET: A Novel Of Suspense (H)","review":"This could have been a good story but it lost all credibility with me by Mr. Berry's admitted 'taking liberties' with the Virgin's third secret. 'Taking liberties' is an understatement. It's more like blasphemy. His rendition of the third secret supposedly spoken by the Virgin was way out of line. And also by Clement XV - the pope in this story - taking his own life after the Virgin told him to do so. The characters might have started out to be credible but they fell off the radar as well. Why would a priest who knew about a certain character murdering another priest tell that person, the murderer, that if he told on his accomplice who happened to be the next in line to be pope - after much manipulation of course - that this murderer is free to go upon confessing his part in the murder? And who was he to even make such a decision? The lady friend journalist was also wishy washy with all her smart-ass rebukes to the same guy who kept threatening to kill her too. In an effort to try to make her into a capable person who knows what she wants in life, she came across as workable as play dough and about as smart. Apparently Mr. Berry is a reluctant Catholic who has a lot of built-up resentment for the Church concerning celibacy to women priests to abortions to homosexuality. It becomes glaringly obvious that he uses his own opinions as being the message from the Virgin which he really has no business doing, even in fiction."},{"Title":"THIRD SECRET: A Novel Of Suspense (H)","review":"This is a very two-thousand-naughts-ish thriller about the inner world of the Vatican. A German pope, the successor to John Paul II, is driven to suicide amid a crisis of doctrinal politics and revelations of divine will, both exacerbated as far back as the pontificate of Paul VI; his own successor -- Peter the Roman, no less! -- ascends through machination and guile, but cannot hold on to the apostolic see for more than a few days; what the heavens above really want is revealed at the end, with no surprise, as extreme liberality the Church has never accepted.As a light but picturesque inner view of the workings of the Vatican, it seems to be as good as anything else. If the author has changed things for his own purposes, he at least admits it in an appendix.As a statement of theology, it is of course exasperating to those that take their catechism too seriously. But what else is new.As a thriller... well, you can decide for yourself. It held my attention; I give it a pass.Dan Brown? Well... yes, for all the superficial similarities in setup and heterodoxy; and no. For the very two things I like about it particularly.First, its staying power. Four years after I first read it, here I am thinking about it and in fact reviewing it. Unlike that stuff by the other guy.And second. Is the heterodoxy a strange and poignantly meaningful allegory?Berry's characterizations at first seem ridiculously out of whack.His German Clement XV, JPII's immediate successor (though you have to puzzle it out, it's nowhere stated quite directly), surely cannot be the real-life Benedict XVI. Ratzinger the supposed pit-bull of the Holy Office as a meek soul shattered by a revelation of tolerant divine will? No, I can't buy it. Benedict's core of humanism, utter rationalism, and slight tendencies to liberalism only came out to the world at large after the book was written. Clement must surely be someone else.His Paul VI is a strong ruler, the last strong monarchic pope, an infallible arch-conservative, doctrinally. This cannot be: Montini was a man of tortured self-doubt, hesitating and keeping silent more often than not; his revision of the mass is the drawing-rod for all the traditionalists cannot accept; his encyclical on human life and birth control may be conservative, but was emphasized at the time as NOT infallible dogma. In truth, Berry's Paul VI resembles nothing more than Pius XII.His John Paul II is not what you imagine as an ultra-liberal Catholic's image of Karol Wojtyla. We do not see the ecstatically primitive, rigid, dour conservative slowly, steadily and deliberately if incompletely derailing over the course of a quarter-century the theology of liberation and the humanistic impulse of Vatican II. Instead, there is a cautious man modernizing the church and letting slip its internal forces of reaction, but doing nothing to keep them in check. Paul VI, in real life.And who succeeded Paul VI in real life? The one pope Berry doesn't mention. Albino Luciani, John Paul the First, the smile of God, the thirty-three days -- and the sudden death. Humility and charity, with radical wording and a liberal promise scarcely imaginable in our age of triumphant, spiteful, self-proud reaction. The hints of the same message Berry presumes to ascribe to Above.If Berry's Clement is Luciani extended, then Berry's Peter the Roman IS John Paul II -- his reign inverted in the alternate universe. A man who brought the church to ruin from its inner rot and by refusing to acknowledge the true light of Godly love? Melodramatically put, but Wojtyla ignored paedophilia, utter financial corruption, and a multitude of other things too, though the abuse came back to haunt. If the Catholic Church under attack today teeters in its own rot, it is because Mary did not respond to JPII's ecstatic prayer -- at least not in a way designed to shield embarrassment.Read the book, and you'll see why I bring up Mary all of a sudden.No, I'm not saying the above is without a doubt what Berry really intended.But I remember the Smile in August/September 1978. And when I do, the \\"Third Secret\\" reads to me as an allegory of what might have been, and as the alternate universe of the world we have misplaced.Heresy and wishful thinking or not."},{"Title":"THIRD SECRET: A Novel Of Suspense (H)","review":"I loved this book!!!!!

I liked it so much that I bought all the novels by him that I could lay my hands on (from my favorite local used books store). It is action packed and well researched. I admit that the conclusion of the book seems a bit far fetched. His depiction of the Vatican's intrigues do not seem very far from the truth though (except perhaps for the murder parts). It is the kind of novel that I find perfect to relax at the end of the day or on vacation."},{"Title":"THIRD SECRET: A Novel Of Suspense (H)","review":"I've never read a Steve Berry novel before. I knew of him, as one of the people who got published following the success of Dan Brown (tried Angels & Demons, didn't care for it) so I had avoided him, but this book of Berry's came into my possession for free. When I get a book for free I tend to read it, at least until I get bored. While the plot here was of little interest to me, Berry's writing style keeps things moving quickly enough that I didn't get bored before the pages had all run past me.So in this installment we have Father Colin Michener. Colin's an American who has been attached to a particular German priest, as an assistant, since the German was a bishop. Now he's the Pope, and Colin's the papal secretary. The pope is struggling with a variety of issues, mostly involving sightings of the Virgin Mary, both current and in the past. Colin, of course, doesn't know what's happening, and since everything's told from his point of view, the story has some artificial suspense added to it.There are, of course, various \\"dark forces\\" trying to control the church for their own ends. These include an Italian cardinal who thinks he should be the next pope, and is willing to blackmail and bully his way there if need be, and his assistant, who has even darker methods for achieving results. An old girlfriend of Colin's (what sort of novel about the Catholic Church would this be, unless one of the priests breaks the vow of celibacy?) is a journalist who wanders through the plot, acting as a sidekick for Colin as he investigates the sightings of the Virgin Mary and tries to figure out why they're occurring.When you finally get to the point where the Third Secret is revealed to you, it's a bit of a letdown. It's nothing surprising, just about what you'd expect in a book like this from a (presumably) lapsed Catholic. For those who aren't Catholic (like me) or who are still devout, the denouement will be rather disappointing and a bit overmuch, to boot. The way the novel was constructed, there were many characters who knew what was going on before you did, and the author keeping you in the dark was merely to keep you interested.Not a bad book, but not the best either."},{"Title":"THIRD SECRET: A Novel Of Suspense (H)","review":"The premise of the book intrigued me. In 2000, the third secret of Fatima is finally revealed to the world after decades of suppression by the Catholic Church. But \\"The Third Secret\\" suggests that not all was revealed. Indeed, there is more to be discovered. So I read the book with great anticipation.Author Steve Berry does a credible job reconstructing the events of Fatima and the real locations and figures of historical note. The storyline moved well with the requisite heroes and villains strewn about. My only disappointment was in the final revelation of the \`complete' secret. I was waiting for the big explosive bang but didn't get it. Others may have been more thrilled with the ending than I was.

I will absolutely read this author again, and enjoyed the characters, especially the naughty ones!"},{"Title":"THIRD SECRET: A Novel Of Suspense (H)","review":"Steve Berry's \\"The Third Secret\\" is a blending together of religious fact with fiction to create a creditable thriller based upon doctrines set forth by the Vatican.An appariton of the Virgin Mary observed by 3 peasant children in 1917 Fatima, Portugal and the disclosures made by her form the crux of the plot of the novel. The Virgin purportedly revealed 3 secrets, two of which were revealed by one of the children named Lucia. The third secret, however remained concealed within the walls of the Vatican only observed by papal eyes until its revelation in the year 2000.Father Colin Michener, papal secretary to present pope Clement XV has served the former Cardinal of Cologne faithfully for years. They forged a father son relationship and Michener was concerned by the popes behavior. Pope Clement had been spending an inordinate amount of time in the Riserva, a Vatican library whose contents were reserved for papal use only. Clement was a progressive pope altering rather than sticking to the old doctrines of the Vatican.Vatican Secretary of State Italian Cardinal Valendrea was at odds with Pope Clement. Having narrowly lost the papacy in the last conclave, Valendrea with lofty aspirations to become pope, favored a return to the princples of the past. Valendrea was a corrupt man using eavesdropping devices he had installed in the Vatican to keep members of the college of cardinals in line.Pope Clement became aware that the third secret of Fatima stored in the Reserva seemed incomplete. He recruited Father Michener to discover the missing segment of the secret by travelling to Romania to speak with a Father Tibor, the original translator of the account of the peasant girl Lucia.Berry leads us on a trail of adventure and intrigue as on one hand the true meaning of the secret is trying to be revealed. At the same time forces lead by the conservative Cardinal Valendrea are attempting to suppress its contents. The plot is at times uneven but the religious history, when woven into the story is fascinating."},{"Title":"THIRD SECRET: A Novel Of Suspense (H)","review":"Steve Berry is known for his historic-based fiction thrillers, and The Third Secret follows his usual formula. While definitely entertaining, the plot defies belief.Father Colin Michener is the papal secretary for Pope Clement XV. Clement is obsessed with the visitations of the Virgin Mary at La Salette, Lourdes, Fatima and Medjugorje. He is especially intent on discovering the third secret of Fatima. Clement sends Michener to Romania and Bosnia in his efforts to uncover the truth. But there is another powerful member of the Vatican Curia who has knowledge of the third secret. He is so fearful of it coming to light that he has resorted to wiretapping, blackmail and even murder.Berry weaves this tale around Roman Catholic history. In addition to the visitations, he also uses the predictions of St. Malachy of the 16th Century, Irish birthing centers in the 20th Century, and the procedures for papal succession. While the historic aspects were interesting, the plot was a stretch. Without giving away the plot, Fatima's third secret (as revealed in this book) is just totally unbelievable and would change almost all the core beliefs of the Roman Church. Most of the characters are also a bit over the top. Michener, an ordained priest and lawyer, is way too gullible. His former girlfriend, Katerina Lew, is totally self-centered and not very likable. Cardinal Alberto Valendrea is too Machiavellian, and his assistant, Paolo Ambrosi acts more like a Nazi SS officer than a priest.While The Third Secret was a fast-paced thriller that kept my interest, it is not of the same caliber as other books of this genre including The DaVinci Code."},{"Title":"THIRD SECRET: A Novel Of Suspense (H)","review":"Even with the stereotypes (good pope - bad secretary of state; good conflicted priest - evil murderous unconflicted priest, etc), this isn't so bad if you like the genre of lost secrets (or in some books, lost manuscripts) found, eternal battle of good and evil, etc. I thought the author's handling of why Lucia didn't contradict the published secret very well done. There were some historical inaccuracies, but who cares. This is just a good summer mystery and held together enough for me to read it straight through in an afternoon."},{"Title":"THIRD SECRET: A Novel Of Suspense (H)","review":"[Warning: SPOILERS ahead] This is a good read. It moves along at a fast pace, it deals with a real-life mystery (because the prophecy, when revealed in 2000, really didn't seem inflammatory enough to justify being kept secret for so long), and the wealth of detail about Vatican politics and procedures - however much of it may be accurate - is fascinating. I'd recommend it to anyone who wants mystery and excitement, in a book that's hard to put down, with some history lessons and thought-provoking controversy thrown in.But there are a couple of irritants.First, the writing style. Why does so much of the novel have to be written in the pluperfect tense? We are constantly reading \`he'd done this' or \`she'd said that', and the effect is that most of the book seems to be a series of recollections. A few flashbacks are fine, but this is overdone. And breaking up the narrative so that we switch back and forward between characters, each time leaving one at a cliffhanger moment, is a standard technique, but again, it becomes tiresome when it is done so repetitively. You feel like you're watching a TV show that has too many commercial breaks.Second, the endorsement of abortion in Mary's messages is done in a heavy-handed way that makes you wonder if it was a last minute addition. \`Hey, I've got away with having the Mother of God endorse priestly marriage, female priests, and homosexuality (though I think Berry is a bit ambivalent about that one - see below), maybe I can throw abortion in as well'. The desirability of priests being free to marry was well set up in the plot, but abortion just comes out of left field at the last minute. Unless the descriptions of the Irish birthing centres and Michener's own adopted childhood are meant to have prepared the way - but this necessarily require Michener to conclude that his own life would have been better if he had never had the chance to live it, which would seem to involve a degree of muddle-headedness that even he never quite descends to.Nor is the justification given for the approval of abortion at all convincing. I'm saying nothing about whether abortion should be acceptable to Christians or not, only that the way Berry chooses to have Mary justify it is ridiculous. If the Mother of God were to announce that abortion were permissible, it is very hard to imagine that she would do so by saying \`know that your body is yours', since this is directly contrary to a rather important Christian doctrine that your body is, in fact, not yours to do with as you wish at all: \\"Do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit, who is in you, whom you have received from God? You are not your own; you were bought at a price. Therefore honor God with your body.\\" (1 Cor 7:2). There may well be respectable arguments for abortion that could be used within a Christian context, but it's hard to see how \`your body is your own' could be one of them.And for Mary to be made to say that \`I freely chose to be the mother of God' is somewhat ludicrous. Is this meant to mean that Mary could have chosen, after the angel had visited her and informed her that she was to be the mother of God, and the Holy Spirit had come upon her and made her pregnant, to have had an abortion, and that God wouldn't have been even a little bit annoyed with her at that point?Then there's homosexuality. The only obviously homosexual character in the novel is the evil Ambrosi, whose homosexuality seems to serve no purpose in the plot except to enable Katerina to get in a crude jibe (\`I piss sitting down, so I doubt I'm your type'). And while Mary enthusiastically embraces abortion, she is much more guarded when it comes to this topic: \`why persecute the man or woman who loves differently from others'. Saying that homosexual people should not be \`persecuted' is not much at all; it falls a long way short of saying that homosexuality is not wrong. If God really wanted to tell the Roman Catholic church that homosexuality was not a sin, rather than merely that sinners should not be tormented, he'd probably use less ambiguous language. So I was left wondering what message Berry really wanted to give about homosexuality.Ultimately, while I enjoyed the book (apart from the standard of the writing), the ending was always going to be a letdown. Four hundred pages of build-up of conspiracy theory, over protection of a secret preserved at the cost of lives over decades, demands an awful lot, and - just as with Dan Brown's Da Vinci Code or Umberto Eco's Foucault's Pendulum - there's a risk that the secret, when finally revealed, won't live up to the promise. But the journey to get there is quite a lot of fun."},{"Title":"THIRD SECRET: A Novel Of Suspense (H)","review":"The characters in Berry's novel seem to be computer generated, as does the story itself. Once again, the evil Catholic Church has hidden the \\"truth\\" from a blind & stupid laity, who must be recued by the liberal elite. Those priests, bishops & nuns who have failed to live up to their vows due to their exclusive knowledge of what \\"Truth\\" is, i.e. \\"situational\\".Berry quotes extensively from scripture in this piece of work. He even quotes a scripture that makes his whole story just plain silly. \\"What you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven & what you bind on earth, will be bound in heaven.\\" Guess he overlooked that one because, after all, most of us loyal to the Church, are too dumb & blind to \\"catch it\\". I'm an old woman now, so I'll just stick to my ongoing conversations with Jesus through the Eucharist, the rosary, & just plain \\"listening\\".

The first two thirds of the book was written well. The book bviously puts the Catholic church in a very bad light. The mysterious untold portion of the third secret (which is what keeps you reading the book) was so bizaar and completely rediculous that it blew away any semblance of believability that the reader may have had up to that point. What a severe let down. Fiction of this type has to retain some trace of believablity even to the end. I can not recommend this book."},{"Title":"THIRD SECRET: A Novel Of Suspense (H)","review":"A colleage recently recommended this book to me when we were on a business trip together. While traveling, she and I (both Catholics) discussed how change in the Church happens from within. Someday, we hope to see a Pope from Africa or South America who reflects the changing face of the Faithful. Someday, we wonder if women will be able to have a stronger role in the Church. It was during this discussion that my colleague mentioned THE THIRD SECRET and said that it focused on an African Pope. She also mentioned that the book was wholly irreverent, but that she enjoyed it. I had enjoyed The Da Vinci Code and Angels & Demons, so I thought this might be worth a spin, too.I stayed up until 1 a.m. last night to finish THE THIRD SECRET. It was a good yarn up until Chapter 65, which -- as noted in other reviews -- the big whopper of a secret was revealed. Perhaps someday (likely not in our lifetimes) women will be allowed to celebrate Mass, or the celibacy vow might be overturned. Despite secular pressures I doubt we will ever see the Church wholeheartedly embrace same-sex marriage and abortion. I mean, come on, this IS the Catholic Church we're talking about here. And to have Mary, the Mother of God, say this stuff? Steve, buddy, that's waaaaaay over the top. It would have been much more plausible to stick with the plot thread of priests debating and doubting their vow to the Holy Order. Having that stuff come out of Mary's mouth is just too crazy for even this \\"liberal, progressive\\" Catholic.2 stars: One for Chapters 1-64, and another because I stayed up half the night to finish the book."},{"Title":"THIRD SECRET: A Novel Of Suspense (H)","review":"This book is contrived, poorly written, and far-fetched.

It turns out that the 'revelations' are based on God's dissatisfaction with Church doctrine in areas that liberals are always whiny about.**Spoiler below**So the repeated appearances of the Virgin Mary were due to her anger that the Church opposed homosexual marriage, abortion, female priests, and allowing priests to marry and have families.

At first it's just the bad writing and the stock cardboard characters. If you're looking for psychological nuance or complexity, don't open this book. Thank God the author spared us the love scenes! But by the time the secrets are revealed, the book has descended into a comic awfulness reserved for only the greatest bad books. I was writhing and groaning on my couch. If your book club is used to reading good books, have them read this one sometime, and then sit around like the guys in Mystery Science Theater and have a great time poking fun at it. But hey, it was a best seller! Says a lot about us doesn't it?!"},{"Title":"THIRD SECRET: A Novel Of Suspense (H)","review":"The book starts out pretty good. The idea of political wrangling in the Vatican is kind of interesting, whether or not it actually works that way in real life. And the idea of there being a missing piece to the Third Secret of Fatima makes for an interesting plot device. However, in the end that's all it is.The Secret, when finally revealed, didn't seem to warrant all the troubles that it supposedly caused. I was left wondering... if that's the big Secret, why bother trying to hide it? It would be much easier to just reveal it and renounce it as a fraud. Afterall, only devout Catholics believe in Marian apparitions to begin with, and wouldn't such people be quick to accept the Church's judgement if they said it wasn't genuine? Therefore, the whole premise of the plot was sort of spoiled for me. For this, I take off one star.To make matters worse, the book describes a whole series of unbelievable (or at least highly unlikely) events. Also, characters in the book (including the hero) do things that seem very out of character. The overall effect is that it becomes very difficult to suspend one's disbelief. So, I have to take off another star.I still found the book interesting. However, I think it could have been better."},{"Title":"THIRD SECRET: A Novel Of Suspense (H)","review":"I think Steve Berry is a great writer. His plots are always intriguing and force you to keep reading. The plot of The Third Secret was propelled by the reader's urge to learn the suppressed secret of Fatima.

Some of the themes and characters are similiar -- such as the history and bureaucracy of the Catholic Church, as well as, the camerlengo, cardinals, and the Pope. But unlike the Brown books -- there is no use of symbology and clues here leading the reader from place to place. Rather it's more of a novel about tortured souls and broken hearts making some tough choices related to thier vows and responsibilties as they deal with this \\"third secret\\" from the Virgin Mary. Personally, as a Catholic, I found the Virgin's revelations at the end of the novel, unrealistic. But overall the book was still a page turner."},{"Title":"THIRD SECRET: A Novel Of Suspense (H)","review":"The author brings the the characters into focus and makes us care about them, or detest them.

Read it."},{"Title":"THIRD SECRET: A Novel Of Suspense (H)","review":"Steve Berry's third book reflects an author more comfortable in telling a story. This increasingly popular novelist has developed a narrative style that allows the reader to ponder the material, yet experience recreational pleasure as well.In the prologue, a child named Lucia has just experienced her third now-famous vision of the Virgin Mary at Fatima.In response to questions from bystanders, Lucia explains, \\"It's a secret and the Lady told us not to tell.\\" And it is that very secret, as well as the part of the secret the church does not reveal, that will keep a reader awake into the wee hours, turning the pages with expectation.All the characters in this book are more interesting and more rounded, especially the women. Even the sinister candidate for pope, Valendrea, comes around to grace, although it is a minimal sort of grace. Two central characters who have a past together, Colin Michener and Katerina Lew, undertake a journey that is not only physical but also spiritual. In the final pages, the narrator slips into Colin's voice. \\"He knew,\\" goes the passage, \\"that of the thousands gathered around him, only he and Katerina truly understood. God was alive. He was there. Listening.\\"The Third Secret entangles interesting characters in a web of deceit and a journey towards truth. That it may offend some because of the plot resolution comes as no surprise. But history supports bloodshed and strife not only in the Catholic faith, but in denominations that comprise every other major religion. History also supports a record of the subordination of women. Each major religion's dependence on women as childbearers, propagators of the future faithful, is well-documented. The novel also explores peripheral issues such as a person of color becoming pope.What is also inspiring to me as a reader with diverse interests and a curious rather than myopic intellect, involves the fact that only in a free country could a book like this be written. In a country where freedom of thought and expression is not allowed, such a book might be banned because those with power might place their own ideologies above those of the populace. That we have freedom of expression regarding religion is, in my opinion, one of the most important freedoms we have, considering our country was founded upon that basis.The Writer's Note at the end offers information on both facts and fictions. Secrets, mysticism, history and a just-plain-good tale entwine in a book that inspires musing after the covers are closed. You can't ask much more than that from a novelist."},{"Title":"THIRD SECRET: A Novel Of Suspense (H)","review":"The Florida Times-Union describes The Third Secret as \\"seamlessly weaving history and fiction\\", and Steve Berry does an extraordinary job of doing just that.The Third Secret begins almost one hundred years ago, in Fatima, Portugal. There, three young children are supposedly visited by an apparition of the Virgin Mary who entrusts to them three secrets, which cannot be revealed until the Lady deems it time.Fast-forward to the modern-day Vatican. Clement XV is Pope. The story focuses on Papal secretary Father Colin Michener, and his concern for the Pope, who has suddenly become strangely obsessed with researching Marian appearances... specifically Fatima. He sends Father Michener to speak with an old priest in Romania, and suddenly Michener finds himself thrown into the middle of a mystery that generations of Popes have buried deep within the Vatican's private archives. Add to the mix the return of the woman Michener once loved, causing him to question his faith and the Church, and would-be-Pope Cardinal Valendrea, who seems to be just as interested in what is hidden in the archives, and you find yourself immersed in suspicion, speculation and of course... the third secret. What Michener eventually discovers is a revelation that will change the world's view of God, religion and the Church.I had a bit of trouble getting into The Third Secret at first, perhaps because I was not familiar with the history behind the Lady of Fatima. It didn't take more than a few chapters, though, before I found myself completely intrigued and wanting to know more.Berry is an excellent character writer. Each introduction of a new character left me with an almost immediate visual of that person, along with a strong emotional attachment... like, dislike, respect, sympathy, disbelief. I found myself really pulling for the \\"good guys\\" and actively wanting to see the \\"bad guys\\" fail.At the end of the book are Writers Notes, where Berry explains the history behind the story and highlights the points where he moved from history to fiction. I was really pleased to read this- like I said, I knew next to nothing about Marian appearances or the history surrounding them before reading this book. While I wouldn't recommend reading this section first due to possible spoilers, I do wish that I had done a bit of research after reading the prologue and before delving into the rest of the book. While reading, I found that I spent quite a bit of time speculating as to whether such-and-such actually supposedly happened, or whether Berry was creating the scenarios out of his own imagination. While it didn't take away from the overall experience of the story, I found my own ignorance to be a bit distracting.Overall an excellent read which I totally recommend."},{"Title":"THIRD SECRET: A Novel Of Suspense (H)","review":"This is what you'd expect by a lawyer named Steve who's not bad looking (see giant author pic on back of dust jacket) and has a blurb from the ubiquitous Dan Brown of DaVinci Code fame/notoriety. Obvious tie-ins are hoped for, but I haven't read that bestseller; I was referred to Third Secret via Amazon and enjoyed it as a relative rarity, a theological thriller.You have to love any book that contains these lines: a key figure \\"produced a small black controller. 'One press and Swiss guards charge into this room. Assaulting the pope is a serious crime.'\\" (308) And admire, whatever prose or creed you incline towards, this description of a skeptical witness of a visionary: \\"For an instant he thought he caught a glimmer of light in her pupils--two quick flashes of a reflected image--a swirl of blue and gold. His head whirled left, searching for the source, but there was nothing. Only the sunlit corner and the silent statue. Whatever was occuring was apparently [the visionary's] alone.\\" (237. No plot spoilers, thus the brackets.)Not up to the apocalyptic shocks of GK Chesterton's The Man Who Was Thursday--which I highly recommend to any reader of Berry--but a quick-paced, if rather too fast-moving, reimagining of Marian visions, not only of Fatima but relating to common trends also seen at LaSalette, Lourdes, and Medjugorje. (Garabandal and other discredited ones would have been clever to throw in as contrasts with those to which the Church has deemed \\"worthy of assent.\\" And Berry's legal eye works well here to analyze the implications of this at first supportive phrase from Rome, which leads into the heart of the tension in this story. I am glad I did not read many of the earlier posted reviews here, as they give away far too much of the plot. The chapters, I agree with other critics, are often too telegraphic, and with 71 of them I felt as if I was reading merely Berry's expanded outline too often.For me, not wanting to diminish the suspense denoted in the novel's subtitle, suffice to say I found it a notch above the \\"airport reading\\" I expected. Berry has done a commendable job in relating serious theological debate on issues of the utmost importance to Catholicism and incorporates a lot of expository byways that prove also intriguing. Why prelates wear skullcaps, what is addressed to a dead pope three times, how St. Malachy's alleged prophecies might mesh with the German pope neatly elected after this novel's publication and its fictional Teutonic pontiff, and the clash of humanism and authority within such structures as the former Irish homes for unwed mothers and today's celibate mandate for (unless you transfer from the Anglican priesthood as already married!) Latin rite priests and clergy makes for often thoughtful as well as enlightening engagement well above a genre-bound page-turner. A brief afterward documents Berry's research and his alterations.The strengths I found most emanated from Michener's struggle with his vocation, although why he entered the priesthood seems a mystery. A stronger connection with his Irish past remained necessary; the links Berry crafts here feel too flimsy. The fey clerical henchmen defies credibility--although even he does surprise me a bit, credit to the author I admit. (I was half-expecting him--and his episcopal manipulator--to be part of that dependable Dan Brown scapegoat Opus Dei, so heavy-handed was the sidekick's character and the clumsiness with which he--and again his employer--was drawn by the author.)If you decide to take the plunge, stick with the middle portion--what's predictable does swerve again into more satisfying speculation despite the utter unreality of what a pope would be most concerned with immediately upon election to the throne, and all the jet flights across Europe, however quickly accomplished, blur crucial periods of the action into unbelievably action-driven scenes involving cardinals as well as connivers. That such high-ranking figures would be skulduggerers amidst the pomp of a papal investiture never convinced me at all.I don't care how much \\"the fate of the Church\\" depends on the third secret--it remained preposterous that its highest figures would be dashing about Eastern Europe while a pope died and another lurked to grab St. Peter's chair. (Speaking of which, I suspect Berry muddles papal infallibility--which has to be \\"from the chair,\\" or ex cathedra explicitly stated, not, as he proposes, in any matter even of faith or morals, unless I am wrong. Viz. \\"Cathedra\\" in the Oxford Dict. of the Christian Church: \\"No authoritative statement exists as to which particular Papal pronouncements are 'ex cathedra'.\\")The love interests occupy a respectable portion of the plot and prepare the reader for wider relevance as the climax approaches. I was moved by the final portions of this novel, and only wish that they could be fulfilled, personally and for the Church. If the ending strikes other Amazonians as preposterous, consider that as I read this novel, cardinals were gathered at the Vatican to gingerly hint at possible liberalization of celibacy for priests, as an Eastern rite Melkite priest argued to his Latin rite confreres.Berry, astutely, has a relevant subject: a German pope, this ever-deepening conflict within the priesthood as vocations decline and congregations in the Third World increase, and the vexing tug-of-war between clerical and lay factions as to married clergy, reproductive freedom, gay unions, and the expression of sexuality. With a nimble mind if not the most agile construction, this novel should challenge readers of any faith who place all their faith in a fixed, unchanging revelation.

Having written that a German pope would hold the seat of Saint Peter for a short length of time; and that a African cardinal would be in the running at a future conclave, leads us on in thinking could this have taken place? Many of the characters were complex in nature, strong, and yet very vulnerable. The story excels when the focus is on Colin Michener and Katerina Lew. Eyewitness accounts of the appearances of the Virgin Mary at Fatima and Medjugorje, Bosnia are intertwined with the love story of Colin and Kate, and Cardinal Valendrea's murderous rise to power. Great entertainment, destined for the movies."},{"Title":"THIRD SECRET: A Novel Of Suspense (H)","review":"This book is a great read for anyone, but even better with a background in religion. It has great factual basis yet spins a great fiction book that readers will enjoy. &lt;&lt;spoiler>> great timing too due to a new pope taking office, as well as Catholic issues with marriage, children, etc in the news. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoyed Dan Browns books, and would encourage readers to check out Steve Berry's other novels."},{"Title":"THIRD SECRET: A Novel Of Suspense (H)","review":"I was really intrigued by the jacket copy and read this book with hopes of an intelligent thriller about an intriguing religious mystery. The third secret of Fatima has long been a subject of speculation. The revelation of it a few years ago was a letdown, so it was totally plausible for Berry to concoct a thriller around the \\"real\\" secret.But this book misses the mark. I am willing to believe in cardinals wheeling and dealing and not always for holy purposes. But do we really believe a cardinal would authorize murder to get his hands on the secret and the papal throne?The secret that Berry invents is a totally ludicrous wishlist of changes in the church. That he suggests that the Virgin Mary has been endorsing these changes for almost 80 years is a hoot.Is it possible to write a thriller about the Catholic Chruch that does not have priests bedding mistresses or murdering people? There are plenty of mysteries, intrigues, backroom deals, etc that could provide plot points. If it wasn't for the timeliness of the recent papal conclave, this would be of even less interest. Add this to the slush pile started by \\"Angels and Demons\\"."},{"Title":"THIRD SECRET: A Novel Of Suspense (H)","review":"I enjoyed berry's novel,The Amber Room, and thought this would be worth reading. It wasn't!! The plot was well done,but when it came to the revelation of the \\"secret\\", I moaned and wanted to toss the book across the room. What a letdown!! I literally laughed out loud and thought just another liberal minded person wrote this book. Very disappointing"},{"Title":"THIRD SECRET: A Novel Of Suspense (H)","review":"What if the third secret of the miracle of Fatima would upset the Catholic Church as we know it? That is the premise of Steve Berry's take on Vatican politics, papal infallacy and faith itself. Some Catholics may take much offense at the way the pope and the cardinals are portrayed, as truly there are some evil ones in this book. There is blackmail, murder, lies and deception and the overall portrait of the church is certainly not a pretty one. Father Colin Michener, who is secretary to Pope Clement XIV is sent on a mysterious mission to uncover the facts behind Marian visitations. He is joined by an old lover, an atheist reporter named Katherine Lew, and finds himself in danger at every turn. Much information is given on the miracle at Fatima and the mechanism behind the election of a new Pope. The writing is good and the plot holds your interest. Issues of celibacy, homosexuality, abortion are all addressed. A thought provoking if somewhat disturbing read."},{"Title":"THIRD SECRET: A Novel Of Suspense (H)","review":"I was first drawn to Steve Berry because Dan Brown made a positive comment about one of his books.

But after reading The Third Secret, I will never read another Steve Berry book again.The plot line borrowed significantly from the likes of Dan Brown in his DaVinci Code and Angels & Demons books without providing anything original besides a ludicrous conclusion.

Could't stop reading. historic and fictional facts are enterwined, making the book really fascinating."},{"Title":"THIRD SECRET: A Novel Of Suspense (H)","review":"The Third Secret by Steve Berry was not one of my favorite by this author. I had read a few books by him prior to this one and found them intriguing as well as thought provoking, because of the subjects he chose to focus on. However this book simply fell flat.The Third Secret follows Father Collin Michener a secretary to the Pope and his mission to reveal a murder and Vatican cover up of certain events that took place at the Miracle at Fatima. The plot was too much like The Da Vinci Code by centering mostly in Rome and unheard small villages that the characters arrived simply because the author decided they needed to be there. The characters lacked conviction in their reasoning for their actions and beliefs which were both suppose to drive the story forward. The climax had no originality in its execution or resolution.Having gone to a Catholic school I found the book very poorly researched. It took on very controversial topics, which were not simply Christian based, without any good conclusions about them other than \`get with the program Catholicism it's the twenty first century'. There was not enough history or religion to make this book worth reading or really thinking about after you have finished it. The Third Secret is a quick read that will leave you the second that you have turned the last lack luster page."},{"Title":"THIRD SECRET: A Novel Of Suspense (H)","review":"It's a well plotted book. One person said, it was contrived. All books are, thrillers more so. But the way he keeps you guessing with his twists is great. His characters, while not being wholly round, were well constructed & consistent--especially for a thriller.This is my first Steve Berry book; it won't be my last."},{"Title":"THIRD SECRET: A Novel Of Suspense (H)","review":"\\"Frustrating\\" is what another review said and that really hits the nail on the head. The only suspense in the whole book is waiting to see what the third secret is which takes until the very end to find out. Only to find that: 1. Suicide is O.K. 2. Priests can marry. 3. Homosexuality is O.K. 4. Abortion is O.K. So much more could have been done with this book. How many people were disturbed by the fact that the Virgin Mary actually told the pope to kill himself?"},{"Title":"THIRD SECRET: A Novel Of Suspense (H)","review":"To me, one necessary characteristic of thrillers is that you have to say to yourself, \\"Wow, something like this could really happen! This could be true!\\" That's the point of all the historical and geographical detail--to get you to believe that what you're reading is possible. But the denouement here just strains credibility. It feels too much like wish-fulfillment on the part of the author. Spoiler in next sentence: I may or may not agree with the Church's teaching on abortion, but I simply find it incredible that the Virgin Mary left messages to people all the way back in 1917 arguing in favor of the right of a woman to have an abortion. I am willing to believe that God would want us to allow women to be priests and allow priests to marry, but I find it impossible to imagine that the Virgin Mary wants us to repent from considering homosexuality a sin. Just won't go down my throat.As far as the writing style, it is competent, and I read the book in a few sittings. But the suspense and thrill quotient is rather low. There are some editing mistakes (\\"The site of her made him happy\\" or words to that effect.) And while it is obvious that Berry did his research on the big things, there are errors in the stuff that he figured he already knew and didn't need to research. At one point in the story he mentions that a person can receive \\"300 indulgences\\" by kissing the Pope's ring, but that the man in question probably has more than 300 sins that he needs forgiveness for. All wrong. Indulgences don't forgive sins, and they aren't counted out sin by sin. The meaning of \\"300 days' indulgence\\" (not 300 indulgences) is complex, but this is flat wrong. An author loses credibility when he's wrong about something small that I know the facts on.It is impressive, though, to see his prescience in regards to a German being the Pope to follow John Paul II (not shockingly so, but impressive nonetheless.) And it was a hoot to see the German Pope on tv wearing a Santa Claus-like cap which I'd never seen before and then to read a description of this ancient custom the next day in Berry's book.Overall, this book kept my interest, and taught me a few interesting details about the various Marian apparitions, but the point the author wanted to make was heavy-handed and not credible."},{"Title":"THIRD SECRET: A Novel Of Suspense (H)","review":"A great blend of page-turning thriller-action and thoughtful reflection on the state and history of the Catholic church. The craze for books like The Da Vinci Code has mostly died down, but this novel reminded me of why I jumped on that bandwagon in the first place. There is just enough there to make me stop and think about my own faith and beliefs and to keep me engaged with that aspect of the tale, and there is just enough action to keep me turning pages. The writing is sound enough that I truly cared about what was happening, not just for myself but for the characters involved. Really, Berry is a master of that blend, and I especially enjoyed the challenge to reflect in the context of the novel's action."},{"Title":"THIRD SECRET: A Novel Of Suspense (H)","review":"I have to say that I really really enjoyed this book. As soon as I was finished I drove over to my parents house to give it to them to read!There are some many mysteries surrounding the sightings of Mary, the mother of Jesus and putting them into this book with its conspiracy plot was magic. Although it puts some aspects of the Catholic Church in a bad light (and I'm Catholic), it is a work of fiction to be enjoyed on that level! I hope to read any other books by Steve Berry as I'm sure that they will be as wonderful as this was!"},{"Title":"THIRD SECRET: A Novel Of Suspense (H)","review":"I picked up this novel during an airport layover and finished it in a couple of days. I was raised Catholic and thoroghly enjoyed it. I'd never really understood Fatima, Lourdes, etc, and found that history to be facinating. I plan upon reading Steve Berry's other books. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"THIRD SECRET: A Novel Of Suspense (H)","review":"I read this book thinking that the author may have some good insight into what the famous \\"Third Secret\\" of Fatima is, especially in view of today's world. Instead he wrote a book that ended up insulting Christians, Catholics in particular. I was shocked when he finally gets to the end of the book and suggests the Mary was sending messages from heaven implying that God is upset because there is not enough acceptance of abortion ,homosexualitry, promiscuity, you name it. Steve Barry has totally lost it. Don't waste your time or money."},{"Title":"THIRD SECRET: A Novel Of Suspense (H)","review":"Taking his cue from Dan Brown, Steve Berry moves from the Russian themes of his first two novels to the intrigues of the Vatican for his third, The Third Secret. The influence of his expertise on Russia & Eastern Europe is still felt in his elucidation of the secrets of Fatima and scenes in Romania and Bosnia but this is a very different novel than he's written previously.Like The Romanov Prophecy, this novel is set in an imaginary near future where Pope John Paul's successor is Clement XV, a progressive German pope who is looking to understand the third secret of Fatima. According to Berry's premise, the third secret supposedly revealed by John Paul is not, in fact, the message--or not the entire message--left by the Virgin. Clement is helped in this task by Msgr. Colin Michener, loyal but haunted by his past. Then, Michener's quest is hampered when Clement dies by his own hand and the ultra-conservative Alberto Cardinal Valendrea becomes pope.Let me leave it there. It would be unfair to give away much more. Needless to say, what remains to unfold and be revealed is the ultimate dream of progressive Catholics everywhere. Pure fantasy? Certainly. Fun for a Catholic who dreams of a Church rocked to its foundations by a voice from heaven speaking directly to every problem the Church has? Absolutely.Still, it is worth noting that, though Dan Brown may be the guiding force behind this novel, The Third Secret is nowhere near as controversial as The DaVinci Code; mainly, because Brown's novel speaks to the basic tenets of Catholicism while Berry's novel speaks to religious practice--controversial in its own way but less so. Berry also has eliminated from this novel some of the things that plagued his first two; in particular, the body count here is low and handled realistically.Overall, it remains difficult to say whether or not this novel is fundamentally any better than his previous two novels. And yet, it seems more sound in many basic ways and less taxing on the suspension of disbelief once you accept the basic premise. To be honest, for a progressive Catholic reader, it's just more interesting and fun, a great read. A subjective analysis, to be sure, but an honest one."},{"Title":"THIRD SECRET: A Novel Of Suspense (H)","review":"I was interested in this book based upon the title. After having read some of the reviews of people that have read it, I'm glad I didn't order. It sounds like a sensational, fictional novel with no basis in history or in fact.Pope John Paul II revealed the third secret of Fatima in the late 1990s and attested to the content of the third secret of Fatima. This was also confirmed by Sister Lucia when the secret was revealed and before her recent death. The information is readily available on the internet in well known, respected publictions... including many international news agencies. Just do a google search. The secret was intentionally not revealed until after the event occurred... the attempted assasination of the pope. It's a wonderful story that goes on to explain the pope's devotion to Our Lady of Fatima and how he dedicated the two bullets that pierced his body.So why buy a titillating, fictional novel if you are on a quest for the truth?"},{"Title":"THIRD SECRET: A Novel Of Suspense (H)","review":"I liked The Amber Room and LOVED The Romanov Prophecy.

While even the bravest scholar of Nostradamus shudders at the thought of actually living through his end of time predictions, it nevertheless behooves us to pay close attention to what the prophet had to say about the possible apocalypse lurking somewhere in our near future.In \\"Nostradamus: Predictions of World War III,\\" author Jack Manuelian has gathered together all the prophecies of Nostradamus believed to be applicable to the coming Final Conflict, and his painstaking research into the pertinent quatrains lends an authenticity to his interpretations that has few equals in the field of Nostradamus scholarship. Manuelian has utilized sources in English, French and Spanish, and his command of all three languages assures the reader that his approach is both thorough and highly literate.The reader may already be familiar with what are called the Three Antichrists of Nostradamus. Nostradamus predicted the rise and fall of, first, Napoleon, and second, Adolph Hitler, both of whom were tyrants who presecuted and slaughtered great numbers of innocent people. The Third Antichrist, which most scholars consider to be yet-to-come, is interpreted here as an ... TERRORIST who will suffer a crushing military defeat at the hands of his enemies and ultimately be forever vanquished.Manuelian makes the case for the final Antichrist being of Arab ancestry slowly and carefully, combining several quatrains that eventually coalesce into a portrait of an enemy of all mankind, a \\"black and angry one\\" who wears a blue turban as a sign of his identity. While one would hesitate to name ... as this figure just yet, he seems a likely candidate at this point.Admittedly, Manuelian is not the first to call Arab terrorism the Third Antichrist. That theoretical interpretation has been kicked around for the last fifteen to twenty years. But he is certainly as good a source as any for an education in what has been prophesied by Nostradamus about the bitter battles that may lie ahead of us on the way to a better world.Manuelian also includes material from modern day prophets like Veronica Lueken, Doloros Cannon, and Dannion Brinkley, and gives his own opinions on the alien/UFO connection to possible scenarios of the future.No one wants to hear the crack of doom in what has happened to New York, to Washington and to all of us. Even if the many end-time prophecies of Nostradamus (as well as predictions from countless cultures and religious faiths) finally are to be fulfilled, we should still approach the future with faith that mankind will, with the help of God, eventually prevail against all Antichrists, Arab or otherwise, that are sent to trouble us. In the meantime, books like Manuelian's can give us a foothold in time while we wait to see if the worst is still ahead of us."},{"Title":"Nostradamus: Predictions of World War III","review":"Obviously we live in troubled times. Many are unable to confront the tragic events that recently took place. Others feel it very important that they know what is ahead for all of us. If you are of like mind you will want to read NOSTRADAMUS PREDICTIONS OF WORLD WAR III. It contains a host of material from the seers earlier prophecies right on through to the third anti christ who is said to be living in the Middle East. Does this book have all the answers??? Probably not, but the author does delve into the meaning of Nostradamus words as well as bringing in the visions of other seers from our current era. And, in addition, there are other things besides predictions of World War III to contemplate -- even an invasion from space."},{"Title":"Nostradamus: Predictions of World War III","review":"It's an okay read.

It is well explained that the verses that Nostradums wrote are matter of interpretation."},{"Title":"Nostradamus: Predictions of World War III","review":"Nostradamus predicted that in the year 1999 and seven months, from the sky will come a Great king of Terror. This terror will revive the great king of the Mongols and there will be war before and after this event. I believe that on September 11, 2001 this prediction came true. Nostradamus also said that this war will be a holy war between Islam and the West and that is exactly what is about to happen right now. Nostradamus had the year wrong because he connected it with the August 11, 1999 eclipse, so he was two years off. In Nostradamus time September was the seventh month so this part of the prophecy did come true. This was the worst terrorist attack in history so it defenantly was a great king of terror. I cannot explain the third line but the fourth line is obviously a reference to a major doomsday war that will follow this terror event. This war according to Nostradamus is World War III. There is a prophecy that says that it will begin in the summer of 2002!! Maybe the War on Terrorism or the situation in the Middle East could lead to World War III. Nostradamus also said that after the war a king will come to make peace in the world. In the Bible, the book of Daniel said that the antichrist would confirm a covenant with many nations especially Israel. So it is possible that Nostradamus king may be the antichrist mentioned in the Bible. This means that unless something changes the course of history very soon, the world will be doomed!!!"},{"Title":"Nostradamus: Predictions of World War III","review":"I am seriously convinced that George W.

It is great for younger kids too if you don't mind your 4 year picking up expressions like 'gross me out' and 'punky' (which are now common expressions in our house).

To help make the trip \\"educational\\" as well as fun - this book is like a journal where the students can keep all their tickets, maps, flyers, and information in one little holder. When the parents ask the kids what they saw and did - the kids can pull this out and SHOW the parents and REVIEW what they did!!

It's a fantastic series -- one of my favorites -- and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend to anyone with even a passing interest in science fiction.Expendable is the first of the League of Peoples books. It introduces Festina Ramos, the main recurring character in the series, and Oar, the main character of Ascending (a later book in the series). Expendable also serves as a good introduction to the series' universe (the Explorer Corp., that humans are small fry in the universal pecking order, that non-sentients can't leave their home solar system, etc.). It's a good book -- it got me hooked on the series -- and is a logical place to start reading. That said, it isn't as good as the later books."},{"Title":"EXPENDABLE.","review":"James Alan Gardner's \\"Expendable\\" is definitely an all-around interesting book. The writing style and structure are very different from most books, the characters are not something you normally see, and the concepts underlying the story are original. I'd really like to rate the book higher. But, there are problems. First, the ending of the book is weak. Once the characters reach the city of their goals, the tone of the book changes to be more campy than interesting. Specifically, 1) the Explorers in the city are not the competent types that they should be as described throughout the book, and 2) a cheesy super-villain appears (and, oddly, Gardner specifically notes this cheesiness and super-villainy in the dialog). My other problem with the book is that Gardner gets rid of the best character in the book (Chee) early on. Surely, there could have been a way to tell this tale without tossing the best character. Anyway, the book is definitely different, interesting, and easy to read. But, because of those faults, I have to drop it a star and rate it at merely an OK 3 stars out of 5."},{"Title":"EXPENDABLE.","review":"The social system of the Technocracy and the way they and other \\"sentient\\" races interact is quite interesting. Festina is a great character who's more than able of taking care of herself. The fight to get off Melaquin and to keep Jelca from destroying the world is good too. I liked the writing, the pacing, and the way the novel was formatted.However, once extremely irritating facet of this book kept it from being a solid 4-Star: Oar. Snooty, whiney, blithering, Oar took a lot of my enjoyment out of this story. She got under my skin and not in a good way. Her personality was grating. She could have been a much better character."},{"Title":"EXPENDABLE.","review":"_Expendable_ by James Alan Gardner has an unusual premise. In the twenty-fifth century life is fantastic, people just about live forever thanks to YouthBoost and with advanced medical technology and quick responses, just about no one ever dies (at least violently).Except for members of the Explorer Corps.In a perfect world of perfect people, some just don't fit. They have some deformity, maybe a malformed hand or arm, a bizarre and startling facial birthmark, some sort of birth defect involving their ear lobes or hair. With most people in the Technocracy, these problems are usually fixed but for a small portion of the population, these defects are seen to have national security benefits. If the defect is not debilitating or life threatening (merely mildly inconvenient or just unsightly), if the person is otherwise capable and intelligent, efforts on the part of that person to have that defect surgically altered are quietly blocked behind the scenes. That person is groomed for the only position that is open to them, the Explorer Corps.The powers that be, the admirals of the Fleet, concluded long ago that the loss of a crewmember was devastating to the ship's personnel, as it required days if not weeks of mourning, loss of readiness, and generally made for an unwanted distraction. However, if the person killed was one people were uncomfortable around, who was a social outcast, who while not hated was maybe pitted instead, well, it was too bad if that person was lost in the line of duty exploring some hostile alien planet, but the crew would say a few words, have a short memorial service, and then be talking about what was for dinner afterwards.The Explorer Corps, while highly trained, very capable and intelligent individuals, were made of just these misfits. Though officially highly valued (the chief protagonist in the book, Explorer First Class Festina Ramos, is on the books second in command only to the captain of the vessel she served on, the _Jacaranda_), they were pretty much social outcasts, often making other members of the fleet uncomfortable, usually clinging together with other explorers or eating alone in their rooms. The Explorers well knew not only their social position in the scheme of things but also how the Fleet ultimately saw them. Their name for themselves was ECM, standing for Expendable Crew Member. Their job was to explore alien planets, relaying what they saw back to the vessel. While many worlds turned out to be safe or even boring places to explore, a great many explorers have lost their lives, going \\"oh sh**!\\" as the Explorers say among themselves, an acknowledgment of common last recorded words of many an Explorer as they met their demise.Festina Ramos and her partner, Yarrun Derigha, had done pretty well as Explorers -i.e. not having been killed in the line of duty - but one day an apparently very unstable Admiral Chee is escorted aboard with sealed orders, orders for the two them to accompany the admiral to the planet Melaquin, the \\"Planet of No Return,\\" a graveyard for dozens of Explorers, most of whom died in ten minutes or less on the planet for reasons unknown. Though the planet looked very Earth-like to automated probes sent before each Explorer expedition, something on the planet killed people off in minutes. Was it disease, hostile aliens, some bizarre and undetected weather phenomenon? No one knew, but Festina knew she and Yarrun were going there.Oh, and they aren't allowed anything more powerful than a stun gun. See, in this setting the League of Peoples is the ultimate big brother. A diverse and for all practical purposes omnipresent and omniscient organization made up of not only \\"normal\\" corporeal sentient races like humans but also of many powerful energy beings, the League monitors all space flights. While weapons are allowed on a race's homeworld, they are not allowed to leave the atmosphere of that world. Further, those who have committed murder, ordered deaths, allowed murder to be committed, or knowingly aided murderers (what the League calls \\"unsentient acts\\") are stopped cold. Depending on the situation, the League's instant reactions can vary from stopping the heart of a murderer to destroying outright an entire ship.I won't say anything more about the book, but it was well-written and a fast read. The big secret of Melanquin was interesting and tied in well with the League, the Explorer Corps, and secrets held by the highest levels of the Technocracy. An enjoyable book, it reminded me in some ways of some of the Golden Age of science fiction novels with it sense of wonder and wide-open possibilities."},{"Title":"EXPENDABLE.","review":"Festina & Admiral Chee make a great pair of characters in the start of the book. I wish this sort of duo could have continued longer than it had. The humor which was replaced with this duo wasn't as effective. Melaquin seems like an ideal place to settle if it wasn't for the myth surrounding the place. The follow through of adventure was well done but some of the ideas kind of boring, unadventurous. However, the entire idea of Expendables is hilarious and sad at the same time."},{"Title":"EXPENDABLE.","review":"but interesting and pretty good. I really enjoyed this book much to my own suprise as I thought it was going in a very boring direction in the middle, but the author didn't let me down and it got very interesting after this point. This book is about hte Expendable Crew Members, people in society that don't look normal and cause the crew less distress is they are lost on hostile missions. The concept and writing style are original and interesting, which would be enough for most readers. The pace is good, not overly fast, not too slow. I enjoyed the way the subchapters were set up and titled, it added a lot of humor to the story. Coming from a time of imperfection I found it a little hard to believe that all the normal people felt completely horrified by people some of the lesser abnormalities, such as the main characters strawberry birthmark. I gave the author the benifit of the doubt, however, and really enjoyed the book. It is solid sci-fi that also has a good sense of humor, which I always appreciate. I would suggest giving it a try."},{"Title":"EXPENDABLE.","review":"James Alan Gardner is one of those authors that likes to get right to the meat of things. He gives ample descriptions of the characters and their surroundings, but doesn't bore you to death with minute details that have little bearing on the story as a whole. Festina Ramos is one of the most original and entertaining protaganists ever to be put to paper. Even without 4 chapters of back story her subtle intricacies and social shortcomings are clear and believable. The character of Oar is one of the most hilarious and original ideas to grace a Sci-Fi novel since the heyday of RAH(Robert Heinlein). I read this book at the behest of a good friend and was hooked on Gardner ever since. While his stories lack the infusion of science fact that are the trademarks of true masters of sci-fi his debut novel is entertaining and memorable."},{"Title":"EXPENDABLE.","review":"James Alan Gardner is one of my new favorite authors. In Expendable, he has created a new and exciting universe peopled by characters who breathe and live between the pages. Some aspects of this book were predictable. However, it is still a page turner.I found it interesting that he wrote this book from the viewpoint of a female. It is written in first person perspective.The book is also a study of human nature and behavior. It has some funny bits, some poignant bits and a lot of great imagery. This is an excellent book. Honestly, it is one of the best \\"first\\" books I have read.Right after this book, I read \\"Commitment Hour\\" also by this author.

I'll also write a review about that book."},{"Title":"EXPENDABLE.","review":"THis is not a hard science book but it is great. It is very original and suprisingly funny and frank.

I can't describe how it changed me, but let 's just say I found myself saying &quot;That's what 'expendable' means,&quot; daily."},{"Title":"EXPENDABLE.","review":"This book has a novel premise and that's about it. This might have made a good short story, but as a novel it is completely uninspiring. The characters are all cardboard cutouts who inspire no empathy. The plot consists of one unbelievable deus ex machina turn after another. The contrived mini-chapters with the giveaway titles are annoying. The natives of the planet Melaquin have no depth or ingenuity behind them. Don't bother with this book."},{"Title":"EXPENDABLE.","review":"This book was one of the slowest and stupid books I have ever read"},{"Title":"EXPENDABLE.","review":"I loved this story about a future in which the expolorers are all slightly deformed, so that they won't be missed when they die. A ridiculous premise, of course! But it makes for a wonderful group of characters.

I recommend it highly."},{"Title":"EXPENDABLE.","review":"... I do find the idea of whether the League would not figure out the \\"non-sentient\\" practice of dumping off people on a hostile planet to get rid of them a bit \\"off\\" (if they even know when you intend to kill, wouldn't they know what the Admirality was up to, and want to stop it?) I also am not sure about the practice of picking the unattractive to be expendable-- Festina is genetically engineered to have a big old birthmark that makes her troublesome and therefore expendable. These are potentially interesting ideas that could be explored to great effect-- and at first, I thought Gardner was going to really wow me. But the last half of the book does end with more of a whimper than a bang-- and I don't think that anyone really grows or changes, least of all the Earth folks who don't have to take responsibility for what they've been doing.It's a good, quick read, and don't get me wrong, I did enjoy it. But what sci fi does best is take an already existing condition and make us think about it in a new way that changes some of us... and I think what this book does more of is reinforce things we already know about ourselves without really questioning the big underlying assumptions. The human race can be big jerks sometimes-- so what does the humble explorer do about it?"},{"Title":"EXPENDABLE.","review":"This book has an interesting premise (the world's deformed are forced to become explorers (ie. redshirts)), but JAG avoids major issues, such as why do the expendable put up with their current situation and since the exploeres are reallly quite powerful, why don't the seize control? The book was enjoyable, but JAG skirts the issue that explorers are treated badly and no one really ever deals with it in a real way--both the author and the charactes. Yes, in the end, the characters deal with it and the end result deals with it, but a major portion of the book doesn't deal with the racism that explorers feel.The problem, as stated with this book, is that is really is about racism with a SF background, however, JAG, never deals with it. He takes the time for you to feel for the characters, to get to know some of them, and even start to identify yourself with them, however, the is no resolution to the issue what-so-ever. It is a very good premise, and quite believeable, however, nothing is ever done with it well. Good characters suffer through an incomplete novel."},{"Title":"EXPENDABLE.","review":"I'm getting tired of wading through these novels where the main antagonist is incredibly annoying, but left in the plot because there'd be no reason to continue writing without him (or her). So you just sit there and get annoyed by the character until the book - mercifully - ends.Expendible is not one of these books. The characters are strange but never annoying. If nothing else, they're human without resorting to extremes. The book reads very quickly and cleanly.You'd be inclined to think it's fluff, since it does read well, but there's actually quite a bit of food for thought in there and some very interesting insight into human nature. Go read it now."},{"Title":"EXPENDABLE.","review":"I've only just gotten back into reading sci-fi books, and I have to say that this was an interesting story. The characters lead a sad life, but of course all is vindicated in the end. The plot took a twist after they landed on &quot;the planet&quot; (one that I wasn't expecting, I might add), then it became somewhat political, but I still enjoyed it. I'll more than likely read the other books that are part of the series."},{"Title":"EXPENDABLE.","review":"EXPENABLE I thought was a very good book.

From , Natasha"},{"Title":"EXPENDABLE.","review":"This first person narrative of an Explorer, a member of an outcast corps considered expendable because of their physical disabilities, was outstanding. Not only was it a great story which kept me reading until the end, but an insightful commentary on how a society labels and creates &quot;throw-aways&quot;. It is a courageous book that never fails to address important issues as they arise in the minds of the characters. As a disabled reader who daily confronts challenges created by others more than by my disability, I commend the author for his sensitive portrayal of the main character and the wonderful ending."},{"Title":"EXPENDABLE.","review":"SF is an excellent vehicle to explore aspects of our human nature or of human society. Expendable examines the definition of \\"humanness\\", the nature of bigotry, and the underpinnings of official corruption. The author creates a future in which people with appropriate physical defects are denied available medical care, and become second class citizens assigned to unpleasant and ultimately dangerous work as Explorers in the human interstellar fleet. Explorers make first contact with aliens and sometimes fall victim to injury or death due to misunderstandings. Because Explorers are physically unattractive, other members of the interstellar fleet can accept death or injury of these people (or almost people, in their eyes) more easily. A dark secret is that the Admiralty uses an apparently hospitable planet as a dumping ground for undesirables, since for unknown reasons, no one apparently survives or returns.Gardner creates an interesting tale that has moral underpinnings without preaching to the reader. The book is well-written and flows nicely. He builds smoothly to a climax and the characters, including some distinctly alien beings, are people who you care about. I did wonder why the marooned Explorers, who have no close attachments in the way of family or friends, are so anxious to return to an institutionally corrupt society that has discarded them. A nice Earth-like world where one could live in peace seemed a pretty good alternative."},{"Title":"EXPENDABLE.","review":"I read this book because it was on a list of books with strong female characters. I was not disappointed, and I found myself thinking that perhaps I had misjudged science fiction. The plot revolves around the concept that people get upset if attractive people are killed on dangerous missions, but no-one really cares about unattractive or physically flawed people. So although the technology is there to correct birth defects and other physical problems (such as stammering, obesity, or birthmarks), certain children are left with their physical problem uncorrected and raised to be &quot;explorers&quot;, so that if they die on a mission of interplanetary exploration, there won't be a public outcry or grief. These people are expendable, and no-one will notice they've died, except for other explorers, who will respond with their motto -- &quot;That's what expendable means.&quot; They have been raised from early childhood and specially trained to sacrifice themselves. These &quot;explorers&quot; simultaneously think of themselves as superior and inferior -- &quot;real people&quot;, as they call them, are shallow and weak, and yet they envy &quot;real people.&quot; This whole concept raises questions about the value placed on physical perfection by our society and what it means to be someone who can't meet those standards.The main character, Festina Ramos, is a female explorer sent on a suicide mission to a planet from which no explorer has ever returned. She and her partner are being sacrificed as part of a larger plot to deal with another undesirable of society. Needless to say, the planet turns out to be inhabited. Festina sets off on a long adventure of survival. I really couldn't put the book down, and I particularly recommend it to those who are interested in strong, capable female protaganists."},{"Title":"EXPENDABLE.","review":"I was suprised at how much I enjoyed this book. It was well-written, with a very interesting plot. But what won me over was Gardner's ability to create a realistic, heroic, kick-@%% female character. This is an extremely rare ability for writers in any genre, and is enough to recommend this novel even without its other outstanding qualities. The constant sarcasm is a wonderful touch, and the outcast Explorers will appeal to any other cynics out there. But Gardner's real twist is that he manages to sneak something close to optimism in there without anybody noticing. Very sneaky. Very good novel."},{"Title":"EXPENDABLE.","review":"Expendable is an absolute brilliant novel; that it is the debut novel for James Alan Gardner makes it even more spectacular.Many science-fiction novels, television series, and films present the future as something which should be desired by the people of our present time. Expendable, however, shows the future as not-so-desirable in two pertinent ways: 1.) Humanity can rule itself, but must constantly act within the strict guidelines established and summarily enforced by The League of Peoples, which take on a nearly-mystical, nearly-godlike role, knowing all without ever being seen; 2.) Not everyone is &quot;beautiful,&quot; and those with both the aptitude and the lack of beauty are made into Explorers, also known as Expendable Crew Members because of the logic that &quot;no one will miss someone who is not beautiful&quot; - this despite the easy availability of numerous surgical procedures to essentially MAKE someone beautiful.This second point is what truly grabbed my attention from the second page. The main character, Festina Ramos, was born with a &quot;birthmark&quot; condition which has left &quot;a lurid port-wine birthmark covering the right half of my face from cheekbone to chin.&quot; A very close friend of more than a decade has the same &quot;birthmark,&quot; so the tale spun by Gardner is particularly personal.Gardner's writing style is excellent - easy to follow, providing technological explanations without being deeply detailed, and split into short segments (ranging from several paragraphs to - rarely - several pages in length) grouped together as chapters to enable the reader to stop at really any point and feel it is a good stopping point (thus making it a great book for those who are often interrupted when reading). Unfortunately, however, the story is told in the first person in flashback, which takes some of the &quot;danger&quot; element away from the overall mood of the narrative.Overall, Expendable is a very good read. The primary world Gardner creates is both familiar and foreign, and the narrative twists mostly unexpected. Especially for those with or those who care deeply for someone with the &quot;birthmark&quot; condition, this mark of &quot;disfigurement&quot; takes on a new light and helps to cause the reader to consider concepts of beauty in our present reality."},{"Title":"EXPENDABLE.","review":"I found the basic concept of this book, that particularly ugly members of our future technocracy are considered expendable, to be patently untenable. Perhaps that's just wishful thinking on my part and Gardner has it right - alas!As we progress in this, Festina Ramos' absorbing adventure, we befriend a number of well fleshed out and interesting characters. I admit to feeling that the characterization, as the plot, was a bit heavy handed, but I certainly enjoyed it.Swept along in her discovery of the secrets of the exile planet Melaquin, Festina gradually loses everything that she holds dear. She remains firmly rooted in her distinct personality, however, and finally triumphs in a most unexpected way.This book, like many of my favorites, didn't end as I turned the last page. Even now, mulling over it to write this review, I am struck by new realizations of the deeper purpose and meaning of Melaquin, that..... Noooooo, you'll have to read it yourself.Bravo James Alan Gardner, and thank you. I'll certainly look for more Festina and more Gardner."},{"Title":"EXPENDABLE.","review":"Festina Ramos is an Explorer, one of the ranks of the ECMs (Expendable Crew Members), who are chosen for dangerous missions because they are not physically appealing. The League of Peoples ensures that life is sacred and that there's no war and little crime. Festina, who is also bisexual (although this has nothing to do with her status as an Explorer), finds that she and her partner have been chosen to go to Melaquin, the planet from which no Explorer has ever returned. Festina is not amused and is determined to survive. Melaquin is apparently the dumping ground for undesirable personnel (like crazed Admirals who refuse to retire) and for various Explorers. Upon landing on Melaquin, Festina finds it's not unlike how Earth used to be. And the similarities only get stronger. And weirder. Did the Explorers who arrived before her and her partner survive? If so, where are they? &quot;Expendable&quot; is a captivating story full of whimsical and sarcastic humor, as well as intriguing social commentaries. It's a fascinating adventure for Festina and the reader who's plunging along, fully involved. I wavered rating the book either 4 or 5, and finally settled on 4 because it does end as one would expect, but that didn't disappoint me in any fashion. Instead it made me want to read more and find out what happens in the next book."},{"Title":"EXPENDABLE.","review":"Like most good SF, this book makes some uncomfortable points about our current society by picking a facet and exaggerating it. How do we see those who are \\"different\\" or do not meet our standards of physical perfection? In this book, and frankly in contemporary America, those who are distasteful to look at are expendable. This book takes that to the extreme, and wraps it in a powerful and evocative story. Unfortunately, Gardner finds it necessary to sprinkle the tale with miracles and improbabilities that add little to the story or the message. The characters are solid and well-envisioned, and Gardner tells the story elegantly and well, but much of the novel is, um, expendable. Overall, though, a good novel with complex issues; well worth the time it takes to read."},{"Title":"EXPENDABLE.","review":"James Alan Garner is remarkable. He's created a story in such a tired out genre, and warped into something that is enjoyable and readable.Those who may think the primise of the book is too simplistic will quickly find out how well this story has been written. It displays the main characters' dilemma in dealing with who she is as a person . . . a 'expendable' person, who is trapped on a planet that was supposed to kill her. What happens after brings the reader into this world she's in -- and what troubles being someone that noone wants to mind losing brings to those people.Why can't all sci-fi novels be like this? God, I can't wait for his next book (after 'Commitment Hour'). I'm not worthy!"},{"Title":"EXPENDABLE.","review":"WOW! I'd constantly seen this book in stores and read the short synopsis in the back but I figured it would probably be a bore. Then one day I finally decided to check it out and I was extremely surprised. So much of science fiction books nowadays try to be difficult and impend some sort of sciecne fictional philosophy on the reader just to confuse and bore the reader( I could give some examples but I wouldn't LOL! ) all at once. EXPENDABLE is a novel in which you find yourself hooked with the main character(s). The style of Gardner's writing is great. There's not a dull moment. If so, it so the characters will develop more. A treat that's very rare. Read it now! Enjoy it! And thank me later!"},{"Title":"EXPENDABLE.","review":"This book is a somewhat enjoyable and a quick read. It starts with some very interesting concepts that offer the promise of great science fiction philosophy. Unfortunately the author seemed to get tired towards the end of the book and doesn't put much effort into ending what starts as a great book.At first, I thought the author was writing a book based on a concept that was pretty original. That is the concept that an entire book could be written with a protagonist, but no antagonist. With no clearly defined villian, the hero was free to explore more than just the tight boundries dictated by modern day media entertainment. And for two-thirds of the book this concept is brilliant and works very well. Unfortunately, at some point the author seems to \\"wake up\\" and realize that he has no where to go with the book because he has run out of ideas or he is too scared to creatively finish what he has started. And so within the last 40 pages of the book he creates your typical villian character and ends the book on a huge cliche. Sad, this book could have been so much better if the author had stayed true to his original premise."},{"Title":"EXPENDABLE.","review":"James Alan Gardner's EXPENDABLE is a full-bodied SF tale set in a somewhat mysterious but fully developed universe. Hard SF is melded flawlessly with sociological SF to create a lively universe that is not just a rehash of the usual alien or galactic empire setting.Within a universe ruled and monitored by the shadowy League of Sentient Beings, humans are permitted to expand their dominion as long as they behave in a sentient manner--that is, they don't kill other sentient beings or each other. Other space-faring species have been declared non-sentient and have had their space exploration privledges revoked by the League. But the human Technocracy seems to have found a loophole, a deadly planet called Melaquin. Undesireables, especially undesirable admirals and officials, get assigned to \\"explore\\" this death planet. Of course, they must be accompanied by trained Explorers, who are all considered \\"Expendable\\" because of their various physical defects.The heroine of the novel is an Explorer, who, of course, is assigned to accompany a senile admiral to Melaquin. That's when the adventure begins. EXPENDABLE is a refreshing SF novel that blends the broad sweep of Asimov's FOUNDATION series with the philosophical-ethical introspection of Huxley's BRAVE NEW WORLD.Vincent Miskell is a SF writer whose short fiction has appeared in ROSEBUD, MILLENNIUM, and in the SF anthology, THE AGE OF WONDERS.

Mr. Gardner is a fine writer, but has a knack for using really dumb sociobiological explanations. Let us hope he has mulled through consequences when writing COMMITMENT HOUR. He deserves another chance."},{"Title":"EXPENDABLE.","review":"*Expendable* is a good science fiction novel, driven by clever writing and fast plotting. Its virtues have been sung by other reviewers here, with whom I mostly agree. But I also see some faults that, for me, diminished my enjoyment of the book. First, elements of the plot struck me as contrived. For example, Festina (the protagonist) needs to be convinced that she must remain on Melaquin (a planet of permanent and secret exile), and so she's presented as believing that she is a murderer (by the laws of the League of Peoples, a kind of trans-stellar federation of really smart species, murders cannot leave the surface of their planets lest they be executed). But given the circumstances of her murder, and her own character, it's highly implausible that she would believe this about herself. My other gripe focuses on Festina's character. In the course of the novel she undergoes experiences -- betrayal by her superiors, being marooned on a &quot;death planet,&quot; accidentally killing her partner, discovering that the man she has loved from afar is a psychopath, among many others -- that would surely have been transformative for any normal person. Yet she does not evolve, or even change -- she is exactly the same at the end of the book as she was at the beginning. In not working out how her experiences would have reformed her, Gardner has here missed an opportunity to write a novel that would have had much deeper resonance, and more lasting impact."},{"Title":"EXPENDABLE.","review":"This was Gardner's first book. Like a lot of first books, it has some good ideas, some bad ideas and some mediocre execution.The Technocracy is a good idea. A galaxy wide, fairly informal organization, it encompasses civilizations so advanced as to be omnipotent. Earth is a very junior member. There's only one unalterable rule in the Technocracy: non-sentient species, defined as a species that kills, aren't permitted to travel beyond their system. If they try, they are killed, with no more compunction than we'd swat a mosquito.Explorers are a good idea, they are brave, intelligent scouts on new planets, with physical defects that make their inescapably high mortality rates politically acceptable. I'm not sure I buy the premise, but at least it's a new idea.Melaquin, the &quot;dumping ground&quot; for the Earth's political hot potatoes, is a bad idea, and the corruptness, incompetence and stupidity of the Earth's governing body is a genuinely dumb idea.Still, the good carries the bad, and overall this is a good read. Gardner's later books, featuring much the same cast of characters, are better. Festina Ramos, the protagonist here, is a far more interesting person in &quot;Vigilant&quot; and &quot;Hunted,&quot; two of the later books.Gardner bears watching. If he continues to improve, he could be a genuinely new voice in science fiction."},{"Title":"EXPENDABLE.","review":"The overall plot isn't entirely believable, but it's science fiction so you're used to that. The story is well told, with an attitude, and I enjoyed reading it. Far better than a lot of what's out there these days."},{"Title":"EXPENDABLE.","review":"An interesting concept proposed in this book, about people who, because of some flaw in their appearence etc. are sent to explore strange new worlds. But at some point they are sent to their doom on a planet where no one has ever reported back. Some interesting plot twists. But the whole premise that people with odd disfigurements are totally expendable doesn't seem plausible."},{"Title":"EXPENDABLE.","review":"My friend Melvin said that science fiction books may be set in the future but they are always about the present. Thus a science fiction book will have characters who are bus drivers, even if they drive a bus that works more like a helicopter.This book is basically about disability. People who go through life with some affliction. The premise of the book is that if someone popular in an organisation dies, then it affects the morale of the organisation. Thus in the future those people who become space explorers undertaking dangerous missions will the the ugly the deformed. That way if they keep getting killed no one is to upset.Of course in the future people will probably only have selected clones as children or the technology will exist to remove things like birthmarks. So really this is a book about being ugly or suffering from a disfigerment and the problems that it brings.The thrust of the book is that the main character of the book goes through a number of adventures and although in the end she is able to cure the defect that she has ( a large birthmark on her face) she is not concerned about it and feels at peace with herself.The book of course is written for young people who despite all looking youthfull and attractive go through a period of feeling that they are ugly. A book like this is no doubt a good idea as they can learn the very real message that physical beauty is something which has its advantages but in real life ones sense of self depend on so many things apart from appearance.The book is very easy to read and it creates a world which is interesting and new, even if in the end it is about a very here and now theme."},{"Title":"EXPENDABLE.","review":"A fast-paced adventure with just the right mix of new ideas, exotic concepts, and action. The type of book that one can easily read in one sitting; entertaining, intelligent, thought-provoking without being a drag, action-packed but not mindless.The silly premise (read the excerpt) is that a government conspiracy keeps deformed people from being cured, so that these unattractive individuals can be used as expendable explorers. Geeze, I doubt we'll every have a shortage of unattractive people (beauty is a relative concept) - take a look out of a your window and you'll agree. But this silly premise (with accompanying conspiracy theories and odd portrayals of society) is easily ignored by the reader.As with many novels these days, the heroine has a Tragic Past and is the Victim of A Social Injustice - in her case, an unsightly birthmark. Thus the protagonist does her requisite amount of complaining about her lot in life. Fortunately, this ritual denouncement of social injustice is not intrusive (and it is a lot more pleasant to hear her complain about her birthmark than the usual writer's crutch of child abuse, incest, and alcoholism)."},{"Title":"EXPENDABLE.","review":"The first few chapters were original in content and writing style. I was intrigued and reading on in hopes of high &quot;original&quot; adventure. Alas, the author quickly ran out of his promising creativeness and the book turned into an amalgam of other sci-fi books. It felt like reading Ringworld meshed in with some others. My interest was lost and I skimmed through the latter two thirds of the book without losing much."},{"Title":"EXPENDABLE.","review":"I found this story to be a story that went no where, and its plot and characters were unengaging. First of all, the basic premise of the story was implausible; that gave it a bad start. (although how is something called speculative fiction judged implausible?) None the less, the idea of a benificial, but virtually omipotentent power existing in a universe where exporation is still necessary, is contradictory. For an interesting take on the 'ultimate' society read Stanislaw Lem's 'The Cyberaid'. The basic premise of the explorer corp, on the other hand, is not only believable, but has countless parrallels in current society (think of the migrant workers that we ignore in the name of cheap produce). Society has always found some group to marginalize for its own benifit and there is no reason to think that this will change. The other interesting point of the book is his take on the transparent humans; the idea that being nearly indestructable will lead to stagnant emotional and intellectual development is quite inspired. It is too bad that a book with two basically interesting ideas could end up being a boring read. Ultimately the story line and characters did not catch my interest, and he did not seem to take his foundational premises anywhere. It was a chore to finish. I gave two stars because of the interesting ideas, and because the writing is clear and easy to follow."},{"Title":"EXPENDABLE.","review":"I found this book by luck; it was misplaced on a bookstore shelf. First, I liked the use of a person of color as the protagonist: someone who just happens not to be white. Second, I found the planet Melaquin, and its native inhabitants, uniquely intriguing. The only part I found difficult to buy is her &quot;deformity.&quot; I, too, am a woman with a port-wine stain on my face, and I've never thought of it as a deformity. I've never tried to hide it. Perhaps hers (I can't recall) was over more of her face than mine. Nevertheless, I was sorry to get to the end of the book. It gave me the same kind of strong-woman-on-a-harrowing- adventure-pleasure as the movie &quot;Aliens 2&quot; did. I want more of same."},{"Title":"EXPENDABLE.","review":"Gardner manages several things incredibly well here: a plausible future that does not require too much suspension of disbelief, the point of view of someone who is an outsider to society (something most humans have felt at some time), and and INCREDIBLE command of the female voice. Rarely have I seen characters so lovingly developed."},{"Title":"EXPENDABLE.","review":"THIS A STIRRING SF ADVENTURE THAT PITS A MEMORABLEHEROINE, FESTINA RAMPOS AGAINST A STRANGE ANDDEADLY WORLD WHICH SHE IS STRANDED ON.

For being one of Gardner's first books, its a great one. He tosses around tons of different concepts and ideas with ease. He paints a vivid picture of of a universe in which &quot;The Technocracy&quot; regulates lifeform's behavior by eliminating all of the non-sentients. This in it's self makes for some pretty interesting rules. In this story, the main characters must not only deal with these rules, but also bend them. And the way that happens mixes a recipe that isn't your typical sci-fi fare.Very interesting stuff."},{"Title":"EXPENDABLE.","review":"I loved this book, I needed to take a break from the large quantity of dark fantasy I had been reading and picked up Expendable on the recommendation of Anne Bishop. Boy, am I happy I did it! He is the kind of author who can give you well thought out characters with actual lives and foibles and real humor! Festima is fantastic, she deals with the superficiality of her day with sort of a shrug and a roar. She is not going to be pushed around and she is not going to let them make her disappear... Don't miss this first novel, pick up and thoroughly enjoy it."},{"Title":"EXPENDABLE.","review":"Expendable is the first novel in the League of Peoples series. Festina Ramos is an Explorer, a first-in specialist, who is used to check out unknown worlds; the Explorers call themselves Expendable Crew Members. Ramos has a port-wine colored birthmark covering the right side of her face; in a society that demands perfect appearance, she is an anomaly. Most Explorers have such imperfections; the Explorer Corps is the wastebin of humanity.The League of Peoples have imposed bans on Terrans and other peoples within their jurisdiction. The most dramatic is the ban against the interstellar transportation of persons who have committed homicide. Such people just die as soon as their ship goes into interstellar space and so does everybody who assisted in their transport. Their attitude is: kill each other as much as you desire, but don't export the killers.In this novel, Festina and Yarrun Derigha, her subordinate, are ordered to accompany Admiral Chee to the surface of Melaquin. The orders are a little disconcerting, for Chee is 150 years old with declining mental faculties; in addition, though many Explorers have gone down to the planet's surface, none has ever returned; but, what the heck, Explorers are expendable.When Festina, Yarrun, and their batty Admiral reach the surface, Chee immediately discards his tightsuit and breathes the air. Festina and Yarrun ignore him and start a survey of their surroundings. Nothing dangerous appears on the bumbler, so they start sampling the soil and lifeforms. Suddenly, they notice that the Admiral is no longer with them and is nowhere in sight.This story is a tale of official corruption and unofficial bigotry. The Admiral is a hoot; he has lost almost all his inhibitions and tells it as he sees it. Underneath his cynical remarks, however, works a very shrewd mind.Recommended for anyone who enjoys nitty-gritty yarns of people in a no-win situation."},{"Title":"EXPENDABLE.","review":"This lightweight tale is as somewhat, how should we say, &quot;Restrained&quot; as it's lead character; all characters are lacking in detail and intensity as it's story line is. The entire plot reads more like a juvenile or a comic book, rather than a serious piece of Sci-Fi.Not even close to a personal best for the author, or the genre, but still a fairly good read for late night or a rainy weekend."},{"Title":"EXPENDABLE.","review":"Expendable is a truly remarkable book that grabbed me from the moment I started reading. Gardner's smooth prose and his fully realized protagonist carried the book, even through places where the plot sagged. He did a very nice job of telling the tale through a woman's point of view without sounding ridiculous, as some men do. Festina Ramos is a wonderful character, and I look forward to reading more about her in his other books."},{"Title":"EXPENDABLE.","review":"I have been reading a lot for 45+ years now, and so seldom come across a really unique novel or voice.This is one of them.The plot- while logical in retrospect- kept me guessing; it didn't follow the usual tropes. The characterization was nicely done. The world/universe was coherent and explained, but still holds some mystery. Given all this, I found it to be a page-turner; I could NOT predict what would happen next!This is one of th4e best novels I've read recently."},{"Title":"EXPENDABLE.","review":"I'd read a couple of chapters, and didn't really find it engaging. I set it down, and intended on just returning it. I picked it back up because I'd run out of other books, and decided to stick it out in hopes it'd get better. The premise of the story is good and intriguing, but I found the actual content boring. I felt the main character Festina was very flat and 2-D. It was hard to want to keep hearing from her and thought it would have been better told from another character&iquest;s perspective. Also, while I know the language of Oar was to set the tone of how she learned English, it was overdone. The repetitive cussing dulled its purpose and just made it annoying. Rating - Idea premise: B+, Content: C-; Overall: C."},{"Title":"EXPENDABLE.","review":"This book was so cool. It took me three days to read it and I mostly don't finish novels this long that fast. I would recommend it to anyone who is a hardcore science fiction fan. You won't be disappointed. I wasn't."},{"Title":"EXPENDABLE.","review":"The author lives in Waterloo, Ontario and this is his first novel. He has won a number of awards for his short fiction (including an Aurora). The novel is set in the medium distant future. The main character is an Explorer Corps member (ECM for short). The ECMs are the first to contact new planets and thus have rather shorter career paths than most. ECM is also short for Expendable Crew Member. This is a novel that is humorous while remaining true to it's universe. This is a finely crafted novel, the humour does not overwhelm it. There are circles within circles (of ideas, of plots &amp; characters). Simply FASSinating...

I find that he is definitely a great writer. I believe all of us are ECM's sometimes. . ."},{"Title":"EXPENDABLE.","review":"Ugly because the expendable Explorers are deformed people who are deliberately kept that way, despite 25th century technology. Bad because bad things happen to them. Good because the book is good. Unlike most current sf novels, which try to turn one idea into 600 pages, this book is so rife with ideas and plot twists that they almost come too quickly. Still, it manages to keep its heart with its characters. This makes it among the best of current sf. In fact, it reminds me of why I started reading sf over thirty years ago.

Yay!), it isn't necessary for you to understand how FTL works or YouthBoost...noteven the folks in the story understand it.Festina Ramos, our heroine, is a real person. Not in the sense that she exists in our reality...I don't know if she does or not, nor, in the long run, do I need to. But in this story, she's alive and real and very full of that vitality that makes you care about someone.Read this book. Really. If you like SF. If you like strong, believable characters. If you want to kill a day reading.Just go read it. It's worth it, for whatever you're looking for."},{"Title":"EXPENDABLE.","review":"Fascinating premise and bold execution. The 25th century has a new face in Festina Ramos, the protagonist who is left scarred by a purple birthmark that is not altered so that she can be one of the &quot;expendable&quot; crew members that few will have qualms about sending on missions from which they might not return. This novel is a wonderful debut for Gardner and shows tremendous skill in a tale well told and presenting ideas of grandiose speculation. There have been plenty of tales told from the &quot;outsider's&quot; perspective, but none quite like this -- and there are all kinds of social parallels that reflect on our society today. A nice balance of science, humor, and drama gradually reveal levels of depth within the ranks of the ECMs (Expendable Crew Members), the benevolent (and dictatorial) League of Peoples and the humans governmental structure"},{"Title":"EXPENDABLE.","review":"Expendable is based on a wacky and to my mind thoroughly implausible premise: that the morale of spaceship crews would be thoroughly undermined if quote normal unquote people were to die while exploring hostile planets. However, if abnormal, deformed, people die, nobody will much care. Those people are, see, expendable. Thus the Explorer Corps in James Alan Gardner's future space Navy is made up of people with defects, such as the port wine birthmark disfiguring the face of this book's narrator Festina Ramos. These people are so useful to the Navy, mind, that conditions such as Festina's, which could be easily fixed by future medicine, are purposely left untreated.That's a lot to swallow, and frankly I can't, really. But once you get past the absurd premise, the story told in Expendable is imaginative and fun. The other odd premise of Gardner's future is that very advanced aliens control the Galaxy with one law: that noone who would kill another sentient creature can travel in space. But people look for loopholes, and one seems to be to send unwanted sorts to dangerous planets to explore them. Festina and her partner are assigned to accompany an old Admiral, who has become a thorn in the side of the leaders of the human people, to a legendary dangerous planet, from which no Explorer has ever returned.When they get there, they find that the planet is implausibly similar to Earth in its conditions: gravity, atmosphere, climate, etc. Sent to the surface, they don't die immediately, as they've expected, but their means of return is withdrawn. Soon the mysteries begin to mount. Festina encounters a strange person apparently made of glass, and that person takes her to a city made of glass. It becomes apparent that there are several such cities on the planet, occupied by the immortal glass people, and by the previously marooned explorers. Is there any way back to the civilized Galaxy?This is fast-moving, fun, adventure, with some wild ideas. Some of the ideas are pretty neat, and some are frankly silly. The plot is similarly inconsistent. It's worth reading, and the sequels (Vigilant and Hunted) are even better."},{"Title":"EXPENDABLE.","review":"It's been scientifically proven that attractive people have more advantages than unattractive people. By that, I mean more superficial advantages. I remember in a psychology class of mine that in a criminal trial, a jury is more likely to believe an attractive witness that an unattractive one. Good looking adolescents, male or female, are treated better by their peers than ones they find ugly. I'm sure everyone has seen an incident in their life where someone was treated a certain way simply because of their appearance, whether it was negative or positive. Whether we like it or not, we base a lot of our opinions simply on appearance. It just makes it easier to process the world around us.James Alan Gardner takes this and runs with it. In the 25th century, death has become a rare occurence. This has to do with medical techonology and also the fact that murder is outlawed by a race of omnipotent beings called the League of Peoples. They can even sense the intent to murder. If you commit murder you are considered non-sentient and are sentenced to death yourself. I don't know if that quite makes sense? Anyway, death has become so rare that humans are reluctant to be put in dangerous situations such as being the first explorers to a new planet.It is stumbled upon by the Admiralty (those in charge of space travel) that when people who are seen as outcasts die nobody cares. It's only when an attractive person dies that it's seen as traumatic. I forgot that humans are genetically altered to be perfect. So when babies are born that have physical defects they are considered automatic candidates for the Explorer Corps. Its members call themselves ECMs--Expendable Crew Members.Explorers Festina Ramos and her partner Yarrun Derigha are ordered to escort an important dignitary named Admiral Chee to a planet called Melaquin. The higher ups think that an Admiral will be able to help them in their exploration. What's really going on is that no Explorer has touched down on Melaquin and returned. Within minutes of their arrival all communication is cut off and they are presumed dead. Rumor has it that the planet is merely a garbage heap where undesirables are sent to die. Admiral Chee happens to be one of those undesirables.I really liked this book. It's really impressive and more so because it's the first novel by Gardner. The only thing that bugged me sometimes was the Beavis and Butthead attitude towards sex that surfaces in the book, especially in the beginning. The hyperspace field that surrounds spaceships is like a white comet so it is referred to as sperm. When a tunnel is formed for transportation and human beings shoot out of it, you can guess the verb used to describe it. It just struck me as very immature Henry Miller. Once he gets over these little obsessive crudities the author can write quite well. The system based on physical apperance resonates with our generation where young girls starve themselves to look like this months starved looking model on Vogue. We are a nation of idolaters.Check this book out for a good swift read."},{"Title":"EXPENDABLE.","review":"This book has a clever plot, a clever story and is very, very witty. The book consists of sections of one or two pages, at most, which simultaneously tell the story, give insight on how the main character thinks, and provide a witticism of some sort. At first it annoyed me, as I prefer a more continuous prose, and the witticisms were making it hard for me to concentrate on the story. :-) But this book is so good that this soon ceased to be of any importance.This is very good science fiction. If you like science fiction in general, you'll like this book."},{"Title":"EXPENDABLE.","review":"This is a great little read. A fast paced book told in small chapters. It raises many questions about our society. Do we need &quot;different&quot; people to keep society alive? Does society stagnate when it is comfortable? Do deformed people have an individuality and strength that makes them more resourceful? Do we mourn the passing of ugly people less than the passing of beautiful people?Picture yourself being dumped on a planet, alone and virtually unarmed, in the certain knowledge that all who went before have disappeared off the face of the universe.

Those on the frontline of this effort are the Explorers. Explorers are those individuals are have been deemed to be of normal or above-normal intelligence but have a crucial flaw...they are, in one form or another, disfigured. As such they are deemed Expending Crew Members (ECMs) and are the vanguard of humanity's effort to contact alien life...in other words, they get sent into all the really dangerous first-contact situations. Festina Ramos is an Explorer (and an ECM), she has a large red birthmark covering an entire side of her face. Along with her partner Yarrun, she has been assigned to lead a mission escorting the flamboyant Admiral Chee to the planet Melaquin. Over the course of the last 50 years dozens of Explorers have disappeared on Melaquin and Ramos (along with Yarrun and Chee) has been sent to figure out why.After a fairly slow, start, Expendable picks up its pace. The natives on Melaquin are...a very interesting idea. I'd hate to spoil anything here...so let me just say the natives have unique properties that make them a really creative idea on Mr. Gardner's part.As for what happened to the previous Explorers that were sent to Melaquin, that was kind of formulaic...but I enjoyed the story nonetheless. Also, I'd really like another book with much more detail given on the League of Peoples...the background alien federation/conglomeration that gave humanity much of its sophisticated technology with which they now use to explore the stars.Overall, I'd definitely read more of Mr. Gardner's works...while Expendable hardly falls into the category of great literature, it is an enjoyable story with some really interesting ideas."},{"Title":"EXPENDABLE.","review":"The League of Peoples keeps an eye on all species. There is no war, little crime, and life is sacred ... unless you are an Explorer. Humans' morale takes a sharp nose dive if someone beautiful and loved dies. Therefore, the Human race takes those among themselves who are considered to be the misfits, the deformed, the ugly, the flawed, and trains them to be ECMs (Expendable Crew Members).Festina Ramos has a red birthmark that covers one side of her face. She belongs to the well-trained, always-dwindling ranks of the ECMs. Her partner is Yarrun Derigha. They are ordered by the High Council to escort the mentally unstable Admiral Chee to Melaquin. All information about Melaquin is classified. The only thing publically known is that it seems to be a duplicate planet of Old Earth. Everyone who has ever went to Melaquin has disappeared. No one seems to know why. But once or twice a year, a small party of ECMs is sent to investigate.Of course, this is meant to be the LAST mission for Festina and Yarrun. But Festina has other ideas.***** Excellent! James Alan Gardner brought all the characters to life, especially Festina! This is one of the best sci-fi books I have read this year. This novel came out in 1997. It was the author's debut novel. However, it is so hard for me to believe this was his first!This story was written to stand alone. A second novel of this type was not even considered by the author (per his short interview with SFBC). Indeed, James Alan Gardner went on to write other books. But so many readers cried out to him and his publisher for more about the ECMs that the author finally broke down. Therefore, this year (2004) a second ECM novel came out titled \\"Radiant\\" (Review forthcoming.) Sci-Fi fans should not miss out on this fabulous story! *****Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews."},{"Title":"EXPENDABLE.","review":"Explorer Festina Ramos, her partner and a crazy Admiral are all exiled to the planet-of-no-return. They are expendable because they are ugly or freaks. I have to admit I had somewhat expected a comedy with this novel, and while it does raise the odd mild laugh in the end its not a really memorable novel or one that I really want to keep.Somehow Festina and her woes of being exiled fail to raise a great deal of tension. Her problems turn out to mostly reasonably easily solved and the book slides by like a bland desert. I know that there are other books in this series, but I have to say that this first instalment does not make me inclined to seek them out."},{"Title":"EXPENDABLE.","review":"I've read a lot of Hugo and Nebula award winners lately but this non-award winner is one of the best SF books I have read.

As usual, he is skilled not only in making science concepts comprehensible but bringing into vivid detail the *story* of science -- how we know what we know. It even includes the occasional philosophical discussion.So why the low rating? Because this book is twenty years old. I had assumed that the reprint would maybe have some updated material, but it doesn't. This is effectively a book on the State of Cosmology circa 1983.Don't waste your money on this. Ferris's own Whole Shebang is better written and more up to date. You might also check out Lonely Hearts of the Cosmos, which is a very similar book but far better and has been updatee for the most recent discoveries. Bill Bryson's Brief History of Nearly Everything only covers cosmology in basic detail, but is also far more up-to-date."},{"Title":"The Red Limit","review":"A great review of the discovery of the expanding universe; the science is interesting and understandable for the lay person. Even more compelling is the drama of the scientists themselves, there life, personalities,strengths, foibles and their wonderful discoveries.

NobleThe Red Limit is a fascinating cosmological exploration. This is the second time I have read this book. It is the perfect book for the non-scientist. I have no background in science but like to make an attempt to know what is going on in the science of the universe.Cosmology and astrophysics are truly out of my category. But because of writers like Timothy Ferris I am able to jump right in and swim around. This man is a find for me. I will be reading more of his works in the future.In this book the author takes us through the various scientists and their insights that have brought us to the theoretical evaluations that are most prevalent today in regards to the universe. How our Universe may have begun and how many have come to the conclusion that it is growing and expanding.We learn about the instruments, the telescopes, the mirrors and lenses. We learn about the craftsmen and inventers involved. We learn about the astronomers, and the astrophysicists and how and why they have made their determinations.Timothy Ferris is a writer, a teacher, a journalist and a professor. This is a difficult subject for me but Professor Ferris's ability with words made everything easy and simple. There is nothing covered in this book that I did not understand. Or maybe I should say, there was nothing by way of Mr. Ferris' explanations of these complicated processes and happenings that I did not feel I was provided with insight and some modicum of understanding of these notions that are truly \\"way out there.\\" I feel now that I have some basis on which to move forward.Personally I am extremely dubious of this whole Big Bang notion and the interpretation of Mr. Hubble's discovery - as was he, I find noted in the text. But since these are the prevailing thoughts on this subject I am very happy to find an author who can explain to the likes of one like me what is thought to be going on.The author writes clearly an intelligibly. His explanations are cogent and concise.I have tried other science writers but to this point this man is the best.

Ferris tells the story of the development of the various theories surrounding cosmology the development of the universe. As such he does spend a lot of time talking about theories which were later proved incorrect. Periodically while reading the book I did find myself checking out various things on the internet in order to see what the final result would be.He covers things like the debates on whether the universe contains one galaxy or many, how the big bang theory was developed, the discoveries of things like cephiad variable stars, the galactic red shift, and background microwave radiation that led to a better understanding of the universe. He also covers some of the great scientific debates, like the one about uncertainty between Einstein and Heisenberg.I found the book to be very readable and informative. The only reason it's not 5 stars is that it is somewhat dated. However, as it is not really a book about science, but a book about the history of science, its dated nature doesn't detract from its overall narrative.

Shortly after my son was born I began looking for audio novels which would allow me to share my passion of astronomy, physics and astrophysics with my then six month old son, The Red Limit: The Search for the Edge of the Universe, was perfect meeting all the criteria. Timothy Ferris also gets top marks for announciation, his speaking is very clear and easy to understand. It is because of his outstanding work that I decided to purchase his other audio novels, The Whole Shebang and Coming of Age in the Milky Way.That was 11 months ago. All of Timothy Ferris audio novels turned out to be excellent with a high standard of quality in production. What started off as a casual experiment with audio bedtime stories for my son has now become firmly entrenched as a nightly event. My son now 18 months old, has moved onto the Richard Feyman Physics audio lectures which are also carried by Amazon.I would like to encourage Timothy Ferris to continue produce more of these types of edutainment audio programs on tape or CD. I love listening to scientific books on my way to work and also love to share them with my 18 month old son as his bedtime stories. In addition to the content, the high level of clear announciation in the Timothy Ferris work is great, it really helps my son to learn new words, concepts and the organization of the english language. More than he would ever obtain in normal everyday speech.I would love to see the following subjects abrigded to audio for distribution through Amazon.com. Maths, sciences, physics, astrophysics, geology, any and all space related topics, gravity, unified field theory, electromagnetics, electronics, microproccessor design, optics, micro-optics, electro-optics, light and the theory there of, satellites, satellite orbital mechanics and related theory, engineering, chemical engineering, civil engineering, electrical engineering.I do not have time in my busy daily schedule to read very much, but do I have five hours a day to listen and learn.If you make it I will support it.Arnold D Veness"},{"Title":"Church Mice at Christmas (Church Mice at Christmas A142 Paper)","review":"Another classic story by author/artist Graham Oakley.

This is such a book. The story is of a young Israelite girl named Achsah, who is the only daughter of a high leader of the tribe of Judah, Caleb.We are told at the beginning of the story some of the traditions of the Jewish people, such as the Father always chooses a husband for his daughter, this does not set well with young Achsah.Achsah is a strong willed girl, not wanting to be told whom she will spend the rest of her life with, as is the custom. The author takes you into the heart of young Achsah as she battles with her emotions of loyalty to her father, her God and the traditions of their faith. Will she be able to submit to these traditions and still find the happiness she believes belongs to her? You become entwined in her mind as she comes to terms with her destiny. It is a tender story, carefully written with respect for the history it is based on, yet full of adventure and drama. A taste of the past flavored with emotions felt in the present, very good mix.Unveiling during the conquest of Canaan, the work allows you to experience the victories and defeats of these chosen people, taste a little of their rebellion and understand a great deal of their faith, as young Achsah blooms into a woman and takes her place in the land of promise.A very good read! Thumbs up on this one!"},{"Title":"Caleb's Daughter","review":"The Bible tells us that \\"Caleb said, He that smiteth Kirjathsepher, and taketh it, to him will I give Achsah my daughter to wife. And Othniel the son of Kenaz, the brother of Caleb, took it: and he gave him Achsah his daughter to wife. And it came to pass, as she came unto him, that she moved him to ask of her father a field: and she lighted off her ass; and Caleb said unto her, What wouldest thou? Who answered, Give me a blessing: for thou hast given me a south land; give me also springs of water. And he gave her the upper springs, and the nether springs.\\" (Joshua 15:116-19)This is all we know of Caleb's daughter. But in the long and recently re-popularized tradition of Midrash, Kay Flowers has taken it upon herself to tell the rest of the story. Her novel begins in the days before the Hebrews entered the Promised Land, and it spans many years until the death of Othniel, judge of Israel. The book focuses on Caleb's daughter Achsah, a headstrong young woman who finds herself the center of a romantic conflict.The work has several good descriptions, and it is certainly more true to the spirit of the Bible than, say, a novel like The Red Tent. Flowers fills in the empty spaces in the biblical narrative without insisting on contradicting its central teachings. The narrative method of the author, however, is at times didactic, and there is on the whole too much telling and not enough showing. Consequently, the book is occasionally uninteresting. The work, however, does address important themes, such as romantic vs. mature love and personal vs. communal/traditional faith."},{"Title":"Caleb's Daughter","review":"Books like THE RED TENT have sparked an interest in works based in Biblical settings that focus on women rather than their famous male leaders. Kay Flowers has chosen to focus her novella on the years just before and those that followed the entry of the Children of Israel into their land of milk and honey. Her protagonist, Achsah, is the only daughter of Caleb, one of Moses's greatest generals.The child of Caleb's middle age, Achsah is not surprisingly more than a little spoiled. Throughout many of her early years, she is determined to have her own way, by manipulation and stealth when direct means fail-those direct means usually entailing a tantrum of one degree or another.As time and life take their toll, however, Achsah comes not just to maturity but to a deep faith in the god of Israel, a faith that sustains her when tragedy and danger impinge.Although clearly the work of a talented storyteller and likely to appeal greatly to younger readers, the unfortunate brevity of Ms. Flowers's work leaves the reader, especially one who has an interest in the historical and cultural background, feeling unsatisfied. One closes the book with the sense it was meant more as a morality tale than an historical one, a lesson in the importance of faith and in caring for others. The plot evolves as a series of episodes in Achsah's life, beginning with her as a young child and ending with her in the twilight years. Once she has had her moment of epiphany, what follows is little more than a denouement that goes on too long.The author's attempt to justify the slaughter of innocents-according to the messages delivered from God via Moses and Joshua, the Israelites were to exterminate everyone living in their \\"promised land\\"-also lacks force. No matter how perverse the Canaanites' religious and social practices may have been, the killing of children simply doesn't quite fit with the concept of an all-loving god, and one senses the author wrestling with that issue, unable to avoid it yet unable to adequately deal with it, either.Nevertheless, CALEB'S DAUGHTER is an excellent choice for young readers both for its nicely drawn details of the Israelite culture and the subtle lesson it contains. Christian parents looking for first-class reading material for their older middle-schoolers and younger teens will find it an excellent addition to their libraries."},{"Title":"Restless Giant: The United States from Watergate to Bush vs. Gore (Oxford History of the United States)","review":"Patterson organizes this history around the various US Presidents from 1974-2001. The book primarily considers social and cultural issues in the context of their impact on these Presidents and how these latter developped policies accordingly. As a result, it is primarily a political history and only tangentially a cultural or social history.That said, the plumline running through the domestic agenda of all presidencies in this period was the cultural wars between progressives and conservatives. The former camp were liberals, leftists, minorities, immigrants,women, gays, who emerged more powerful from the 60s revolution etc; in the conservative campwere fundamentalists, corporate leaders, old-schoolers, who viewed the 1950s as a Golden Age or felt threatened by the rising tide of feminism and multiculturalism. This \\"Tale of Two Countries\\" is complicated by the Me Generation that emerged in the 1970s: those people who, on the one hand, had abandoned traditional mores like their precursors in the 60s, yet also abandones the ideals of that period, prefering to pursue bourgeois, consumeristic lifestyles.It is also the tale of American foreign policy during the Cold War and the post-Soviet world. The author does not examine the details of American foreign policy, only at how the influence they had on the political scene in America. The book does not include a discussion of the Military-Industrial complex and its role in policy making. In fact, very little mention is given to the role of lobbyists or the mediatization of politics.We are also given almost no clue about intellectual life in America as such. Perhaps that is in some ways appropriate. American politics is rather devoid of intellectual content, being primarily pragmatic and populist. If those traits have saved Americans from the dogma of many modern \\"isms\\", it also makes them more vulnerable to opportunistic jingoism, especially when combined with modern marketing techniques and the media.In any case, it would be unfair to disparage \\"Restless Giant\\" due to its superficial treatment of some subjects or absence of discussion of others. After all, one can only fit so much into a popular contemporary history of 400 pages. The author remedies this by including a detailed bibliography, providing the interested reader with sources for further study. Patterson is to be commended for attempting to be fair, providing several perspectives on a given issue. Finally, as one who lived through all of the epochs covered in the book, it is entertaining/informative to look at the events of this book which are distant enough to allow some objectivity and near enough as to allow me to discern their direct impact on my life."},{"Title":"Restless Giant: The United States from Watergate to Bush vs. Gore (Oxford History of the United States)","review":"Patterson does a fine job of presenting the 26 years between watergate and Bush v Gore but only scratches the surface of the underlying stories that were there. I believe he does not sufficiently cover the dramatic effect Watergate had on the executive branch of government. It empowered the legislative and judiciary branches more than they should have ever been, ever intended by the Constitution. It caused the Presidents that followed to be less-endowed with the executive powers they were intended to have and made the word &#34;-gate&#34; into a suffix that described every stumble an executive encountered. It made the American public too distrustful of our leaders, granted it was a failure of great magnitude, but we have since graded any political individual warily."},{"Title":"Restless Giant: The United States from Watergate to Bush vs. Gore (Oxford History of the United States)","review":"I found the two books by Patterson, Grand Expectations and Restless Giant, to be the two weakest of the series.

I have enjoyed this series tremendously and this book doesn't disappoint. For a very quick reminder of the Ford administration to the beginning of George W. Bush's time, you can't go wrong reading this one."},{"Title":"Restless Giant: The United States from Watergate to Bush vs. Gore (Oxford History of the United States)","review":"An interesting thing, the Oxford History of the United States is. Almost three decades after the first volume, only four volumes have yet to follow, covering less then half of the United States' existence.The individual books vary in quality. Previous volumes included two of the best written history books, Pulitzer-prize winning tombs by James McPherson (on the Civil War Era) and David Kennedy (on the Great Depression and the Civil War). But the series also featured an unreadable, messy account of the American Revolution (by Robert Middlekauf), and the previous book by James T Patterson, which I haven't read.Patterson's Restless Giant, his follow up to \`Great Expectations' is an overall entertaining and informative book. It is hampered by a few problems that are inherent, and a few that are the author's in making.First, the period of time Patterson gets 1974-2000, is odd. The subtitle is \\"From Watergate to Bush v. Gore\\", but there is very little that connects these two scandals, and very few events that spanned these years alone. The editors of the series should have taken the well traveled road, and closed the volume with the end of the Cold War.The second problem is one of perspective. We are simply too close to most of the events, particularly those of the 1990s, to get an objective view about them. The great majority of the actors in Patterson's drama were still alive while he wrote about them, and most were still politically active. Virtually everything that was written about the events served implicitly or explicitly some political agenda. Objectivity is very hard to find.The third problem is that the 1970s, 80s and 90s are simply not as inherently interesting as the Civil War and World War 2 eras. That's not to say that there were dull - far from it - but the inherent drama of the struggles for civilizations that Lincoln and Roosevelt had to confront makes better reading then the less-than-heroic attempts by Reagan to disguise his \\"Robin Hood in reverse\\" policies with Patriotic rhetoric.Patterson's books starts off weak, with long confused chapters about the 1970s. In these early chapters, Patterson doesn't so much narrate as lists: economic statistics, crime rates statistics, political scandals, foreign policy adventures. Compare Patterson's short, matter-of-fact description of the Iranian Hostage Crisis (126-27), with James McPherson's account of John Brown's Harper Ferry raid in \\"Battle Cry of Freedom\\". I doubt Brown's attack was any less consequential then the Iranian crisis, which contributed to Carter's downfall, marked the first confrontation between the US and the Radical new regime of Iran, raised anti-Americanism in the Muslim world and marked the first outright failure of American Foreign Policy in the Middle East.Things get better when Patterson comes to the 1980s, and particularly to Ronald Reagan. Reagan's colorful personality and bizarre politics characterized the US more then most presidents, and Patterson's description of him and his age is quite effective. Still, there is a lot to quiver with: Although Patterson doesn't ignore Reagan's role in the Cold War, his discussion is quite shallow. Patterson hardly addresses the transformation of Conservative thought, and the slow emergent of neo-conservatives, either during the Reagan administration or in the 1990s; Jeanne Kirkpatrick and her seminal paper about \\"Dictatorships and Double standards\\" aren't even mentioned. This is like writing about the origin of the Cold War and ignoring George Kennan.Unlike Kennedy and McPherson who used first rate economic analysis, Patterson's economic information is not really sound. His even handed approach toward Supply Side Economics, resembles \\"He said, she said\\" journalism of the worst kind. The great change of the 1990s - the rise in Productivity Growth - is barely mentioned, and Patterson's analysis of the North American Free Trade Area (NAFTA) is not very deep.In reading about the administration of George H W. Bush, one is struck by how efficient and effective his rule was; Unlike his son, Bush pere worked with Democrats, balanced the budget, and led a careful and masterful foreign policy, including a successful war in Iraq. Although Bush's abandonment of the Kurds must be held against him, it would be a shame if his very real triumphs would be overshadowed by the disastrous presidency of his son.Patterson's account of the 1990s suffers from some of the same problems as his discussion of the 1970s. Again featuring a \\"kitchen sink\\" of cultural, political, demographical, legal and economic data, it's rather messy. Patterson also exposes his cultural biases in his tirades against violent movies (such as Tarantino's brilliant \\"Pulp Fiction\\") and downplays, even if he doesn't ignore, the development of the internet (Microsoft gets all of two mentions. Napster gets none). The discussions of the Clinton persecutions and the OJ Simpson trial fail to raise any new insights, and I doubt many current readers would find them very illuminating. With the passage of time, though, new generations of readers, who may be less familiar with these developments, may find here a useful primer.Ultimately, it's hard to view the decades covered by \`Restless Giant' objectively. A future historian might focus more on the rising of the Neo-Conservative movement, or on the cracks inside the seemingly uniform Fundamentalist Christian coalition. She may locate the first signs for a Muslim movement in America, and of a new wave of religious extremism (as in the spooky \`Jesus Camp' documentary I just watched). She may discuss the rise of Protectionism and anti-Immigration movements. Hopefully, she may single out the emergence of a new center, committed to the best values in both the Democratic and the Republican traditions: Balanced Budgets and Welfare for the poor, Free Trade and Civil Rights, Separation of Powers and of Church and State, and a sane, idealistic yet realistic foreign policy. The administrations of Bush the father and of Bill Clinton took steps (however hesitant and at times misguided) in the right direction. For America's sake, and for the World's, let's hope that America returns to that path."},{"Title":"Restless Giant: The United States from Watergate to Bush vs. Gore (Oxford History of the United States)","review":"My final stop on my march through the ages is James T. Patterson's Restless Giant. This volume has a very different feel from both Patterson's previous bookGrand Expectations: The United States, 1945-1974 (Oxford History of the United States)and from the Oxford series in general. This book is more upbeat than the previous; this could be due to the material. Grand Expectations leaves you a little emotionally down in a reflection of the disappointment of the time period. In contrast, Restless Giant is written with the optimism of the 1980s and 1990s, where America, in winning the Cold War, seemed as if it were invincible. The title of the book is a clear spin of one Admiral Yamamoto's statement of America being a sleeping giant that he had awakened by attacking Pearl Harbor. This book is also very different from the rest of the Oxford series because, unlike the earlier volumes, this book is features an era that I actually lived through. I was born in 1981, so my life begins basically in chapter 5 and the rest of the book covers the events of my youth.The story begins in the 1970s in the aftermath of Watergate, Patterson does his best to uncover this brief little era, in which a public first supports President Gerald Ford but begins to soar towards him in as he pardons his dishonored predecessor. Ford finds himself replaced with the humorless Jimmy Carter, who in turn presides over one of the worst economies since the 1930s. In keeping the tradition of the series, Patterson explores this era from all sides. He tells the story of the ordinary people, the social trends, new gadgets, and entertainment that the people enjoyed. It is a decade I am glad to have just missed.The 1980s and my life begin with Ronald Reagan having vanquished Jimmy Carter in the 1980 election, ushered in a new conservative era. Although Patterson points out that even though conservative politics were becoming popular it was hardly a triumph equal to the liberals in 1932. The Democrats still held the House and Reagan while eager to pay lip-service to conservative domestic polices, he was not that interested in promoting them. Reagan chose instead to focus mainly on U.S. foreign policy. Reagan's foreign policy would be credited with winning the Cold War for the United States. Patterson also discusses horrors of the era, such as, the coming of the AIDS epidemic, and some the lighter moments such as the beginning of MTV.\\"Reagan, moreover, was not so doctrinaire a conservative as liberals made out. While fond of damning big government--and of denunciations of 'welfare queens'--he recognized that liberal interest groups had effective lobbies on the Hill, that major New Deal--Great Society social programs--many of them entitlements--were here to stay, and the rights-consciousness had become a powerful political force. He understood that though people said they distrusted government, they expected important services from it.\\"(p.163)The chapter covering the era of George H.W. Bush is known simply as 'Bush 41'. There is a strong argument to be made that of all the presidents to be featured in this book he was the most successful. Unfortunately, he will never be look at in that regard because he is cursed as a one-termer in his lost Bill Clinton in 1992. Although he had 'neo-cons' in his administration, the first President Bush was not as dominated by those view points as his son would be over a decade later.Patterson begins to cover the nineties, which saw the end of the Industrial Age and the beginning of the Information Age. As the first baby boomer to assume the presidency, Bill Clinton gave Americans the impression that they once again had a very young Kennedy like president. Like Kennedy, he makes a lot of errors and also has his triumphs. And also like Kennedy, Patterson covers more of the former than the later. Nevertheless, I feel that Patterson gives Clinton a fair treatment.\\"Extraordinarily well informed about domestic issues, Clinton had impressed many party leaders when he headed the Progressive Policy Institute, a think tank that blossomed after 1989 within the ideologically centrist Democratic Leadership Council. Like a great many boomers, he liberal positions on a range of social issues such as abortion and health care, but though he had the populist touch of a campaigner, he did not position himself of the left. A moderate as governor, he distanced himself as a presidential candidate from liberals like Mondale and Dukakis, who had been badly beaten in 1984 and 1988.\\" p.248I was a teenager in the 1990s and my political options were beginning to form. So reading about the Clinton years was like reliving my youth in a way. Of the course the news that dominated the headlines was the Monica Lewinsky affair and the unjustified impeachment of President Clinton by his relentless partisan opponents. Clinton's behavior brought on a lot of his own misery, but his opponents' behavior was worse because they attacked not only Bill Clinton politically, but the office the President as an institution. Clinton in standing up to these attacks, I believe, ended a deterioration of power that had been chipping at the presidency since Nixon resigned*.\\"If Clinton's near-legendary luck had held out--as it might have done if he had been chief executive during pre-Watergate days when reporters had turned a relatively blind eye to the promiscuity of politicians--he would have joined a number of American presidents who had engaged in extramarital relations without being publicly exposed while in office.\\"(p.388)The book ends with the controversial election of President George W. Bush over Vice President Al Gore. The first election that I ever voted in was one that was finished by the United States Supreme Court. I was very disappointed the time because I thought the election was outright stolen. I now, in agreeing with Patterson but having this opinion before, feel that the election had instead just fallen off a bus. (I have often thought about what might have been.)Before ending I have to talk about this one part of a paragraph in chapter 8--the chapter that deals with the culture wars of the 1990s:\\"Though many publishers and bookshops struggled to break even, fiction by highly talented authors--Toni Morrison, Alice Munro, Anne Tyler, Richard Ford, John Updike, and others with smaller name recognition--sold well. So did excellently researched works of non-fiction. James McPherson's prize winning Battle Cry for Freedom (1988), a history of the Civil War era enjoyed huge sales.\\" (p.288)NowBattle Cry of Freedom: The Civil War Era (Oxford History of the United States), I believe I both read and reviewed that book. If memory serves that is the Civil War volume of the Oxford History of the United States series, which is the same series as this very book! David Kennedy, the current editor, must have yelled out 'GO TEAM' when he read those words.All in all, this is a great book. It is interesting reading events that took place in your own life as actually history. I strongly recommend this book to anyone who wishes to know more about the time decades preceding the attacks of September 11."},{"Title":"Restless Giant: The United States from Watergate to Bush vs. Gore (Oxford History of the United States)","review":"Restless Giant, By James Patterson, is a sweeping social/political and economic history of life in the United States from the end of the Watergate scandal to the controversial election of 2000. It is another component in the Oxford History of the United States series.Patterson ties together modern history in a precise way. His prose is even and interesting. Though many of the subjects are extremely familiar, his even handed treatment and conclusions are clear. This is a very excellent one-volume summation of our modern times."},{"Title":"Restless Giant: The United States from Watergate to Bush vs. Gore (Oxford History of the United States)","review":"There are thousands of books available on American History, some with narrow focus, some painting broad pictures. Based on my sampling of these books over the years, I have found that no series has provided a better overall history than the Oxford History of the United States. The only flaw in this series is that it is only being slowly produced, with only five volumes thus far (with around a dozen or so projected).Chronologically, Restless Giant is the last in the series, covering the years 1974 to 2000, or essentially, Watergate to the Bush-Gore election. This is a rough period to write a history of for a couple reasons. For one thing, it is too recent to get any sort of historical perspective; the detachment that time provides is not there (for example, the 2000 election is still the source of debate, with people on one side or the other about who really won). In addition, while this was an eventful era, it lacks that single event that defines it. For example, previous books focused on the Revolution (The Glorious Cause), the Civil War (Battle Cry of Freedom) and the Great Depression and World War II (Freedom from Fear). Only Grand Expectations (also written by James Patterson) is also lacking the single, focusing event in its history of 1945 to 1974.But as Grand Expectations proved, however, Patterson is good at overcoming these issues to write a book that is both informative and entertaining. Restless Giant is similarly high quality. The primary topic is political, and a good portion of the book deals with the various Presidential administrations during these two-and-a-half decades, but Patterson goes further to discuss various social trends.With politics being so important, we see the many conflicts between left and right. Generally, this was an era of conservative ascendancy, starting with the post-Watergate nadir of the G.O.P., Reagan/Bush in the middle of the period, the \\"Republican Revolution\\" of the mid-1990s, and, of course, Bush 43's controversial elevation to the top office in 2001. Of course, this is similarly a period of decline for liberalism and the remnants of the New Deal. Is this a good or bad thing? Patterson remains objective enough to provide no real answers; he is critical enough of both right and left to provide ammunition for either side.Of course, in a 400+ page book, there are going to be a lot of things missed, but Patterson catches most of the important things. All in all, this is another top-notch volume in the Oxford series."},{"Title":"Restless Giant: The United States from Watergate to Bush vs. Gore (Oxford History of the United States)","review":"About a decade ago, Patterson published an excellent survey, Grand Expectations, of the postwar years from the end of WWII to Nixon's resignation. He now follows Grand Expectations with a fine book covering the period from Nixon's resignation to the election of 2000. One of the major themes of Grand Expectations was the sense felt by many Americans that life would bring them increasing prosperity, freedom, and American power. A second major theme was the so-called Rights Revolution, the great expansion of individual rights that occurred with the Civil Rights movement and allied phenomena. These themes continue in Restless Giant. In the present book, Patterson follows the ups and downs of Americans' expectations regarding their lives and the direction of the nation. A recurring theme is that despite continued economic expansion and the considerable successes of American society, the last generation has seen persistent anxiety about the prospects of Americans as individuals and America as a society. Patterson also shows the continuing evolution and success of the Rights Revolution. This revolution consists not only of the expansion of perceived rights but also of a variety of Federally sanctioned entitlements accompanying them. Over the last 50 years, the expansion of rights and entitlements has included a substantial waning of anti-Semitic and anti-Catholic prejuidice, the guarantee of legal and civil equality for African-Americans and other ethnic minorities, the emergence of disability rights, the increasing equality of woment, and even a gradual though grudging acceptance of homosexuality. An important part of the book covers the rise of Republican conservatism. Patterson shows well that despite the considerable political success of this movement, it has succeeded only in perhaps slowing the Rights Revolution but not reversing it. In one of his rare astute comments, the conservative journalist George Will once wrote that, \\"Americans are conservative but they want the New Deal.\\" It would be more correct to say that Americans are conservative but they want the Rights Revolution and its accompanying entitlements.Patterson organizes this book by alternating chapters giving social history with chapters on political history, using Presidential terms and the experiences of each administration. This works quite well and Patterson is quite evenhanded in his treatment of controversial issues. Reading these chapters will bring back memories for many readers, some of whom may be surprised by what they find. For example, most people today will think of Jimmy Carter as a leftist democrat. Patterson shows President Carter as relative moderate who preferred fiscal restraint, who appointed Paul Volcker as Fed Chairman with the knowledge that he would aggressively pursue deflationary policies, and whose foreign policy in the last 2 years of his administration anticipates some of the Reagan policies. Indeed, Carter in some respects was tougher than Reagan as he embargoed grain sales which the Reagan administration would later permit.Patterson is a very good writer and the narrative and analysis flow smoothly. Despite its considerable virtues, this book has some minor defects. Patterson does quite a good job on social history but could have covered more economic history. He appropriately cites a lot of statistics but this always done in the text. Patterson, like many historians, doesn't seem comfortable presenting this type of data in charts or graphs which often make looking at this type of data easier. In discussing events and personalities, Patterson is perhaps too evenhanded. In discussing individual presidents, for example, he often says things like, \\"Reagan's critics said...\\", rather than presenting a judgement. But, for many of these events and person it is possible to render judgements. If Gerald Ford and Bush 1 are underestimated, as implied by the narrative, why not say so? It should be possible to make a reasonable judgement about Reagan's role in the end of the Cold War rather than avoid the issue. Its a shame that someone with Patterson's perspective and depth of knowledge isn't more willing to make critical statements. While he describes nicely the success of conservative Republicanism in electoral politics, he doesn't deal well with the fact that Republicans largely abandoned their conservative principles about the size and role of the Federal government and become a vehicle for business group lobbying, a phenomena that the political scientist Theodore Lowi called interest group conservatism.Finally, its impossible to read this book, with its extensive and fair descriptions of our recent Presidents, and not think about the performance of our present President, Bush 2. Even compared with Presidents who came to power in unpropitious circumstances or committed serious self-inflicted wounds like Clinton and Reagan, Bush 2 comes off poorly in terms of leadership and vision."},{"Title":"Restless Giant: The United States from Watergate to Bush vs. Gore (Oxford History of the United States)","review":"This series is generally excellent, but Patterson's effort here drifts off into more sociology than history. He predictably dislikes Nixon like 99.5% of academics. This volume was something of a disappointment."},{"Title":"Restless Giant: The United States from Watergate to Bush vs. Gore (Oxford History of the United States)","review":"The value was diminished by the fact the book had no dust jacket.

Otherwise, satisfied as a good reference for this time period."},{"Title":"Restless Giant: The United States from Watergate to Bush vs. Gore (Oxford History of the United States)","review":"I recently read Theodore White's books on the Presidential campaigns of 1960, 64, 68 and 72. I was thinking this book would be a good read to keep going in chronological order... I don't want to quit reading too soon but the book has a tone that makes me wonder if it was written in the 1970s.. It is incredibly dated and the author appears to me to be clearly pushing a very conservative viewpoint. He seems to be selective in what he talks about and does quite a bit of editorializing. Don't think I am going to bother finishing it."},{"Title":"Restless Giant: The United States from Watergate to Bush vs. Gore (Oxford History of the United States)","review":"James T. Patterson's \\"Restless Giant\\", Volume 11 (and last chronologically) in the Oxford History of the United States puts an exclamation point on this gem of a series. Professor Patterson follows up on his own penultiate volume in the series, \\"Grand Expectations\\", with aplomb. David M. Kennedy, now the editor of the series, succeeding the late C. Vann Woodward, and himself the author of the antepenultimate volume, \\"Freedom from Fear\\", perhaps sums up the rationale for studying such recent history in his forward to this book: \\"It is often said that the history we know the least well is the history of our own time, particularly the decades immediately surrounding our own birth. Here (the readers) will find a cogent and compelling account of how history shaped the world they inherited . . . \\".Patterson does again what he does best and that is put history in the context of a multitude of definitionally overlapping diciplines. Covering the time period of 1974-2000, without the context of a Revolutionary War (as did Robert Middlekauff in \\"Glorious Cause\\"), the Civil War (James McPherson in \\"Battle Cry of Freedom\\"), and the Great Depression and WWII (Kennedy's Freedom from Fear) - all part of this series, is exceedingly well done and presented in a fashion that most historical narrative writers would find difficult to create. It is, hence, no surprise that Patterson was chosen to write two volumes here, both recent 20th Century history, without a linchpin on which to write around. He covers the period extraordinarily well and gives the reader a very balanced view of the many facets of our history over the last thirty years.With this book only the 5th actually published in the series, I was quite happy to learn the following. Gordon S. Wood (Brown University) will be writing on the early National era. Daniel Howe (UCLA) will be writing on the Jacksonian era. H.W. Brands (University of Texas) will be writing on the late 19th Century. Bruce Schulman (Boston University) will be writing on the Progressive era. One or two volumes (two would make the series the full eleven volumes originally envisioned) on the Colonial period apparently have yet to be assigned. While the topical volume on economic history has been scrapped, George Herring (University of Kentucky) is writing one on foreign relations and policy. These are expected out in the 2006-2007 time frame.The entire series is a wonderful undertaking that has not received the joint acclaim it deserves. Certainly many awards have been won individually for these terrific works but I think the awareness of the series, as a whole, is much lower than is warranted by the scholarly work being put into it. I am hopeful that as more volumes are published, this quickly dissipates. Kudos to all involved in this very worthy project.It appears as if readers are in for a treat over the next 12- 24 months with the \\"missing\\" volumes at least having manuscripts into David Kennedy (Freedom from Fear) and the series' new editor with the passing of C. Vann Woodward.Volumes 1 and 2, covering the Colonial Period (1672-1763) have been assigned, in some order, yet to be made public (that I am aware of) to Fred Anderson (University of Colorado) and Andrew Cayton (Miami University of Ohio).Volume 3 - The Glorious Cause 1763-89, Robert Middlekauf PUBLISHEDVolume 4 - The U.S. from 1789-1815, Gordon Wood (Brown University)Volume 5- What Hath God Wrought 1815-48, Daniel Walker Howe (UCLA)Volume 6- Battle Cry of Freedom, 1848-65, James McPherson PUBLISHEDVolume 7- Leviathan: America Comes of Age, 1865-1900, H.W. Brands (Texas)Volume 8- Reawakened Nation, 1896-1929, Bruce Schulman (Boston University)Volume 9- Freedom from Fear, 1929-1945, David M. Kennedy PUBLISHEDVolume 10- Grand Expectations, 1945-74, James T. Patterson PUBLISHEDVolume 11- Restless Giant, 1974-2000, James T. Patterson PUBLISHEDVolume 12- a complete history of American foreign policy, George Herring (Kentucky)It appears that the Brands addition has been pulled and will not be part of the series. What will take its place is not yet known. I would speculate that Brands will be writing on this same period, just not for this series as the work was largely done. A similar event happened some time ago with Stanley Elkins and Eric McKitrick writing \\"The Age of Federalism, 1788-1800\\". This was originally to be part of the series but the two apparently did not go far enough chromatically for the publishers. Also John Gaddis Lewis has written extensively and was also, somehow, dropped by Oxford. All of this makes for great reading one way or another."},{"Title":"Restless Giant: The United States from Watergate to Bush vs. Gore (Oxford History of the United States)","review":"It is only when the history books are written that we begin to find out what really happened as opposed to reading/watching the day to day news stories in the paper/television.This book by James Patterson, part of the Oxford history of the United States covers the years from Nixon's resignation (1974) to inauguration day 2001 when George W. Bush became President. The media tends to stress conflict. In actuality there is much less conflict than you might otherwise believe. The majority of Americans were less partisan, less attentive to political fighting than were the protestors, the politicians or the interest groups with causes to defend.Through this quarter century, the Americans tended to elect the presidential candidate that they considered to be the most central, neither left nor right wing. Both political parties continued to be effective, holding about half of both houses of congress. The rights of racial and ethnic minorities, Catholics and Jews, the handicapped, senior citizens, women and gays all expanded. The economy expanded to have more Americans working than ever before.This supurb book takes the immediacy out of the headlines and presents the history of our time in a well thought out, clear, and concise manner."},{"Title":"Restless Giant: The United States from Watergate to Bush vs. Gore (Oxford History of the United States)","review":"I've often felt that \\"contemporary history\\" is not just an oxymoron, but a fallacy as well. Good history depends on two things: information and perspective. Information, in that there are sources available that provide insight into the motivations behind decisions and events, and perspective in that there is enough distance to make an assessment of what decisions and trends truly shaped subsequent developments. Without both, the observations and conclusions made may not be inaccurate, but they are not really historical judgments.For this reason, I approached James Patterson's book with some skepticism. It's not that I didn't think he was up to the task (his previous contribution to the series,Grand Expectations: The United States, 1945-1974 (Oxford History of the United States), is testament to his ability to write such history), but that the task itself was in many ways a fool's errand. Yet Patterson has done an admirable job of applying a historical assessment of America during the last quarter of the twentieth century. He strikes an admirable balance in examining the political, social, and economic developments of those decades; what emerges is a portrait of America becoming more conservative politically during these decades while coming to terms with the \\"rights revolution\\" of the 1960s. I was particularly impressed with his discussion of American culture of the period, something that was sorely lacking in a couple of the earlier volumes of the series.Nevertheless, the challenge of writing contemporary history shows in these pages. Many of the archival collections remain closed, and Patterson seems heavily dependent upon contemporary journalism in assessing events. Where his problems are particularly evident, though, is in drawing conclusions about developments. The challenge for historians is in assigning causality, to say why something happens. Too often what Patterson does is to present various explanations of events without coming to any definite conclusions himself. While such evenhandedness is admirable, it demonstrates the fundamental problem - we still don't know enough to make judicious assessments of the impact of events still within living memory. The result is best regarded as an interim account, one that will be revised in many respects as our knowledge and distance from the times grows.This is not to diminish the author's achievement. Patterson has written a good, comprehensive survey of recent American history, easily the best one available to us today. Even readers who remember well the events Patterson describes will learn something new from this book, one that is likely to remain the standard history of the era for many years to come."},{"Title":"Restless Giant: The United States from Watergate to Bush vs. Gore (Oxford History of the United States)","review":"The Oxford History of the United States series is an amazing endeavor. The purpose of this undertaking is to provide readers with an accessible summary of major historical works in the field in engaging narratives. Two books in the series have won the Pulitzer Prize; others have won a number of important, but lesser-known book awards. Patterson, a professor emeritus at Brown University, is the only individual to write two volumes in this series. This book picks up right where Grand Expectations, his previous contribution to the series, left off. He basically advances the same argument about rights consciousness, but for a different time period.His text is stunning. He shows his skill in interpreting vast amounts of information and putting old controversies into new lights. The 1970s were hardly as bad as people thought and the 1980s were a time of greatness as Ronald Regan dominated the decade in a way that few presidents do.The account, however, breaks down when Patterson reaches 1990. The chapters in the second half of the book are quite uneven. Some are as brilliant and informative as the material on the 1970s. In other chapters, Patterson fails to support his thesis. His citations are often missing and fail to support his arguments. At times, Patterson comes across as little more than a journalist reporting on the news of the day.To use a baseball term, this book is a hit and a miss. A .500 batting average is pretty good in baseball; in history it gets a four-star rating, but just barely."},{"Title":"Restless Giant: The United States from Watergate to Bush vs. Gore (Oxford History of the United States)","review":"James Patterson wrote his second book in the Oxford History of the United States. His first book was excellent. His second book on 1974-2000 is informative and covers the essential and contentious social issues of the era. However, he editorializes a lot in this book and political biases are clearly present.I don't take issue with his scholarship. He has exhaustivily researched the era. However, he failed to give conservative presidents much positive coverage or recognition for their accomplishments. For example, he is very harsh in his analysis of the Reagan presidency. He correctly points out some failures during the Reagan years. However, he fails to give Reagan much credit for policies that led to the end of the Cold War. He points out that the national deficit grew dramatically during the Reagan years, but he failed to recognize positive economic trends like a virtual end of inflation, the creation of millions of jobs, and low unemployment levels.This is a book worth reading. It is very informative and well-researched. The problem is he presents facts that fit his ideological position and omits facts that put the Reagan administration in a positive light. Overall, I liked the book, but I was disappointed with the ideological biases present in the work."},{"Title":"Restless Giant: The United States from Watergate to Bush vs. Gore (Oxford History of the United States)","review":"Patterson successfully presents modern history in this book in a very concise and easy to read book. It's objective for the most part, and covers the most relevent events of each decade mentioned. There is not a whole lot of detail on everything however, it is more of a summary, but it will \\"wet your appetite\\" on various topics for more detailed study. It's a pretty good history book."},{"Title":"Restless Giant: The United States from Watergate to Bush vs. Gore (Oxford History of the United States)","review":"What I liked best about the book was sense of balance. It discussed good things and bad things about both Reagan & Clinton, the two most controversial presidents of the period. It was also a period of enormous social change, much more so than the sixties. Patterson could have made the point that the 70's were the time when the social experiments of the sixtiescame to fruition."},{"Title":"Restless Giant: The United States from Watergate to Bush vs. Gore (Oxford History of the United States)","review":"It is said that people are less familiar with the recent past (those years during which they have lived) than they are with the history of previous generations. This book certainly made that point crystal clear to me. The book covers the years 1974-2001, during which time I grew from a young child to a parent, and I found myself marveling at the information contained in the book.Patterson has provided us with a clear, consise history of America during this nearly 30 year period - covering everything from the social history of integration to the political turmoil surrounding Nixon, Ford, Carter, Reagan, Bush, & Clinton, along with a brief look at the political battle that landed Bush 43 in the White House in 2001.Although it is too early to know with any certainty the long-term historical impacts of these years, Patterson gives us a solid understanding of the trials encountered and the immediate ramifications seen.Starting with the so-called \\"troubled 1970s\\", which seem to be nothing more than a conclusion to the activism of the 60s, we move on through the challenging Carter years (the massive economic troubles of stagflation) and into the rise of Ronald Reagan and the modern conservative movement. We see how Reagan changed the thinking of Americans and laid the groundwork for conservatism to continue evolving for the rest of the century.Pushing through the foreign-affairs dominated presidency of Bush 41, we move quickly into the social history of immigration & race relations in the 90's. Clinton's domestic agenda and political battles offer the final chapters in the book, with a brief stop in the Supreme Court for the declaration that George Bush was to be inaugurated as the 43rd President of the United States.Overall, I would highly recommend this book to anyone that came of age in these years - it will help you to thoroughly understand the reasons why the world you live in today developed as it did rather than simply being a continuation of the Beatnik society of the 50's, the Hippie dominated culture of the 60's, or the constant fear that pervaded American life immediately following World War II - that fear of nuclear war with the Soviet Union. I believe that this book will make a powerful text for the next generation when studying recent American history, and until that generation can revisit these years with another 25-30 years of review under their belt, this is probably the definitive work we will see of this time frame."},{"Title":"Restless Giant: The United States from Watergate to Bush vs. Gore (Oxford History of the United States)","review":"Patterson delivers another smash hit in his book on the United States from Watergate to Bush v. Gore. This book is a less historiography study and more of a statistical approach than other oxford books but it is nonetheless expertly presented. The analysis is top quality and the sense of how the United States became restless (especially during the 1990's is apparent. Patterson makes a good argument that we have to wait and see what effect 9/11 will have and whether or not it was the changing milestone. If you are interested in this time period this is a must read. For those who are interested in American studies this is an essential book for your library."},{"Title":"Restless Giant: The United States from Watergate to Bush vs. Gore (Oxford History of the United States)","review":"I must say this was a disappointing effort as compared with his previous (and very well-done) work in this series. This struck me more as \\"Modern US History According to Patterson\\" than the historical work I expected.I was surprised and dismayed by all of the unsupported and sweeping conclusions he jumped to without benefit of supporting analysis. He seemed anxious to label and categorize rather than to describe and analyze. Patterson seemed to have a political agenda that I have not seen in the other volumes in this series.He certainly is entitled to his views--and I don't mind him expressing them--but his opinions and beliefs are no substitute for a balanced analysis of a given event or topic. In a surprising number of instances, Patterson just declared by fiat that \\"of course\\" certain groups were acting out of disgenuine motives and as a subterfuge to their true agenda with no supporting analysis.For example, in his discussion of school desegregation and busing in the 1970s, Patterson asserts with no supporting analysis that the resulting \\"white flight\\" was based solely on racism (i.e., white families not wanting their kids to go to school with black kids) as opposed to genuine concerns about safety and educational oportunities and quality. Whether I agree with him or not, I expect him to analyze the issue, consider the major viewpoints and give me a rational basis for his conclusions, rather than just assuming facts and motives that fit his world view and expecting me to go along.This was written as though we are sitting in Patterson's study, listening while he puffs on his pipe and pontificates on HIS views of recent events. There's nothing wrong with that (I greatly enjoyed Stephen Ambrose's \\"Letters to America\\" which was written in that vein), but that's not what I have come to expect from this series. To me, this book is clearly the weak link in this fabulous series. I hope it was an aberration and not a trend."},{"Title":"Get Better or Get Beaten!: 31 Leadership Secrets from Ge's Jack Welch","review":"There are a series of great books available on Amazon.com that much better explore the world of Jack Welch and GE. After attending a workshop I picked up three from Amazon and two at the library. This was the weakest of the three. First, this is a poorly constructed paperback version. It is just plain cheap. Feels cheap and looks cheap. Thats it for the layout and format.Second, many of the paragraphs seem to be cut and pasted from one chapter to another. I felt that I was re-reading essentially the same ten paragraphs scattered throughout the book. Very frustrating because it indicates either laziness by the author or redundancy to be pedantic.Next, many books claim to have a special insight since the author was given rare access to the GE training center known as the &quot;pit.&quot; This book claims that as well and quotes Welch at a number of public meetings...in an attempt to reinforce the concepts.As Welch soon retires, I wonder if these same books will hold the interest they now capture. You are better served by more narrative, substantial texts on Welch and his management style. As always, Amazon readers can rate reviews and many loyalists vote against critics. I have a great admiration for Welch, and what he managed to accomplish. This book does neither him, nor his accomplishments real justice.Reading this &quot;guide for leaders&quot; I wondered if Welch would look at it and laugh at its simplicity."},{"Title":"Get Better or Get Beaten!: 31 Leadership Secrets from Ge's Jack Welch","review":"Jack Welch would be the first to point out that none of the 29 Leadership Secrets to which the subtitle refers is really a secret. In fact, most of the material in this book has been recycled or updated from previous publications, notably from Slater's excellent Jack Welch and the GE Way and The GE Way Fieldbook, both of which I also highly recommend. Slater is an excellent judge of material and writes very well. After more than 25 years as a successful journalist, he has developed a keen sense of what key business issues are, and, how Welch's comments on those issues can be most effectively shared with the reader. Two factors set this book apart from most other business books which also share \\"secrets.\\" First and obviously, Welch's well-deserved reputation as a great leader. Also, the business context in which Slater anchors each of the 29 key points. With brevity and precision, Slater addresses questions such as these:* How to \\"harness the power of change\\"?* What does \\"Face Reality!\\" mean? Also, what does it require?* What is the best process for evaluating your organization with a \\"fresh eye\\"?* What are the major perils as well as benefits of Six Sigma initiatives?* What are some of the most effective e-business strategies?* How can e-business \\"put the final nail in bureaucracy\\"?Thanks to Slater, as I read the book I felt as if Welch himself were making a series of assertions directly to me. In response to each I am inclined to ask, \\"Exactly what does he mean by that?\\" An explanation then follows, based on the wealth of information about Welch which Slater and others have accumulated over the years. Slater also includes a series of lists of \\"Welch Rules\\" and then, in an Appendix, a list of \\"GE Values\\"...the same list which (reproduced on a laminated card) is carried by each GE employee.Welch himself has been and continues to be an avid student of business. Time and again, he has gratefully acknowledged what he has learned, not only from other great business leaders but also from his associates at GE...especially from younger GE executives who share his contempt for what Jim O'Toole has characterized (in Leading Change) as \\"the ideology of comfort and the tyranny of custom.\\"If you share my great admiration of Jack Welch and also wish you could spend some time with him one-on-one, here's probably your best opportunity to do so.

The intriguing list of \\"29 leadership secrets\\" (which could have been reduced to ten) is more selective than secret, given that Welch has been preaching them loudly from a very prominent platform for more than 20 years. However, the book will be valuable to Welch neophytes and to fans who want more Jack, or the essence of Jack. Author Robert Slater assumes a certain familiarity with GE's history and initiatives, and sometimes refers to them without explanation. Welch long ago transcended management to become sort of a leadership prophet, and his utterances are sometimes paradoxical, if not contradictory. He says nurture people, but downsize; he says cut bureaucracy, but implement a paperwork intensive Six Sigma program. We promise that somewhere in here, you'll find a managerial principle to fit almost any occasion.

When I received the book I felt Jack Welch's ideas were simple, straightforward and obvious. It is only after working for other companies that I realize the genius behind them, and how rare it is for these \\"simple\\" concepts to be played out elsewhere in corporate America. Jack Welch is truly a business visionary, and this book outlines many of his ideas, albeit in sketch format. His ideas about re-structuring, de-layering, change management, corporate speed and employee empowerment were all way ahead of their time. Thirty-one of his best ideas are presented here, but unfortunately, with little substance behind them. I would suggest that this book is a great place to start if you are interested in GE's business and corporate philosophies, however, to get more in depth analysis and explanation you will need to look elsewhere.

Quality and Re-engineering gurus like Peter Drucker, Philip Crosby, Tom Peters etc had stressed the importance of quality, customer orientation, corporate culture, employee involvement blah blah blah for decades. It's just that Jack Welch had been so successful a real life practitioner and advocate that nobody can neglect.

I think this book would be very good for summer reading and I hope you enjoy the book!"},{"Title":"Great Space Battles","review":"I received this book as a Christmas gift in 1979. Recently, while going through some of my old things, I came across this book again and I must say that the illustrations and text are just as compelling today as they were 25 years ago. As part of a popular series of &quot;future history&quot; handbooks for juvenile readers in Cowley's Terran Trade Authority series, the premise of the series was quite simple yet inspired - create a collection of &quot;fact-packed&quot; stories based on the scenes depicted in several pieces of sci-fi illustration that previously adorned book or magazine covers and package each story together with its corresponding illustration in an attractive, glossy coffee-table-type book.This particular edition documents major interplanetary wars between Earthmen and aliens, the struggle of human colonists against the hostile environments of distant planets as well as stories of future law enforcement agencies battling space pirates and pan-galactic organised crime. The writing is picturesque and is phrased in the typically dry and information-rich style of a documentary book meant for a young audience aged 10 years and above. The illustrations featured are some of the most impressive and vivid work I have ever seen from a selection of sci-fi artists who were either some of the most promising talents or the leading lights of their day. Some of these illustrators are still very much active today and have won much praise and many awards for their work.Being long out of print, this and other books in the same series are now highly sought after collectable items. If you ever come across a copy, don't hesitate to grab it. Besides this title, I also own &quot;Starliners: Commercial Spacetravel in 2200 AD,&quot; (also by the same author) which I also highly recommend. They make for such fascinating &quot;idle-time&quot; reading and are such a great feast for the eyes that I don't intend to part with either of these treasures, ever. &quot;Great Space Battles&quot; makes for a great gift for the SF fan who is young or still young at heart."},{"Title":"Great Space Battles","review":"I can't add a lot to what I've said in my other reviews regarding the Cowley titles.

Evidently the passage of time and the advent of video games and digital animation has not dimmed this title's appeal."},{"Title":"Great Space Battles","review":"This book has the personal distinction of fostering a lifelong interest in science fiction. Its collection of seperate stories of a fictional future human interstellar federation, the centerpiece being the short and brutal war between Terra and the Lagunians. Written in a historical narrative, the stories cover a possible future of human history written in the past tense. It was memorable for creating a world of human colonization and exploration riddled with civil unrest and adversity, contrary to the resolved idealism Star Trek. Humans didn't change but just spread out among the stars, and our flaws went with us. Various chapters of piracy, rebellion, colonial crisis, planetary phenomena, and human greed and struggle.The illustrations are of a generally very high quality and does a great job reinforcing the written world. The book is oversized to do the artwork justice which really is the focus of this book. I heard that some the illustrations were used as inspiration for the computer game \\"Homeworld\\", a shame Cowley doesn't write more about the Terran Trade Authority, it may have started something for a movie or miniseries, perhaps writing Children Books was more lucrative..."},{"Title":"Great Space Battles","review":"A child of the 80's would have found this book in there library and I was glad to rediscover it when I did."},{"Title":"Great Space Battles","review":"Big spaceship pictures future history.A book aimed at kids with very cool pictures of spaceships, and a decent series of short stories throughout, at least as far as that goes, detailing some elements of the society.This aimed at younger reader books full of cool artwork and short tales of interstellar conflict and other adventures amidst the backdrop of Cowley's Terran Trade Authority future history is still fun.The book is broken into two sections :-The Laguna WarsGreat Space Battles : The Nightmare Beings - Stewart CowleyGreat Space Battles : The Forgotten Fleet - Stewart CowleyGreat Space Battles : The First Clash - Stewart CowleyGreat Space Battles : A Mysterious Liquid - Stewart CowleyGreat Space Battles : A Clue - Stewart CowleyGreat Space Battles : the Breakout - Stewart CowleyGreat Space Battles : A Desperate Race - Stewart CowleyGreat Space Battles : The Defence of Terra - Stewart CowleyGreat Space Battles : The Final Victory?

It's turned out to be a mixed bag, but I'm still glad I bought it and I'm still using it as my primary knitting course to teach myself to knit.The target audience is rank beginners, as you would guess from the title. It is not intended as a reference book for more advanced knitters.Where this book excels is its selection of topics and the order of the topics. Other knitting books will bog you down with umpteen variations on a subject when you'd be better advised to move on to the next basic topic. Ms. Kagan picks the appropriate topics to concentrate on and presents them in an appropriate order for learning them. The basic topics include casting on (first row), knitting, purling, binding off (last row), gauge (picking the appropriate size needles), correcting mistakes, increasing and decreasing the size of rows so you're not limited to knitting rectangles, and reading typical project instructions. From there, she moves on to assembling the finished item (blocking, pressing, seams); textured, raised, and cable patterns; yarn embroidery - a simple way to add color before you're ready to tackle knitting multi-colored patterns; stripes; multi-colored patterns; using circular and double-pointed needles; and decorative openwork (various lace shawl patterns).The book is attractively laid out and copiously illustrated, inviting you to dive in and explore. That's unless you're a man or boy curious about knitting, in which case you'll have a hard time getting past the pink cover and feminine look of the book.The down side is that the instructions could be clearer. On getting it home and actually sitting down to read it, I couldn't at first understand what she was saying. However, with knitting needles in hand, concentrating on learning just one technique at a time, and picking a technique I'm reasonably ready to learn, I can usually figure it out. If you're left-handed (I'm not), good luck - it has one paragraph for you. The instructions are clearer in the \\"I Taught Myself Knitting\\" booklet co-produced by Lion Brand yarn and Boye (equipment manufacturer), a surprisingly good booklet that comes in kits with various starter assortments of equipment.Another strength of this book is that it intersperses projects between lessons. The projects don't happen to be my style or anything I happen to have any use for, for the most part, or maybe that's just due to first impressions and color choices, but they're good both for practicing and for better understanding the techniques just learned. The more sensible projects include scarves, hats, sweaters, an embroidered pillow, throw (red hearts?? maybe I'll try it with green shamrocks instead), leg warmers, slouch socks, fingerless gloves, poncho, and a nice lace shawl.In summary, if you're a rank beginner, this book can give you the knowledge and confidence to tackle any reasonably normal knitting project, however you may need to supplement it with another book or ask for help from someone who knows how to knit."},{"Title":"Ready, Set, Knit: Learn to Knit with 20 Hot Projects (Stand-Up Book)","review":"When I first looked at this book, I was struck by the good instructions that the author gives on various types of cables and other pattern stitches. I think that this book is a good book to own if you want to learn a lot of pattern stitches, but the patterns themselves do not really appeal to me. The candy stripe leg warmers and the cable hats are cute, but those are about the only ones I feel particularly attracted to. The fringe top is really ugly, too--just thought you might want a warning...Bottom line: It's not worth the list price, but if you can find a good deal, then it's a nice book to have in your knitting library."},{"Title":"Ready, Set, Knit: Learn to Knit with 20 Hot Projects (Stand-Up Book)","review":"I purchased this book as a brand new knitter looking to learn from a book. I was attracted to it because of the cover art, the fact that the book can be freestanding, and the beautiful photographs of the stitches inside. I also liked the look of the designs of the patterns. I won't say this is a horrible book, because it does have some good qualities, but it is not for beginners, as it does not provide detailed explanation in most of the patterns. I also found some errors in some of the patterns, which I thought were on my part, but I went to a knitting store and asked the owner and she said it was not my error, but the book's. The sock pattern, in particular, will make a sock, but with a very awkward feel and fit. I think these patterns are much more suited to the intermediate knitter who can catch an error before it is too late. That being said, I do wish more pattern books were free standing like this one--it made life easier."},{"Title":"Ready, Set, Knit: Learn to Knit with 20 Hot Projects (Stand-Up Book)","review":"I would probably give 4.5 stars if possible...I really like this book overall. I agree that it's not likely that anyone would like all of the patterns in here (especially the fringe top!), but I think there is something for everyone. I have made the \\"flaps or no flaps\\" hat (no flaps for me), the tote bag, and the slouch socks. There are several other patterns I plan to try eventually.But what I really love are the instructional parts of the book. If you're a total beginnger, it's a great thing to work your way through the techniques from beginning to end. If you're a little more advanced, it's a handy reference. I have pulled it off the shelf several times to look up a pattern abbreviation, check a diagram of a technique, etc. The large numbers of sample stitches (different open work patterns, cable patterns, textured patterns, etc.) are also a great reference if you're interested in designing your own pattern. It has made me braver as a moderate knitter--I never would have guessed I would try making my own patterns before I bought this book!"},{"Title":"Ready, Set, Knit: Learn to Knit with 20 Hot Projects (Stand-Up Book)","review":"As a new knitter attempting to teach myself, I thought this book would help me become proficient in no time. Boy, was I wrong! Granted, I'm only on the first project, but I feel I'm lucky to be squeeking even the essentials out of this poorly-written book. Some of the instructions (even illustrated) are unclear and confusing, and I was completely lost on the selvage information, which was not illustrated; they actually used a selvage skill in the first project! I gave up that part of the instructions after about 10 rows - it was impossible to see what I was doing and it made absolutely no sense.The first project was a scarf - ideal for new knitters, but she has you using \\"chunky\\" yarn and no. 17 (HUGE, FAT) needles, which were awkward to use at first and the chunky yarn made it difficult for me to really see what I was doing. Some of the other projects are just plain DORKY - no one I know would be caught dead wearing that fringed top!The \\"stand-up\\" feature is impractical; the pages aren't even properly set up in the instruction part of the book to allow one to stand the book up and merely turn it around - half the pages are upside-down! I would rather have had a regularly bound and set up book than this halfway effort.While I will keep this book and likely refer to it occasionally, I would not recommend it to anyone. I've ordered \\"Instant Expert: Knitting,\\" which a friend recommended, so I hope that will be better. As for this book, I'd skip it.

I gave my first copy away to a beginning real estate investor. Then I bought another copy because I wanted a copy for my library but I'll probably end up giving that one away to a friend or family memeber when they ask me about investing in real estate.The most successful real estate investors in my local real estate investors association follow Ron LeGrand. I like the many testimonials of real people who have actually done real deals in this book. This tells me that real people have followed through and have had success.Ron LeGrand packs a bunch of very valuable information in a book that is only $22! I paid much more than that to attend two of his seminars. He has condensed his entire mode of operation into a single book. Every person who buys this book is getting the deal of their lifetime. You will not find another real estate investor who has demonstrable proof of their success laying out their whole way of doing business and charging you only $22 for it! Actually, I was a little ticked that he put in over two dozen ways to find real estate deals because that is what most people are trying to do. And I was surprised that in the Appendix he even added letters, flyers, and documents that he gave us in the seminars that I went to. I paid much more for them though.Of course a glossary of real estate investing terms is in the back for you to use as a reference. And he will send you 5 CD's (for free) that further expound on topics in the book. Believe me, I paid a lot for the CD's I purchased. In fact, it would cost me more than 22 bucks to take a millionaire out to lunch so buying his business plan in a book for only $22 is a true no brainer.One last thing. The book is an easy read so don't deceive yourself and think that it must be harder than this because it isn't. The secret is not in the information. The secret is in the action - actually following through and doing what he lays out.I am not a millionaire yet, but I have been following (most of) what he says to do, and I have made over 50 times what I paid for those seminars. And that is a very good return on my investment."},{"Title":"How to Be a Quick Turn Real Estate Millionaire: Make Fast Cash with No Money, Credit, or Previous Experience","review":"Ok, there are people on here rating this book 1 star because of the author trying to sell his course.

Just simply don't read those pages and really think about the quality of the rest of the pages and you will be rating this book a 5 instead of 1, its that simple.

On the other hand the seminars & courses are really pricey. Many people spend upwards of 20-30k on seminars without ever doing a real estate deal. LeGrand's greatest student is probably Robin Thompson, the Queen of Rehabs, who has become a millionaire many times over using his techniques (I'm one of her students). I have a good friend who spent 5 grand for a LeGrand course and never made any money with it. In essence it all depends on the person. Some can take these techniques and become wealthy.

He actively practices what he preaches (today, not 25 years ago), shoots straight, and doesn't sugar coat his opinions.

The key, as Mr. LeGrand says, is that you have to work at it. Don't think that you won't have to pay your dues and work the problem.This book is a result of his experience in buying and selling houses, and even more in teaching other people how to buy and sell houses. It covers all the aspects. Finding the house, doing repairs that may be necessary, cleaning up the dead (One house I recently bought had a legal description saying that the lot was smaller than the house itself. It took three meetings of the city council, surveryors, public notices in the newspaper, etc. to get the legal description clear - the old legal description was written in 1869 and hadn't been changed in 135 years.)All the ins and outs are described here in clear and easy to understand terms. He reports on the deals he has made, some good, some not so good. Unfortunately that's the way he had to learn, reading his report is a lot easier than taking the hit in the pocket book and with the mental anguish. You won't learn everything you need to know from this book, consider it a start."},{"Title":"How to Be a Quick Turn Real Estate Millionaire: Make Fast Cash with No Money, Credit, or Previous Experience","review":"I heard Ron Legrand's name several times before a person making more money than me, recommeded finding one of his books and reading it.... I did, and I will never regret it. In response to one of the other reviews, don't expect to learn everything about real estate from a book, why would you want to trust a book that much? It doesn't matter, the book gives me more info about real estate than I could find in any other book and this was only about my 10th real estate book and probably the last book on real estate I will ever buy. It explains different aspects of real estate like the different kinds of sales then explains them- I would read about someone doing a \\"short sale\\" in another book and not know what it is the whole book, Ron at least explains all the different ways to \\"acquire\\" a house and good situations to use them. Not only that but gives suggestions about IRA's, and some of his advice reminds me of a Robert Kiosaki book but goes just a bit further."},{"Title":"How to Be a Quick Turn Real Estate Millionaire: Make Fast Cash with No Money, Credit, or Previous Experience","review":"Don't buy this book!I was really excited when I bought this book: \\"Make Fast Cash with No Money, Credit or Previous Experience\\". It looked like it could deliver what it promised, and a quick scan of the chapters convinced me that this was the real deal.When I sat down to read the first chapter or two, I thought the material was good, but thin. In the first 60 pages, 20 are either blank or full-page testimonials of LeGrand's training courses (not testimonials of this book, but of his other courses - which should have tipped me off). There were also several statements like, \\"Well, I could write a whole book on this topic, but since I can't include it all here, this (short explanation) will have to do\\". It was a little frustrating, getting excited about a subject and then getting cut off that way with only a little bit of information.When I hit page 62, I knew I'd been had. I read, \\"\\"Yes, Iknow that was a shameless commercial...\\" \\"I'd preferyou don't take the information in this book andimplement it with no further training.\\" \\"...doyourself a favor and don't expect miracles from abook.\\"What ever happened to \\"Make Fast Cash with No Money, Credit or Previous Experience\\"? \\"Don't expect miracles from a book\\" certainly wasn't pasted all over the cover in big letters! Then, on the same page, were advertisements for his $3000 real estate courses.I had paid $21.95 for Ron LeGrand to advertise to me! What he did has been done many times before (read any of Wade Cook's books): put out \\"teasers\\" in a book, say how much someone can make from all of these ideas, then don't give them enough information to implement them without paying thousands for additional training.I sent an email to his organization saying the same thing. One week later: no response, no apology, no defense of their shameless advertising ploy.I am disgusted with LeGrand's dishonest \\"bait and switch\\" tactics, and I hope everyone who sees this learns from my mistake."},{"Title":"How to Be a Quick Turn Real Estate Millionaire: Make Fast Cash with No Money, Credit, or Previous Experience","review":"It's interesting that reviewers mostly either rated this book one star or five, and almost nothing in between. Seems like evidence that the book actually merits one star, and the five star reviews may have been written by those with added incentive. Even the language of the five-star reviews mimics the language of the book exactly, as though the book's author or someone from the organization wrote them.I actually borrowed the book from the library before deciding whether to buy it, to see if the material was worth keeping around for future reference. Without even having spent anything on it, I still felt used, like I was suckered, because I invested my time in it. It's even structured in the same way as an infomercial, with a page of enticement alternating with a page of personal testimonials from seminar attendees. (And by the way, the MIS seminar frequently mentioned in these testimonials costs $7,000! I looked it up on Ron LeGrand's website, mentioned once every few pages in the book.)To be fair, there is some actual information in the book, albeit prefaced by constant disclaimers that further investment in training is necessary to be able to apply these principles. But something in one of the testimonials led me to believe that there's probably not much to his exorbitant seminars either. Here is an actual quote from p. 54: \\"The prior residents were supposed to buy it for $152,000 - we figured we would increase the price to $159,900 - but on your CD (the timing of when we listened to that particular one couldn't have been better!) you said to make sure we \\"research\\" market values BEFORE we put a price on a home...we ended up asking $168,999...\\" Now, that is a no-brainer (duh!). If that's the kind of additional training we get from paying thousands for CDs and seminars, I'll stick with a book borrowed from the library, or maybe just my common sense..."},{"Title":"How to Be a Quick Turn Real Estate Millionaire: Make Fast Cash with No Money, Credit, or Previous Experience","review":"I seriously suspect that people who gave 5 star reviews for this book work for the author or publisher. This book is nothing but a plug for his real estate courses. Believe me, buying this book will make the author, LeGrand, millionare not you."},{"Title":"How to Be a Quick Turn Real Estate Millionaire: Make Fast Cash with No Money, Credit, or Previous Experience","review":"I must echo the sentiments of earlier reviews that found this to be more of a promotional piece. This book started well but it was not long before the recurring references to his site and training courses.As someone curious about real estate investing, I find that many of the authors on this topic use their books as introductions to their other products.Legrand provides some interesting insights from his personal experience. However, much of the rest of the book followed predictable patterns of brief illustrations of successful investor situations and carefully selected letters to keep readers focused on the \\"pot of gold\\" that is available.Authors trying to promote other products does not bother me. It would be helpful if these experts would share a few complete illustrations of their techniques (adding the disclaimer that these are examples and may vary greatly in real life). These start to finish illustrations would give a more complete picture of the process and really give beginners a better look at the process."},{"Title":"How to Be a Quick Turn Real Estate Millionaire: Make Fast Cash with No Money, Credit, or Previous Experience","review":"This is certainly a book for beginners. If you're at all experienced in real estate investment, then you should probably skip it.If, however, you're trying to break into the real estate investment business but lack cash, credit, and much knowledge on what to do with distressed properties and/or distressed sellers, then this could be a great place to start. Your education won't end here, but it could start (and you don't have to sign up for expensive seminars...but you will probably have to join a local real estate investment association and get hooked up with people willing to teach you).Did anyone really think they were going to get all of the information they needed in a $20 book? Of course not...but there is certainly enough good information here for a complete novice to justify a $20 investment. If you read this book, either the light-bulb will go off over your head or it won't. You'll either get motivated to get out there and do a deal (or at least try), or you won't.Just remember...to have something you have never had, you must do something you have never done."}]`),B={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:A},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:C,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(s=>setTimeout(s,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},R={class:"card-container"},H=["disabled"],x={key:0},E={key:1};function M(s,o,n,u,r,i){const c=f("PoemCard");return e(),t("section",null,[o[1]||(o[1]=a("div",{class:"top-banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),a("div",R,[(e(!0),t(y,null,g(i.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(e(),p(c,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(e(),t("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:o[0]||(o[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(e(),t("span",E,"Loading...")):(e(),t("span",x,"See more"))],8,H)):w("",!0)])}const P=d(B,[["render",M],["__scopeId","data-v-8c26a382"]]),W=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"guide/16.md","filePath":"guide/16.md"}'),D={name:"guide/16.md"},O=Object.assign(D,{setup(s){return(o,n)=>(e(),t("div",null,[b(P)]))}});export{W as __pageData,O as default};
