In his seminal study Christianity as Mystical Fact he turned his esoteric genius to interpreting the Christ event as the turning point in the world's spiritual history--an incarnation whose significance he saw transcending all religions.\\" --Bishop Frederick H. Borsch, professor of New Testament and chair of Anglican Studies, Lutheran Theological Seminary, Philadelphia \\"As simultaneously mysticism and fact, Christianity is a breakthrough in the historical development of humanity for which the mysteries, with the results that they brought about, form a prior evolutionary stage.\\" --Rudolf Steiner During the fall and winter of 1901-1902, Steiner gave a series of lectures called \\"Christianity As Mystical Fact\\" to members of the Theosophical Society. The lectures were rewritten and issued as a book later that year. They mark a watershed in the development of Western esotericism. Steiner wrote of the idea behind his book: \\"The title Christianity As Mystical Fact was one I gave to this work eight years ago, when I gathered together the content of lectures given in 1902. It was meant to indicate the special approach adopted in the book. Its theme is not just the mystical side of Christianity in a historical presentation. It was meant to show, from the standpoint of a mystical awareness, how Christianity came into being. Behind this was the idea that spiritual happenings were factors in the emergence of Christianity, which could only be observed from such a point of view. It is for the book itself to demonstrate that, by \\"mystical,\\" I do not in any way imply a vague intuition rather than strict scientific argument. In many circles, mysticism is understood as just that, and therefore it is distinguished from the concerns of all 'genuine' science. \\"In this book, however, I use the term to mean a 'presentation of spiritual reality'--a reality accessible only to a knowledge drawn from the sources of spiritual life itself. Anyone who denies the possibility of such knowledge in principle will find its contents hard to comprehend; any reader who accepts the idea that mysticism may coexist with the clarity of the natural sciences, may acknowledge that the mystical aspect of Christianity must be described mystically.\\" This is a fundamental book, in Steiner's own development, in that of Western esotericism, and for our understanding of the Christ event. Readers will find the evolutionary development from the ancient Mysteries through the great Greek philosophers to the events portrayed in the Gospels. Included are an informative introduction and annotated notes by Andrew Welburn and an afterword by Michael Debus, a priest of the Christian Community, who summarizes the book and places it in context.

A Perfect Planet shows in stunning detail how Earth has always been more than the sum of its parts. Unlike any other astronomical body, it is a living world.

In Sorokin's scabrous dystopian satire, Day of the Oprichnik, American readers were introduced to his distinctive style, which combines an edgy avant-garde sensibility with a fondness for the absurd and even grotesque all in the service of bringing out stinging truths about life in modern-day Russia. In The Blizzard, we are immediately immersed in the atmosphere of a 19th century Russia familiar to us from the works of Turgenev, Tolstoy, and Dostoyevsky. District doctor Garin is desperately trying to reach the village of Dolgoye, where a mysterious epidemic called the  Chernukha  is raging and threatens to spread throughout the country, turning people into zombies. The doctor carries with him a vaccine that will prevent the spread of this terrible disease, but is stymied in his travels by an all-consuming snow storm, an impenetrable blizzard that turns a drive that should last only a few hours into a voyage of days, and finally, a journey into eternity. The Blizzard dramatizes a timeless metaphysical predicament. The characters in this nearly post-apocalyptic world are constantly in motion, and yet somehow trapped and frozen spending day and night fighting their way through the storm on an expedition filled with extraordinary encounters, dangerous escapades, torturous imaginings, and amorous adventures. In the fantastical realm Sorokin has invented, the reader also loses her bearings, subject to the vicissitudes of time and change, to both the movement of life and its stagnancy. Hypnotic, fascinating, and richly descriptive, The Blizzard is a seminal work from one of the most inventive writers working today.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=CafMCgAAQBAJ&dq=The+blizzard&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Irish Wit and Wisdom (Mini Books)","description":"Folklore, humor, proverbs, toasts -- and blarney!","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=mV__61OuOEoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Silas Marner (The Classic Collection)","description":"Tells the story of the unjustly exiled Silas Marner - a handloom linen weaver of Raveloe in the agricultural heartland of England - and how he is restored to life by the unlikely means of the orphan child Eppie.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=hEpjS7KoK_UC&dq=Silas+Marner+(The+Classic+Collection)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fra Angelico (The Gallery of masterpieces)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5n7czQEACAAJ&dq=Fra+Angelico+(The+Gallery+of+masterpieces)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How To Get Away With Murder In New York","description":"How To Get Away With Murder In New York is an irreverent look at crime and the criminal justice system in New York.

Deftly marshaling a vast array of historical and demographic research, Neil Postman, author of Technopoly, suggests that childhood is a relatively recent invention, which came into being as the new medium of print imposed divisions between children and adults. But now these divisions are eroding under the barrage of television, which turns the adult secrets of sex and violence into poprular entertainment and pitches both news and advertising at the intellectual level of ten-year-olds. Informative, alarming, and aphorisitc, The Disappearance of Childhood is a triumph of history and prophecy.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=YFKCUr8oMQQC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Haunted Screen: Expressionism in the German Cinema and the Influence of Max Reinhardt","description":"The Golden Age of German cinema began at the end of the First World War and ended shortly after the coming of sound. From The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari onwards the principal films of this period were characterized by two influences: literary Expressionism, and the innovations of the theatre directors of this period, in particular Max Reinhardt. This book demonstrates the connection between German Romanticism and the cinema through Expressionist writings. It discusses the influence of the theatre: the handling of crowds; the use of different levels, and of selective lighting on a predominately dark stage; the reliance on formalized gesture; the innovation of the intimate theatre. Against this background the principal films of the period are examined in detail. The author explains the key critical concepts of the time, and surveys not only the work of the great directors, such as Fritz Lang and F. W. Murnau, but also the contribution of their writers, cameramen, and designers. As The Times Literary Supplement wrote, 'Mme. Eisner is first and foremost a film critic, and one of the best in the world. She has all the necessary gifts.' And it described the original French edition of this book as 'one of the very few classics of writing on the film and arguably the best book on the cinema yet written.'","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=lwZ_S6ap1LcC&dq=The+Haunted+Screen:+Expressionism+in+the+German+Cinema+and+the+Influence+of+Max+Reinhardt&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Watermelon Man","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=m94_zQEACAAJ&dq=Watermelon+Man&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rita Blitt : The Passionate Gesture","description":"\\"From the time she could pick up a crayon, painter/sculptor Rita Blitt has never ceased to make art.

With the probity of an open-minded historian and the skills of a trained therapist (he is both), Strozier examines Lincoln's relationships to women: his mother, stepmother, two young loves, and Mary Todd. He also considers Lincoln's feelings toward his father and male friends and colleagues. In this psychological portrait, the reader comes closer than ever to understanding our greatest president. For this revised edition, Professor Strozier has incorporated new sources--most important, the writings of William Herndon, Lincoln's long-time law partner--to update and expand his psychological portrait of our 16th president. \\"This is a remarkable book with extraordinary insights about the inner life of Abraham Lincoln. It will be read and studied for years to come, for Charles Strozier brings to every chapter the very qualities that Lincoln himself possessed--empathy, wisdom, balance, and creativity.\\" -- Doris Kearns Goodwin, Author of No Ordinary Time \\"When Lincoln's Quest for Union was first published, it was immediately recognized as the best-informed and most perceptive analysis of Lincoln's inner life. This new edition, extensively revised and expanded, is even more rewarding. This is a basic book in the Lincoln canon--a work of great intelligence, written with sensitivity and literary grace.

It was not until the discipline of archaeology emerged, in the nineteenth century, that the evidence of material culture could be used to form an image of the earliest societies in Greek lands. Only in the last 125 years have the Cycladic, Minoan and Mycenaean peoples been brought to light and an elaborate framework of dates, styles, periods and events constructed to enable us to understand the Aegean Bronze Age. Where have these 'facts' come from, and how accurately do they actually describe a remote period from which there is no written history? To trace the progression from a blank to a complex picture this book begins with the towering achievements of individuals such as Heinrich Schliemann and Arthur Evans, whose dramatic discoveries made them household names. The author then charts the consolidation and often controversial reinterpretation of their finds by succeeding generations, thereby raising fascinating questions about how archaeological knowledge is acquired and how our changing assumptions and attitudes shape our view of the ancient past.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_vQNAQAAMAAJ&dq=The+Discovery+of+the+Greek+Bronze+Age&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Arriba Comunicacion Y Cultura (Spanish Edition)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Ae4MAAAACAAJ&dq=Arriba+Comunicacion+Y+Cultura+(Spanish+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Facts the historians leave out","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=RUSotwEACAAJ&dq=Facts+the+historians+leave+out&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"I Shall Not Be Moved","description":"In her first book of poetry since Why Don't You Sing?

Merton's many biographers and the American press now say unanimously that he died from accidental electrocution. From a careful examination of the official record, including crime scene photographs that the authors have found that the investigating police in Thailand never saw, and from reading the letters of witnesses, they have discovered that the accidental electrocution conclusion is totally false. The widely repeated story that Merton had taken a shower and was therefore wet when he touched a lethal faulty fan was made up several years after the event and is completely contradicted by the evidence. Hugh Turley and David Martin identify four individuals as the primary promoters of the false accidental electrocution narrative. Another person, they show, should have been treated as a murder suspect. The most likely suspect in plotting Merton's murder, a man who was a much stronger force for peace than most people realize, they identify as the Central Intelligence Agency of the United States government. Thomas Merton was the most important Roman Catholic spiritual and anti-warfare-state writer of the 20th century. To date, he has been the subject of 28 biographies and numerous other books. Remarkably, up to now no one has looked critically at the mysterious circumstances surrounding his sudden death in Thailand. From its publication date in the 50th anniversary of his death, into the foreseeable future, this carefully researched work will be the definitive, authoritative book on how Thomas Merton died.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=iWnEswEACAAJ&dq=The+Death+of+Thomas+Merton:+A+Novel&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Thirteen Days","description":"\\"A minor classic in its laconic, spare, compelling evocation by a participant of the shifting moods and maneuvers of the most dangerous moment in human history.\\" Arthur M.

Few authors in any literature can rival Bandhopadhyaya's understanding of the child mind. He writes of Opu and Bruga and their friends, at home or out at play with a natural realism unmarred by adult condescension. The social environment is all-embracing: qork and holidays, religious festivals, daily worship and the grim rites of death. The reader senses the reality of family ties, the power of the supernatural in ordinary things, the relations between the castes and between rich and poor. In creating this picture of rural Bengal, Bandopadhyay has introduced us to an area of life which so far has been a closed book to foreign visitors to India, and which scholars know little about. The translation which faithfully reflects the changing moods of the original as well as its many variations of style, is the work of T.W.

Then, in another discourse, we are to study the subject from its more mystical side, to consider the relation of the human Spirit to the divine, and to try to see the conditions of the unfolding of the Christ in man. Those of you who are familiar with Christian teaching will remember how the great Initiate, S. Paul, pointed out that it was the intention of the Christian religion to bring about the birth of the Christ within the individual believer, and that the Christ-Child, thus born in the human Spirit, was to grow and to develop until the full stature of the Christ was reached in man. Until that becomes objectively true, as it is ever true implicitly, in the human being, Christ cannot become the first-born among many brethren, surrounded by, those who have reproduced in themselves His own likeness, so that the great family of the Sons of God shall be realised as the rationale of the evolution of the Sons of Man.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=l3_byQEACAAJ&dq=Super-Human+Men+in+History+and+Religion&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Among friends","description":"In this fast-paced novel about the bonds of friendship, Jenny, Emily, and Hillary, known as the Awesome Threesome, thought they d be a threesome forever.

Describes Gnostic anti-Judaism as directed primarily against the Jewish God and his law, rather than against the Jewish people who are their blind servants. Judaism for the Gnostics is more contemptible than dangerous, since its power is only in this world, to which the Gnostics attached no importance. Suggests that their hostility was aroused by Judaism's claim to equate its God with the higher God of Hellenistic thought. Paul took over much of the Gnostic two-power scheme, including the view of the Jews as blind servants of the Law. Argues that his own anti-Judaism did not go beyond that of the Gnostics. But in seeing the Crucifixion as central to salvation, and in singling out the Jews for a special role in salvation history, he added to the Gnostic two-power theology elements that later took shape as the Christian view of the Jews as Christ-killers and instruments of Satan.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=wOXYAAAAMAAJ&dq=Paul+and+Hellenism&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dark rapture;: The sex-life of the African Negro","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ZoGBAAAAMAAJ&dq=Dark+rapture%3B:+The+sex-life+of+the+African+Negro&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hunger Moon","description":"A debut novel in the vein of Anne Tyler and Alice Hoffman follows a single, pregnant woman as she flees to Boston to begin a new life and where she meets an elderly widow and an anorexic dancer.

Complaints abound: from inflated ticket prices, $6 hot dogs, and $9 beers to owners endlessly demanding new multimillion-dollar stadiums funded by public tax dollars. Those sitting in the owners  boxes are increasingly placing profit over players  performances and fan loyalty. Bad Sports cuts through the hype and bombast to zero in on tales of abusive, dictatorial owners who move their teams thousands of miles away from their fan base, use their stadiums as religious and political platforms, or hold communities ransom for millions of dollars of taxpayer money to fund their gargantuan stadiums. As the multibillion-dollar sports-industrial complex continues to lumber along, Dave Zirin is the voice in the wilderness, speaking out for the common fan with a tough, passionate, and intelligent voice that will remind readers that there is more to sportswriting than glowing athlete profiles.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=DEgiTalvVXwC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A history of the Roman world from 753 to 146 B.C (Methuen's history of the Greek and Roman world)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0kQAjwEACAAJ&dq=A+history+of+the+Roman+world+from+753+to+146+B.C+(Methuen%27s+history+of+the+Greek+and+Roman+world)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Miffy's Busy Morning","description":"Follows Miffy the rabbit as she wakes up, takes a bath, eats breakfast, and gets dressed.

This book is an in-depth historical survey of the Indians of the United States, including the Eskimos and Aleuts of Alaska, which isolates and analyzes the problems which have beset these people since their first contacts with Europeans. Only in the light of this knowledge, the author points out, can an intelligent Indian policy be formulated. In the book are described the first meetings of Indians with explorers, the dispossession of the Indians by colonial expansion, their involvement in imperial rivalries, their beginning relations with the new American republic, and the ensuing century of war and encroachment. The most recent aspects of government Indian policy are also detailed the good and bad administrative practices and measures to which the Indians have been subjected and their present situation. Miss Debo's style is objective, and throughout the book the distinct social environment of the Indians is emphasized an environment that is foreign to the experience of most white men. Through ignorance of that culture and life style the results of non-Indian policy toward Indians have been centuries of blundering and tragedy. In response to Indian history, an enlightened policy must be formulated: protection of Indian land, vocational and educational training, voluntary relocation, encouragement of tribal organization, recognition of Indians' social groupings, and reliance on Indians' abilities to direct their own lives. The result of this new policy would be a chance for Indians to live now, whether on their own land or as adjusted members of white society. Indian history is usually highly specialized and is never recorded in books of general history. This book unifies the many specialized volumes which have been written about their history and culture. It has been written not only for persons who work with Indians or for students of Indian culture, but for all Americans of good will.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=YWH9e5ieEHEC&dq=History+of+the+American+Indians,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Echoes of His Presence","description":"Journey back to the world of Jesus' day and take a historically- sound, culturally-accurate look at the Man, His ministry, and His message.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=uAWJFd4H2zMC&dq=Echoes+of+His+Presence&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ranma 1/2, Vol. 21","description":"Follows the adventures of half-boy, half-girl martial artist Ranma, whose transforming gender problems began at the Accursed Springs in China when he became cursed to turn into a girl when splashed with cold water, and back into a boy with hot water.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=RbKpjwEACAAJ&dq=Ranma+1/2,+Vol.+21&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Nature of Florida","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jb4lAAAACAAJ&dq=The+Nature+of+Florida&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Auf Deutsch!: Workbook (Student) Level 1-Eins","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jdRizoFw0N0C&dq=Auf+Deutsch!:+Workbook+(Student)+Level+1-Eins&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Garland of Mahamudra Practices","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xR0LAAAAYAAJ&dq=The+Garland+of+Mahamudra+Practices&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tampa Bay's Jewish communities (Research report)","description":"An exploration into the new Tibetan Buddhist religious community in New York City is an exploration into the community's involvement in the larger political environment.

T. Barnum called for examples of \\"all the uncivilized races in existence.  In response, the showman R. A. Cunningham shipped two groups of Australian Aborigines to the United States. They were displayed as \\"cannibals  in circuses, dime museums, fairgrounds, and other showplaces in America and Europe and examined and photographed by anthropologists. Roslyn Poignant tells the fascinating and often searing story of the transformation of the Aboriginal travelers into accomplished performers, professional savages who survived at least for a short time by virtue of the strengths they drew from their own culture and their individual adaptability. Most died somewhere on tour. A century later, the mummified body of Tambo, the first to die, was discovered in the basement of a recently closed funeral home in Cleveland, Ohio. Poignant recounts how Tambo s posthumous repatriation stimulated a cultural renewal within the community from which he came, exposing the roots of present social and economic injustices experienced by indigenous Australians.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=DAbwF-b56b4C&dq=Professional+Savages+:+Captive+Lives+and+Western+Spectacle&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Channels Of Desire: Mass Images and the Shaping of American Consciousness","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=CTkjVQfF5QkC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Snake River Ruins (The Trailsman #264)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Fully Exposed: The Male Nude in Photography","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=IN_vswEACAAJ&dq=Fully+Exposed:+The+Male+Nude+in+Photography&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"THE LIFE AND DEATH OF THE MAYOR OF CASTERBRIDGE.

Long hot afternoons / watching ants while the cicadas railed / in the Chinese elm about the brevity of life.  Time slows down in these poems, as Gilbert creates an aura of curiosity and wonder at the fact of existence itself. Despite powerful intermittent griefsover the women he has parted from or the one lost to cancer (an experience he captures with intimate precision)Gilbert s choice in this volume is to  refuse heaven.  He prefers this life, with its struggle and alienation and delight, to any paradise. His work is both a rebellious assertion of the call to clarity and a profound affirmation of the world in all its aspects.

These are: the need to maintain energy security in an energy-hungry world, the desire to move towards zero-emission vehicles and power plants, and the mitigation of climate change by lowering of CO2 emissions. New fuel cell materials, enhanced stack performance and increased lifetimes are leading to the emergence of the first truly commercial systems in applications that range from fork-lift trucks to power sources for mobile phone towers. Leading vehicle manufacturers have embraced the use of electric drive-trains and now see hydrogen fuel cells complementing advanced battery technology in zero-emission vehicles. After many decades of laboratory development, a global but fragile fuel cell industry is bringing the first commercial products to market. This thoroughly revised edition includes several new sections devoted to, for example, fuel cell characterisation, improved materials for low-temperature hydrogen and liquid-fuelled systems, and real-world technology implementation. Assuming no prior knowledge of fuel cell technology, the third edition comprehensively brings together all of the key topics encompassed in this diverse field. Practitioners, researchers and students in electrical, power, chemical and automotive engineering will continue to benefit from this essential guide to the principles, design and implementation of fuel cell systems.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=CuhRDwAAQBAJ&dq=Fuel+Cell+Systems&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Chapman Navigation Rules: International - Inland (Chapman's Guide to the Rules of the Road)","description":"This is the clearest, most fully illustrated version of the navigation rules that every captain must have on board in fact, boats 12 meters (or 39 feet) and longer are required to carry a copy.

Colson Whitehead, Pulitzer Prize-winning author of The Nickel Boys and Harlem Shuffle \\"...'My Monticello' is, quite simply, an extraordinary debut from a gifted writer with an unflinching view of history and what may come of it.\\"   The Washington Post Winner of the Weatherford Award in Fiction A winner of 2022 Lillian Smith Book Awards A young woman descended from Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings driven from her neighborhood by a white militia. A university professor studying racism by conducting a secret social experiment on his own son. A single mother desperate to buy her first home even as the world hurtles toward catastrophe. Each fighting to survive in America. Tough-minded, vulnerable, and brave, Jocelyn Nicole Johnson s precisely imagined debut explores burdened inheritances and extraordinary pursuits of belonging. Set in the near future, the eponymous novella,  My Monticello,  tells of a diverse group of Charlottesville neighbors fleeing violent white supremacists. Led by Da Naisha, a young Black descendant of Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings, they seek refuge in Jefferson s historic plantation home in a desperate attempt to outlive the long-foretold racial and environmental unravelling within the nation. In  Control Negro,  hailed by Roxane Gay as  one hell of story,  a university professor devotes himself to the study of racism and the development of ACMs (average American Caucasian males) by clinically observing his own son from birth in order to  painstakingly mark the route of this Black child too, one whom I could prove was so strikingly decent and true that America could not find fault in him unless we as a nation had projected it there.  Johnson s characters all seek out home as a place and an internal state, whether in the form of a Nigerian widower who immigrates to a meager existence in the city of Alexandria, finding himself adrift; a young mixed-race woman who adopts a new tongue and name to escape the landscapes of rural Virginia and her family; or a single mother who seeks salvation through  Buying a House Ahead of the Apocalypse.  United by these characters  relentless struggles against reality and fate, My Monticello is a formidable book that bears witness to this country s legacies and announces the arrival of a wildly original new voice in American fiction.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ICcQEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Greatest Gifts Our Children Give to Us","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=HBTHtwEACAAJ&dq=The+Greatest+Gifts+Our+Children+Give+to+Us&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Knowledge Capitalism: Business, Work, and Learning in the New Economy","description":"Knowledge Capitalism reveals how the emerging knowledge-based economy is redefining firms, empowering individuals and reshaping learning and work.

As astrophysicist Sir James Jeans wrote,  the Universe begins to look more like a great thought than like a great machine.

Mitchell died in February of 1998, millions mourned his passing. Our loss was the lead item on the national news, many newspaper obituaries ran for a full page, and as an extraordinary mark of respect, flags outside government offices across the land flew at half-mast. The man they mourned - and everyone in the Canadian book world whose life he had touched was personally saddened - was known above all as the author of Who Has Seen the Wind. And this edition - containing the full text - marrying W.O. Mitchell's text with the art of William Kurelek, has established itself as a classic. Since its publication in 1947, Who Has Seen the Wind has established itself in the hearts and minds of millions as a Canadian classic. The reasons for the book's classic status are not hard to find. As readers enter the world of four-year-old Brian O'Connal and his family and friends, they find characters that radiate life so convincingly that the book has a life of its own. No ordinary simple novel, it is the ageless story of childhood told with tenderness and humour and without sentimentality, and the picture of a small town anywhere, drawn with realism and understanding. This handsome edition marries W.O. Michell's prose with the inspired illustrations of one of Canada's finest and most popular artists, the late William Kurelek. The 8 full-colour paintings he produced, like the 32 black-and-white sketches that adorn the first page of every chapter, all come specifically from the text, and are illustrations in the very best sense.

This study examined whether character evidence influences mock jurors perceptions of a defendants guilt, focusing on the impeachment and rehabilitation of a character witnesss testimony. A pilot study was first conducted to examine the strength of character evidence statements; the primary study then utilized those pilot-tested statements. For the primary study, a total of 197 participants were included from a large northeastern university. This six-group study had two levels of character evidence (none or present), three levels of impeachment (none, a general character witness rebuttal, or a cross-examination of the defenses witness), and two levels of rehabilitation (none or presence of cross-examination/redirect). Results revealed that when character evidence was present, mock jurors found the defendant more likely to be guilty on a seven-point Likert scale. This was true even when there was an impeachment and/or rehabilitation of the character witnesss testimony.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=TDVlnQEACAAJ&dq=Character+Witness&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Way of the Road Warrior: Lessons in Business and Life from the Road Most Traveled","description":"The Way of the Road Warrior offers weary business travelersinspiration, advice, and practical skills for conquering thecompetition while conducting business on the road.

The still life is a practical, forgiving genre as it does not require the likeness of a portrait or the accurate proportions of the figure and, unlike the landscape, it doesn t change with the weather. Instead, it gives aspiring artists ample time to study and the opportunity to look closer. It can be used as a purely formal subject for drawing and painting techniques, or a platform for emotional expression using personal symbolism and imagery. However, though the still life is used throughout as a teaching tool, this is first and foremost a book about oil painting. It begins with simple compositions that build to more complex arrangements. Starting with essential information on how to best set up your studio including lighting, equipment, materials (paints, solvents, brushes, mediums), and preparing your canvas and paper for oil painting Still Life Painting Atelier then offers concrete lessons in a logical progressive sequence, with step-by-step illustrations, finished paintings, diagrams and tips. Chapters cover: ? How to address composition through thumbnail sketches and line drawings ? Using underpainting to study the characteristics of light and shade ? The basics of color theory and color mixing ? How to use a variety of brushes to create sharp and soft edges ? Techniques that are helpful when painting metal and glass ?

Similarly, The Ha-Ha, the latest offering from poet David Kirby, is both an exploration of the ways in which the mind invites chaos yet keeps it at a distance and an apologia for humor, reflecting Irish poet Patrick Kavanagh's observation that tragedy is merely underdeveloped comedy. Embracing wit, wide-ranging scholarship, and an equal love of travel as well as the pleasures of home, The Ha-Ha depicts comedy as a radical form of intelligence, a way of thinking that just happens to be noisy and rumbustious. We are staying with Barbara's parents on Oahu, and the first night we're there, I notice an angry-looking man is staring at me out of the neighbor's upstairs window and mumbling something, but the second night I realize that it's that poster of Bo Diddley from the famous Port Arthur concert, and there's a phone wirein front of his face that bobs up and down when the trade winds blow, which they do constantly, making it seem as though Mr. Diddley is saying something to me.

It highlights the importance of autobiographical writing not only as an opening into fiction writing, but also as a powerful therapeutic tool. Celia Hunt discusses how autobiographical fiction can be used in therapeutic work by art therapists, psychotherapists and creative writing tutors, as well as in personal development by writers of any kind. She draws up guidelines for a successful course on autobiography and creative writing, and presents case studies and practical ideas for writing about the self. She shows how writing autobiographical fiction can help people to explore significant events and relationships in their lives.

This book attempts to throw light on the question, one that has never been answered and rarely asked. In doing so, it involves the reader in many other themes of vital relevance to everyone -- not to those in recovery alone. This in-depth psychological study of the AA founder is generally based on the facts of Wilson's life, but not restricted to the literal truth: the prerogative of the novel. Some biographical events in Wilson's history have been passed over in favour of an intensive, original recreation of its key moments, from childhood to early middle-age, when the power of the depression was first felt. Chiefly a work of the imagination as this is, it is able to probe more deeply into the hidden life of its subject than non-fiction can do. According to the author, Bill W's depression may have been his salvation, and saved him from a worse fate. This book will introduce new readers to Bill Wilson -- \\"the greatest social architect\\" in Aldous Huxley's words of his century -- and one of the seminal voices of our age. It also provides a fresh look for those already familiar with his story.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-dORIFGulSkC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Going bananas: A collection of photographs with appeal","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=4aGdHAAACAAJ&dq=Going+bananas:+A+collection+of+photographs+with+appeal&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Five Books Of Moses: An Easy To Read Torah Translation","description":"Sol Scharfstein's new translation of the Torah (The Five Books of Moses) is written with a sense of piety and awe for the majesty and sanctity of the biblical text, it conveys the content of the Five Book of Moses in language that is easy to read and understand.

Since their earliest discovery in 1947, the Scrolls have been the object of fascination and extreme controversy. Challenging traditional dogma, Golb has been the leading proponent of the view that the Scrolls cannot be the work of a small, desert-dwelling fringe sect, as various earlier scholars had claimed, but are in all likelihood the remains of libraries of various Jewish groups, smuggled out of Jerusalem and hidden in desert caves during the Roman siege of 70 A. D. Contributing to the enduring debate sparked by the book's original publication in 1995, this digital edition contains additional material reporting on new developments that have led a series of major Israeli and European archaeologists to support Golb's basic conclusions. In its second half, the book offers a detailed analysis of the workings of the scholarly monopoly that controlled the Scrolls for many years, and discusses Golb's role in the struggle to make the texts available to the public. Pleading for an end to academic politics and a commitment to the search for truth in scrolls scholarship, Who Wrote the Dead Sea Scrolls? sets a new standard for studies in intertestamental history \\"This book is 'must reading'....

Selected by the Modern Library as one of the 100 best nonfiction books of all time  A towering biography . . . a brilliant chronicle.  Time This classic biography is the story of seven men a naturalist, a writer, a lover, a hunter, a ranchman, a soldier, and a politician who merged at age forty-two to become the youngest President in history. The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt begins at the apex of his international prestige. That was on New Year s Day, 1907, when TR, who had just won the Nobel Peace Prize, threw open the doors of the White House to the American people and shook 8,150 hands. One visitor remarked afterward,  You go to the White House, you shake hands with Roosevelt and hear him talk and then you go home to wring the personality out of your clothes.  The rest of this book tells the story of TR s irresistible rise to power. During the years 18581901, Theodore Roosevelt transformed himself from a frail, asthmatic boy into a full-blooded man. Fresh out of Harvard, he simultaneously published a distinguished work of naval history and became the fist-swinging leader of a Republican insurgency in the New York State Assembly. He chased thieves across the Badlands of North Dakota with a copy of Anna Karenina in one hand and a Winchester rifle in the other. Married to his childhood sweetheart in 1886, he became the country squire of Sagamore Hill on Long Island, a flamboyant civil service reformer in Washington, D.C., and a night-stalking police commissioner in New York City. As assistant secretary of the navy, he almost single-handedly brought about the Spanish-American War. After leading  Roosevelt s Rough Riders  in the famous charge up San Juan Hill, Cuba, he returned home a military hero, and was rewarded with the governorship of New York. In what he called his  spare hours  he fathered six children and wrote fourteen books. By 1901, the man Senator Mark Hanna called  that damned cowboy  was vice president. Seven months later, an assassin s bullet gave TR the national leadership he had always craved. His is a story so prodigal in its variety, so surprising in its turns of fate, that previous biographers have treated it as a series of haphazard episodes. This book, the only full study of TR s pre-presidential years, shows that he was an inevitable chief executive.  It was as if he were subconsciously aware that he was a man of many selves,  the author writes,  and set about developing each one in turn, knowing that one day he would be President of all the people.

This book draws on new research on Hindu-Muslim conflict in India to address this important question. Ashutosh Varshney examines three pairs of Indian cities one city in each pair with a history of communal violence, the other with a history of relative communal harmony to discern why violence between Hindus and Muslims occurs in some situations but not others. His findings will be of strong interest to scholars, politicians, and policymakers of South Asia, but the implications of his study have theoretical and practical relevance for a broad range of multiethnic societies in other areas of the world as well. The book focuses on the networks of civic engagement that bring Hindu and Muslim urban communities together. Strong associational forms of civic engagement, such as integrated business organizations, trade unions, political parties, and professional associations, are able to control outbreaks of ethnic violence, Varshney shows. Vigorous and communally integrated associational life can serve as an agent of peace by restraining those, including powerful politicians, who would polarize Hindus and Muslims along communal lines.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Ez1ZAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Middle powers in international politics","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=f1-uCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sawney Bean (Playscripts)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=s8o9AQAAIAAJ&dq=Sawney+Bean+(Playscripts)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Reading Roddy Doyle","description":" [Doyle] imparts a sense of poignancy and glimpses of happiness, of grief and loss and small moments of connection . . . you re left feeling close to dazzled.

In these ten beautifully moving short stories written mostly over the last year, Booker Prize winner Roddy Doyle paints a collective portrait of our strange times. A man abroad wanders the stag-and-hen-strewn streets of Newcastle, as news of the virus at home asks him to question his next move. An exhausted nurse struggles to let go, having lost a much-loved patient in isolation. A middle-aged son, barred from his mother s funeral, wakes to an oncoming hangover of regret.

This astonishing book lays bare the life and the mind of a man whose acts have left us horrified. His story provides an enormous amount of new information about his life and how it led to the Tate-LaBianca murders and reminds us of the complexity of the human condition. Born in the middle of the Depression to an unmarried fifteen-year-old, Manson lived through a bewildering succession of changing homes and substitute parents, until his mother finally asked the state authorities to assume his care when he was twelve. Regimented and often brutalized in juvenile homes, Manson became immersed in a life of petty theft, pimping, jail terms, and court appearances that culminated in seven years of prison. Released in 1967, he suddenly found himself in the world of hippies and flower children, a world that not only accepted him, but even glorified his anti-establishment values. It was a combination that led, for reasons only Charles Manson can fully explain, to tragedy. Manson s story, distilled from seven years of interviews and examinations of his correspondence, provides sobering insight into the making of a criminal mind, and a fascinating picture of the last years of the sixties.  A glimpse of part of the American experience that is rarely described from the inside . . . It compels both interest and horror.

Margot Asquith's remarkable role as the most intriguing of primeministerial wives is fully explored: her feuds with Lloyd George, her mistrust of the gutter genius Winston Churchill, and her hatred of Lord Northcliffe, the press baron who ultimately drove her husband from power in 1916. At the heart of the story are four of the Asquith children, Raymond, the brilliant scholar and outstanding President of the Oxford Union, who died leading his men into attack on the Somme; the shy Beb, artillery officer and poet, who overcame shell shock to face the horrors of Passchendale; Oc, whom General Freyberg - himself a VC - described as the bravest man I ever knew; and their mercurial sister Violet, her father's most ardent supporter but the bane of her jealous stepmother's life. Drawing for the first time on Margot Asquith's own journals, Asquith's letters to her, and a mass of hitherto unpublished correspondence, Colin Clifford provides an engrossing picture of a remarkable political family at a time of crisis.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=MVmCQgAACAAJ&dq=The+Asquiths&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Miss Hallberg's Butterfly Garden","description":"Miss Hallberg's Butterfly Garden is a 32-page illustrated story about butterflies and the remarkable woman whose life is devoted to them and their preservation.

The organizations include a shelter for battered women, a rape crisis center, a rape-prevention ride service, a residential facility for female offenders, and a statewide organization for chemically dependent women. Based primarily on interviews with 57 founders, staff, volunteers, and /or board members, the book traces into the mid-1980s how women translated their understandings of radical feminist ideology into goals, social change strategies, services, and organizational structures. Tales from the Trenches explores how members dealt with the problems created by antifeminist resistance as well as the dilemmas that characterized many feminist efforts in the early years of the women's movement. The extensive use of direct quotations in the book along with women's detailed accounts provide valuable examples of feminist practice based on thoughtful applications of feminist principles to specific circumstances rather than remaining within the confines of conventional assumptions or prescriptive politics.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ZHJ_NAt9oosC&dq=Tales+from+the+Trenches:+Politics+and+Practice+in+Feminist+Service+Organizations&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Brookhaven Connection","description":"In the wake of World War II and amidst a flurry of reported UFOs, the National Security Act was invoked in 1947 setting forth a policy of secrecy which has immersed the US government ever since in a labyrinth of security and intrigue.

However, the end of the war does not mean the beginning of peace for people on either side of the border. Indeed, the war is just one phase of a predictable escalation of tensions after the Pokhran nuclear tests of May 1998. How did the Kargil war come about? Were warnings of a conflict ignored? Was the war an unqualified military triumph? Was Prime Minister Vajpayee 'betrayed' by Pakistan, or in fact blind to ground realities? What are the connections between the Pokhran nuclear tests and the war? How was the US brought in as a mediator in the conflict? Did the BJP-led government succeed in bringing peace to Jammu and Kashmir? What political consequences will violence in Jammu and Kashmir have for the rest of India? What were Pakistan's objectives in sparking off the war in Kargil and has it really failed? Drawing on his experience of several years of covering Jammu and Kashmir as a journalist, Praveen Swami of Frontline magazine unearths vital data and analyses the long-term reasons behind the war, its course, and its consequences. In this revised and updated edition, the author analyses, among other things, the post-Kargil escalation of militancy in Kashmir, the Report of the Kargil Review Committee, and the recent proposals concerning the 'autonomy' of Jammu and Kashmir.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=yhFvAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Kargil+war+(Signpost+:+issues+that+matter)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Life and Times of Richard III (Kings and Queens of England Series)","description":"Concise account, placing the life of Richard III in its historical context","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ukOUQgAACAAJ&dq=The+Life+and+Times+of+Richard+III+(Kings+and+Queens+of+England+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Professional responsibility in a nutshell (Nutshell series)","description":"Structure, Scope and Supervision of Legal Profession; Duty to Make Legal Services Available; Attorney-Client Relationship; The Lawyer in the Legal System: Functions and Responsibilities.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ENNRAQAAIAAJ&dq=Professional+responsibility+in+a+nutshell+(Nutshell+series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Life Lessons My Mother Taught Me: Universal Values from Extraordinary Times","description":"EBONY is the flagship magazine of Johnson Publishing.

As Ember struggles to accept her future, St. George soldier Garret Xavier Sebastian is tasked with hunting her down.

Founder and first president of the Center for Humans and Nature, Donnelley was a pioneer in the exploration and promotion of the idea that human beings individually and collectively have moral and civic responsibilities to natural ecosystems. In this wide-ranging volume, Donnelley traces the connections between influential figures such as Aldo Leopold and Charles Darwin, as well as lesser-known but original thinkers that he met during the course of a full life -- ministers at his church, friends with whom he fished, and colleagues who shared his passion for research and writing. He grounds his work in classic philosophers such as Descartes, Spinoza, and Whitehead and reinterprets their writings about the natural world to develop a conservation-centered philosophy, which he dubs \\"democratic ecological citizenship.\\" Edited by his daughter, Ceara Donnelley, and Bruce Jennings, Frog Pond Philosophy illuminates the dominant strands of Donnelley's intellectual identity as a philosopher, naturalist, agitator, and spiritualist. Despite his often grim depiction of the current state of the environment, Donnelly never surrenders his faith in humanity's ability to meet its ethical obligations to conserve, respect, and nurture the complexity and diversity of the natural world. His vivid and personal essays, rooted in everyday experiences, offer a distinctive perspective on questions of urgent contemporary importance.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=YS9ADwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"BEYOND BELIEF (The Secret Gospel 0f Thomas)","description":"In Beyond Belief, renowned religion scholar Elaine Pagels continues her groundbreaking examination of the earliest Christian texts, arguing for an ongoing assessment of faith and a questioning of religious orthodoxy.

Digital Equipment Corporation created the minicomputer, networking, the concept of distributed computing, speech recognition, and other major innovations. It was the number two computer maker behind IBM. Yet it ultimately failed as a business and was sold to Compaq Corporation. What happened? Edgar Schein consulted to DEC throughout its history and so had unparalleled access to all the major players, and an inside view of all the major events. He shows how the unique organizational culture established by DEC's founder, Ken Olsen, gave the company important competitive advantages in its early years, but later became a hindrance and ultimately led to the company's downfall. Schein, Kampas, DeLisi, and Sonduck explain in detail how a particular culture can become so embedded that an organization is unable to adapt to changing circumstances even though it sees the need very clearly. The essential elements of DEC's culture are still visible in many other organizations today, and most former employees are so positive about their days at DEC that they attempt to reproduce its culture in their current work situations. In the era of post-dot.com meltdown, raging debate about companies ''built to last'' vs. ''built to sell,'' and more entrepreneurial startups than ever, the rise and fall of DEC is the ultimate case study.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=FEXCUAJJH_IC&dq=DEC+Is+Dead,+Long+Live+DEC:+The+Lasting+Legacy+of+Digital+Equipment+Corporation&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Highway Trade","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=y-wkAQAAMAAJ&dq=Highway+Trade&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Elbow Room","description":"Twelve short stories, including \\"Why I Like Country Music,\\" \\"The Silver Bullet,\\" \\"Problems of Art,\\" \\"Widows and Orphans,\\" and \\"A Sense of Story.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=hZVBDwAAQBAJ&dq=Elbow+Room&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"WHAT HAPPENED WHEN GRANDMA DIED","description":"When her grandmother dies, a young girl feels better after her mother reads Bible verses describing God's plan for everlasting life.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=uzqK9Lr8ilsC&dq=WHAT+HAPPENED+WHEN+GRANDMA+DIED&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Electronic Communication","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=kET-vQEACAAJ&dq=Electronic+Communication&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Silas Marner (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=MofiAAAAMAAJ&dq=Silas+Marner+(Classic+Collection+(Brilliance+Audio))&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Blessed Beyond Measure: Experience the Extraordinary Goodness of God","description":"Many people have an incorrect concept of God as an angry taskmaster, which hinders them from coming to Him and receiving what Jesus died to purchase for them.

Transformations in Twentieth Century Korea employs a thematic structure to discuss the interrelated elements of Korea s modernization within agriculture, business and the economy, the state, ideology and culture, and gender and the family. The essays in this volume encompass the Choson dynasty, the colonial period, and postcolonial Korea. Collectively, they provide us with an original and innovative approach to the study of modern Korea, and show how knowledge of the country s past is critical to understanding contemporary Korean society.

To this proposition it will be for these pages to find answer. Few men of their own free will seek seclusion, for does not man belong to the social vertebrates, and do not the instincts of the many rule? And when an individual is fain to acknowledge himself a variant from the type, and his characteristics or idiosyncrasies (as you will) to be so marked as to impel him to deem them sound and reasonable; when, after sedate and temperate ponderings upon all the aspects of voluntary exile as affecting his lifetime partner as well as himself, he deliberately puts himself out of communion with his fellows, does the experiment constitute him a messenger? Can there be aught of entertainment or instruction in the message he may fancy himself called upon to deliver? or, is the fancy merely another phase of the tyranny of temperament? We cannot always trust in ourselves and in the boldest of our illusions. There must be trial. Then, if success be achieved and the illusion becomes real and transcendental, and other things and conditions merely \\"innutritious phantoms,\\" were it not wise, indeed essential, to tell of it all, so that mayhap the illusions of others may be put to the test?","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=koUTAAAAYAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Ara Pacis Augustae & the Imagery of Abundance in Later Greek & Early Roman Imperial Art","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=E7FPAQAAMAAJ&dq=The+Ara+Pacis+Augustae&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Picasso (Getting to Know the World's Greatest Artists)","description":"This book provides an entertaining and humorous introduction to the famous artist, Pablo Picasso.

Drawn mostly from the daughters and wives of the working poor and declass  elites, prostitutes in Shanghai were near the bottom of class and gender hierarchies. Yet they were central figures in Shanghai urban life, entering the historical record whenever others wanted to appreciate, castigate, count, regulate, cure, pathologize, warn about, rescue, eliminate, or deploy them as a symbol in a larger social panorama. Over the past century, prostitution has been understood in many ways: as a source of urbanized pleasures, a profession full of unscrupulous and greedy schemers, a changing site of work for women, a source of moral danger and physical disease, a marker of national decay, and a sign of modernity. For the Communist leadership of the 1950s, the elimination of prostitution symbolized China's emergence as a strong, healthy, and modern nation. In the past decade, as prostitution once again has become a recognized feature of Chinese society, it has been incorporated into a larger public discussion about what kind of modernity China should seek and what kind of sex and gender arrangements should characterize that modernity. Prostitutes, like every other non-elite group, did not record their own lives. How can sources generated by intense public argument about the \\"larger\\" meanings of prostitution be read for clues to those lives? Hershatter makes use of a broad range of materials: guidebooks to the pleasure quarters, collections of anecdotes about high-class courtesans, tabloid gossip columns, municipal regulations prohibiting street soliciting, police interrogations of streetwalkers and those accused of trafficking in women, newspaper reports on court cases involving both courtesans and streetwalkers, polemics by Chinese and foreign reformers, learned articles by Chinese scholars commenting on the world history of prostitution and analyzing its local causes, surveys by doctors and social workers on sexually transmitted disease in various Shanghai populations, relief agency records, fictionalized accounts of the scams and sufferings of prostitutes, memoirs by former courtesan house patrons, and interviews with former officials and reformers. Although a courtesan may never set pen to paper, we can infer a great deal about her strategizing and working of the system through the vast cautionary literature that tells her customers how not to be defrauded by her. Newspaper accounts of the arrests and brief court testimonies of Shanghai streetwalkers let us glimpse the way that prostitutes positioned themselves to get the most they could from the legal system. Without recourse to direct speech, Hershatter argues, these women have nevertheless left an audible trace. Central to this study is the investigation of how things are known and later remembered, and how, later still, they are simultaneously apprehended and reinvented by the historian.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=oCaPQTdQUKoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Black Sailors: Afro-American Merchant Seamen and Whalemen Prior to the Civil War (Contributions in Afro-American and African Studies: Contemporary Black Poets)","description":"This is the first book to document thoroughly the lifestyle and collective experience of the many thousands of black sailors during this time period.

In their new book, S-Business: Reinventing the Services Organization, James A. Alexander and Mark Hordes offer a comprehensive and focused approach by which decision-makers in product, professional services and support services organizations can embrace services as a strategic weapon. This is the essence of S-Business.Giant organizations like IBM and General Electric, once thought of as pure product companies, are actively implementing s-business strategies. IBM Global Services generates more than $33 billion in annual revenue; for each dollar earned on software, $162 is paid out in services. Professional services firms such as Accenture and McKinsey are reinventing their marketing, delivery and alliances to meet the ever expanding issues and needs of customers and clients for comprehensive services. All segments of the economy will be touched by the new s-business paradigm shift. No organization of any size, in any market or geography, can afford not to implement an s-business strategy.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=H8Hb77lnTVIC&dq=S-Business:+Reinventing+the+Services+Organization&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Archer at Large","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=77XfXwAACAAJ&dq=Archer+at+Large&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Shania Twain: An Intimate Portrait of a Country Music Diva","description":"Shania Twain is not your average pop star.

It explores state construction in twentieth-century Afghanistan and Afghan nationalism, and explains the shifts in the state s policies and societal responses to different forms of governance of cultural diversity. The book problematizes liberalism, communitarianism, and multiculturalism as approaches to governance of diversity within the nation-state. It suggests that while the western models of multiculturalism have recognized the need to accommodate different cultures, they failed to engage with them through intercultural dialogue. It also elaborates the challenge of intra-group diversity and the problem of accommodating individual choice and freedom while recognising group rights and adoption of multiculturalism. The book develops an alternative approach through synthesising critical multiculturalism and interculturalism as a framework on a democratic and inclusive approach to governance of diversity. A major intervention in understanding a war-torn country through an insider account, this book will be of great interest to scholars and researchers of politics and international relations, especially those concerned with multiculturalism, state-building, nationalism, and liberalism, as well as those in cultural studies, history, Afghanistan studies, South Asian studies, Middle East studies, minority studies, and to policymakers.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=pSvJDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"New Arabian nights: The pavilion on the links and other tales (A Heron Books collection)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Jv4duAEACAAJ&dq=New+Arabian+nights:+The+pavilion+on+the+links+and+other+tales+(A+Heron+Books+collection)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Deadly Relations Bester Ascendant","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=82nWHAAACAAJ&dq=Deadly+Relations+Bester+Ascendant&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"American History Through Maps (Map Study Book)","description":"Throughout its history, America has been defined through maps. Whether made for military strategy or urban reform, to encourage settlement or to investigate disease, maps invest information with meaning by translating it into visual form. They capture what people knew, what they thought they knew, what they hoped for, and what they feared. As such they offer unrivaled windows onto the past. In this book Susan Schulten uses maps to explore five centuries of American history, from the voyages of European discovery to the digital age. With stunning visual clarity, A History of America in 100 Maps showcases the power of cartography to illuminate and complicate our understanding of the past. Gathered primarily from the British Library s incomparable archives and compiled into nine chronological chapters, these one hundred full-color maps range from the iconic to the unfamiliar. Each is discussed in terms of its specific features as well as its larger historical significance in a way that conveys a fresh perspective on the past. Some of these maps were made by established cartographers, while others were made by unknown individuals such as Cherokee tribal leaders, soldiers on the front, and the first generation of girls to be formally educated. Some were tools of statecraft and diplomacy, and others were instruments of social reform or even advertising and entertainment. But when considered together, they demonstrate the many ways that maps both reflect and influence historical change. Audacious in scope and charming in execution, this collection of one hundred full-color maps offers an imaginative and visually engaging tour of American history that will show readers a new way of navigating their own worlds.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2g1uDwAAQBAJ&dq=American+History+Through+Maps+(Map+Study+Book)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Training Wheels for Nurses: What I Wish I Had Known My First 100 Days on the Job: Wisdom, Tips, and Warnings from Experienced Nurses","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The VMEbus handbook","description":"Hardware -- Input/Output and Data Communications.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=TH2yQQAACAAJ&dq=The+VMEbus+handbook&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Alice in stitches","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=DKSiAAAACAAJ&dq=Alice+in+stitches&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Tarot: A Key to the Wisdom of the Ages","description":"Many students of the Western esoteric tradition consider Paul Foster Case's The Tarot the finest explanation that has yet appeared on the occult meaning of numbers, the construction of the Tarot, and the attribution of the 22 Major Trumps to the Hebrew alphabet.

The book circles around two life-changing moments. The assassination of her uncle, Salvador Allende Gossens, on September 11, 1973, sent her into exile and transformed her into a literary writer. And the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, on her adopted homeland, the United States, brought forth from Allende an overdue acknowledgment that she had indeed left home. My Invented Country, whose structure mimics the workings of memory itself, ranges back and forth across that distance accrued between the author s past and present lives.

However there is a dark side to this story that has never been fully told, which may help explain their circumspection. What began as an heretical Islamic sect founded in the early 1900s by Black circus magician, Noble Drew Ali, evolved over the century into a techno-tantric commune whose members managed to escape this befouled world into a pristine, Edenic parallel universe, a New Jersey Pine Barrens devoid of inhabitants. This latter rag-tag group built the 'Egg' -- a glistening Faberge-like device that enabled trans-dimensional travel into unpopulated mirror worlds (per the Everett-Wheeler-Graham model). A special quantum-tantric feature allowed passage for two occupants while they made love, irrespective of their race, age or gender. But wait, there's more!

For many, it springs from a practice of mindfulness, for others from the rituals of religion. But not everyone finds a connection with a Higher Power in those ways. Through daily reflection and meditation, In God s Care gifts a healing inspiration to our spirit. Steadily, we find spiritual growth. Recovery is an act of faith. An addict is promised healing and self-development through the rigors of counseling, treatment, therapy, and a Twelve Step program. With motivational guidance, addictive behaviors are abandoned, coping skills are learned, and sobriety is lasting. The cycle of addiction is broken by trusting in the process. This is the power of faith: a new way of life. Co-author Karen Casey, who wrote the bestselling recovery classic Each Day a New Beginning, harnesses this power to transform life s struggles into a devotional outlook. These heartfelt meditations encourage the optimism needed for continuous change. It doesn t matter what we call the goodness we wish to be and see God or otherwise. It only matters that we hold it in our hearts and affairs as we create a new life. That is the truest definition of a Higher Power.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ajnXDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Husk of Time: The Photographs of Victor Masayesva (Sun Tracks)","description":"Photographer and filmmaker Victor Masayesva, Jr., was raised in the Hopi village of Hotevilla and was educated at the Horace Mann School in New York, Princeton University, and the University of Arizona.

His work has been exhibited internationally, and he is perhaps best known for his feature-length film Imagining Indians. For Masayesva, photography is a discipline that he approaches in a manner similar to the way that he was taught about himself and his clan identity. As he navigates his personal associations with Hopi subject matter in varied investigations of biology, ecology, humanity, history, planetary energy, places remembered, and musings on things broken and whole, he has created an extraordinary visual cosmography.

While their segregated regiments served in the American West for the following three decades, the promise of Reconstruction gave way to the repressiveness of Jim Crow. But black men found a degree of equality in the service: the army treated them no worse than it did their white counterparts. The Black Regulars uses army correspondence, court-martial transcripts, and pension applications to tell who these men were, often in their own words: how they were recruited and how their officers were selected; how the black regiments survived hostile congressional hearings and stringent budget cuts; how enlisted men spent their time, both on and off duty; and how regimental chaplains tried to promote literacy through the army s schools. The authors shed new light on the military justice system, relations between black troops and their mostly white civilian neighbors, their professional reputations, and what veterans faced when they left the army for civilian life.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=non0DQAAQBAJ&dq=The+Black+Regulars,+1866-1898&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Day Before Sunrise A Novel","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The survival manual for the Floyd Rose tremolo","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The United Nations Exposed","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=G3unE1w5iRwC&dq=The+United+Nations+Exposed&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Prayer Flags: The Life & Spiritual Teachings of Jigten Sumgon","description":"Instructions for spiritual practice, especially the tantric path of Mahamudra.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=EL4eAAAAMAAJ&dq=Prayer+Flags:+The+Life&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Tuning of the World","description":"Entertaining recreations of soundscapes of past times and places precede a survey of methods for analyzing present-day soundscapes, distinguishing types of sound, and developing an understanding of the effects of sounds on us all.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=SIufAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Tuning+of+the+World&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Drac and the Gremlin (Picture Puffin)","description":"Playing in the backyard, a young girl, pretending to be Drac, the Warrior Queen of Tirnol Two, unites with a young boy, pretending to be the Gremlin, to save the White Wizard's planet from the Terrible Tongued Dragon.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=absyyFa_erMC&dq=Drac+and+the+Gremlin+(Picture+Puffin)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Galileo's Pendulum: From the Rhythm of Time to the Making of Matter","description":"Bored during Mass at the cathedral in Pisa, the seventeen-year-old Galileo regarded the chandelier swinging overhead and remarked, to his great surprise, that the lamp took as many beats to complete an arc when hardly moving as when it was swinging widely. Galileo s Pendulum tells the story of what this observation meant, and of its profound consequences for science and technology. The principle of the pendulum s swing a property called isochronism marks a simple yet fundamental system in nature, one that ties the rhythm of time to the very existence of matter in the universe. Roger Newton sets the stage for Galileo s discovery with a look at biorhythms in living organisms and at early calendars and clocks contrivances of nature and culture that, however adequate in their time, did not meet the precise requirements of seventeenth-century science and navigation. Galileo s Pendulum recounts the history of the newly evolving time pieces from marine chronometers to atomic clocks based on the pendulum as well as other mechanisms employing the same physical principles, and explains the Newtonian science underlying their function. The book ranges nimbly from the sciences of sound and light to the astonishing intersection of the pendulum s oscillations and quantum theory, resulting in new insight into the make-up of the material universe. Covering topics from the invention of time zones to Isaac Newton s equations of motion, from Pythagoras s theory of musical harmony to Michael Faraday s field theory and the development of quantum electrodynamics, Galileo s Pendulum is an authoritative and engaging tour through time of the most basic all-pervading system in the world.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=QyEsEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How to Do Biblical Theology (Princeton Theological Monograph Series) (Family Psychology and Counseling Series)","description":"The Practice of Pastoral Care has become a popular seminary textbook for courses in pastoral care and a manual for clinical pastoral education.

This new edition elaborates on and expands the author's previous work, adding an intercultural perspective that gives more attention to religious pluralism in the pastoral care setting.

The Georgics celebrates the crops, trees, and animals, and, above all, the human beings who care for them. It takes the form of teaching about this care: the tilling of fields, the tending of vines, the raising of the cattle and the bees. There's joy in the detail of Virgil's descriptions of work well done, and ecstatic joy in his praise of the very life of things, and passionate commiseration too, because of the vulnerability of men and all other creatures, with all they have to contend with: storms, and plagues, and wars, and all mischance.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=HTbFCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Platforms","description":"Michael Hyatt, one of the top business bloggers in the world, provides down-to-earth guidance for building and expanding a powerful platform.

By applying multiple linear regression analyses to a new data set on multi-party elections in Sub-Saharan Africa, the study investigates the relationship between political mobilizations and electoral competitiveness. It finds that the more societal groups engage in political mobilizations, such as protests and strikes, the more competitive elections become. Based on these results, the author argues for a change in the policies of international democracy assistance programs. The study s findings suggest that efforts to promote democracy would likely be more successful if international donors focused their support on organizations that have active constituencies and are willing to use their mobilization capacity to address ruling elites with political or socio-economic grievances.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=S46dDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Introduction to Stochastic Search and Optimization","description":"A unique interdisciplinary foundation for real-world problemsolving Stochastic search and optimization techniques are used in a vastnumber of areas, including aerospace, medicine, transportation, andfinance, to name but a few.

How we start each and every day affects everything--body, mind, spirit, family, work. We can begin in a combative mood, fighting with how things are, or we can begin in a peaceful mood, helping ourselves construct things the way we want them to be. Hugh Prather, in his writing and his life, opts for the latter. And in these Morning Notes, he invites us to live as if we think our world and the people in it are worth caring about, worth taking time for, worth changing. Love, forgiveness, self-healing, change--yes! Self-loathing, judgment, anger, prevaricating--no! The former help us realize our Oneness within ourselves, with other human beings, and with God. The latter prevent this realization. These 365 simple meditations take us a long way toward our spiritual home. Individually and as a whole they speak to the spiritual task of the 21st century--to wake up to our own responsibility for what happens to us.Hugh Prather is the author of 16 books, including Spiritual Notes to Myself, Love and Courage, The Little Book of Letting Go, How to Live in the World and Still Be Happy, and Shining Through. As a minister and radio talk-show host, he counsels couples, singles, teenagers, and families in crisis. He and his wife, Gayle, live in Tucson, Arizona.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=TxVzU6aRQl0C&dq=Morning+Notes:+365+Meditations+To+Wake+You+Up+(Prather,+Hugh)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Toll Bridge","description":"Everyone seems to know best when it comes to Jan's future - but he's still working out for himself who he really is.

Jim Whitehurst, celebrated president and CEO of one of the world's most revolutionary software companies, tells first-hand his journey from traditional manager (Delta Air Lines, Boston Consulting Group) and  chief  problem solver to CEO of one of the most open organizational environments he'd ever encountered. This challenging transition, and what Whitehurst learned in the interim, has paved the way for a new way of managing one this modern leader sees as the only way companies will successfully function in the future. Whitehurst says beyond embracing the technology that has so far disrupted entire industries, companies must now adapt their management and organizational design to better fit the Information Age. His mantra?  Adapt or die.  Indeed, the successful company Whitehurst leads the open source giant Red Hat has become the organizational poster child for how to reboot, redesign, and reinvent an organization for a decentralized, digital age. Based on open source principles of transparency, participation, and collaboration,  open management  challenges conventional business ideas about what companies are, how they run, and how they make money. This book provides the blueprint for putting it into practice in your own firm. He covers challenges that have been missing from the conversation to date, among them: how to scale engagement; how to have healthy debates that net progress; and how to attract and keep the  Social Generation  of workers. Through a mix of vibrant stories, candid lessons, and tested processes, Whitehurst shows how Red Hat has blown the traditional operating model to pieces by emerging out of a pure bottom up culture and learning how to execute it at scale. And he explains what other companies are, and need to be doing to bring this open style into all facets of the organization. By showing how to apply open source methods to everything from structure, management, and strategy to a firm's customer and partner relationships, leaders and teams will now have the tools needed to reach a new level of work. And with that new level of work comes unparalleled success. The Open Organization is your new resource for doing business differently. Get ready to make traditional management thinking obsolete.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WmPhBwAAQBAJ&dq=American+Voices:+Culture+and+Community+with+Student+Access+to+Catalyst&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Generation 2K: What Parents & Others Need to Know about the Millennials","description":"Wendy Murray Zoba's experience as a parent and youth worker, along with research, interviews and surveys provide her with a strong understanding of today's teenagers and how to guide them through a consumer culture and nurture their faith.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=yZ5vdlHGkYkC&dq=Generation+2K:+What+Parents&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Chilton's Auto Repair Manual 1940-1953","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=slmMrgEACAAJ&dq=Chilton%27s+Auto+Repair+Manual+1940-1953&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Power of Appreciative Inquiry: A Practical Guide to Positive Change","description":"Thoroughly revised and updated, this is the new edition of the bestselling guide to implementing the popular change methodology, Appreciative Inquiry, for organizations of all sizes and sectors. 20,000 copies of the 1st edition were sold.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6Ny3AQAACAAJ&dq=The+Power+of+Appreciative+Inquiry:+A+Practical+Guide+to+Positive+Change&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"THE MISSING BOOKS OF THE BIBLE (2 vols)","description":"The figures of Susanna, Judith and Judah Maccabee were all prominent features in European art, but their stories are missing from present-day Bibles.

Arguing that, unlike in Europe, where class formed around the nation-state, race deeply informed how class is defined in this country and, conversely, our unique relationship to class in this country helped in some ways to invent race as a distinction in social relations. Begins tracing this development in the slave plantations in 1600s colonial life. Examines how the social structures encoded there lead to a concrete development of racialization. Then takes us up to the present day, where forms of those structures still inhabit our public and economic institutions.

In this sixth volume in The Library of America's authoritative collection of his writings-the final volume of his fiction-America's greatest humorist emerges in a surprising range of roles: as the savvy satirist of The Gilded Age, the brilliant plotter of its inventive sequel, The American Claimant, and, in two Tom Sawyer novels, as the acknowledged master revisiting his best-loved characters. Also in this volume is the authoritative version of Twain's haunting last novel, No. 44, The Mysterious Stranger, left unpublished when he died. The Gilded Age (1873), a collaboration with Hartford neighbor Charles Dudley Warner, sends up an age when vast fortunes piled up amid thriving corruption and a city Twain knew well, Washington, D.C., full of would-be power brokers and humbug. The novel also gives us one of Twain's most enduring characters, Colonel Sellers, who returns in The American Claimant (1892), an encore performance that moves beyond the worldly satire of its predecessor into realms of sheer inventive mayhem. Tom Sawyer Abroad (1894) and Tom Sawyer, Detective (1896) extend the adventures of Huck and Tom. No. 44, The Mysterious Stranger (1908), an astonishing psychic adventure set in the gothic gloom of a medieval Austrian village, offers a powerful and uncanny exploration of the powers of the human mind.

Full of illuminating anecdotes and insightful observations involving prominent characters from the MAT and the European theatre of the early twentieth century, Chekhov takes us through events in his acting career and personal life, from his childhood in St. Petersburg until his emigration to Latvia and Lithuania in the early 1930s. Accompanying Chekhov's witty, penetrating, and immensely touching accounts are extensive and authoritative notes compiled by leading Russian Chekhov scholar, Andrei Kirillov. Anglo-Russian trained actor Bella Merlin provides a useful hands-on overview of how the contemporary practitioner might utilise and develop Chekhov's ideas. Chekhov was arguably one of the greatest actors of the twentieth century. His life made a huge impact on his profession, and his actor-training techniques inspired many a Hollywood legend  including such actors as Anthony Hopkins and Jack Nicholson -while his books outlining his teaching methods and philosophy of acting are still bestsellers today The Path of the Actor is an extraordinary document which allows us unprecedented access into the life, times, mind and soul of a truly extraordinary man.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=z29_AgAAQBAJ&dq=The+Path+Of+The+Actor&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Survival Instinct (Necromunda)","description":"This new series begins in a cyberpunk world where rival gangs fight for survival in a seedy, industrial underworld.

In 1861, the Dominican Republic was annexed to Spain. The Spanish empire expansionist policy sought to preserve Cuba and Puerto Rico, and the acquisition of the Dominican Republic strengthened Spain's hold on the Antilles Empire. Spain's policies strengthened the political objectives of the Dominican ruling class, which were political stability and control of the political power under a Caucasian empire. While both these objectives were achieved, the new colonial experiment was a total failure. The exclusion of the native ruling class, over taxation, economic exploitation, coercive imposition of the Catholic Church customs, prejudice against blacks and mulattos led to war, ending with the defeat of the Spanish Empire. This defeat opened a revolutionary cycle in the Spanish Caribbean.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zhaRTRsf03wC&dq=Biografia+Del+Dr.+Ramon+Emeterio+Betances+(Spanish+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"THE GRACE WAY ( God's Path to Successful Christian Living)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=AC86AAAACAAJ&dq=THE+GRACE+WAY+(+God%27s+Path+to+Successful+Christian+Living)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fables from the Garden (Kolowalu Book)","description":"A series of brief stories about animals and plants of Hawaii, each with a moral, such as \\"Friends respect, appreciate, and even celebrate each other's differences, \\" and \\"Excuses are like clouds; they carry no weight.\\" Includes scientific facts about the featured plants and animals.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=VaMBEAAAQBAJ&dq=Fables+from+the+Garden+(Kolowalu+Book)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Operation Moonlight Sonata: The German Raid on Coventry","description":"This book is an in-depth study of the Luftwaffe raid on Coventry, England, the night of November 14/15, 1940.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ej5nAAAAMAAJ&dq=Operation+Moonlight+Sonata:+The+German+Raid+on+Coventry&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Peter Behrens and a New Architecture for the Twentieth Century","description":"The complete story of Behrens' contribution to the history oftwentieth-century architecture.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2cpHqRiK3LcC&dq=Peter+Behrens+and+a+New+Architecture+for+the+Twentieth+Century&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Ring Movie Soundtrack Piano, Vocal, and Chords (The Lord of the Rings) (Pvg)","description":"Six selections from the blockbuster The Lord of the Rings, plus fantastic color photos from the movie!

Under successive military regimes, however, the country eventually ended up as one of the poorest countries in Asia, a byword for repression and ethnic violence. Richard Cockett spent years in the region as a correspondent for The Economist and witnessed firsthand the vicious sectarian politics of the Burmese government, and later, also, its surprising attempts at political and social reform. Cockett's enlightening history, from the colonial era on, explains how Burma descended into decades of civil war and authoritarian government. Taking advantage of the opening up of the country since 2011, Cockett has interviewed hundreds of former political prisoners, guerilla fighters, ministers, monks, and others to give a vivid account of life under one of the most brutal regimes in the world. In many cases, this is the first time that they have been able to tell their stories to the outside world. Cockett also explains why the regime has started to reform, and why these reforms will not go as far as many people had hoped. This is the most rounded survey to date of this volatile Asian nation.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=X4d2CgAAQBAJ&dq=The+gold+of+dreams&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Country House: Polish Theatre Archive (Polish Theatre Archives)","description":"This unique reference guide provides descriptions and evaluations of archive manuscript materials and ephemera relating to twentieth-century British and American theatre.

As anyone who has ever engaged in or tried to settle an argument on highly charged issues knows, facts rarely persuade in such situations. This innovative approach to intractable policy controversies shows how \\"reframing\\" the issues can succeed where simply appealing to facts often fails. In Frame Reflection, two of his country's leading organizational theorists and policy analysts show how disputes that in abstract debate or negotiation seem insoluble can sometimes be resolved pragmatically by those who actually have to design and implement the specific programs. The authors illustrate their theory through a detailed examination of three specific programs: the evolution of early retirement programs in Germany; a statewide project for the homeless in Massachusetts; and the development of Project Athena, a large-scale experiment in the use of computers in undergraduate education at MIT. Policy stalemates are inevitable. Yet we know that people sometimes do change their minds, even in situations that at first appeared hopeless. How that happens is the subject of this pathbreaking book.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=438QtAEACAAJ&dq=Frame+Reflection:+Toward+The+Resolution+Of+Intractrable+Policy+Controversies&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Teaching Guide to Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH (Discovering Literature)","description":"Designed to develop appreciation of literature & improve reading & comprehension skills.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=CdAHAAAACAAJ&dq=A+Teaching+Guide+to+Mrs.+Frisby+and+the+Rats+of+NIMH+(Discovering+Literature)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Ego Identity Crisis: Handbook for Enlightenment","description":"Why Not Attain Enlightenment? Wouldn't you like to be at peace, feel 100% fulfilled, and always be happy and blissful, as well as discover what reality is truly about? This handbook instructs one on the exact 'how to' of attaining enlightenment. Whereas most other books just explain the phenomenon of experiencing the Higher Self, this book actually teaches the entire process of transcending the ego and realizing one's true nature of the infinite as the Self. It provides the information in such a way that enlightenment would commonly occur within a matter of months, if one were to read it and apply its teachings. So why not take a step out of the finite and into the infinite? It can't hurt. All that you will discover is your Self! You will learn: What Reality truly is (the crystallization process, manifestation, creation, duality and Nonduality, the manifest and Unmanifest, levels of consciousness of the Universal Mind, ego [mind] and Self [Mind], and much more). That all form is actually an illusion that the ego has led itself to believe is real. What the ego is (limitation) and how it holds us back from being the Self (unlimited), and that suffering is an option and not a guarantee. How to deprogram the ego's structure to reveal Aware Mind. How all beings are One with God/Source/Truth. How to meditate, work with chakras, and comprehend the energetic field. That only positives exist and that negatives are just a state of mind (ego). That it is possible to experience peace, love, and joy for the rest of our lives.This is our mission: Once again to realize that we are a part of something greater, and that ultimately, we are All That Is. By simply knowing this, transcending begins. And by implementing the Truths (teachings) within this book, enlightenment becomes possible. To deny Truth is to deny oneself from knowing one's True Nature as infinite love. Aren't you ready to experience God? Now is the time to stop living in a dream and to start experiencing Reality!","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=pdJUPQAACAAJ&dq=The+Ego+Identity+Crisis:+Handbook+for+Enlightenment&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cowboy Proposes...

It was an era of emancipation for former slaves, settlement houses for immigrants, and colleges for women. Anti-saloon leagues called for the prohibition of alcohol, while citizens demanded labor regulations and food and drug laws. Confronted by all these forces of change, the Supreme Court appeared the bastion of conservatism in case after case as it defended the old moral and social order. Progressive reformers of the time as well as historians of the twentieth century have depicted the era's nine justices as aging reactionaries or, worse, accused them of championing a laissez-faire, imperialistic reading of the U.S. Constitution. Now, in Guardians of the Moral Order, Mark Bailey rises to their defense. The conservatism of the Supreme Court from 1860 through 1910, he argues, reflects not a conversion to the gospel of wealth but a steadfast belief in the vision of man and society grounded in eighteenth-century Enlightenment ideas and nineteenth-century moral science. As college students, the justices learned these values through the philosophy courses central to the antebellum curriculum. As judges, their understanding of the law as a branch of moral science influenced their rulings on a wide array of social, political, and economic issues. Taking the approach of an intellectual historian, Bailey examines the college education and legal training that these justices received. He then looks at their speeches and writings, both on and off the bench, to discover their views on such topics as the definition of private property, racial equality, and the rights of peoples in America's newly acquired territories. An unflagging faith in a divinely ordained natural order, he concludes, provided these men with their model for the social and moral order. The worldview cherished by these men was shared by many Americans educated in antebellum schools, colleges, and law offices. Theirs was not a reactionary conservatism rabidly opposed to change but a deeply ingrained belief in immutable moral truths upon which civilization itself depended. If we are to understand the Gilded Age, as Bailey so convincingly demonstrates, we must acknowledge that ideas matter.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=JxhrQgAACAAJ&dq=Guardians+of+the+Moral+Order:+The+Legal+Philosophy+of+the+Supreme+Court,+1860-1910&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Guide to Your Career, 5th Edition (Career Guides)","description":"Provides over one hundred samples of successful resumes and cover letters, as well as examples of key words and phrases to get job applications noticed.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=AxUEnwEACAAJ&dq=Guide+to+Your+Career,+5th+Edition+(Career+Guides)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How I Came to Know Fish","description":"These stories memorialize Ota Pavel's childhood in Czechoslovakia--his beloved family, the flash of fish in clear streams, and the annihilation of this world by the Nazis.

But debt is also reduced through financial repression, a tax on bondholders and savers via negative or belowmarket real interest rates. After WWII, capital controls and regulatory restrictions created a captive audience for government debt, limiting tax-base erosion. Financial repression is most successful in liquidating debt when accompanied by inflation. For the advanced economies, real interest rates were negative 1?2 of the time during 19451980. Average annual interest expense savings for a 12 country sample range from about 1 to 5 percent of GDP for the full 19451980 period. We suggest that, once again, financial repression may be part of the toolkit deployed to cope with the most recent surge in public debt in advanced economies.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=mbYZEAAAQBAJ&dq=The+debt+burden+and+debt+maturity+(NBER+working+papers+series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"1001 wonderful things: [a collection of photographs of remarkable things in the world of art and of nature, each accompanied by a brief description]","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ObE2Qg9rI0QC&dq=1001+wonderful+things:+%5Ba+collection+of+photographs+of+remarkable+things+in+the+world+of+art+and+of+nature,+each+accompanied+by+a+brief+description%5D&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Double Life of Pocahontas","description":"A biography of the famous American Indian princess, emphasizing her life-long adulation of John Smith and the roles she played in two very different cultures.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ATMqIy-evFMC&dq=The+Double+Life+of+Pocahontas&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Enlightenment for Everyone: A Practical Guide to Realizing Your True Nature","description":"Adam and Eve were not just naughty, disobedient children. They were created in God's image. They had God's desire for creative expression and awareness. As long as they remained in the Garden, they could not take the next step in their evolution. How do you convince a dependent, obedient child to leave home, especially if there is a comfortable bed and three gourmet meals served every day? Adam and Eve weren't going to make a conscious choice to leave the comforts of the Garden. The choice had to be made at an unconscious level. They were driven by a desire they did not yet understand. And so these two archetypal beings began a spiritual journey that would take them from sin to atonement, from ignorance to knowledge, from denial to responsibility. They would have to explore their darkness to find the light. They would have to become sinners to discover the blueprint for their redemption.

The Doctor s Daughter is a haunting portrait of a woman coming to terms with her family history and the fallibility of memory. One morning, Alice Brill awakes with a sudden awareness that something is wrong. There s a hollowness in her chest, and a sensation of dread that she can t identify or shake. Was it something she s done, or forgotten to do? As she scours her mind for the source of her unease, she confronts an array of disturbing possibilities. First, there is her marriage, a once vibrant relationship that now languishes stasis. Then there s her idle, misdirected younger son, who always needs bailing out of some difficulty. Or perhaps Alice s trepidation is caused by the loss of her career as an editor at a large publishing house, and the new path she s paved for herself as a freelance book doctor. Or it might be the real doctor in her life: her father. Formerly one of New York s top surgeons, he now rests in a nursing home, his mind gripped by dementia. And the Eden that was Alice s childhoodthe material benefits and reflected glory of being a successful doctor s daughter, the romance of her parents  famously perfect marriagemakes her own domestic life seem fatally flawed. While struggling to find the root of her restlessness, Alice is buoyed by her discovery of a talented new writer, a man who works by day as a machinist in Michigan. Soon their interactions and feelings intensify, and Alice realizes that the mystery she s been trying to solve lies not in the present, as she had assumed, but in the pastand in the secrets of a marriage that was never as perfect as it appeared. Like the best works of Anne Tyler, Sue Miller, and Gail Godwin, The Doctor s Daughter is private yet universal, luminous and revelatoryand marks the reemergence of a singular talent in American writing.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=mmqCoPamf8oC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Write me a poem, baby","description":"An anthology of juvenilia interspersed with Mr. Smith's comments.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=rSVLAAAAIAAJ&dq=Write+me+a+poem,+baby&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Car Games","description":"A collection of games to enjoy while traveling, including spotting games, guessing games, action games, imagination games, and word games.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-ilLf2SCsDoC&dq=Car+Games&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tobruk","description":"Tobruk was one of the greatest Allied victories  and one of the worst Allied defeats  of the Second World War.

Furthering Rommel s ascendency and souring relations within the British Commonwealth, it marked a turning point in Anglo-American relations in the fight against Adolf Hitler s Third Reich. Utilising a wealth of primary and secondary sources, Tobruk 1942 examines why the fortress fell to Rommel s Axis forces in just 24 hours when it held out against repeated attacks the previous year. Comparing the 1941 and 1942 battles, this book presents a new perspective on Tobruk  the isolated Libyan fortress, and symbol of Allied freedom, which for a period in the war captured the world s attention.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=HYYTDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Theory of Poverty and Social Exclusion","description":"Bill Jordan seeks to fill a gap in social scientific theory by accounting for why a deterioration in the living standards of the worst-off members of societies tends to coincide with the resurgence of free-market utopianism as a political creed.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=UmeNlFhsoMYC&dq=A+Theory+of+Poverty+and+Social+Exclusion&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Development of theoretical models of integrated millimeter wave antennas (NASA contractor report)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=K2g1AQAAIAAJ&dq=Development+of+theoretical+models+of+integrated+millimeter+wave+antennas+(NASA+contractor+report)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bidato: (October Pomo village) (Madrugada broadside)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=SosqOwAACAAJ&dq=Bidato:+(October+Pomo+village)+(Madrugada+broadside)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Istanbul Insight Guide (Insight Guides)","description":"Insight Guide Turkey is a comprehensive full-colour guide to the culture, history and people of this varied and youthful country.

Little did he know that among those released was Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, a man who would go on to become a terrorist mastermind too dangerous even for al-Qaeda and give rise to an Islamist movement bent on dominating the Middle East. Zarqawi began by directing hotel bombings and assassinations in Jordan from a base in northern Iraq, but it was the American invasion of that country in 2003 that catapulted him to the head of a vast insurgency. By identifying him as the link between Saddam and bin Laden, the CIA inadvertently created a monster. Like-minded radicals saw him as a hero resisting the infidel occupiers and rallied to his cause. Their wave of brutal beheadings and suicide bombings continued for years until Jordanian intelligence provided the Americans with the crucial intelligence needed to eliminate Zarqawi in a 2006 airstrike. But his movement endured, first called al-Qaeda in Iraq, then renamed Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or ISIS, seeking refuge in unstable, ungoverned pockets on the Iraq-Syria border. And as the Syrian civil war broke out in 2011, ISIS seized its chance to pursue Zarqawi's dream of a sweeping, ultra-conservative Islamic caliphate. Drawing on unique access to CIA and Jordanian sources, Joby Warrick weaves together heart-pounding, moment-by-moment operational details with overarching historical perspectives to reveal the long trajectory of today's most dangerous Islamic extremist threat\\"--","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=x2reDAAAQBAJ&dq=The+Headmistress+(Isis+General+Fiction)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Lord Told Me...

Fear of success, fear of persecution and imaginations are all ways that we limit God. We often see ourselves in a certain way but we have to change that image if we want to experience the abundant life that God has for us. To be able to see big things happen like healing, prosperity in finances and restoration of marriages, you have to let the Word of God paint a picture on the inside of you. Often, if you meditate on that and let the Word of God work, the limits are taken off and what you are praying to happen, will come to pass. In this book, author Andrew Wommack helps you to recognize the areas that you are limiting God so that you can move forward and fulfill His will for your life. Once you take the limits off God, watch what He will do in you and through you!","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=jvucDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Effective Medical Testifying: A Handbook for Physicians, 1e","description":"'Proving' the cause of the plaintiff's injury in personal injury litigation often entails significant challenges, particularly when science cannot identify the cause of a biological phenomenon or when the nature of this cause is debatable. This problem is frequently encountered in medical malpractice cases, where the limitations of scientific knowledge are still extensive. Yet judges must decide cases, however uncertain the evidence with regard to proof of causation. Reluctant to leave patients without compensation, courts have in some cases challenged their traditional approach to causation through recourse to such techniques as reliance on factual presumptions and inferences, the concept of loss of chance, and reversal of the burden of proof. This book analyses and criticises the use of these various techniques by the courts of England, Australia, Canada, France, and the civilian Canadian province of Quebec in confronting evidentiary causal difficulties caused by the uncertainties of medical science.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=1tPbBAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Managing the Veterinary Cancer Patient: A Practice Manual","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=kQdsQgAACAAJ&dq=Managing+the+Veterinary+Cancer+Patient:+A+Practice+Manual&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Painting in the Attic","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=YILvjgEACAAJ&dq=The+Painting+in+the+Attic&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Axemaker's Gift","description":"\\"A detailed, original and persuasive reading of cultural and intellectual history.\\" Los Angeles Times. \\"A genuine tour de force.\\" San Francisco Chronicle.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=rKlPEAAAQBAJ&dq=The+Axemaker%27s+Gift&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The New Treasury of Scripture Knowledge","description":"The New Treasury of Scripture Knowledge is an exhaustive cross-referencing tool for those seeking the truth in God's Word.

Switching back and forth between Lee (and his twin, Max) and Carver's degenerate leadership of their twenty-second century world, it touches on contemporary issues such as the environment, the third world, and stem cell research. Ronald Carver III will do anything to maintain his hold over the masses, and Lee will do anything to stop him. Their personal battle ranges from earth to outer space, and as they come closer to a final, all-encompassing showdown, the fate of society - and of the entire planet itself - hangs in the balance.Irish author David Murphy lives with his wife, son and daughter near Dublin where he writes, gives workshops and publishes the magazine Albedo One, of which he is a founding editor.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=kaabtzl1Z7QC&dq=Five+Star+Science+Fiction/Fantasy+-+Longevity+City&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"THE RISING SUN - TWO VOLUMES","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=zC8JAAAAQAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"America's garden book","description":"This updated work, a gardening standard since 1939, treats all aspects of gardening in the United States, adapting planting designs to today's smaller, more informal gardens","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2Nk6AQAAIAAJ&dq=America%27s+garden+book&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Night Falls Fast: Understanding Suicide","description":"From the author of the best-selling memoir An Unquiet Mind, comes the first major book in a quarter century on suicide, and its terrible pull on the young in particular. Night Falls Fast is tragically timely: suicide has become one of the most common killers of Americans between the ages of fifteen and forty-five. An internationally acknowledged authority on depressive illnesses, Dr. Jamison has also known suicide firsthand: after years of struggling with manic-depression, she tried at age twenty-eight to kill herself. Weaving together a historical and scientific exploration of the subject with personal essays on individual suicides, she brings not only her remarkable compassion and literary skill but also all of her knowledge and research to bear on this devastating problem. This is a book that helps us to understand the suicidal mind, to recognize and come to the aid of those at risk, and to comprehend the profound effects on those left behind. It is critical reading for parents, educators, and anyone wanting to understand this tragic epidemic.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=SFM-o1kA5BUC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Teach Yourself Borland JBuilder 21 Days: With CDROM (Sams Teach Yourself)","description":"Offers instruction in the fundamentals of Java while profiling the new and advanced features of JBuilder 2","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=HFEiAQAAIAAJ&dq=Teach+Yourself+Borland+JBuilder+21+Days:+With+CDROM+(Sams+Teach+Yourself)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Family Learning: How to Help Your Children Succeed in School by Learning at Home","description":"Children in today's world are inundated with information about who to be, what to do and how to live. But what if there was a way to teach children how to manage priorities, focus on goals and be a positive influence on the world around them? The Leader in Meis that programme. It's based on a hugely successful initiative carried out at the A.B. Combs Elementary School in North Carolina. To hear the parents of A. B Combs talk about the school is to be amazed. In 1999, the school debuted a programme that taught The 7 Habits of Highly Effective Peopleto a pilot group of students. The parents reported an incredible change in their children, who blossomed under the programme. By the end of the following year the average end-of-grade scores had leapt from 84 to 94. This book will launch the message onto a much larger platform. Stephen R. Covey takes the 7 Habits, that have already changed the lives of millions of people, and shows how children can use them as they develop. Those habits -- be proactive, begin with the end in mind, put first things first, think win-win, seek to understand and then to be understood, synergize, and sharpen the saw -- are critical skills to learn at a young age and bring incredible results, proving that it's never too early to teach someone how to live well.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=oWX6JLCpHKcC&dq=Family+Learning:+How+to+Help+Your+Children+Succeed+in+School+by+Learning+at+Home&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Encountering God: A Spiritual Journey from Bozeman to Banaras","description":"Religion scholar Diana Eck is director of the Pluralism Project, which seeks to map the new religious diversity of the United States, particularly the increasing presence of Hindu, Buddhist, and Muslim communities.

In her innovative book, she demonstrates how teachers can guide their students by showing them how insights from communication theory, discourse analysis, pragmatics, and semiotics illuminate the translation process. Challenging long-held assumptions, she establishes a fascinating framework on which to base the structure of a professional prose-translation class. Her original contributions to the question of directionatliy and to the specific strategies of tranlsating are applicable to not only the teaching of translation from Spanish to English, but to other teaching situations and to other pairs of languages as well. She also reviews the latest attempts in translation theory to define and contextualize ideal translator competence, student translator competence, and general translation strategies. Beeby Lonsdale completes her book by applying her conclusions to selecting and organizing the content of teaching translation from Spanish to English. She illustrates one or more of the basic translation principles through 29 teaching units, which are prefaced by objectives, tasks, and commentaries for the teacher, and through 48 task sheets, which show how to present the material to students.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=qW2kiADQhHQC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The confessions of a beachcomber","description":"Does the fact that a weak mortal sought an unprofaned sanctuary-an island removed from the haunts of men-and there dwelt in tranquillity, happiness and security, represent any just occasion for the relation of his experiences-experiences necessarily out of the common?

Few men of their own free will seek seclusion, for does not man belong to the social vertebrates, and do not the instincts of the many rule? And when an individual is fain to acknowledge himself a variant from the type, and his characteristics or idiosyncrasies (as you will) to be so marked as to impel him to deem them sound and reasonable; when, after sedate and temperate ponderings upon all the aspects of voluntary exile as affecting his lifetime partner as well as himself, he deliberately puts himself out of communion with his fellows, does the experiment constitute him a messenger? Can there be aught of entertainment or instruction in the message he may fancy himself called upon to deliver? or, is the fancy merely another phase of the tyranny of temperament? We cannot always trust in ourselves and in the boldest of our illusions. There must be trial.

Girls and women were once second-class citizens in the nation's schools. Americans responded w ith concerted efforts to give girls and women the attention and assistance that was long overdue. Now, after two major waves of feminism and decades of policy reform, women have made massive strides in education. Today they outperform men in nearly every measure of social, academic, and vocational well-being. Christina Hoff Sommers contends that it's time to take a hard look at present-day realities and recognize that boys need help. Called \\"provocative and controversial . . . impassioned and articulate\\" (\\"The Christian Science M\\"onitor), this edition of \\"The War Against Boys\\" offers a new preface and six radically revised chapters, plus updates on the current status of boys throughout the book. Sommers argues that the problem of male underachievement is persistent and worsening. Among the new topics Sommers tackles: how the war against boys is harming our economic future, and how boy-averse trends such as the decline of recess and zero-tolerance disciplinary policies have turned our schools into hostile environments for boys. As our schools become more feelings-centered, risk-averse, competition-free, and sedentary, they move further and further from the characteristic needs of boys. She offers realistic, achievable solutions to these problems that include boy-friendly pedagogy, character and vocational education, and the choice of single-sex classrooms. \\"The War Against Boys\\" is an incisive, rigorous, and heartfelt argument in favor of recognizing and confronting a new reality: boys are languishing in education and the price of continued neglect is economically and socially prohibitive.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=aQBxCgAAQBAJ&dq=The+War+Against+Men&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Selected Stories of Eudora Welty Containing All of a Curtain of Green and Other Stories and the Wide Net and Other Stories","description":"Eudora Welty's subjects are the people who live in southern towns like Jackson, Mississippi, which has been her home for all of her long life.

By shattering state control over information and giving a platform to long-stifled voices, these new Arab media have challenged the status quo by encouraging open debate about Iraq, Palestine, Islamism, Arab identity, and other vital political and social issues. These public arguments have redefined what it means to be Arab and reshaped the realm of political possibility. As Marc Lynch shows, the days of monolithic Arab opinion are over. How Arab governments and the United States engage this newly confident and influential public sphere will profoundly shape the future of the Arab world. Marc Lynch draws on interviews conducted in the Middle East and analyses of Arab satellite television programs, op-ed pages, and public opinion polls to examine the nature, evolution, and influence of the new Arab public sphere. Lynch, who pays close attention to what is actually being said and talked about in the Arab world, takes the contentious issue of Iraq-which has divided Arabs like no other issue-to show how the media revolutionized the formation and expression of public opinion. He presents detailed discussions of Arab arguments about sanctions and the 2003 British and American invasion and occupation of Iraq. While Arabs strongly disagreed about Saddam's regime, they increasingly saw the effects of sanctions as a potent symbol of the suffering of all Arabs. Anger and despair over these sanctions shaped Arab views of America, their governments, and themselves. Lynch also suggests how the United States can develop and improve its engagement with the Arab public sphere. He argues that the United States should move beyond treating the Arab public sphere as either an enemy to be defeated or an object to be manipulated via public relations. Instead of wasting vast sums of money on a satellite television station nobody watches, the United States should enter the public sphere as it really exists.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=AkyrAgAAQBAJ&dq=Sexual+Orientation+and+Gender+Expression+in+Social+Work+Practice:+Working+with+Gay,+Lesbian,+Bisexual,+and+Transgender+People&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Civic Biology: Presented in Problems","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=C8EXAAAAIAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Magic in my shoes","description":"Put on your favorite pair of shoes and join in on a magical adventure your little one is sure to enjoy!","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=UMeYzAEACAAJ&dq=Magic+in+my+shoes&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Manchester Slingbacks Pb","description":"An indispensable sampling of the vast assortment of publications which exist as an adjunct to the mainstream press, or which promote themes and ideas that may be defined as pop culture, alternative, underground or subversive.

He goes on to chart the resurgence of the idea within communitarian thought, the complications and critiques of multiculturalism, and its new manifestations within a society where new modes of communication produce both fragmentation and the possibilities of new social bonds. Contemporary community, he argues, is essentially a communication community based on new kinds of belonging.

Between America's retreat from China in late November 1941 and the moment General MacArthur's airplane touched down on the Japanese mainland in August of 1945, five men connected by happenstance fought the key battles of the war against Japan. From the debacle in Bataan, to the miracle at Midway and the relentless vortex of Guadalcanal, their solemn oaths to their country later led one to the Great Marianas Turkey Shoot and the others to the coral strongholds of Peleliu, the black terraces of Iwo Jima and the killing fields of Okinawa, until at last the survivors enjoyed a triumphant, yet uneasy, return home. In The Pacific, Hugh Ambrose focuses on the real-life stories of five men who put their lives on the line for our country.

McDougal lived in Asia for twenty years, including ten years in the Philippines from 1972 to 1982. His impeccable research stems from an academic background whose credentials include a bachelor of science degree from the University of Georgia, a master's degree from the Asian Institute of Management, and a doctorate in business from the University of the Philippines. The data he gathered for his doctoral dissertation was the genesis of his 1987 book \\"The Marcos File\\", which exposed the Marcos regime for its corruption and excesses. It was while working on a book about Marcos' hidden wealth that he stumbled on the story of a treasure hunt headed by Marcos. His close friendship with the national security director provided him access to the corridors of power. He was asked to find out the truth, both about the legendary treasure and the Marcos gold. His academic credentials, plus his military background-- he was a captain in the Green Berets in Vietnam-- made him a natural choice. He returned to the Philippones. A cave-in killed two of his men and overnight this top-secret operation made the front page of almost every major newspaper in the world.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=aPNmAAAAMAAJ&dq=Asian+Loot:+Unearthing+the+Secrets+of+Marcos,+Yamashita+and+the+Gold&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Vernacular Drawings","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=wnNQAAAAMAAJ&dq=Vernacular+Drawings&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Native Roots: How the Indians Enriched America","description":"\\"Well written, imagery-ridden...A tale of what was, what became, and what is today regarding the Indian relation to the European civilization that 'grafted' itself onto this ancient system.'\\" (Minneapolis Star Tribune) Conventional American history holds that the white settlers of the New World re-created the societies they had known in England, France, and Spain. But as anthropologist Jack Weatherford, author of INDIAN GIVERS, brilliantly shows, the Europeans actually grafted their civilization onto the deep and nourishing roots of Native American customs and beliefs.

It was published on 8 June 1949 by Secker & Warburg as Orwell's ninth and final book completed in his lifetime. Thematically, \\"Nineteen Eighty-Four\\" centres on the consequences of totalitarianism, mass surveillance, and repressive regimentation of persons and behaviours within society. Orwell, himself a democratic socialist, modelled the authoritarian government in the novel after Stalinist Russia. More broadly, the novel examines the role of truth and facts within politics and the ways in which they are manipulated. The story takes place in an imagined future, the year 1984, when much of the world has fallen victim to perpetual war, omnipresent government surveillance, historical negationism, and propaganda. Great Britain, known as Airstrip One, has become a province of a totalitarian superstate named Oceania that is ruled by the Party who employ the Thought Police to persecute individuality and independent thinking. Big Brother, the leader of the Party, enjoys an intense cult of personality despite the fact that he may not even exist. The protagonist, Winston Smith, is a diligent and skillful rank-and-file worker and Outer Party member who secretly hates the Party and dreams of rebellion. He enters into a forbidden relationship with a colleague, Julia, and starts to remember what life was like before the Party came to power.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=PEpoEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rexx in the TSO Environment (The QED IBM mainframe series)","description":"Instant productivity increases are guaranteed with this book.

Networked collaborations of artists did not begin on the Internet. In this multidisciplinary look at the practice of art that takes place across a distance--geographical, temporal, or emotional--theorists and practitioners examine the ways that art, activism, and media fundamentally reconfigured each other in experimental networked projects of the 1970s and 1980s. By providing a context for this work--showing that it was shaped by varying mixes of social relations, cultural strategies, and political and aesthetic concerns-- At a Distance effectively refutes the widely accepted idea that networked art is technologically determined. Doing so, it provides the historical grounding needed for a more complete understanding of today's practices of Internet art and activism and suggests the possibilities inherent in networked practice. At a Distance traces the history and theory of such experimental art projects as Mail Art, sound and radio art, telematic art, assemblings, and Fluxus. Although the projects differed, a conceptual questioning of the \\"art object,\\" combined with a political undermining of dominant art institutional practices, animated most distance art. After a section that sets this work in historical and critical perspective, the book presents artists and others involved in this art \\"re-viewing\\" their work--including experiments in \\"mini-FM,\\" telerobotics, networked psychoanalysis, and interactive book construction. Finally, the book recasts the history of networks from the perspectives of politics, aesthetics, economics, and cross-cultural analysis.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ri36wNZoqVkC&dq=At+a+Distance:+Precursors+to+Art+and+Activism+on+the+Internet+(Leonardo+Book+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Economic Approaches to Organizations","description":"Now in its fifth edition, Economic Approaches to Organisations remains one of the few texts to emphasize the importance of economic issues and developments in the study of organisations and management.

Male sexuality comes of age in this provocative collection of personal essays and poetry. Male Lust's nearly 60 contributors explore emotional, social, and political aspects of sex and desire from a diversity of backgrounds, perspectives, and sexual orientations. Answering the long-standing challenge for men to finally theorize the complexity of their own sexual desires, Male Lust (a 2001 Lambda Gay Studies Literary Award Finalist) delves into topics such as commercial sex, sadomasochism, feminism, and white supremacy without lapsing into reactionary, knee-jerk or misogynist stances. This book offers a positive sexual vision that moves far beyond the narrow messages offered in mainstream media. Male Lust reveals thoughtful, detailed realities of gay, straight, bisexual, transgender, and same-gender-loving men's personal experiences with sex that lurk behind the stereotypes. Among the many topics that the essays, stories, and poems herein chronicle are: various facets of men's and women's experience with commercial sex, both as consumers and providers social and hormonal phenomena involved in transitioning from female to male handling the impact of white supremacy on male lust as a man of color the transformational possibilities of S/M women's responses to the lusts of the men in their lives coming of age with a  deviant  gender or sexual orientation healing from rape and other forms of sexual abuse coming to terms with loving and desiring women within a misogynist culture lust and desire within a disabled body Together, the contributors break the noisy silence surrounding male lust, challenge the dominant images of men as unemotional sexual predators, and expose the live, beating hearts, minds, and souls of real men loving, healing, and revealing themselves, each other, and the women in their lives.

Landowners wrangled bitterly over boundaries with neighbors and contested areas became known as \\"the devil's lane.\\" Violence and bloodshed were but some of the consequences to befall those who ventured into these disputed territories. The Devil's Lane highlights important new work on sexuality, race, and gender in the South from the seventeenth- to the nineteenth-centuries. Contributors explore legal history by examining race, crime and punishment, sex across the color line, and slander. Emerging stars and established scholars such as Peter Wood and Carol Berkin weave together the fascinating story of competing agendas and clashing cultures on the southern frontier. One chapter focuses on a community's resistance to a hermaphrodite, where the town court conducted a series of \\"examinations\\" to determine the individual's gender. Other pieces address topics ranging from resistance to sexual exploitation on the part of slave women to spousal murders, from interpreting women's expressions of religious ecstasy to a pastor's sermons about depraved sinners and graphic depictions of carnage, all in the name of \\"exposing\\" evil, and from a case of infanticide to the practice of state-mandated castration. Several of the authors pay close attention to the social and personal dynamics of interracial women's networks and relationships across place and time. The Devil's Lane illuminates early forms of sexual oppression, inviting comparative questions about authority and violence, social attitudes and sexual tensions, the impact of slavery as well as the twisted course of race relations among blacks, whites, and Indians. Several scholars look particularly at the Gulf South, myopically neglected in traditional literature, and an outstanding feature of this collection. These eighteen original essays reveal why the intersection of sex and race marks an essential point of departure for understanding southern social relations, and a turning point for the field of colonial history. The rich, varied and distinctive experiences showcased in The Devil's Lane provides an extraordinary opportunity for readers interested in women's history, African American history, southern history, and especially colonial history to explore a wide range of exciting issues.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=37q5j7Ix-fkC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Buffy the Vampire Slayer: Chosen","description":"INTO EVERY GENERATION A SLAYER IS BORN Before Buffy, the world has been protected by Chosen Ones with the strength and spirit to fight evil in every form it takes.

However, from mid-1943 as the War drug on, the Stuka began incurring heavy losses. Dunkirk, Warsaw, Rotterdam, and other early victories became distant memories as severe reversals came about in the East. Wherever possible and often against overwhelming resources, the Stukas supported the retreating German armies by conducting not just precision dive-bombing missions, but low-level ground attack operations against enemy transport targets, gun positions, and ships. This second and concluding volume in this series examines the role of the Stuka during these years of retreat. Aspects of the Stuka's role, which the book recounts, includes the attacks against the Malta convoys, the retreat in North Africa, the war over the Arctic, the Russian campaign including the battle for Stalingrad, and the collapse of the Eastern front.

This is not just another edition of the book; it is a major rewriting and reorganization of the previous edition. The new edition is expanded and updated to reflect recent advances in the field, offering in-depth treatment of diagnostic plots, time series regression, multicollinearity, and logistic regression. Suitable for anyone with an understanding of elementary statistics, Regression Analysis by Example, Third Edition illustrates methods of regression analysis, with examples containing the types of irregularities commonly encountered in the real world. Each example isolates one or two techniques and features detailed discussions of the techniques themselves, the required assumptions, and the evaluated success of each technique. Each of the methods described can be carried out with most currently available statistical software packages.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=LUlsQgAACAAJ&dq=Regression+Analysis+by+Example,+3rd+Edition&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Murder on the Menu","description":"Best friends Annie and Eve know the bare bones of both culinary school and amateur sleuthing.

With cinematic immediacy and meticulous attention to historical detail, here is the true story of a legendary sixteenth-century explorer and his death-defying navigation of the Amazon river of darkness, pathway to gold. In 1541, the brutal conquistador Gonzalo Pizarro and his well-born lieutenant Francisco Orellana set off from Quito in search of La Canela, South America s rumored Land of Cinnamon, and the fabled El Dorado,  the golden man.  Driving an enormous retinue of mercenaries, enslaved natives, horses, hunting dogs, and other animals across the Andes, they watched their proud expedition begin to disintegrate even before they descended into the nightmarish jungle, following the course of a powerful river. Soon hopelessly lost in the swampy labyrinth, their numbers diminishing daily through disease, starvation, and Indian attacks, Pizarro and Orellana made a fateful decision to separate. While Pizarro eventually returned home barefoot and in rags, Orellana and fifty-seven men, in a few fragile craft, continued downriver into the unknown reaches of the mighty Amazon, serenaded by native war drums and the eerie cries of exotic predators. Theirs would be the greater glory. Interweaving eyewitness accounts of the quest with newly uncovered details, Buddy Levy reconstructs the seminal journey that has electrified adventurers ever since, as Orellana became the first European to navigate and explore the entire length of the world s largest river. Levy gives a long-overdue account of the native populations some peaceful and welcoming, offering sustenance and life-saving guidance, others ferociously hostile, subjecting the invaders to gauntlets of unremitting attack and intimations of terrifying rituals. And here is the Amazon itself, a powerful presence whose every twist and turn held the promise of new wonders both natural and man-made, as well as the ever-present risk of death a river that would hold Orellana in its irresistible embrace to the end of his life. Overflowing with violence and beauty, nobility and tragedy, River of Darkness is both riveting history and a breathtaking adventure that will sweep readers along on an epic voyage unlike any other.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=j4qP-GCsHfEC&dq=River+of+Darkness&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Little Bo-Peep (A Rand McNally Junior Elf Book, No. 8010)","description":"Follow Little Bo-Peep to find her sheep all comfy and cozy.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=rYKDAAAACAAJ&dq=Little+Bo-Peep+(A+Rand+McNally+Junior+Elf+Book,+No.+8010)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Mouth Like Yours","description":"Open Your Mouth Like A Bell is ultimately a book of love poems to poetry itself, or rather, to the gift of language and its powerful mercury. \\"Sincerity is the only currency I bring,\\" writes Mindy Nettifee in her haunting poem \\"Election Eve,\\" a piece composed in a state of not-knowing, just days before the 2016 U.S. election that delivered the presidency to Donald Trump. In this third full-length collection of poetry, Nettifee's powers are on the wax. The book follows a course of descent, tapping wells and constructing thresholds to underworlds. She's plumbing the dark unknown, in search of wild memory and buried trauma and the stories of the dead. She is seeking the roots of the personal, familial and cultural madness blossoming aboveground. Her studies of the unconscious mind, archetypal psychology and western mysticism are in conversation with punk chaos, feminist politics, and the evolution of kissing. The lineage of poems as spells is humming and cracking beneath the surface, asking questions about what it takes to imagine, create and enact change. Nettifee won't banish the mystery, but does not leave us in the dark. By the end of the book we are led up and full circle, reinitiated into the bright, light-filled, mundane world. Only everything has changed. Here, in the surreal real and the strange and sacred ordinary, we must use our own voices to emotionally echolocate, to sense new landscapes both inside and out. We must tell the stories it is impossible to tell. We must speak until we feel the ring of truth.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=KjJbDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Vulnerable Populations in the United States (Public Health/Vulnerable Populations)","description":"Based on the authors' teaching and research at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and the Keck School of Medicine of the University of Southern California, the second edition of this landmark text offers a general framework for students, researchers, practitioners, and policymakers for learning about vulnerable populations.

It is commonly viewed as a defiant barrier, the end of the empire, a place where civilization stopped and barbarism began. In fact, the massive structure remains shrouded in mystery. Was the wall intended to keep out the Picts, who inhabited the North? Or was it merely a symbol of Roman power and wealth? What was life like for soldiers stationed along its expanse? How was the extraordinary structure built -- with what technology, skills, and materials? In Hadrian's Wall, Adrian Goldsworthy embarks on a historical and archaeological investigation, sifting fact from legend while simultaneously situating the wall in the wider scene of Roman Britain. The result is a concise and enthralling history of a great architectural marvel of the ancient world.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=hv8vDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Off Base: Confessions of a Thief","description":"Baseball's premier base stealer traces his life from his childhood in Oakland to glory in the Major Leagues, offering commentary about the game and anecdotes about such luminaries as Reggie Jackson, Yogi Berra, and Jose Canseco.

And in the history of friendship in early America, Caleb Crain sees the soul of the nation s literature. In a sensitive analysis that weaves together literary criticism and historical narrative, Crain describes the strong friendships between men that supported and inspired some of America s greatest writing--the Gothic novels of Charles Brockden Brown, the essays of Ralph Waldo Emerson, and the novels of Herman Melville. He traces the genealogy of these friendships through a series of stories. A dapper English spy inspires a Quaker boy to run away from home. Three Philadelphia gentlemen conduct a romance through diaries and letters in the 1780s. Flighty teenager Charles Brockden Brown metamorphoses into a horror novelist by treating his friends as his literary guinea pigs. Emerson exchanges glances with a Harvard classmate but sacrifices his crush on the altar of literature--a decision Margaret Fuller invites him to reconsider two decades later. Throughout this engaging book, Crain demonstrates the many ways in which the struggle to commit feelings to paper informed the shape and texture of American literature.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=CSiG7zgbQToC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"I Am Alone","description":"Thirty monologues, 30 female, 30 male.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=boTVoAEACAAJ&dq=I+Am+Alone&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Standard of Excellence Enhanced Comprehensive Band Method, Book 1: Conductor Score (Enhanced Comprehensive Band Method, Bk1)","description":"Instrumental method books for level 1 band students, plus conductor score.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=y2tVwgEACAAJ&dq=Standard+of+Excellence+Enhanced+Comprehensive+Band+Method,+Book+1:+Conductor+Score+(Enhanced+Comprehensive+Band+Method,+Bk1)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Flowering of Old Testament Theology: A Reader in Twentieth-Century Old Testament Theology, 1930-1990 (Sources for Biblical and Theological Study Old Testament Series)","description":"Knowledge of God / Theodorus C.

He is a leader in applying computer modeling to social science problems. His book The Evolution of Cooperation has been hailed as a seminal contribution and has been translated into eight languages since its initial publication. The Complexity of Cooperation is a sequel to that landmark book. It collects seven essays, originally published in a broad range of journals, and adds an extensive new introduction to the collection, along with new prefaces to each essay and a useful new appendix of additional resources. Written in Axelrod's acclaimed, accessible style, this collection serves as an introductory text on complexity theory and computer modeling in the social sciences and as an overview of the current state of the art in the field. The articles move beyond the basic paradigm of the Prisoner's Dilemma to study a rich set of issues, including how to cope with errors in perception or implementation, how norms emerge, and how new political actors and regions of shared culture can develop. They use the shared methodology of agent-based modeling, a powerful technique that specifies the rules of interaction between individuals and uses computer simulation to discover emergent properties of the social system. The Complexity of Cooperation is essential reading for all social scientists who are interested in issues of cooperation and complexity.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=J0dgRGMdjmQC&dq=The+Complexity+of+Cooperation:+Agent-Based+Models+of+Competition+and+Collaboration&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Anglo-Saxon magic and medicine (Publications of the Wellcome Historical Medical Museum)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=fkzmMgEACAAJ&dq=Anglo-Saxon+magic+and+medicine+(Publications+of+the+Wellcome+Historical+Medical+Museum)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Consumer Reports Money Book","description":"Covers banking, money management, taxes, insurance, investing, and retirement planning","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=v74mxfr9tcEC&dq=The+Consumer+Reports+Money+Book&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Charles Darwin, (English worthies, ed. by A.

They dared to risk it all in a skiff of reeds or leather, on a ship of wood or steel, knowing the only thing between them and certain death was their ship. To explore, to seek out what lay beyond the close and comfortable, every explorer had to embrace danger. And as they did so, what arose was a mystical bond, a passion for the ships that carried them. From the very first time humans dared to warp the fabric of space, escaping from the ashes of the third World War, they also created ships. These vessels have become the icons of mankind's desire to rise above the everyday, to seek out and make the unknown known. And these ships that travel the stellar seas have stirred the same passions as the ones that floated in the oceans. While every captain has wished that their starship could be outfitted in the same manner as the sailing ship H.M.S. Beagle without weapons that proved untenable. From the start, Starfleet realized that each vessel, due to the limited range of the early warp engines, must be able to stand alone against any attack. Thus arose the idea, taken from the days of wooden sailing ships, that every Starfleet vessel must stand as a ship of the line. Through the actions of their captains and crews, countless starships have taken on that role. Here we remember some of those ships and their heroic crews. In celebration of one of science fiction's most beloved franchises, this updated edition of the acclaimed Ships of the Line hardcover collection now includes dozens of additional images brought together for the first time in book format spectacular renderings featured in the highly successful Star Trek: Ships of the Line calendar series. With text by Star Trek's own Michael Okuda, the story of each of these valiant starships now comes to life. ?, ?, & ? 2014 CBS Studios, Inc.

Told from two perspectives - the wise outlook of elderly General Archbald, a civilized man in an uncivilized world, and the romantic vantage point of Jenny Blair, his impetuous grandchild - the story is a vivid parable of a society in decline.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=vMceDgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Maurice Utrillo (1883 - ) (The Pocket Library of Great Art, A12)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8Fr9MgEACAAJ&dq=Maurice+Utrillo+(1883+-+)+(The+Pocket+Library+of+Great+Art,+A12)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Paternity Lessons (Family Matters) (Silhouette Romance)","description":"FAMILY MATTERS PATCHWORK FAMILY In the blink of an eye, Tyler Corwin found himself father to the little girl he'd loved as a baby, then let go when his marriage fell apart.

To St Theodore the Studite, writing in the midst of the iconoclastic controversy of the eighth and ninth centuries, it was clear that iconoclasm is a serious error, which alienates its followers from God as much as any other heresy. That is to say, rejection of Christian veneration of images effectively denies God's incarnation, which alone makes human salvation possible. If Christ could not be portrayed, then He was not truly man, and humanity was not truly united with God in Him. In our own day, when the material world so often is regarded as mere matter, incapable of being transfigured in Christ, St Theodore's message remains remarkably pertinent.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=cxNrOyPtDS8C&dq=On+the+Holy+Icons&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Beheaded Freshman and Other Nasty Rumors (An Avon Flare Book)","description":"Presents a collection of horrifying stories, including the tale of the maniac who axed a sleeping camper to death.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=CcXjAQAACAAJ&dq=The+Beheaded+Freshman+and+Other+Nasty+Rumors+(An+Avon+Flare+Book)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lon Po Po: A Red-Riding Hood Story From China (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","description":"Three sisters staying home alone are endangered by a hungry wolf who is disguised as their grandmother.

Turn of the Century is a good old-fashioned novel about the day after tomorrow--an uproarious, exquisitely observed panorama of our world as the twentieth century morphs into the twenty-first, transforming family, marriage, and friendship and propelled by the supercharged global businesses and new technologies that make everyone's lives shake and spin a little faster. As the year 2000 progresses, George Mactier and Lizzie Zimbalist, ten years married, are caught up in the whirl of their centrifugally accelerating lives. George is a TV producer for the upstart network MBC, launching a truly and weirdly groundbreaking new show that blurs the line between fact and fiction. Lizzie is a software entrepreneur dealing with the breakneck pleasures and pains of running her own company in an industry where the rules are rewritten daily. Rocketing between Los An-geles and Seattle, with occasional stopovers at home in Manhattan for tag-team parenting of their three children, George and Lizzie are the kind of businesspeople who, growing up in the sixties and seventies, never dreamed they would end up in business. They're too busy to spend the money that's rolling in, and too smart not to feel ambivalent about their crazed, high-gloss existences, but nothing seems to slow the roller-coaster momentum of their inter-secting lives and careers. However, after Lizzie, recovering from a Microsoft deal gone awry, becomes a confidante and adviser to George's boss, billionaire media mogul Harold Mose, the couple discovers that no amount of sophisticated spin can obscure basic instincts: envy, greed, suspicion, sexual temptation--and, maybe, love. When they and their children are finally drawn into a thrilling, high-tech corporate hoax that sends Wall Street reeling (and makes one person very, very rich), George and Lizzie can only marvel at life's oversized surprises and hold on for dear life. Like Tom Wolfe's Bonfire of the Vanities, Kurt Andersen's Turn of the Century lays bare the follies of our age with laser-beam precision, creating memorable characters and dissecting the ways we think, speak, and navigate this new era of extreme capitalism and mind-boggling technology. Entertaining, imaginative, knowing, and wise, Turn of the Century is a richly plotted comedy of manners about the way we live now.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=OyDNutsYQsoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The punishment cure: How aversion therapy is being used to eliminate smoking, drinking, obesity, homosexuality ... and practically anything else","description":"A biography of the President who preserved the American Union during the Civil War.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_sJrAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+punishment+cure:+How+aversion+therapy+is+being+used+to+eliminate+smoking,+drinking,+obesity,+homosexuality+...+and+practically+anything+else&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"\\"Most of the Good Stuff:\\" Memories of Richard Feynman","description":"\\"A printed eulogy of one of the most interesting and creative physicists of our time....The reader gets fascinating first-person accounts from eminent physicists qua ardent admirers of one who will forever be remembered in the pages of physics.\\" Choice Prominent physicists such as John Wheeler, Freeman Dyson, Hans Bethe, Julian Schwinger, Murray Gell-Mann, David Pines, and others offer intimate reminiscences of their colleague and perceptive explanations of Feynman's trailblazing work.

How do social class and the use of bad language interact? Do young speakers use bad language more frequently than older speakers? Using the spoken section of the British National Corpus, Swearing in English explores questions such as these and considers at length the historical origins of modern attitudes to bad language. Drawing on a variety of methodologies including historical research and corpus linguistics, and a range of data such as corpora, dramatic texts, early modern newsbooks and television, Tony McEnery takes a socio-historical approach to discourses about bad language in English. Arguing that purity of speech and power have come to be connected via a series of moral panics about bad language, the book contends that these moral panics, over time, have generated the differences observable in bad language usage in present day English. A fascinating, comprehensive insight into an increasingly popular area, this book provides an explanation, and not simply a description, of how modern attitudes to bad language have come about.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=hxaCAgAAQBAJ&dq=Swearing+in+English:+Bad+Language,+Purity+and+Power+from+1586+to+the+Present+(Routledge+Advances+in+Corpus+Linguistics)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"SOMEDAY ANGELINA","description":"Angeline could read before she was old enough to turn the pages of a book, and she mastered the piano without a single lesson.

Here a city slicker got a country girl pregnant and then took a bullet in the back. Wolfe s job was to get an innocent man exonerated of the crime and catch a killer in the process. But when he packed his silk pajamas and headed west, he found himself embroiled in a case rife with local cynicism, slipshod police work, and unpleasant political ramifications. In fact, Nero Wolfe was buffaloed until the real killer struck again, underestimating the dandified dude with an unerring instinct for detection.

Only by going public with his theory--that dreams manifest hidden wishes--did Freud establish a position to defend and embark upon a career. That position and career have been among the most influential in this century. In August 1899, Freud wrote to Wilhelm Fliess of the dream book in terms reminiscent of Dante's Inferno. Beginning from a dark wood, this modern journey features \\"a concealed pass though which I lead the reader--my specimen dream with its peculiarities, details, indiscretions, bad jokes--and then suddenly the high ground and the view and the question, Which way do you wish to go now?\\" Physician that he is, Freud appoints himself guide rather than hero, yet the way \\"you\\" wish to go is very much his prescribed way. In Welsh's book, readers are invited on Freud's journey, to pause at each concealed pass in his seminal work and ask where the guide is taking them and why. Along the way, Welsh shows how Freud's arbitrary turnings are themselves wishful, intended to persuade by pleasing the reader and author alike; that his interest in secrets and his self-proclaimed modest ambition are products of their time; and that the book may best be read as a romance or serial comedy. \\"Some of the humor throughout,\\" Welsh notes, \\"can only be understood as a particular kind of fine performance.\\" Welsh offers the first critical overview of the argument in Freud's masterpiece and of the author who presents himself as guide.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=m4AoL7o8JnQC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Naked Ambition: Women Who Are Changing Pornography","description":"A collection of personal writings by women in the pornography industry considers how they have revolutionized the world of adult entertainment by producing, writing, and publishing pornography by and for women, in a volume that includes essays by such figures as Jenna Jameson, Theresa Flynt, and Violet Blue.

Harman follows Darlington's path from bleak prospects to world fame, showing how, within the most miniscule of worlds, he sought answers to the biggest questions--how species originate, how variation occurs, how Nature, both blind and foreboding, random and insightful, makes her way from deep past to unknown future. But Darlington did not stop there: Chromosomes held within their tiny confines untold, dark truths about man and his culture. This passionate conviction led the once famed Darlington down a path of rebuke, isolation, and finally obscurity. As The Man Who Invented the Chromosome unfolds Darlington's forgotten tale--the Nazi atrocities, the Cold War, the crackpot Lysenko, the molecular revolution, eugenics, Civil Rights, the welfare state, the changing views of man's place in nature, biological determinism--all were interconnected. Just as Darlington's work provoked him to ask questions about the link between biology and culture, his life raises fundamental questions about the link between science and society.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=6flWrFTw5fcC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"El discipulo amado","description":"Just as Christ took John on a lifelong journey into the depths of His love, He will do the same for you.

Mastering the writing system of one's language is crucial for success in a modern society. This book examines how children learn to write words. It provides a theoretical framework that integrates findings from a wide range of age groups--from children who are producing their first scribbles to experienced spellers who are writing complex words. To set the stage for these discussions, early chapters of the book consider the nature of writing systems and the nature of learning itself. The following chapters review various aspects of orthographic development, including the learning of symbol shapes and punctuation. Each chapter reviews research with learners of a variety of languages and writing systems, revealing underlying similarities. Discussions of how orthography is and should be taught are incorporated into each chapter, making the book of interest to educators as well as to psychologists, cognitive scientists, and linguists. This book is unique in the range of topics and languages that it covers and the degree to which it integrates linguistic insights about the nature of writing systems with discussions of how people learn to use these systems.

This book is all that and more.\\" --Chicago Tribune In the tradition of Susanna Kaysen's Girl, Interrupted and Caroline Knapp's Drinking: A Love Story, Mary Allen tells a riveting love story that explores the uncharted territory between passion and addiction, grief and madness, this world and the next. When Mary Allen falls in love with Jim Beaman, she doesn't know he has a drug problem, but she does sense demons and angels around him, like \\"a disturbance in the air, a sound just beyond the register of human hearing.\\" And when Jim--discouraged and depressed, struggling with his addiction--kills himself a year into their relationship, Allen is unable to let him go. In her desperate attempts to recover from the loss, she uses a Ouija board and automatic writing to pull back from reality into the dark recesses of her mind, where she believes she can find him. The result is a mesmerizing trip across the boundaries between this world and the afterlife, a journey that leads her to the brink of insanity and ultimately back to herself.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=B3X6Muhe6uQC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Michelin Green Guide: Chateaux of the Loire (Green tourist guides)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=CQkW2_BKirgC&dq=Michelin+Green+Guide:+Chateaux+of+the+Loire+(Green+tourist+guides)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Techniques of the Selling Writer","description":"Techniques of the Selling Writer provides solid instruction for people who want to write and sell fiction, not just to talk and study about it.

But their verse could also give coded expression to desires and resentments produced by competition amongst an elite for the favour of an increasingly tyrannical king. This study focuses primarily on the work of the two most successful courtier poets, Sir Thomas Wyatt (c.1503-1542) and Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey (1517-1547). Although Surrey admired and imitated Wyatt, each represents a significantly different element in the Henrician court. Wyatt was a 'new man', rising in the service of the King, while Surrey was a member of the old peerage, jealous of the erosion of traditional powers and privileges. The book offers readings of the full range of each man's writing, from amorous Italianate songs and sonnets, to classicizing epigrams and satires, and Reformist psalm paraphrases. The poetry is considered in the contexts of their careers, of the writing of contemporaries, and of the political and social conditions within which they lived. Dr Heale's analysis makes it clear that the lightest court song is often freighted with complex significance, while the poems of plain-speaking reflection prove to be wily approximations of the truth. This accessible and informative text will be a helpful resource for both undergraduate and postgraduate students of English literature and history, especially those taking courses on Renaissance and Early Modern writing, Tudor literature, and the Tudor court. -- Book cover.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=USRaAAAAMAAJ&dq=Wyatt,+Surrey+and+Early+Tudor+Poetry+(Longman+Medieval&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Play and the Politics of Reading: The Social Uses of Modernist Form","description":"\\"Classrooms and curricula should be structured to foster the playful interaction that can teach students how to negotiate social and political differences in an emancipatory, noncoercive manner.... Teaching reading as a playful exercise of reciprocity with otherness can help prepare students for a democracy understood as a community of communities.\\" from the \\"Pedagogical Postscript\\" Reading is socially useful, in Paul B. Armstrong's view, and can model democratic interaction by a community unconstrained by the need to build consensus but aware of the dangers of violence, irrationality, and anarchy. Reading requires mutual recognition but need not culminate in agreement, Armstrong says; instead, the social potential of reading arises from the active exchange of attitudes, ideas, and values between author and reader and among readers. Play and the Politics of Reading, which has important implications for education, draws on Wolfgang Iser's notion of free play to offer a valuable response to social problems. Armstrong finds that Joseph Conrad, E. M. Forster, Henry James, and James Joyce provide apt examples of the politics of reading, for reasons both literary and political. In making the transition from realism to modernism, these authors experimented with narrative strategies that seek simultaneously to represent the world and to question the means of representation itself. The formal ambiguities and complexities of such texts as Howards End and Ulysses are ways of staging for the reader the difficulties and opportunities of a world of differences. Innovative formal structures challenge readers to reconsider their assumptions and beliefs about social issues.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=k6FhDwAAQBAJ&dq=Play+and+the+Politics+of+Reading:+The+Social+Uses+of+Modernist+Form&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Double Deal","description":"An expose of organised crime and its unholy alliance with world leaders, intelligence agencies, and law enforcement, Double Deal is a 40year saga told with unflinching honesty by mob insider and former Chicago chief of police Michael Corbitt. Growing up poor and angry, Michael Corbitt fought his way up the ranks of greasers and street gangs until he attracted the attention of Chicago crime boss Sam Giancana, who placed him on the Willow Springs, Illinois, police force. By the time Corbitt was appointed chief of police, he'd also moved up the Outfit's ranks and was living the high life of a respected mobster. Corbitt's luck turned when he was indicted on charges of racketeering and conspiracy to commit murder. Although there was a mob contract on his life and he was facing a 20year jail sentence, he refused to testify against organised crime figures under the witness protection programme, maintaining instead the Mafioso's code of silence  until his release from prison. Now Corbitt breaks that silence, holding back nothingincluding the account of his personal involvement in the brutal murder of the wife of Chicago mob attorney Alan Masters. Corbitt bares his soul, confessing in graphic  sometimes horrific  detail a life lived as both saint and sinner, a life that moved back and forth between the conflicting worlds of the police officer and the gangster with ease.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=EYWYDZKRFj4C&dq=Double+Deal&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Quiet Moments in the Presence of God","description":"Through inspiring portions of Scripture, Quiet Moments in the Presence of God celebrates the gifts God gives us every day in 170 moving reflections.

Over the years the philosophical landscape has changed, and in this new edition Zach Manis joins Evans in a thorough revamping of arguments and information, while maintaining the qualities of clarity and brevity that made the first edition so appreciated. New material on divine foreknowledge and human freedom has been added as well as on Reformed epistemology. The discussions on science now cover new developments from cognitive psychology and naturalism as well as on the fine-tuning of the cosmos. The chapter on faith and reason has been expanded to include consideration of evidentialism. The problem of evil now forms its own new chapter and adds a discussion of the problem of hell. The standard features remain: a survey of the field, an examination of classical arguments for God's existence, and an exploration of contemporary challenges to theism from the social sciences and philosophy as well as the natural sciences. The meaning and significance of personal religious experience, revelation and miracles--all within the realm of contemporary religious pluralism--are likewise investigated.

At the age of fourteen he renounced his patrimony and took a vow to serve the Lord. His time was divided, according to the rule, between the singing of hymns, the study of grammar, and the meditation of eternal truths. A celestial perfume soon disclosed the virtues of the monk throughout the cloister, and when the blessed Gal, the Abbot of Yvern, departed from this world into the next, young Mael succeeded him in the government of the monastery. He established therein a school, an infirmary, a guest-house, a forge, work-shops of all kinds, and sheds for building ships, and he compelled the monks to till the lands in the neighbourhood. With his own hands he cultivated the garden of the Abbey, he worked in metals, he instructed the novices, and his life was gently gliding along like a stream that reflects the heaven and fertilizes the fields. At the close of the day this servant of God was accustomed to seat himself on the cliff, in the place that is to-day still called St. Mael's chair. At his feet the rocks bristling with green seaweed and tawny wrack seemed like black dragons as they faced the foam of the waves with their monstrous breasts. He watched the sun descending into the ocean like a red Host whose glorious blood gave a purple tone to the clouds and to the summits of the waves. And the holy man saw in this the image of the mystery of the Cross, by which the divine blood has clothed the earth with a royal purple. In the offing a line of dark blue marked the shores of the island of Gad, where St. Bridget, who had been given the veil by St. Malo, ruled over a convent of women. Now Bridget, knowing the merits of the venerable Mael, begged from him some work of his hands as a rich present. Mael cast a hand-bell of bronze for her and, when it was finished, he blessed it and threw it into the sea. And the bell went ringing towards the coast of Gad, where St. Bridget, warned by the sound of the bell upon the waves, received it piously, and carried it in solemn procession with singing of psalms into the chapel of the convent. Thus the holy Mael advanced from virtue to virtue. He had already passed through two-thirds of the way of life, and he hoped peacefully to reach his terrestrial end in the midst of his spiritual brethren, when he knew by a certain sign that the Divine wisdom had decided otherwise, and that the Lord was calling him to less peaceful but not less meritorious labours.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2YPOCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Melbourne","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Points and Lines","description":"This is the only book on the topic of geometric configurations of points and lines. It presents in detail the history of the topic, with its surges and declines since its beginning in 1876. It covers all the advances in the field since the revival of interest in geometric configurations some 20 years ago. The author's contributions are central to this revival. In particular, he initiated the study of 4-configurations (that is, those that contain four points on each line, and four lines through each point); the results are fully described in the text. The main novelty in the approach to all geometric configurations is the concentration on their symmetries, which make it possible to deal with configurations of rather large sizes. The book brings the readers to the limits of present knowledge in a leisurely way, enabling them to enjoy the material as well as entice them to try their hand at expanding it.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=bY-DAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hunger of Memory: The Education of Richard Rodriguez","description":"Hunger of Memory is the story of Mexican-American Richard Rodriguez, who begins his schooling in Sacramento, California, knowing just 50 words of English, and concludes his university studies in the stately quiet of the reading room of the British Museum.

Classical Fighting Arts of Japan: A Complete Guide to Koryu Jujutsu is the first comprehensive English-language book on traditional jujutsu. Author Serge Mol-working almost exclusively from original Japanese source materials-vividly outlines the history of the close-quarter fighting methods that warriors developed not only to prove themselves on the battlefield and in daily life, but also to the constantly ready to defend their feudal lords. A great number of jujutsu styles and techniques-armed and unarmed-have existed over the centuries, and many of the classical weapon schools also instructed in the use of jujutsu. The Classical Fighting Arts of Japan expertly guides readers through the rise and development of many of the major schools. The classical martial arts as practiced in the ancient ryuha were deeply interwoven. For this reason, this definitive guide to koryu jujutsu will not only be invaluable to practioners of traditional and modern jujutsu, but will be of great interest to enthusiasts of modern budo such as judo, aikido, kendo, and iaido. Mol explores the historical and cultural factors that helped shape jujutsu and the martial arts in general. He offers a detailed look at individual jujutsu ryuha, giving details on the school's history (where possible including illustrations of their founders and photos of ancient manuscripts). This book is richly illustrated with numerous photographs of rare documents and with many photos of exponents demonstration techniques, many of which have never before been shown outside Japan. In addition to his extensive research in original source material, Mol had regular access in conversation, over the course of years, to the insights of the grandmasters of several of the most important jujutsu schools that remain active today. Classical Fighting Arts of Japan will be a welcome addition to the personal collection of every serious student of Japanese martial arts.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=F-XCwAEACAAJ&dq=Classical+Fighting+Arts+of+Japan:+A+Complete+Guide+to+Koryu+Jujutsu+(Bushido--The+Way+of+the+Warrior)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Off the Chain, Vol. 2","description":"A second volume in the authorized biography of the influential American science-fiction writer covers the period between 1948 and his death, discussing Heinlein's views on the Cold War, his contributions as an advisor to Ronald Reagan and the writing of such classic works as Stranger in a Strange Land. 20,000 first printing.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=7GttAwAAQBAJ&dq=Off+the+Chain,+Vol.+2&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Cad","description":"A narrative history rich with romance and tragedy, The Angel and the Cad is the story of the high society scandal that gripped Regency England.

Their lives constantly intersect at crucial moments in their personal histories as each discovers his own unique -- and uniquely gay -- identity. Their complex, tumultuous, and madcap relationship endures against 40 years of history and their involvement with the handsome model, poet, and decorated Vietnam vet Matt Loguidice, whom they both love. Picano chronicles and celebrates gay life and subculture over the last half of the twentieth century: from the legendary 1969 gathering at Woodstock to the legendary parties at Fire Island Pines in the 1970s, from Malibu Beach in its palmiest surfer days to San Francisco during its gayest era, from the cities and jungles of South Vietnam during the war to Manhattan's Greenwich Village and Upper East Side during the 1990s AIDS war. In a book that could have been written only by one who lived it and survived to tell, Picano weaves a powerful saga of four decades in the lives of two men and their lovers, relatives, friends, and enemies. Tragic, comic, sexy, and romantic, filled with varied and colorful characters, Like People in History is both extraordinarily moving and supremely entertaining.

Nowhere is this more evident than in Utah's redrock canyon country, which is among the most spectacular terrain not only in America but in the world. These extraordinary lands lie at the heart of the Colorado Plateau -- 130,000 square miles of uplifted rock sitting like a huge island in an earthly continental sea, surrounded on all sides by the remnants of once-active volcanoes. Although the Colorado Plateau includes portions of Colorado, New Mexico, and Arizona, in no other part of any other state are its complexity and time-constructed beauty illuminated more brilliantly than in southern Utah. Tourists and outdoor enthusiasts by the millions visit and revisit the area because there is no place else on earth quite like it. In The Redrock Chronicles, T. H. Watkins, one of America's best-known and award-winning writers on the environment and history, focuses on southern Utah's unprotected lands in a loving testament to its warps and tangles of rock and sky. Combining history, geography, and photography, the author reports the full story of the region -- from its violent geologic beginnings to the coming (and going) of pre-Puebloan peoples whose drawings still adorn rocks and caves there, from the Mormon settlement of the 1840s and 1850s to the great uranium boom of the 1950s, from the beginning of tourism and parkland protection in the 1930s to today's controversial movement to preserve millions of acres of wild Utah land in the National Wilderness Preservation System. Indeed, the account of that revolutionary movement is told here in all its color and complexity for the first time. Writing from his own personal experience and extensive research, an appreciative Watkins takes readers on a tour of the Grand Staircase of plateaus, moving from the utterly wild triangle of Kaiparowits Plateau, with its erosion-sculptured mesas, tablelands, benchlands, and canyons, to a more welcoming kind of verdant wilderness that sits northeast, across the rolling desert scrubland of Harris Wash, in the red-walled canyon of the Escalante River. The author has spent much time hiking and camping here among the isolated buttes and mesas, and he draws a vivid portrait of the area's highlights: Comb Ridge, a 90-mile wall of 600-foot cliffs; Waterpocket Fold, an even more spectacular monocline to the northeast of the Escalante River, stretching a hundred miles; the Henry Mountains; Hump of Bull Mountain; Cataract Canyon; and the San Rafael Swell, an enormous oval some 2,200 square miles which rises just north of Capitol Reef National Park. But The Redrock Chronicles is not simply a celebration. Watkins concludes with a spirited call for the preservation of the unprotected wilderness that gives the land its character and color. He offers the legislative device of wilderness designation as the necessary means of saving this plateau country that is not marked by one or two or even three or four scenic marvels but by an enormous kaleidoscope of geological diversity whose impact on the senses can set the mind to reeling with every turn.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=4ZGYTxGAqvwC&dq=The+Redrock+Chronicles:+Saving+Wild+Utah+(Center+Books+on+Space,+Place,+and+Time)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Da Vinci (Getting to Know the World's Greatest Artists)","description":"These books are without a doubt the definitive - and most entertaining - biographies of artists for young readers.

Jack comes from a family of wealthy ship-owners in Merseyside, who may not approve of the match; Lena is terrified that history will repeat itself if her daughter falls in love with a man above her station; and, worst of all, Jack has not been entirely honest with Kate from the start... What readers are saying about The Price of Love: 'Beautifully written, the characters come to life on the page as their story unfolds. I would highly recommend this book' 'The book is very hard to put down!

Unlike other recent books in the field that focus on certain aspects of the Gothic, this work directs researchers to seminal and significant resources on all of its aspects. Annotations will help researchers determine what materials best suit their needs.

With essays by military heroes, political leaders, and Nobel Prize winners, sports heroes, firefighters, scientists, and schoolteachers -- and with an introduction by basketball legend, businessman, and philanthropist Earvin \\"Magic\\" Johnson -- this collection gathers individuals who themselves are shining examples to tell us about the people who have illuminated their own lives. ? How did Dana Reeve come to find such grit and grace when her fairy-tale prince was thrown from his real-life steed, paralyzed from the neck down? ? What traits of baseball great Ted Williams have inspired war hero Senator John McCain since childhood? ? What impact did Nelson Mandela have on boxing legend Muhammad Ali? ? Why does one of the all-time greats of baseball, Yogi Berra, believe that he owes each of his legendary home runs to his brothers? ? How did Michael J. Fox find a woman who would walk away from a spectacular career in finance in order to fight for a cure for Parkinson's disease at the helm of his nonprofit foundation? ? Why does John Glenn, a man who flew into space twice and served a quarter century on the Senate floor, look up to his own wife, Annie Glenn, as the true hero in the family? In a world hungry for good examples, My Hero reminds us that heroes come in all shapes and sizes. It also teaches us that the words and deeds of those who inspire us are as varied as the stars that illuminate the night. The editors of My Hero and the contributors are donating all royalties from this book to the nonprofit My Hero Project.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=RcFlGp52DHsC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Talis Hunters (Matterhorn the Brave Series #2)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=YHFHPgAACAAJ&dq=Talis+Hunters+(Matterhorn+the+Brave+Series&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Colloquial Arabic (Colloquial series)","description":"Colloquial Arabic (Levantine) offers you a step-by-step approach to the Arabic spoken in Jordan, Syria, Lebanon and Palestine.

A sweeping narrative that presents a multiple biography against the flame-shot background of the American Civil War, it is the story of the great figures of the Army of Northern Virginia who fought under Robert E. Lee. The Confederacy won resounding victories throughout the war, but seldom easily or without tremendous casualties. Death was always on the heels of fame, but the men who commanded -- among them Jackson, Longstreet, and Ewell -- developed as leaders and men. Lee's Lieutenants follows these men to the costly battle at Gettysburg, through the deepening twilight of the South's declining military might, and finally to the collapse of Lee's command and his formal surrender in 1865. To his unparalleled descriptions of men and operations, Dr. Freeman adds an insightful analysis of the lessons learned and their bearing upon the future military development of the nation. Accessible at last in a one-volume edition abridged by noted Civil War historian Stephen W. Sears, Lee's Lieutenants is essential reading for all Civil War buffs, students of war, and admirers of the historian's art as practiced at its very highest level.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=0ymWot7Ab9EC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ratchet & Clank: Going Commando Official Strategy Guide","description":"\\"Our species' pervasive presence on the planet is the combined result of two powerful forces: earth's rich natural endowments and humanity's ability to manipulate nature.

He is a leader in applying computer modeling to social science problems. His book The Evolution of Cooperation has been hailed as a seminal contribution and has been translated into eight languages since its initial publication. The Complexity of Cooperation is a sequel to that landmark book. It collects seven essays, originally published in a broad range of journals, and adds an extensive new introduction to the collection, along with new prefaces to each essay and a useful new appendix of additional resources. Written in Axelrod's acclaimed, accessible style, this collection serves as an introductory text on complexity theory and computer modeling in the social sciences and as an overview of the current state of the art in the field. The articles move beyond the basic paradigm of the Prisoner's Dilemma to study a rich set of issues, including how to cope with errors in perception or implementation, how norms emerge, and how new political actors and regions of shared culture can develop. They use the shared methodology of agent-based modeling, a powerful technique that specifies the rules of interaction between individuals and uses computer simulation to discover emergent properties of the social system. The Complexity of Cooperation is essential reading for all social scientists who are interested in issues of cooperation and complexity.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=J0dgRGMdjmQC&dq=The+Complexity+of+Cooperation:+Agent-Based+Models+of+Competition+and+Collaboration+(Princeton+Studies+in+Complexity)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ed Dean is queer: A novel","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Lz0a2ISX8EcC&dq=Ed+Dean+is+queer:+A+novel&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Dream Like Mine","description":"A white man venture into the awesome and terrifying landscape of the Indian's spirit world- the real, unexplored country which lies within the country we think we have conquered.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=tXofAQAAIAAJ&dq=A+Dream+Like+Mine&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Biography - Mau, Bruce Douglas (1959-): An article from: Contemporary Authors Online","description":"How to use design as a tool to create not only things but ideas, to speculate about possible futures. Today designers often focus on making technology easy to use, sexy, and consumable. In Speculative Everything, Anthony Dunne and Fiona Raby propose a kind of design that is used as a tool to create not only things but ideas. For them, design is a means of speculating about how things could be to imagine possible futures. This is not the usual sort of predicting or forecasting, spotting trends and extrapolating; these kinds of predictions have been proven wrong, again and again. Instead, Dunne and Raby pose  what if  questions that are intended to open debate and discussion about the kind of future people want (and do not want). Speculative Everything offers a tour through an emerging cultural landscape of design ideas, ideals, and approaches. Dunne and Raby cite examples from their own design and teaching and from other projects from fine art, design, architecture, cinema, and photography. They also draw on futurology, political theory, the philosophy of technology, and literary fiction. They show us, for example, ideas for a solar kitchen restaurant; a flypaper robotic clock; a menstruation machine; a cloud-seeding truck; a phantom-limb sensation recorder; and devices for food foraging that use the tools of synthetic biology. Dunne and Raby contend that if we speculate more about everything reality will become more malleable. The ideas freed by speculative design increase the odds of achieving desirable futures.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9gQyAgAAQBAJ&dq=Biography+-+Mau,+Bruce+Douglas+(1959-):+An+article+from:+Contemporary+Authors+Online&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Witch's Runes: How to Make and Use Your Own Magick Stones","description":"This creative, crafty, and spiritual book teaches witches how to create their own stones and use them for divination or to cast spells.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=B00MAAAACAAJ&dq=A+Witch%27s+Runes:+How+to+Make+and+Use+Your+Own+Magick+Stones&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Screw: Observations and revelations of a prison officer","description":"The story of a woman who spent over a decade in uniform behind the bluestone walls of the Victorian penal system working with male and female prisoners.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Yna_PQAACAAJ&dq=Screw:+Observations+and+revelations+of+a+prison+officer&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Man nobody knows","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=HH3NAihbA-IC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A First Course in Logic.","description":"\\"The ability to reason and think in a logical manner forms the basis of learning for most mathematics, computer science, philosophy and logic students.

Tenacious and passionate, Esther Ross's refusal to abandon her cause resulted in federal recognition of the Stillaguamish Tribe in 1976. Her efforts on behalf of Pacific Northwest Indians at federal, state, and local levels led not only to the rebirth of the Stillaguamish but also to policy reforms affecting all Indian tribes. In this rare, in-depth portrait of a contemporary American Indian woman, Robert H. Ruby and John A. Brown document Ross's life and achievements. At the turn of the twentieth century, the Stillaguamish tribe, located on the Puget Sound in Washington State, had all but disappeared. With no organization or system of communication, tribal members dispersed. Desperate for help, surviving members asked Ross, a young, well-educated descendant of Stillaguamish and Norwegian heritage, to assist them in suing for lost land and government services. For fifty years, she waged a persistent campaign, largely self-staffed and self-funded. Despite personal problems, cultural barriers, and reluctance among some tribal members, Ross succeeded, but she was eventually forced from tribal leadership.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=KE7PkC9sTAgC&dq=Esther+Ross,+Stillaguamish+Champion&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Consuming Subjects: Women, Shopping, and Business in the Eighteenth Century","description":"Drawing on feminist criticism, cultural studies, and new historicist ideas, Kowaleski-Wallace suveys eighteenth century literary texts, material object, and cultural events to illuminate the ways in which women are both controlled by and empowered through images of consumption.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=UuqkDpENyiAC&dq=Consuming+Subjects:+Women,+Shopping,+and+Business+in+the+Eighteenth+Century&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Too Many Counselors (Camp Sunnyside Friends)","description":"Carolyn, a counselor goes away.

In this short but powerful book, Roam introduces a new set of tools for making extraordinary presentations in any setting. He also draws on ideas he s been honing for more than two decades, as an award-winning presenter who has brought his whiteboard everywhere from Fortune 500 companies to tiny startups to the White House. Even if you re already a good speaker, you ll learn more about understanding your audience, organizing your content, building a clear storyline, creating effective visuals, and channeling your fear into fun. And you ll master three fundamental rules: ? When we tell the truth, we connect with our audience, we become passionate, and we find self-confidence. ? When we tell a story, we make complex concepts clear, we make ideas unforgettable, and we include everyone. ? When we use pictures, people see exactly what we mean, we captivate our audience s mind, and we banish boredom. From nailing the opening to leaving a lasting impression, you ll soon be able to give the performance of a lifetime . . . time after time. PLEASE NOTE: This eBook edition of SHOW AND TELL is carefully laid out to match the print book; this means it reads much better as designed pages, but you won't be able to use some features such as highlighting and annotating text.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=awzUAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Sword of Knowledge","description":"A three-in-one volume combines the works of four popular authors, and includes \\"A Dirge for Sabis,\\" \\"Wizard Spawn,\\" and \\"Reap the Whirlwind\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ydUEAAAACAAJ&dq=The+Sword+of+Knowledge&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Keepers of the Garden","description":"Dolores Cannon uses information obtained from regressive hypnosis to formulate a provocative viewpoint on the ancient astronaut theory of human origins.

They dared to risk it all in a skiff of reeds or leather, on a ship of wood or steel, knowing the only thing between them and certain death was their ship. To explore, to seek out what lay beyond the close and comfortable, every explorer had to embrace danger. And as they did so, what arose was a mystical bond, a passion for the ships that carried them. From the very first time humans dared to warp the fabric of space, escaping from the ashes of the third World War, they also created ships. These vessels have become the icons of mankind's desire to rise above the everyday, to seek out and make the unknown known. And these ships that travel the stellar seas have stirred the same passions as the ones that floated in the oceans. While every captain has wished that their starship could be outfitted in the same manner as the sailing ship H.M.S. Beagle without weapons that proved untenable. From the start, Starfleet realized that each vessel, due to the limited range of the early warp engines, must be able to stand alone against any attack. Thus arose the idea, taken from the days of wooden sailing ships, that every Starfleet vessel must stand as a ship of the line. Through the actions of their captains and crews, countless starships have taken on that role. Here we remember some of those ships and their heroic crews. In celebration of one of science fiction's most beloved franchises, this updated edition of the acclaimed Ships of the Line hardcover collection now includes dozens of additional images brought together for the first time in book format spectacular renderings featured in the highly successful Star Trek: Ships of the Line calendar series. With text by Star Trek's own Michael Okuda, the story of each of these valiant starships now comes to life. ?, ?, & ? 2014 CBS Studios, Inc.

It would be more correct not to use the word  apply,  for it is not a question of one of the usual works on the  Application of Psychoanalysis to the Mental Sciences ; rather it is a matter of making psychoanalytic thought productive for our entire conception of mankind and history. This finally represents the history of mind, that is, the history of the development of the human mind and of the things created by it. This particular viewpoint, still too new to be quite clearly grasped, is made accessible to us through Psychoanalysis by reason of the prodigious extension of our consciousness, which at the present time enables us to recognize part of the deepest Unconscious as such, and to understand its mode of operation. As scientific knowledge itself is no more than a conscious comprehension of previously latent facts, it is only logical that every particle of the extension of our consciousness, gained by analysis, should be converted into understanding. It is now shown at a quite definite point of psychoanalytic knowledge, which we shall soon characterize more definitely, that there is also a considerable part of organic or biological development which can be understood only from the psychical side; that is, from the side which, together with all the residue of development, includes also our own instrument of knowledge, which has suddenly become definitely more efficient through our progressive knowledge of the Unconscious. We have taken certain new individual psychoanalytic experiences solely as a starting-point for a more comprehensive view and for general knowledge; but we believe that in so doing we have opened up the way to something essentially different from the hitherto prevailing  application  of Psychoanalysis. Thus we also lay stress on the fact that we want to keep ourselves free from an overestimation of the psychoanalytic doctrine of the Unconscious as applied to therapy, without thereby departing from the psychoanalytic way of thinking. But at the same time we extend this line of thought in both directions. It is, then, no accident that Psychoanalysis, as soon as it began to develop from a therapeutic procedure into a doctrine of the Unconscious, almost simultaneously deviating from its original medical field, invaded and enriched wellnigh every mental science, and finally itself became one of the most important of mental movements of the present day. The psychic patient, from whose material and by whose help Psychoanalysis was discovered and developed, will always remain the native source for further investigation and extension of the doctrine. Yet this origin is of no more importance today than, for instance, the country from which Columbus set forth, and which furnished the bold explorer with practical means for his voyage.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ad7jCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A political education : a Washington memoir","description":"An in depth look at what it was like being the president's right hand man during a very difficult time.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6k-uoQEACAAJ&dq=A+political+education+:+a+Washington+memoir&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bruce & Stan's Pocket Guide to Prayer: A User-Friendly Approach (Bruce & Stan's Pocket Guides)","description":"Bruce the bear likes to keep to himself.

Yet many of the dishes and confections visitors have come to expect from the region did not emerge from Pennsylvania Dutch culture but from expectations fabricated by local-color novels or the tourist industry. At the same time, other less celebrated (and rather more delicious) dishes, such as sauerkraut and stuffed pork stomach, have been enjoyed in Pennsylvania Dutch homes across various localities and economic strata for decades. Celebrated food historian and cookbook writer William Woys Weaver delves deeply into the history of Pennsylvania Dutch cuisine to sort fact from fiction in the foodlore of this culture. Through interviews with contemporary Pennsylvania Dutch cooks and extensive research into cookbooks and archives, As American as Shoofly Pie offers a comprehensive and counterintuitive cultural history of Pennsylvania Dutch cuisine, its roots and regional characteristics, its communities and class divisions, and, above all, its evolution into a uniquely American style of cookery. Weaver traces the origins of Pennsylvania Dutch cuisine as far back as the first German settlements in America and follows them forward as New Dutch Cuisine continues to evolve and respond to contemporary food concerns. His detailed and affectionate chapters present a rich and diverse portrait of a living culinary practice widely varied among different religious sects and localized communities, rich and poor, rural and urban that complicates common notions of authenticity. Because there's no better way to understand food culture than to practice it, As American as Shoofly Pie's cultural history is accompanied by dozens of recipes, drawn from exacting research, kitchen-tested, and adapted to modern cooking conventions. From soup to Schnitz, these dishes lay the table with a multitude of regional tastes and stories.

Over the course of one weekend, he and his crew of  retailers  sell their product to students, businessmen, tourists, drifters, and lowlifes, while evading the law and outmaneuvering the competition. It s a fragile balance that avant-garde saxophonist and all-around nuisance Porco Miserio threatens to upend with his big mouth. As Johnny B. and his crew scramble to maintain their embattled existence, each relates their personal story of life on the fringes of Greenwich Village.

Kennedy, which grew out of speeches, travel and his experience as Attorney General and a United States Senator, pose a simple question for America and consequently for the free world, in the 60s and 70s: Are you willing to dare? Today's challenges are awesome in scope and baffling in complexity. A military coup in Brazil may effect the entire hemisphere and endanger the Alliance for Progress. Riots and decay in the American cities pose the dangers of war in the streets, and a permanent alienation of black and white America. Vietnam raises the possibility of recurrent draining conflict, with a huge and unknown China beyond. And overall loom the new weapons of war, threatening at every moment to destroy all they were designed to defend. But for all the problems, says the author, our fortunes need not and cannot be surrendered to an inscrutable fate. The question posed is not to America's resources, not to their ability, but to their commitment and character. This is the question Robert Kennedy repeatedly addresses in To Seek a Newer World. As a major architect of positions and policies at home and abroad since 1961, he is candid in assessing his countries shortcomings and mistakes. Yet his call for a new ordering of national priorities is a hopeful one - to match American heritage and power with a new effort and will - to seek a newer world for the United States and for the community of man.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=y8pIswEACAAJ&dq=To+Seek+a+Newer+World&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Rosicrucian Cosmo-Conception","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=1uANAAAAYAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Secret of the Planet Makon (Daystar Voyages Series #1)","description":"Captain Edge, the Junior Space Rangers, and the other Christians of the Daystar crew head toward the planet Makon in search of the secret that will keep their spaceship from self-destructing.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=lUt-fqRH7H0C&dq=Secret+of+the+Planet+Makon+(Daystar+Voyages+Series&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Night Angel (Heirs of Acadia #4)","description":"The Dramatic Sequel to The Noble Fugitive Serafina's painful memories of betrayal in Venice soften with her growing fondness for John Falconer, who has joined her father in a new commercial venture.

In English translation. Jos Mara Arguedas is one of the few Latin American authors who loved and described his natural surroundings, and he ranks among the greatest writers of any time and place. He saw the beauty of the Peruvian landscape, as well as the grimness of social conditions in the Andes, through the eyes of the Indians who are a part of it. Ernesto, the narrator of Deep Rivers, is a child with origins in two worlds. The son of a wandering country lawyer, he is brought up by Indian servants until he enters a Catholic boarding school at age 14. In this urban Spanish environment he is a misfit and a loner. The conflict of the Indian and the Spanish cultures is acted out within him as it was in the life of Arguedas. For the boy Ernesto, salvation is his world of dreams and memories. While Arguedas poetry was published in Quechua, he invented a language for his novels in which he used native syntax with Spanish vocabulary. This makes translation into other languages extremely difficult, and Frances Horning Barraclough has done a masterful job, winning the 1978 Translation Center Award from Columbia University.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=XHaKdLv-ib8C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pale Horse","description":"Bill Cooper, former United States Naval Intelligence Briefing Team member, reveals information that remains hidden from the public eye.

This is the central question that Price (editor, Journal of Higher Criticism) and Lowder (cofounder, Internet Infidels) pose in their essay collection. Written in response to recent works by Wolfhart Pannenberg, William Lane Craig, Murray J. Harris, and others who offered a defense of the Resurrection on historical and logical grounds, the essays probe the following: What is the most reasonable way to understand the appearance stories? Why would a God resurrect Jesus? Is the Resurrection theologically necessary? Is there enough historical evidence to make the Resurrection plausible or convincing? Did the 'Empty Tomb' really take place? To such questions, the answer is in the negative or is rendered in a nontheistic manner. Interestingly, contributors include not only philosophers, historians, and major nontheists but also New Testament scholars who view the Resurrection as a later church development. Well argued and well written, the essays are certain to stimulate further insight and reflection for both theists and nontheists.... Recommended for academic libraries.--John Jaeger, Dallas Baptist University, Texas, in Library JournalIt is not new for a few lonely, persecuted radicals to deny the resurrection of Jesus. What is new in this book is that such a number of competent, scrupulous scholars are agreeing that it did not happen, and going so far as attacking fundamentalists for propagating false and misleading views of the Bible.--Dr. Barbara Thiering, author of the bestseller Jesus and the Riddle of the Dead Sea ScrollsOne can only hope this valuable collection will result in a renewed commitment to intelligent discourse concerning Christianity's greatest miracle.--Gerd L demann, University of G?ttingen, author of The Resurrection of Christ: A Historical InquiryDid Jesus rise from the dead? Although 19th- and early 20th-century biblical scholarship dismissed the resurrection narratives as late, legendary accounts, Christian apologists in the late 20th century revived historical apologetics for the resurrection of Jesus with increasingly sophisticated arguments. A few critics have directly addressed some of the new arguments, but their response has been largely muted. The Empty Tomb scrutinizes the claims of leading Christian apologists and critiques their view of the resurrection as the best historical explanation.The contributors include New Testament scholars, philosophers, historians, and leading nontheists. They focus on the key questions relevant to assessing the historicity of the resurrection: What did the authors of the New Testament mean when they said Jesus rose from the dead? What historical evidence is needed to establish the resurrection? If there is a God, why would He resurrect Jesus? Was there an empty tomb? What should we make of the appearance stories?

A Modern Language Association Committee on Scholarly Editions textual edition. Dewey's dominant theme in these pages is war and its after-math. In the Introduction, Oscar and Lilian Handlin discuss his philosophy within the historical context: The First World War slowly ground to its costly conclusion; and the immensely more difficult task of making peace got painfully under way. The armi-stice that some expected would permit a return to normalcy opened instead upon a period of turbulence that agitated fur-ther a society already unsettled by preparations for battle and by debilitating conflict overseas. After spending the first half of 1918-19 on sabbatical from Columbia at the University of California, Dewey traveled to Japan and China, where he lectured, toured, and assessed in his essays the relationship between the two nations. From Peking he reported the student revolt known as the May Fourth Move-ment. The forty items in this volume also include an analysis of Thomas Hobbe's philosophy; an affectionate commemorative tribute to Theodore Roosevelt, our Teddy; the syllabus for Dewey's lectures at the Imperial University in Tokyo, which were later revised and published as Reconstruction in Philosophy; an exchange with former disciple Randolph Bourne about F. Mat-thias Alexander's Man's Supreme Inheritance; and, central to Dew-ey's creed, Philosophy and Democracy. His involvement in a study of the Polish-American community in Philadelphia--resulting in an article, two memoranda, and a lengthy report--is discussed in detail in the Introduction and in the Note on the Confidential Report ofConditions among the Poles in the United States.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=VLeopJkTyDEC&dq=The+Middle+Works+of+John+Dewey,+Volume+9,+1899-1924:+Democracy+and+Education,+1916+(Collected+Works+of+John+Dewey)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Impala 1958-2000 (American Classics)","description":"The Impala was introduced in 1958 as Chevrolet's top-of-the-line, full-size sedan.

It offers the perspective of a Bryson City, North Carolina, native on a particular portion of southern Appalachia the Smokies. Casada serves up a detailed description of the folkways of food as they existed in the Smokies over a span of three generations, beginning early in the twentieth century. Fancy-dancy food magazines and self-ordained cuisine cognoscenti regularly rave about gustatory delights reflecting the Appalachian cooking tradition. Yet they focus on restaurants in regional cities such as Asheville and Nashville, Chattanooga and Cleveland, or even the bustling metropolis of Atlanta. Simply put, they are missing the boat, at least in Casada s eyes. Peppered with ample anecdotes, personal memories and experiences, the wisdom of wonderful cooks, and recipes reflective of the overall high-country culinary experience, Casada s book brings these culinary tales to life. Fishing for Chickens includes dishes that Casada has cooked and eaten, recipes handed down through family or close friends, food memories of an intensely personal nature, and an abiding love for a fast-fading way of life. In addition to twenty-four chapters focusing on such diverse topics as  Yard Bird,  Nuts,  and  New Year s Fare,  the author includes nearly two hundred family recipes. With his story, Casada guides readers through a fast-vanishing culinary world that merits not only recollection but preservation.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=mp1wEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Oxford Companion to Children's Literature","description":"The last thirty years have witnessed one of the most fertile periods in the history of children's books: the flowering of imaginative illustration and writing, the Harry Potter phenomenon, the rise of young adult and crossover fiction, and books that tackle extraordinarily difficult subjects.

But Death offered to return her to him for a price: a palace of bones...and their first-born child. Since offspring have never before resulted from any union of the two worlds, Donnerjack accepts Death's conditions--and leads his reborn lover far from the detritus and perpetual twilight of Deep Fields to his ancestral Scottish lands, hoping to build a sanctuary and a self for Ayradyss in the first world. But there is no escaping, because cataclysmic change is taking place in Virtu. A bizarre new religion is sweeping through this ever-shifting universe where the homely can be virtually beautiful, the lame can walk and the blind can see. Now it's threatening to spill over into Verite. And its credo is a call for a different kind of order. For all the ancient myths still occupy Virtu. And the Great Gods on Mt. Meru are amassing great armies in anticipation of the time when a vast computer system attempts to take over the reality that constructed it.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=PbvrHAAACAAJ&dq=Donnerjack&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Doggie Diary","description":"Follow along the first of many Milo the Puppy Chow's Doggie Diary stories as Milo writes about his doggie day.

It is neither a political statement nor scientific research. It is a discussion of SM, what it means to its practitioners, how it is practised, and the structure of its subculture in contemporary American society. Like all sexual behaviour, SM is more than it seems, encompassing a spectrum of physiological and psychological mechanisms. By its reliance only on observed behaviour, the outsider's view has consistently led to misconceptions and false interpretations of SM behaviour. This book moves beyond the superficial and the misleading, focusing on the actual SM experience by fully integrating the external view of the academic with the internal view of the practitioner.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=lbgKAAAACAAJ&dq=Bound+to+Be+Free:+The+Sm+Experience&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Paintings by Masami Teraoka","description":"Ascending Chaos is the first major retrospective of Japanese-American artist Masami Teraoka's prolific and acclaimed work thus far. In Teraoka's paintings which have evolved from his wry mimicry of Japanese woodblock prints to much larger and complex canvasses reminiscent of Bosch and Brueghel the political and the personal collide in a riot of sexually frank tableaux. Populated by geishas and goddesses, priests, and politicians, and prominent contemporary figures, these paintings are the spectacular next phase of a wildly inventive career. With essays by renowned art critics who discuss how Teraoka's work inventively marries east and west, sex and religion, Ascending Chaos is a critical overview of this cultural trickster.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=dF4ElV8hcSUC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Real Freshman Handbook","description":"Draws on the real-life experiences of twelve college students to present a survivor's guide to freshman life on campus, offering advice on such topics as roommates, papers, exams, avoiding pitfalls, and partying.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=QMxUON74U9YC&dq=The+Real+Freshman+Handbook&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ebony Rising: Short Fiction of the Greater Harlem Renaissance Era","description":"A treasury of short fiction from the Harlem Renaissance era","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-PvMzgEACAAJ&dq=Ebony+Rising:+Short+Fiction+of+the+Greater+Harlem+Renaissance+Era&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The tragedy of King Richard the Second (Pelican Shakespeare)","description":"The classic one-volume Shakespeare, including all the plays and poems, now completely revised and updated.

This book will challenge your interpretation of end-times theology and help you sharpen your understanding in light of current times. Does Revelation 8:10-11 describe an asteroid? Is the Wormwood star from Revelation 8 already headed toward Earth? Are NASA and high-level government officials aware of an asteroid that is on a collision course with our planet? Is that why President Trump sanctioned a colossal increase to planetary defense? Do the prophecies from ancient cultures and religions across the globe all point to a catastrophic planetary event that has scientists and politicians taking extreme preventative measures under the public radar? Earth is not currently prepared for the scope of impact that may be just around the corner, and people in high places know it... But what will the biblical Wormwood actually be? Traditional scholarly interpretation claims it will be an asteroid. Others postulate that the eschatological poisoning of one-third of all Earth's waters and the devastation of our planet's ecology might not be as detectable as we may believe: it could hit suddenly and without warning, like an angel of God appearing in the sky with fire and light, bringing judgment in an instant. Follow Thomas Horn as he blazes a trail through these questions and many others, posing answers that very few in the church today are willing to provide.

When Joe Pike is charged with safeguarding a wealthy heiress, he discovers protecting the sole witness to a crime is nothing compared to protecting an LA party girl from her own self-destruction  Larkin Conner Barkley lives like the City of Angels is hers for the taking. Young and staggeringly rich, she speeds through the city during its loneliest hours, blowing through red after red in her Aston Martin as if running for her life. Then suddenly she sees another car s metal-on-metal explosion of a terrible accident and, dazed, finds herself the single witness in a secret federal investigation.

How far would you go to uncover the truth? One spring night in 1998 the beautiful Cressida Strauss plunges from a fourth-floor balcony at the Lyc e Internationale Suisse with catastrophic consequences. Loath to draw negative publicity to the school, a bastion of European wealth and glamour, officials quickly dismiss the incident as an accident, but questions remain: Was it a suicide attempt? Or was Cressida pushed? It was no secret that she had a selfish streak and had earned as many enemies as allies in her tenure at the school. For her best friend, scholarship student Kersti Kuusk, the lingering questions surrounding Cressida's fall continue to nag long after she leaves the Lyc e. Kersti marries and becomes a bestselling writer, but never stops wondering about Cressida's obsession with the Helvetian Society a secret club banned years before their arrival at the school and a pair of its members who were expelled. When Kersti is invited as a guest to the Lyc e's 100th Anniversary, she begins probing the cover-up, unearthing a frightening underbelly of lies and abuse at the prestigious establishment. And in one portentous moment, Kersti makes a decision that will connect her to Cressida forever and raise the stakes dangerously high in her own desire to solve the mystery and redeem her past. An unputdownable read as clever as it is compelling, The Finishing School offers a riveting glimpse into a privileged, rarefied world in which nothing is as it appears.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=GgmwDAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Love and Conquest: Personal Correspondence of Catherine the Great and Prince Grigory Potemkin","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Homeward Bound: A History of the Bahama Islands to 1850","description":"Supporters of the British Crown found life in the Colonies rigorous in the years prior to, during, and after the Revolutionary War.

They gave living reality to that great golden legend-The American Dream. Most were self-made in the Horatio Alger tradition. Those whose beginnings were blessed with wealth parlayed their inheritances many times through the same methods as their rags-to-riches compatriots: shrewdness, ruthlessness, determination, or a combination of all three. The Age of the Moguls is not overly concerned with the comparative business ethics of these men of money. The best of them made \\"deals,\\" purchased immunity, and did other things which in 1860, 1880, or even 1900, were considered no more than \\"smart\\" by their fellow Americans, but which today would give pause to the most conscientiously dishonest promoter. Holbrook does not pass judgments on matters that have baffled moralists, economists, and historians. He is less concerned with how these men achieved their fortune as much as how they disbursed the funds. Stewart Holbrook has written a brilliant and wholly captivating study of the days when America's great fortunes were built; when futures were unlimited; when tycoons trampled across the land. Few writers today could range backwards and forwards in American history through the last century and a half, and could take their readers to a dozen different sections of the country, or combine the lives of over fifty famous men in such a way as to produce a continuous and exciting narrative of sponsored growth. Leslie Lenkowsky's new introduction adds dimension to this classic study.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BR0uDwAAQBAJ&dq=The+Age+of+the+Moguls+(Railroads+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Nursetest: Medical-Surgical Nursing","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=sIo6AAAACAAJ&dq=Nursetest:+Medical-Surgical+Nursing&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Thinking Outside the Block: Step by Step to Dynamic Quilts","description":"Contemporary quilts the easy way - no rules, just fun!

Two state-level case studies of social studies curriculum reform and textbook policy (California and New York) illustrate how curriculum decision making becomes an arena in which battles are fought over national values and priorities. Written by a New York education professor and a California journalist, the text offers a rare blend of academic and journalistic voices. The \\"great speckled bird\\" is the authors' counter-symbol to the bald eagle--a metaphor representing the racial-ethnic-cultural diversity that has characterized the U.S. since its beginnings and the multicultural reality of American society today. The text breaks new ground by focusing on the intersections of national debates and education policymaking. It situates the case studies within historical and contemporary cultural contexts--with particular attention to questions of power and knowledge control and how influence is exercised. By juxtaposing the contrasting cases of California and New York, the authors illustrate commonalities and differences in education policymaking goals and processes. By sharing stories of participants at and behind the scenes, policymaking comes alive rather than appearing to result from impersonal \\"forces\\" or \\"factors.\\"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=hWUrfSGB0-8C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Current atlas: Juan de Fuca Strait to Strait of Georgia = Atlas des courants : Juan de Fuca strait a strait of Georgia (French and English Edition)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=FrnoAAAAMAAJ&dq=Current+atlas:+Juan+de+Fuca+Strait+to+Strait+of+Georgia+%3D+Atlas+des+courants+:+Juan+de+Fuca+strait+a+strait+of+Georgia+(French+and+English+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Willy Loman (Bloom's Major Literary Characters)","description":"A collection of critical extracts and essays examines Willy Loman, the central character in Arthur Miller's play, \\"Death of a salesman\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=P8cfAQAAIAAJ&dq=Willy+Loman+(Bloom%27s+Major+Literary+Characters)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Making Game: An Essay on Woodcock","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BmiOAAAAIAAJ&dq=Making+Game:+An+Essay+on+Woodcock&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How to Get a College Degree Via the Internet: The Complete Guide to Getting Your Undergraduate or Graduate Degree from the Comfort of Your Home","description":"Post-secondary education is a massive globalizing industry with a potential for growth that cannot be overestimated. By 2010 there will be 100 million people in the world, all fully qualified to proceed from secondary to tertiary education, but there will be no room left on any campus. A distinguished panel of scholars and educational administrators from the Americas, Asia, Europe, and the Pacific was asked to speak on the complexities of globalized higher education from their positions of concern and expertise and then engage in a dialogue. The result is this timely and important work. Throughout, contributors address a number of difficult questions: Do the processes of global capitalism fundamentally challenge the inherited forms of the University? How should the use and nature of markets be conceived and how are they related? What is the appropriate pedagogy for the new technologies and what are its limits? If growing participation in higher education is an overriding good, should this be conceived in terms of fulfilling human capacities, realizing national goals, or attaining employment skills?

This inspiring memoir comes from one of the world's most remarkable athletes who achieved arguably the greatest upset in individual sports history when he defeated the Russian Alexander Karelin -- three-time Olympic champ, undefeated and unscored upon for a decade before his match with Gardner -- in the 2000 Gold Medal match. Rulon Gardner tells the story of his impoverished upbringing as one of nine children in a close-knit Mormon family on a farm in Wyoming, where in performing unceasing chores he developed tremendous strength at an early age. Gardner writes about his struggles in school made arduous by learning disabilities that have challenged him his whole life. Also, after winning his Gold Medal, we read how this champion survived a snowmobile accident that marooned him outdoors for eighteen hours in high country. Rulon Gardner recovered from this and went on to defend his Gold Medal at Athens in 2004 -- yet another comeback from this athlete who was supposed to simply fade away.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=XYBWm-LQK-sC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Play Lightly on the Earth","description":"Offers nature activities designed to teach children about plants, trees, wildlife, and outer space","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9h9FAAAAYAAJ&dq=Play+Lightly+on+the+Earth&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"An agricultural testament","description":"Why is there a cow on the front cover of this book? This is a book about agriculture, and farm animals have become unfashionable in some quarters. Cows, it turns out, are responsible for global warming, climate change, and so, no doubt, rising sea levels and chemtrails. But any real farmer, from any time in history, knows that this is not true. Animals have been around forever. Animals are a vital part of an insanely complex living system. Anyone who knows the basics of regenerative agriculture understands this. Albert Howard spent years studying and using the methods of traditional Asian agriculture, and shows in this book that the fertility and health of the soil depend on humus, in the production of which animal materials play an vital role. A healthy soil needs animal inputs. Animals in agriculture are central; they're right in there with fungi. This message is not welcomed by those who would feed the modern world a diet of plant-based, lab-grown food substitutes that have lists of ingredients as long as your arm, and are going to save the planet using gene-spliced soybeans and 3D printed pizzas. So, the cow and her calf are on the cover to redress the balance, and also to feature as one of the stars of this book (along with sugar cane, waste pits, and public servants). She was the photogenic one. Albert Howard's text has been thoroughly re-edited in this new version of his book. The habit, common at the time, of using long paragraphs is not preferred by modern readers, so the text has been extensively 'reparagraphed'. Grammar has been tweaked, and styles have been adopted. Headings have been added, infinitives unsplit. The changes made have been to make things more comfortable for modern eyes and tastes. The sense and intention of the author has not been altered at all, of course. We hope that Albert Howard would approve of this reworking of his book. His ideas are more important than ever. Wendell Berry wrote in The Last Whole Earth Catalog \\"Howard's discoveries and methods, and their implications, are given in detail in An Agricultural Testament. They are of enormous usefulness to gardeners and farmers, and to anyone who may be interested in the history and the problems of land use. But aside from its practical worth, Howard's book is valuable for his ability to place his facts and insights within the perspective of history. This book is a critique of civilisations, judging them not by their artefacts and victories, but by their response to the sacred duty of handing over to the next generation, unimpaired, the heritage of a fertile soil.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ME9pzgEACAAJ&dq=An+agricultural+testament&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Just My Luck: A Novel","description":"Over 4 million Adele Parks books sold worldwide including LIES, LIES, LIES and I INVITED HER IN! \\"Utterly engrossing and brilliant\\"  Lucy Foley New York Times bestselling author of The Guest List It was supposed to be the lottery win they d always dreamed of  For fifteen years, Lexi and Jake have played the same six numbers with their friends.

On her sixteenth birthday, she woke screaming from the sensation that her tongue had been cut out. No doctor can find a medical explanation for her pain, and even the most powerful drugs have proven useless. Only the touch of seawater can ease her pain, and just temporarily at that. Now Kathleen is a twenty-five-year-old opera student in Boston and shows immense promise as a soprano. Her girlfriend Harry, a mezzo in the same program, worries endlessly about Kathleen's phantom pain and obsession with the sea.

When Kathleen suffers yet another dangerous breakdown, Harry convinces Kathleen to visit her hometown in Ireland to learn more about her family history. In Ireland, they discover that the mystery and the tragedy of Kathleen s family history is far older and stranger than they could have imagined.

This volume focuses on recent advances and new developments on how food webs are closely intertwined with the geology, chemistry, and physics of coastal seas. Dr. Alongi presents a process-functional approach as a way of understanding how the energetics of coastal ecosystems rely not only on exchanges within and between food chains, but how such functions are influenced by terrigenous and atmospheric processes. There is a need for documentation and an awareness of just how necessary, yet delicate, is the interplay of biological and physical forces between coastal ocean, land, and the atmosphere. Marine scientists today need to make informed management decisions about sustainable development and conservation of these fragile ecosystems. Coastal Ecosystem Processes provides present and future marine scientists the latest coastal ecosystem information to make the right decisions concerning the ecology of our oceans.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Xf1AygEACAAJ&dq=COASTAL+ECOSYSTEM+PROCESSES&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Good Enough Daughter: A Memoir","description":"A daughter's memoir of the expectations she chafed against and the duties she later embraced offers a positive, affirming perspective on this important subject.

It is 1497. The news of the survival of Richard Plantagenet, Duke of York, has set royal houses ablaze with intrigue and rocked the fledgling Tudor dynasty. With the support of Scotland's King James IV, Richard-known to most of England as Perkin Warbeck-has come to reclaim his rightful crown from Henry Tudor. Stepping finally onto English soil, Lady Catherine Gordon has no doubt that her husband will succeed in his quest. But rather than assuming the throne, Catherine would soon be prisoner of King Henry VII, and her beloved husband would be stamped as an imposter. With Richard facing execution for treason, Catherine, alone in the glittering but deadly Tudor Court, must find the courage to spurn a cruel monarch, shape her own destiny, and win the admiration of a nation.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=NcboIrEzqucC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Spinoza's Book of Life: Freedom and Redemption in the Ethics","description":"Offering a new reading of Spinoza's masterpiece, Smith asserts that the 'Ethics' is a celebration of human freedom and its attendant joys and responsibilities and should be placed among the great founding documents of the Enlightenment.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=j0dMphwIwQ8C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Early Netherlandish School (National Gallery London Publications)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Mosquitoes;","description":"Mosquitoes of the Southeastern United States is a full-color, highly illustrated guide to the sixty-four known species of mosquitoes in eleven genera that populate the South--from the Gulf Coastal states to the Carolinas.

In Scripture \\"prayer\\" includes much more than making known our requests to God, and this is something which His people need reminding of, and some of them instructing in, in these days of superficiality and ignorance. The very verse that presents the privilege of spreading our needs before the Lord emphasizes this very thing: \\"In every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God\\" (Phil. 4:6). Unless gratitude be expressed for mercies already received and thanks be given for granting us the continued favor of petitioning our Father, how can we expect to obtain His ear and receive answers of peace!

What information do faces actually provide? Why do we associate certain facial qualities with particular character traits? What are the social and psychological consequences of reading character in faces?

Offering an in-depth analysis of two appearance qualities that influence our impressions of others, babyfaceness\\" and attractiveness\\",and an account of these impressions, Zebrowitz has written an accessible and valuable book for professionals and general readers alike.The assumption that people's faces provide a window to their inner nature has a long and distinguished history, eloquently expressed in the works of ancient philosophers, like Aristotle, and great writers, like Shakespeare. Zebrowitz examines this assumption, focusing on four central points. She shows that facial appearance, particularly babyfaceness and attractiveness, has a strong impact on how we perceive an individual's character traits and on social outcomes in the workplace, in the criminal justice system, and in other settings. She proposes that facial stereotypes derive from evolutionarily adaptive reactions to useful information that faces can provide. She assesses the accuracy of facial stereotypes in light of plausible links between appearance and character. Finally, Zebrowitz suggests ways to counteract the consequences of reading faces.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=9pRLDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sea Glass Secrets","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=PQqRPQAACAAJ&dq=Sea+Glass+Secrets&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Enneagram Instinctual Subtypes","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=qG-MmwEACAAJ&dq=Enneagram+Instinctual+Subtypes&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Battle of the Bulge","description":"Fought during the frigid winter of 1944-45, the Battle of the Bulge still ranks as the single largest battle ever waged by the US Army.

How did the politics of the Roman Empire affect the development of the liturgical practices of Christianity?

Social psychologist Melanie Joy explores the many ways we numb ourselves and disconnect from our natural empathy for farmed animals. She coins the term \\"carnism\\" to describe the belief system that has conditioned us to eat certain animals and not others. In Why We Love Dogs, Eat Pigs, and Wear Cows Joy investigates factory farming, exposing how cruelly the animals are treated, the hazards that meatpacking workers face, and the environmental impact of raising 10 billion animals for food each year.

Remarkably, for a series of such longevity and international appeal, it is all about elderly people, has little action or plot, and is set and filmed in and around the small Yorkshire town of Holmfirth. Now, Andrew Vine, the deputy editor of Yorkshire s daily newspaper, has written the definitive history of this television phenomenon. It covers the show s inauspicious beginnings, with low ratings, its endless reinvention as participants like Bill Owen, Michael Bates, Brian Wilde and Kathy Staff retired or died, the appearance of a string of guest stars from John Cleese and Norman Wisdom to Thora Hird and Russ Abbott (both of whom soon found themselves fixtures in the cast), and the ingenious plot contrivances as the protagonists became too old and frail to attempt any of the slapstick stunts with runaway prams  indeed any outdoor action.

All chapters provide a review of the relevant literature as well as an overview of important methodologic issues, particularly exposure assessment and statistical methods. Most of these exposures are widespread and low-level, and are thought to increase the risk of chronic diseases that have many causes. Even though the disease risks due to these exposures may be low, the public health burden may be significant because large numbers of people are exposed. Such exposures are inherently difficult to detect via observational epidemiology. This book clarifies the problems and suggests ways to move forward.

Neal Karlen was the only journalist Prince granted in-depth press interviews to for over a dozen years, from before Purple Rain to when the artist changed his name to an unpronounceable glyph. Karlen interviewed Prince for three Rolling Stone cover stories, wrote  3 Chains o  Gold,  Prince s  rock video opera,  as well as the star s last testament, which may be buried with Prince s will underneath Prince s vast and private compound, Paisley Park. According to Prince's former fianc e Susannah Melvoin, Karlen was  the only reporter who made Prince sound like what he really sounded like.  Karlen quit writing about Prince a quarter-century before the mega-star died, but he never quit Prince, and the two remained friends for the last thirty-one years of the superstar s life. Well before they met as writer and subject, Prince and Karlen knew each other as two of the gang of kids who biked around Minneapolis s mostly-segregated Northside. (They played basketball at the Dairy Queen next door to Karlen s grandparents, two blocks from the budding musician.) He asserts that Prince can t be understood without first understanding  70s Minneapolis, and that even Prince s best friends knew only 15 percent of him: that was all he was willing and able to give, no matter how much he cared for them. Going back to Prince Rogers Nelson's roots, especially his contradictory, often tortured, and sometimes violent relationship with his father, This Thing Called Life profoundly changes what we know about Prince, and explains him as no biography has: a superstar who calls in the middle of the night to talk, who loved The Wire and could quote from every episode of The Office, who frequented libraries and jammed spontaneously for local crowds (and fed everyone pancakes afterward), who was lonely but craved being alone. Readers will drive around Minneapolis with Prince in a convertible, talk about movies and music and life, and watch as he tries not to curse, instead dishing a healthy dose of  mamma jammas.

Today, PayPal s founders and earliest employees are considered the technology industry s most powerful network. Since leaving PayPal, they have formed, funded, and advised the leading companies of our era, including Tesla, Facebook, YouTube, SpaceX, Yelp, Palantir, and LinkedIn, among many others. As a group, they have driven twenty-first-century innovation and entrepreneurship. Their names stir passions; they re as controversial as they are admired. Yet for all their influence, the story of where they first started has gone largely untold. Before igniting the commercial space race or jumpstarting social media s rise, they were the unknown creators of a scrappy online payments start-up called PayPal. In building what became one of the world s foremost companies, they faced bruising competition, internal strife, the emergence of widespread online fraud, and the devastating dot-com bust of the 2000s. Their success was anything but certain. In The Founders: The Story of PayPal and the Entrepreneurs Who Shaped Silicon Valley, award-winning author and biographer Jimmy Soni explores PayPal s turbulent early days. With hundreds of interviews and unprecedented access to thousands of pages of internal material, he shows how the seeds of so much of what shapes our world today fast-scaling digital start-ups, cashless currency concepts, mobile money transfer were planted two decades ago. He also reveals the stories of countless individuals who were left out of the front-page features and banner headlines but who were central to PayPal s success. Described as  an intensely magnetic chronicle  (The New York Times) and  engrossing  (Business Insider), The Founders is a story of iteration and inventiveness the products of which have cast a long and powerful shadow over modern life. This narrative illustrates how this rare assemblage of talent came to work together and how their collaboration changed our world forever.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=1RbuDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Thorough-bass accompaniment according to Johann David Heinichen (Studies in musicology)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5lSUQgAACAAJ&dq=Thorough-bass+accompaniment+according+to+Johann+David+Heinichen+(Studies+in+musicology)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Complete Ferrari","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=93wQAAAACAAJ&dq=The+Complete+Ferrari&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Canciones Y Poemas Para Ninos","description":"Es una colecci n compuesta por grandes cl sicos de la literatura universal, pensada principalmente para estudiantes del ciclo de secundaria.

Dan Kennedy is ten years old and wants a black Gibson Les Paul guitar, the kind Peter Frampton plays. It will be his passport to the coolest (only) band in the neighborhood Jokerz. He doesn t get it. Instead, his parents present him with what they think he wants most, a real-estate loan calculator (called the Loan Arranger) and a maroon velour pullover shirt with a tan stripe across the chest. It is the first of what will become a lifetime of various-sized failures, misunderstandings, comical humiliations, and just plain silly choices that have dogged this  hipster Proust of youthful loserdom,  as author Jerry Stahl has so eloquently called Mr. Kennedy. Dan s hilarious and painfully awkward youth soon develops into a . . . uh . . . hilarious and painfully awkward adulthood. His first two choices for university are Yale (Lit or Drama) and Harvard (Business), so he reviews his high school transcripts and decides on Butte Community College in Oroville, California, where he studies for about four and a half weeks. We could go on here and describe in detail all of Dan s good-natured stabs at ambition, but he, himself, sums it all up quite nicely:  If you ve ever tried and failed miserably at being a rock star (no guitar/talent), a professional bass fisherman, an extra in the movie Sleepless in Seattle (guy drinking martini in bar while Tom Hanks makes a phone call), a Madison Avenue advertising executive, a clerk/towel person at a suburban health club (named Kangaroo Kourts), an espresso street-cart owner and operator (in the one neighborhood of that coffee-swilling town, Seattle, where, remarkably, no one really seems to drink coffee), a dot.com millionaire, an MTV VJ, or a forest fire fighter, this book is for you.  Along the way, a few lessons are learned and we are treated to one of the most original, riotously funny, unsentimental, and offbeat memoirs in recent history. Dan s a favorite in McSweeney s and at the very popular Moth readings in New York City. We should be happy that he failed so miserably at so many things and took notes!","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=sctEgO2baegC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Is there life on other worlds?","description":"Does life exist on other planets?

Computers from electronic books to smart phones play an active role in our social lives. Our technological choices thus entail theoretical and political commitments. Dennis Tenen takes up today's strange enmeshing of humans, texts, and machines to argue that our most ingrained intuitions about texts are profoundly alienated from the physical contexts of their intellectual production. Drawing on a range of primary sources from both literary theory and software engineering, he makes a case for a more transparent practice of humancomputer interaction. Plain Text is thus a rallying call, a frame of mind as much as a file format. It reminds us, ultimately, that our devices also encode specific modes of governance and control that must remain available to interpretation.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=r0UkDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Querencia","description":"Born in Boston, Stephen Bodio wandered into Magdalena, New Mexico, in the 1970s while on his way to Montana and never left. He was accompanied by Betsy Huntington, who was twenty years his senior; the couple had been inseparable from the day they met. After stumbling upon a vintage home along the highway, they settled into a country life; it was the perfect way for the two of them to make their lives together in an out-of-the-way place. It s through Bodio that Betsy s story is painted in such memorable passages that soon captivate readers. Together they made their home among the mountains of New Mexico, returning to a simple life of hunting, falconry, and becoming acquainted with the local reptiles and insects of the desert. A lover of nature, Bodio here explains in vivid detail his time spent in the wilderness. He found himself the center of his neighbors  attention when they discovered his endless fascination with the local fauna, from snakes and birds to coursing dogs. He became accustomed to Magdalena through the people and wildlife, even joining in the biggest festival on the calendar: the Quemado Rodeo, better known by locals as the Street Dance and Brawl.

But a few go bad, real bad. Mike Romano is just a beat officer, but now he finds himself facing police corruption and worse. He joined the force to stop a child molester from preying on his neighborhood, but to make the collar stick he has to follow procedure. Now he's about to find out that there is no set procedure for staying alive. Michael J. Mcelhone reviewed Angel With a Gun (Five Star First Edition Mystery) 0 of 1 people found the following helpful Angel with a Gun April 2, 2007 Fantastic book! I am originally from the NY area and it captured the essence of the city. Highly recommended. gritty neighborhood police procedural February 4, 2006 Four years ago Brian Wilkey raped a preadolescent, but was freed by an activist liberal judge on a technicality. This case motivated Mike Romano to become a New York cop because he wants to put away the animals. He becomes upset to learn that a child molester raped a little girl in his neighborhood in Queens, but got away with the odious crime. Mike also learns that a beat cop rarely works predatory sex crime cases though this particular one haunts him as it reminds him of why he became a cop. Though he knows he should not investigate, he begins to notice the department is loaded with corruption starting near the top with deputy inspector Bryan who is too busy to seek out a predator. Thus Mike begins to search for clues to identify the pedophile before this animal harms other children. Fans of gritty neighborhood police procedurals will appreciate this tense cat, cat, and mouse thriller though it is biased against activist liberal judges but ignores conservatives (i.e., the severely burned woman in Maryland) and Judge Breyer's writing that judges actively judge or else allow a computer to rule. Brian is a heroic Blue Knight who wants to keep the streets cleaned of the predators that at times seem to lock away the law abiding citizens in their \\"prison\\" homes. His courage and obstinate determination to stop the child rapist turns him into an avenging ANGEL WITH A GUN and makes for an exhilarating action-packed tale as he tries to follow official procedure, which is frustrating and not often easy.

In this groundbreaking study, William Luis analyzes the most salient and representative narrative and poetic works of the newest literary movement to emerge in Spanish American and U.S. literatures. The book is divided into three sections, each focused on representative Puerto Rican American, Cuban American, and Dominican American authors. Luis traces the writers' origins and influences from the nineteenth century to the present, focusing especially on the contemporary works of Oscar Hijuelos, Julia Alvarez, Cristina Garcia, and Piri Thomas, among others. While engaging in close readings of the texts, Luis places them in a broader social, historical, political, and racial perspective to expose the tension between text and context. As a group, Latino Caribbeans write an ethnic literature in English that is born of their struggle to forge an identity separate from both the influences of their parents' culture and those of the United States. For these writers, their parents' country of origin is a distant memory. They have developed a culture of resistance and a language that mediates between their parents' identity and the culture that they themselves live in. Latino Caribbeans are engaged in a metaphorical dance with Anglo Americans as the dominant culture. Just as that dance represents a coming together of separate influences to make a unique art form, so do both Hispanic and North American cultures combine to bring a new literature into being. This new body of literature helps us to understand not only the adjustments Latino Caribbean cultures have had to make within the larger U.S. environment but also how the dominant culture has been affected by their presence.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=KwKwtqO5RCEC&dq=Dance+Between+Two+Cultures:+Latino+Caribbean+Literature+Written+in+the+United+States&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A life in the day of ... and other short stories","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=dGvHDwAAQBAJ&dq=A+life+in+the+day+of+...+and+other+short+stories&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Round Up the Usual Suspects : The making of Casablanca -- Bogart, bergman, and World War II","description":"In late 1941, a play called Everybody Comes to Rick's went from being a standard World War II romantic suspense film to an exceptional movie, earning Oscars for Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Screenplay.

In this English edition of the work, published in 1865, he addresses the practical problems of implementing his philosophy or doctrine, as he also refers to Positivism, into society. He believes that society evolves through a series of stages that are ruled by social laws and culminate in a superior form of social life. During this reorganisation of society, which will find its greatest supporters among women and the working class, a 'new moral power' will emerge.

However, as every company creates more and more products, ever faster, this is proving more difficult. Customers are not willing to buy another product just because it is slightly better. This summary suggests a more effective strategy:  demand innovation   identifying and serving the customer needs which arise naturally out of the sale of existing products and services.

In studying the central Grail narrative of Wolfram von Eschenbach's Parzival, Stein takes a twofold approach. On the one hand, he searches historical records for the identity of actual people and events concealed behind the Grail epic's veil of romance. On the other hand, Stein deciphers Eschenbach's hidden spiritual messages, showing Parzival to be an esoteric document containing powerful pictures of the human being's inner path of development. Stein reveals the period of the ninth century to be far deeper and more important than to be of mere historical and academic interest. It is the karmic ground from which grows the very destiny of our modern era--the grand battle that must take place between the powers of the Grail and the hindrance of sinister anti-Grail forces at large today.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=IJfhERmwDbUC&dq=The+Ninth+Century+and+the+Holy+Grail&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Executive Power","description":"CIA operative Mitch Rapp investigates an attack on a team of Navy SEALs in the Philippines, searches for a possible State Department traitor, and fights to stop a Middle Eastern assassin out to ignite World War III.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6z87CQAAQBAJ&dq=Executive+Power&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Many Houses of Exile","description":"In this compelling autobiographical account, Richard Jurgens recounts with humor, honesty, and insight, his various experiences of the many different forms of exile: living abroad; ostracism; rejection; separation; and banishment.
