Peoples of the Hills, radically different in culture and beliefs from the better-known Hindu peoples of the plains, they were renowned for their fierce resistance to British rule and for their former practice of head-taking. Although sharing many social and cultural traits, such as feast-giving as a means of acquiring status, the thousands of small Naga villages, perched on isolated hill spurs, seemed often to be very different from each other. They adopted different political systems, ranging from the egalitarian to the autocratic, and spoke more than a dozen mutually unintelligible languages. Appearing to be both one people and many tribes, the Nagas displayed both unity and diversity in their dress and ornament. Their vibrant material culture is generously illustrated in this book in colour photographs that display their textiles, basketry, jewelry, weapons, metalwork and carvings. The artefacts are examined in their full historical and anthropological context. Drawing on a diverse range of historical materials, an examination of how the notion of tribes came to be applied to the Nagas is linked to its subsequent importance in the development of contemporary Naga nationalism. A wealth of documentary field photographs complements this fascinating look at the Naga Peoples of Northeast India.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=IbMsAwEACAAJ&dq=The+Nagas:+Hill+Peoples+in+Northeast+India&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"CliffsComplete The Scarlet Letter (Cliffs Complete Study Editions)","description":"In the CliffsComplete guides, the novel's complete text and a glossary appear side-by-side with coordinating numbered lines to help you understand unusual words and phrasing.

What Cheney, himself a novelist, had said about the book was right on target. Very soon a friendship between this rising star of southern literature and Brainard and Frances Cheney was flourishing. Over the next eleven years there was a spirited exchange of letters and visits. Whenever possible, the Cheneys stopped by Andalusia, the O'Connor farm near Milledgeville, Georgia, and O'Connor was able to visit them at Cold Chimneys, their home in Smyrna, Tennessee. This fascinating book collecting their correspondence reveals a devoted friendship that ended with Flannery O'Connor's death at thirty-nine in 1964. In these 188 letters, all previously unpublished, we see a new aspect of her life, the part she shared with \\"Lon\\" and \\"Fannie\\" Cheney. These letters not only give the pleasure of knowing more about the talented Cheneys, an eminent couple close to the Tate circle, but also provide yet another occasion for readers to revel in the delight of Flannery O' Connor's sparkling wit and dark humor. From O'Connor there are 117 letters, from Cheney 71. All Mrs. Cheney's letters to Flannery have been lost, but from the surviving correspondence the reader can note with pleasure the interests that seemed to draw this trio closer as they shared opinions and reports about their native South, their Roman Catholicism, their novels in progress, and their commitment to good writing. But it is chiefly the literary illuminations via these letters that enhance the friendship as well as ignite the reader's compelling curiosity. The letters focus attention upon a time in Flannery O'Connor's life when correspondence was of great importance to her. The O'Connor/Cheney letters make it clear that her circumscribed life was enlarged and enriched by this friendship during her most creative and productive years. - Jacket flap.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=itqZjEF0DpsC&dq=Correspondence+of+Flannery+O%27Connor+and+the+Brainard+Cheneys&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Concordex of the Urantia Book: The Urantia Book is the Fifth Epochal to our planet, Urantia.

Tzvi Freeman has already built a reputation for poetic literary style and depth of insight with his collection of short meditations, \\"Bringing Heaven Down To Earth.\\" In Heaven Exposed, he polishes the fables of the ancients with the fiery wisdom of the Kabbalah and welds them into a golden setting of science fiction to present us with a chest of magnificent jewelry. What makes this so spectacular is that the fables and the Kabbalah are as authentic as you can get. What's even more wondrous is that such deep wisdom could be made so much fun.

Aron's starting point is the state of nature that exists between nations, a condition that differs essentially from the civil state that holds within political communities. Ever keeping this brute fact about the life of nations in mind and ranging widely over political history and many disciplines, Aron develops the essential analytical tools to enable us to think clearly about the stakes and possibilities of international relations. In his first section, \\"Theory,\\" Aron shows that, while international relations can be mapped, and probabilities discerned, no closed, global \\"science\\" of international relations is anything more than a mirage. In the second part, \\"Sociology,\\" Aron studies the many ways various subpolitical forces influence foreign policy. He emphasizes that no rigorous determinism is at work: politics and thus the need for prudent statesmanship are inescapable in international relations. In part three, \\"History,\\" Aron offers a magisterial survey of the twentieth century. He looks at key developments that have had an impact on foreign policy and the emergence of what he calls \\"universal history,\\" which brings far-flung peoples into regular contact for the first time. In a final section, \\"Praxeology,\\" Aron articulates a normative theory of international relations that rejects both the bleak vision of the Machiavellians, who hold that any means are legitimate, and the naivete of the idealists, who think foreign policy can be overcome. This new edition of Peace and War includes an informative introduction by Daniel J. Mahoney and Brian C. Anderson, situating Aron's thought in a new post-Cold War context, and evaluating his contribution to the study of politics and international relations.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=am9QDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Navajo Canyon","description":"Tough Rick Lindquist wasn't afraid to die.

As parents of nine-year-olds often discover, nine is a tricky age. Children are more distant from Mother and Father; they're more independant and rely on friends for companionship, or they have a tendency to spend time alone. Some nines are boisterous and wild, others thoughtful and withdrawn. Helping parents learn how to cope with the unpredictable nine-year-old is the aim of this practical guide from the Gesell Institute. Nine-year-olds are hovering on the brink of adolescence, and this in part contributes to their up-and-down nature. Dr. Louis Bates Ames and Carol Chase Haber paint a vivid picture of the child at this age and offer useful advice to make life easier for parents and children alike.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=iu6khybgWQEC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Floral Minis: Counted Cross Stitch Easy-to-Read Charts","description":"Get into the holiday spirit when you cross stitch these delightful mini ornaments.

What we have to do today is much like what we have repeatedly done in the past, create ever larger scale institutions to increase cooperation and regulate conflict.-Professor Peter J. Richerson, Department of Environmental Science and Policy, University of California, DavisThe question of when and why religions ever started and how they evolved, as science uncovered so many earlier mysteries, is most fascinating. This book works through the issue, a step at a time, to a clear and well argued position. Not every reader will agree, but every reader will have sharpened his own beliefs and be gratified by the experience.-Louis W. Cabot, Chairman Emeritus, The Brookings InstituteIn this succinct, highly readable overview of the evolution of human society, the author argues that the 21st century will witness a crucially important and difficult transition for the human race. Blending the disciplines of anthropology and evolutionary psychology with over thirty years of experience in the diplomatic corps, Coon traces the evolution of the human tendency to divide others into two groups, us versus them. People tend instinctively to behave altruistically toward members of their own in-group, and to react with suspicion, or even hostility, toward outsiders. He points out that complex human societies became possible only when cultural attitudes and mechanisms became accepted that encouraged individuals to define their in-groups in more expansive ways. Thus small kin-based bands grew into villages, kingdoms, and, eventually, the modern nation-state. Today, he argues, we have reached a stage where the whole world must be viewed as us, for only a united world community can cope with today's global challenges.Coon concludes by discussing the difficulties of making this final transition to a world community and the role the United States should take in leading the way. He deplores the recent unilateral trend of U.S. foreign policy, and advocates strengthening the United Nations.Coon's broad international experience combined with an admirable ability to synthesize the latest research from anthropology and evolutionary psychology results in many original insights and fresh ways of evaluating today's global challenges. This is an extraordinary book that offers a new context to a crucially important message.Carl Coon (Washington, DC) served in the US Foreign Service for more than thirty-five years, during which time he lived and worked in many lands and cultures in both the East and the West. He was ambassador to Nepal from 1981 to 1984.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=o0dJB0IOylMC&dq=One+Planet,+One+People:+Beyond+%22Us+vs.+Them%22&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Manners Matter","description":"Etiquette for children and teenagers.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=f6D29zGTWnYC&dq=Manners+Matter&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Relieve Stress and Anxiety: Subliminal Persuasion/Self-Hypnosis","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=OUE2AQAAIAAJ&dq=Relieve+Stress+and+Anxiety:+Subliminal+Persuasion/Self-Hypnosis&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mitos Griegos 2, Los (Spanish Edition)","description":"The story of Pandora and her box, snake-haired Medusa, and the greedy King Midas are three of the twelve myths presented in a colorfully illustrated collection of Greek myths.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=w088i0hSQxUC&dq=Mitos+Griegos+2,+Los+(Spanish+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"CliffsAP United States History","description":"CliffsAP study guides help you gain an edge on Advanced Placement* exams.

We feel pressure from all sides and wonder if God is really there. We call out to God, wanting to know the purpose and value of the season in which we find ourselves. With her wise counsel and gentle encouragement, bestselling author Pamela Reeve leads readers to see the often unrecognized miracle that God is working in our lives to bring about spiritual growth. Drawing from John 15, she reveals the secret to true and lasting peace in the midst of routine or change, in gladness or extreme sorrow. Lush vineyard photographs beautifully illustrate how God lovingly prunes us to bear the fruit of Christ living within us. A Vineyard in the Desert? It doesn't make sense. Why would the Master Gardner plant His tender vines in a hostile place where searing sun, nameless blights, and biting pests descend to consume the maturing grapes? Why would He cut back those vines so severely, exposing them to merciless heat? Because the sweetest, most bountiful harvest of fruit will burst from thise very vines, so carefully tended by a wise heart and loving hands. Within these pages of this stunningly beautiful book, Pam Reeve shows how our Lord brings hope and sweet new wine from the very pressure, sorrows, and dissappointments that encroah upon the seasons of our lives. Story Behind the Book An encounter with a desert vineyard in her youth led Dr. Reeve to a lifelong interest in vines and vineyards. In talks to college students and women s groups around the country, she uses magnificent slides and a gentle message of courage and hope to the overwhelmed, the discouraged, and those enduring difficult seasons in their lives. This book will inspire readers to depend on Christ living within them to produce His character within and fruit through them. It is not our own religious efforts, but Christ living within us, that promotes spiritual growth.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=J49d_igVCGgC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Star Trek Sketchbook","description":"Presents the sketches created by the artists who developed the television series and includes background on the origins of the show and comments from the designers","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=wCmXAFY0nyIC&dq=The+Star+Trek+Sketchbook&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Aging With Dignity","description":"One of Time s 100 most influential people  shines a new light on the need for a holistic approach to caregiving in America . . . Timely and hopeful  (Maria Shriver). In The Age of Dignity, thought leader and activist Ai-jen Poo offers a wake-up call about the statistical reality that will affect us all: Fourteen percent of our population is now over sixty-five; by 2030 that ratio will be one in five. In fact, our fastest-growing demographic is the eighty-five-plus age group over five million people now, a number that is expected to more than double in the next twenty years. This change presents us with a new challenge: how we care for and support quality of life for the unprecedented numbers of older Americans who will need it. Despite these daunting numbers, Poo has written a profoundly hopeful book, giving us a glimpse into the stories and often hidden experiences of the people family caregivers, older people, and home care workers whose lives will be directly shaped and reshaped in this moment of demographic change. The Age of Dignity outlines a road map for how we can become a more caring nation, providing solutions for fixing our fraying safety net while also increasing opportunities for women, immigrants, and the unemployed in our workforce. As Poo has said,  Care is the strategy and the solution toward a better future for all of us.   Every American should read this slender book. With luck, it will be the future for all of us.

A man of action who took on the incredible task of rebuilding ancient Jerusalem. He was dedicated. Wise. A zealous man who saturated himself with prayer. In all of this he helped set the standard for godly leadership. And yet you probably know nothing about him. He was Nehemiah. Indeed, his Old Testament book reads like the memoirs of a pastoral leader and politician par excellence. In it Nehemiah tells how, with God's help and blessing, he went about rebuilding the city of Jerusalem and renewing her people. It is a spirited, first-person account of spiritual renewal. Yet Nehemiah can equally be read as a testimony to God's involvement with man. Using a Bible-study approach J. I. Packer looks at how Nehemiah led the people and how God led Nehemiah all to ultimately build up His Kingdom. Through this book you will discover a model for revival in your own church. A Passion for Faithfulness should be read by church and business leaders for its in-depth look at Nehemiah's example in these particular arenas. But anyone who thirsts for God and a sense of His presence in their everyday responsibilities will also be inspired by this book. Whether you're a stay-at-home mom trying to raise godly children or an employee who longs for God to make Himself real in even the most mundane task, this book will be a trusted help and a welcome reminder of God's desire to be involved in every facet of your life.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=QgzpAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"October Men : Reggie Jackson, George Steinbrenner, Billy Martin, and the Yankees' Miraculous Finish in 1978","description":"Recounts one of the great summers of baseball history, 1978--the year the Yankees won the World Series after a tumultuous season.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=KJJFvgAACAAJ&dq=October+Men+:+Reggie+Jackson,+George+Steinbrenner,+Billy+Martin,+and+the+Yankees%27+Miraculous+Finish+in+1978&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"160 Degrees of Deviation: The Case for the Corporate Cynic","description":"The good intentions of corporate management are frequently undermined by 160 Degree Deviators with personal agendas who cause morale to suffer and frustration to set in.

The book then covers correlation and multivariate normal random variables; conditional expectation; optimization of decision variables, with discussions of the strategic value of information, decision trees, game theory, and adverse selection; risk sharing and finance; dynamic models of growth; dynamic models of arrivals; and model risk.

In this masterful biography, Janet Wallach shows us the woman behind these achievementsa woman whose passion and defiant independence were at odds with the confined and custom-bound England she left behind.

He grapples with why God made the world and what our role truly is, and seeks to answer the question,  How do I live in the natural world while expressing the values of the supernatural? Philip writes,  I have come to understand faith as the highest form of integrated encounter. Faith puts together, assembles, re-orders, accepting the entire world as God s handiwork. We live among clues, like rescuers sifting through pieces of stained glass shattered by a bomb, and only with a blueprint or some memory of original design can we begin to connect the shards, to assemble them into a pattern that makes sense of our world. Nature and supernature are not two separate worlds, but different expressions of the same reality. To encounter the world as a whole, we need a more supernatural awareness of the natural world. Yancey invites readers to join him on a journey of discovery. He challenges us to tune into  rumors of another world,  and connect the seen with the unseen. He promises that the grace-filled result will be a life of beauty, purpose, freedom, and faith.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=bD2L03AA4yMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Goober The Golf Ball's Great Adventure","description":"This is a story about a little golf ball named Goober.

Not to mention rumours which agitated the maritime population and excited the public mind, even in the interior of continents, seafaring men were particularly excited. Merchants, common sailors, captains of vessels, skippers, both of Europe and America, naval officers of all countries, and the Governments of several States on the two continents, were deeply interested in the matter. For some time past vessels had been met by \\"an enormous thing,\\" a long object, spindle-shaped, occasionally phosphorescent, and infinitely larger and more rapid in its movements than a whale. The facts relating to this apparition (entered in various log-books) agreed in most respects as to the shape of the object or creature in question, the untiring rapidity of its movements, its surprising power of locomotion, and the peculiar life with which it seemed endowed. If it was a whale, it surpassed in size all those hitherto classified in science. Taking into consideration the mean of observations made at divers times rejecting the timid estimate of those who assigned to this object a length of two hundred feet, equally with the exaggerated opinions which set it down as a mile in width and three in length we might fairly conclude that this mysterious being surpassed greatly all dimensions admitted by the learned ones of the day, if it existed at all. And that it DID exist was an undeniable fact; and, with that tendency which disposes the human mind in favour of the marvellous, we can understand the excitement produced in the entire world by this supernatural apparition. As to classing it in the list of fables, the idea was out of the question. On the 20th of July, 1866, the steamer Governor Higginson, of the Calcutta and Burnach Steam Navigation Company, had met this moving mass five miles off the east coast of Australia. Captain Baker thought at first that he was in the presence of an unknown sandbank; he even prepared to determine its exact position when two columns of water, projected by the mysterious object, shot with a hissing noise a hundred and fifty feet up into the air. Now, unless the sandbank had been submitted to the intermittent eruption of a geyser, the Governor Higginson had to do neither more nor less than with an aquatic mammal, unknown till then, which threw up from its blow-holes columns of water mixed with air and vapour. Similar facts were observed on the 23rd of July in the same year, in the Pacific Ocean, by the Columbus, of the West India and Pacific Steam Navigation Company. But this extraordinary creature could transport itself from one place to another with surprising velocity; as, in an interval of three days, the Governor Higginson and the Columbus had observed it at two different points of the chart, separated by a distance of more than seven hundred nautical leagues.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=LGIiDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cartoon Cakes (Warner Brothers)","description":"Cartoon Cakes is the eagerly awaited book from Debbie Brown, the UK's best-selling author of character and novelty cake books.

Everyone wants to know what Eminem is really like-after the curtains go down. In The Way I Am, Eminem writes candidly, about how he sees the world. About family and friends; about hip-hop and rap battles and his searing rhymes; about the conflicts and challenges that have made him who he is today. Illustrated with more than 200 full-color and black-and-white photographs-including family snapshots and personal Polaroids, it is a visual self-portrait that spans the rapper's entire life and career, from his early childhood in Missouri to the basement home studio he records in today, from Detroit's famous Hip Hop Shop to sold-out arenas around the globe. Readers who have wondered at Em's intricate, eye- opening rhyme patterns can also see, first-hand, the way his mind works in dozens of reproductions of his original lyric sheets, written in pen, on hotel stationary, on whatever scrap of paper was at hand. These lyric sheets, published for the first time here, show uncut genius at work. Taking readers deep inside his creative process, Eminem reckons with the way that chaos and controversy have fueled his music and helped to give birth to some of his most famous songs (including \\"Stan,\\" \\"Without Me,\\" and \\"Lose Yourself\\"). Providing a personal tour of Eminem's creative process, The Way I Am has been hailed as \\"fascinating,\\" \\"compelling,\\" and \\"candid.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=bKNPEAAAQBAJ&dq=Eminem&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"National Geographic Atlas of the World","description":"Provides physical and thematic maps of the Earth, covering such aspects as population, food, minerals, climate, politics, and energy, as well as maps of the surface of the Moon, Mars, inner and outer solar system, and universe.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=VPvyDAAAQBAJ&dq=National+Geographic+Atlas+of+the+World&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"CliffsAP U.S. Government and Politics","description":"With two complete practice exams, hundreds of practice questions, a fully annotated U.S. Constitution, and a glossary of political science terms, this cut-to-the-chase guide is just what AP candidates need for exam-day success.408 pp.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=uT00AAAACAAJ&dq=CliffsAP+U.S.+Government+and+Politics&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Six-Way Paragraphs: Advanced","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=7asuMwAACAAJ&dq=Six-Way+Paragraphs:+Advanced&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Writers on Comics Scriptwriting, Vol. 2","description":"The next generation of blazing hot comic book writing talent get their turn in the spotlight in Writers on Comics Scriptwriting Volume 2!

Despite England's triumph, it also played a crucial part in fatally weakening the English army immediately prior to the Norman Conquest, changing the course of history.

California's success, however, has come at significant costs. Never a family-farm region like the Midwest, California's landscape and Mediterranean climate have been manipulated and exploited to serve modern business interests. Home to gargantuan accomplishments such as the world's largest water storage and transfer network, California also relies on an army of Mexican farm laborers who live and work under dismal conditions. In The Conquest of Bread, acclaimed historian Richard A. Walker offers a wide-angle overview of the agro-industrial system of production in California from farm to table. He lays bare the long evolution of each link in the food chain, showing how a persistent emphasis on productivity and growth allowed California to outpace agriculture elsewhere in the United States. Full of thunder and surprises, The Conquest of Bread allows the reader to weigh the claims of both boosters and critics in the debate over the most extraordinary agricultural profusion in the modern world.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=TQOzAAAAIAAJ&dq=The+Conquest+of+Bread:+150+Years+of+Agribusiness+in+California&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"10 Essentials of Highly Healthy People","description":"A guide to health maintenance from a whole-person perspective considers health of the body, mind, and spirit, offering advice on how to make sense of contradictory media information, understand the link between mental and physical health, and recruit support during illness.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=DeftnO-tPfkC&dq=10+Essentials+of+Highly+Healthy+People&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Morita Therapy and the True Nature of Anxiety-Based Disorders: Shinkeishitsu","description":"The first English translation of a seminal work in a therapeutic practice that holds increasing interest for Westerners.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8FKn7cBtFgsC&dq=Morita+Therapy+and+the+True+Nature+of+Anxiety-Based+Disorders:+Shinkeishitsu&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"On a Highland Shore","description":"When her Scottish highland village is decimated in a Viking raid two weeks before her wedding, Margaret MacDonald and her surviving siblings find shelter in the home of warrior Gannon MacMagnus, who agrees to help Margaret locate her abducted younger brother.

But as Stephen Prothero argues in American Jesus, many of the most interesting appraisals of Jesus have emerged outside the churches: in music, film, and popular culture; and among Jews, Muslims, Buddhists, and people of no religion at all. Popular revisions of Jesus are nothing new: Thomas Jefferson famously took scissors to the New Testament to produce a Jesus he could call his own. In Prothero's incisive chronicle, the emergence of a cult of Jesus--as folk hero and commercial icon--is America's most distinctive contribution to Western religion. Prothero describes how Jesus was enlisted by abolitionists and Klansmen, by Teddy Roosevelt and Marcus Garvey. He explains how, in our own time, the proliferation of Jesus' image on Broadway stages and bumper stickers, on the cover of Time and on the Internet, in a Holy Land theme park and on a hot-air balloon, expresses the strange mix of the secular and the sacred in contemporary America. American Jesus is a lively and often witty work of history.

Britain's dwindling power in the Middle East was under siege from Arab nationalism, the Communist bloc and from American designs in the region. Aden, with its strategic military base and old Protectorate buffer zone, was soon the main battleground. The 1962 Egyptian-inspired coup in the neighbouring Kingdom of North Yemen further tightened the noose. So began a bitter and bloody insurgency war in South Arabia. British regular an special forces were soon pitted against growing and formidable insurgency forces, fighting both a war in the mountains and an urban conflict in the backstreets of Aden. Intelligence agencies vied for control of 'hearts and minds'. The British launched a clandestine war in Yemen to keep their enemies at bay. But still the situation in Aden spiralled out of control, culminating in a bloody slaughter in 1967. In that November, the British Army finally withdrew from South Arabia.??Aden Insurgency is the extraordinary story of Britain's last colonial conflict.

Drawing on a wide array of primary sources from slaveowners' diaries to children's daybooks to racist broadsides Joanne Pope Melish reveals not only how northern society changed but how its perceptions changed as well. Melish explores the origins of racial thinking and practices to show how ill-prepared the region was to accept a population of free people of color in its midst. Because emancipation was gradual, whites transferred prejudices shaped by slavery to their relations with free people of color, and their attitudes were buttressed by abolitionist rhetoric which seemed to promise riddance of slaves as much as slavery. She tells how whites came to blame the impoverished condition of people of color on their innate inferiority, how racialization became an important component of New England ante-bellum nationalism, and how former slaves actively participated in this discourse by emphasizing their African identity. Placing race at the center of New England history, Melish contends that slavery was important not only as a labor system but also as an institutionalized set of relations. The collective amnesia about local slavery's existence became a significant component of New England regional identity.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=itT-CgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Where the Money Is: How to Spot Key Trends to Make Investment Profits","description":"From the Foreword \\"Truly valuable investment advice doesn't just direct you to buy a particular stock but helps you to think about investment opportunities within sectors-specifically, in the industries that are poised for growth over the next years and decades.

Based on the most comprehensive survey ever done-representing a range of religious traditions and faith positions-Religion vs. Science is a story that is more nuanced and complex than the media and pundits would lead us to believe. The way religious Americans approach science is shaped by two fundamental questions: What does science mean for the existence and activity of God? What does science mean for the sacredness of humanity? How these questions play out as individual believers think about science both challenges stereotypes and highlights the real tensions between religion and science. Ecklund and Scheitle interrogate the widespread myths that religious people dislike science and scientists and deny scientific theories. Religion vs. Science is a definitive statement on a timely, popular subject. Rather than a highly conceptual approach to historical debates, philosophies, or personal opinions, Ecklund and Scheitle give readers a facts-on-the-ground, empirical look at what religious Americans really understand and think about science.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=VJc4DwAAQBAJ&dq=Religion+and+Science&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Birds Of The Great Basin: A Natural History (Max C.

Hutcheon identifies parody as one of the major forms of modern self-reflexivity, one that marks the intersection of invention and critique and offers an important mode of coming to terms with the texts and discourses of the past. Looking at works as diverse as Tom Stoppard's Rosenkrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead, Brian de Palma's Dressed to Kill, Woody Allen's Zelig, Karlheinz Stockhausen's Hymnen, James Joyce's Ulysses, and Magritte's This Is Not a Pipe, Hutcheon discusses the remarkable range of intent in modern parody while distinguishing it from pastiche, burlesque, travesty, and satire. She shows how parody, through ironic playing with multiple conventions, combines creative expression with critical commentary. Its productive-creative approach to tradition results in a modern recoding that establishes difference at the heart of similarity. In a new introduction, Hutcheon discusses why parody continues to fascinate her and why it is commonly viewed as suspect--for being either too ideologically shifty or too much of a threat to the ownership of intellectual and creative property.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=FoHXjEauvKIC&dq=A+Theory+of+Parody:+The+Teachings+of+Twentieth-Century+Art+Forms&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Graveyard Girl","description":"Kait Lenox is back!

For what is your life? It is even a vapor that appears for a little time and then vanishes away\\" (James 4:14). Living knowing that your life is a vapor is different than just living. Things here are passing away. You've got to hold on to what will stand. Savor what matters. This collection of thirty-one articles is full of that heart-longing after Christ that distinguishes Piper's preaching ministry. You will feel as though you have stumbled into a garden as you enter these pages. The Scripture cuts, Christ is exalted in God, and we worship Him. Life Is Short. Eternity Is Long. Live Like It. You will exist forever. You and God are both in the universe to stay--either as friends on His terms, or enemies on yours--which it will be is proven in this life. And this life is a vapor. Two seconds, and we will be gone. In these thirty-one meditations, John Piper will connect you to a fresh understanding of God and a renewed relationship with Him. You'll find your faith stirred to make every day count for Christ when you consider life as a vapor. Story Behind the Book Time is precious. We are fragile. Life is short. Eternity is long. Every minute counts. Oh, to be a faithful steward of the breath God has given me.

An accomplished poet, renowned for writing \\"smut and filth in terza rima,\\" she goes about her life in Pure Poetry with enough attitude and verve to win your heart forever. But since fleeing the all-consuming passion of her marriage to Max, the sexy German, she can no longer compose so much as a couplet; ghosts have taken over her Greenwich Village apartment, and the contrast between her feelings for her present lover and her former husband is breaking her heart. And neither her best friend, Carmen, nor her cross-dressing analyst, Leon, is able to soothe her angst over her impending thirty eighth birthday, an occasion fraught with a thirty-seven year tradition of emotional devastation. But time waits for no woman, and the dreaded birthday does bring insight: Love can be undone by the same desires that nurture it. Lila knows that she has got to take action, and in doing so she comes to realize some startling truths about herself, her capacity for love, and the nature of true freedom.

Cabot, Frobisher, Hudson, Parry and Ross were all defeated, and the names on the maps testify to their despair: Bay of God's Mercy, the Devil's Cape, Savage Isles, and Repulse Bay. Determined to succeed where the rest had failed, Sir John Franklin-\\"the Lion of the Arctic\\"-set sail from Greenland in 1845. His two ships, the Erebus and the Terror, were last sighted in August of that year, after which the entire expedition-all 135 men-disappeared. For three years, the two ships were trapped in the Arctic ice. Eventually the slow vise of the ice pack and spoiling provisions proved to be too much. Nothing was heard of Franklin's expedition for over a decade, and only many years later did the world begin to learn of their terrible, agonizing fate. In this enthralling, richly inventive novel, Robert Edric recreates what possibly happened to this doomed expedition.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=bAlTy-cbJAEC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Riverside Literature Series Number 1: Evangeline","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_XluswEACAAJ&dq=The+Riverside+Literature+Series+Number+1:+Evangeline&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Water Buffalo: New Prospects for an Underutilized Animal","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=U2rLwAEACAAJ&dq=The+Water+Buffalo:+New+Prospects+for+an+Underutilized+Animal&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rabbit Hill","description":"When a new family moves into the neighborhood the animals of Rabbit Hill are very curious about how these human inhabitants will act.

A consequence of this is that we cannot have any realistic emotional ties: it can never be conclusively said that someone is happy or sad about anything. Finally he argues that no one can ever say, let alone believe, that anything is the case. In order to get beyond this apparent bind - and this condition of ignorance - Unger proposes a radical departure from the linguistic and epistemological systems we have become accustomed to. Epistemologists, as well as philosophers of mind and language will undoubtedly find in this study of the limitations of language an invaluable philosophical perspective.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=h1xI9RoOgi0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The cricket war: The inside story of Kerry Packer's World Series Cricket","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Call it right!: Umpiring in the Little League","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Genre","description":"Genre is a key means by which we categorize the many forms of literature and culture.

During her life, she felt uncomfortable about discussing the source of her fiction and refused to answer questions about her private life. Yet after her death in February 1995, Highsmith left behind a vast archive of personal documents - diaries, notebooks and letters - which detail the links between her life and her work. Drawing on these intimate papers, together with material gleaned from her closest friends and lovers, Andrew Wilson has written the first biography of an author described by Graham Greene as the 'poet of apprehension'. Wilson illuminates the dark corners of Highsmith's life, casts light on mysteries of the creative process and reveals the secrets that the writer chose to keep hidden until after her death.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8As0EAAAQBAJ&dq=Beautiful+Shadow&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A fin de cuentas: Homenaje a Jose Echeverria (Ensayo / Dolmen) (Spanish Edition)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_LHfAAAAMAAJ&dq=A+fin+de+cuentas:+Homenaje+a+Jose+Echeverria+(Ensayo+/+Dolmen)+(Spanish+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Confessions of a Lottery Ball: The Inside-out World of Aaron Freeman","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=OAVwAAAACAAJ&dq=Confessions+of+a+Lottery+Ball:+The+Inside-out+World+of+Aaron+Freeman&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Guide to Cooking Schools (Guide to Cooking Schools: Cooking Schools, Courses, Vacations, Apprenticeships & Wine Instruction ..)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=4avwIWG4caIC&dq=The+Guide+to+Cooking+Schools+(Guide+to+Cooking+Schools:+Cooking+Schools,+Courses,+Vacations,+Apprenticeships&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Strange Encounters: Adventures of a Renegade Naturalist","description":"A collection of anecdotal adventures through the natural world includes descriptions of the author's experiences of rebuilding a New Hampshire mill, researching a protein food source for space travel, and working in a radioactive forest on an early Cold War research project.

The national heritage under attack. Mob violence. America is on the brink of becoming a one-party dictatorship. How did this happen? The Enemy Within: How a Totalitarian Movement Is Destroying America provides the answer. David Horowitz has been the b te noire of the Left for decades on account of his courageous revelations of their aims and tactics, and now he sounds the alarm: the barbarians are already inside the gates. Horowitz lays out how we have ended up in the worst national crisis since the Civil War. He details: ? The Left s embrace of Critical Race Theory and Cultural Marxism the underpinnings of their totalitarian ideology ? The decades-long infiltration of our education system by ideologies hostile to America, our institutions, and our freedom ? Why the Obama administration marked a point of no return in the division of America into two irreconcilable political factions ? The Democrats  unprincipled campaign to destroy a duly elected U.S. president ? Their political exploitation of the coronavirus pandemic ? Their complicity in the riots of the summer of 2020, which left twenty-five dead, injured two thousand police officers, caused billions of dollars in property damage, and revealed the fragility of our civic order As Abraham Lincoln so presciently warned on the eve of America s last existential crisis,  If destruction be our lot, we must ourselves be its author and finisher. As a nation of freemen, we must live for all time, or die by suicide.  In The Enemy Within, David Horowitz provides a spot-on assessment of the threat to the American Republic and points to an escape route while there s still time.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Qjb-DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Death in High Heels.","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=o8tLAQAAMAAJ&dq=Death+in+High+Heels.&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Silver Spike: The Chronicles of the Black Company (Chronicle of the Black Company)","description":"...embedded in the trunk of the scion of the godtree, it contains the essence of the maddest of the Ten Who Were Taken...The Dominator.

R. Fehrenbach","description":"The definitive account of the incomparable Lone Star state by the author of Fire & Blood: A History of Mexico. T. R. Fehrenbach is a native Texan, military historian and the author of several important books about the region, but none as significant as this work, arguably the best single volume about Texas ever published. His account of America's most turbulent state offers a view that only an insider could capture. From the native tribes who lived there to the Spanish and French soldiers who wrested the territory for themselves, then to the dramatic ascension of the republic of Texas and the saga of the Civil War years. Fehrenbach describes the changes that disturbed the state as it forged its unique character. Most compelling is the one quality that would remain forever unchanged through centuries of upheaval: the courage of the men and women who struggled to realize their dreams in The Lone Star State.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=dh4rAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Guide to Capturing a Plum Blossom","description":"Red Pine is the best-selling and ground-breaking translator of Chinese literature","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=mVHowAEACAAJ&dq=Guide+to+Capturing+a+Plum+Blossom&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Coral reef (One small square)","description":"Hardy adventurers ages 6 - 9 dive into a silent watery world where tiny coral animals grow together to form rock gardens of white, pink, and red-orange.

Overprotected and starved for a life, she is smothered by her overbearing parents, successful sister Aruna, and Arun, the family s disappointment of a son. Across the world in Massachusetts, where Arun has gone as a student, family life in an American suburb is bewilderingly different. The Pattons, who he lives with, appear strange and terrible. The women don t appear to cook at all, though they stuff their shopping carts; the men barbecue huge chunks of meat; their daughter binges on innumerable candy bars. Increasingly, Mrs Patton is desperate to be a vegetarian, like Arun. But what Arun wants most is to be invisible.

Basing his research on the diaries, records, and journals of the explorers themselves, he note only traces their progress but reveals them as human beings against a huge panorama in the Spaniards - Ponce de Leon, Cort s, Coronado, de Soto - push forward from the South; the French - Cartier, Champlain, Jolliet, Marquette - move down from the North: British and Americans set out westward from the Atlantic; and the Russians come down from Alaska.

This collection of essays traces Western civilization's struggle to interpret and understand the ancient knowledge of cultures that revere magic men and women-individuals with the power to summon spirits. As written by priests, explorers, adventurers, natural historians, and anthropologists, the pieces express the wonder of strangers in new worlds. Who were these extraordinary magic-makers who imitated the sounds of animals in the night, or drank tobacco juice through funnels, or wore collars filled with stinging ants? Shamans Through Time is a rare chronicle of changing attitudes toward that which is strange and unfamiliar. With essays by such acclaimed thinkers as Claude L vi-Strauss, Black Elk, Carlos Castaneda, and Frank Boas, it provides an awesome glimpse into the incredible shamanic practices of cultures around the world.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=bQGDPoWrR_EC&dq=Shamans+Through+Time&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"DISASTER LOG OF SHIPS","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=I5g1zgEACAAJ&dq=DISASTER+LOG+OF+SHIPS&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Golden Days: Memories of a Golden Retriever","description":"There's no love quite like the love of a golden retriever.

The late antique world possessed no voice like that of Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius (121-180 CE). His private meditations on what constitutes a good life have withstood the centuries and reach us today with the same penetrating clarity and shining light as the words of Shakespeare, Emerson, or Thoreau. In this remarkable new translation, bestselling religious philosopher Jacob Needleman and classics scholar John P. Piazza have retained the depth of Marcus's perspective on life. They have carefully selected and faithfully rendered those passages that clarify Marcus's role as someone who stood within the great religious and ethical traditions that extend throughout every culture in human history. The voice that emerges from their translation is a universal one, equally recognizable to students of Christ, Buddha, the Vedas, the Talmud, and to anyone who sincerely searches for a way of meaning in contemporary life.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0uSVHxhL5aEC&dq=MARCUS+AURELIUS&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Power of His Presence","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=phaOrgEACAAJ&dq=The+Power+of+His+Presence&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cultural Studies: From Theory to Action","description":"In this important new book Rein Raud develops an original theory of culture understood as a loose and internally contradictory system of texts and practices that are shared by intermittent groups of people and used by them to make sense of their life-worlds. This theory views culture simultaneously in two ways: as a world of texts, tangible and shareable products of signifying acts, and as a space of practices, repeatable activities that produce, disseminate and interpret these clusters of meaning. Both approaches are developed into corresponding models of culture which, used together, are able to provide a rich understanding of any meaning in action. In developing this innovative theory, Raud draws on a wide range of disciplines, from anthropology, sociology and cultural studies to semiotics and philosophy. The theory is illustrated throughout with examples drawn from both 'high' and popular culture, and from Western and Asian traditions, dealing with both contemporary and historical topics. The book concludes with two case studies from very different contexts  one dealing with Italian poetry in the 13th century, the other dealing with the art scene in Eastern Europe in the 1990s. This timely and original work makes a major new contribution to the theory of culture and will be welcomed by students and scholars throughout the social sciences and humanities.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=GRotDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Energetic Bodywork: Practical Techniques","description":"If you want to go beyond physical and massage therapy to include working with the chakra system, meridians, and vibrational therapies, this is the book to get you started.

In his fascinating new book, Dr. Lee Goldman presents a radical explanation: The key protective traits that once ensured our species' survival are now the leading global causes of illness and death. Our capacity to store food, for example, lures us into overeating, and a clotting system designed to protect us from bleeding to death now directly contributes to heart attacks and strokes.

Ross Winterowd develop their successful first edition with new examples, more discussion questions and exercises, and clear explanations of the grammatical principles that teach students to understand grammar conceptually and deeply. The first edition has been completely redesigned visually to enhance learning and retention. Rodby and Winterowd's THE USES OF GRAMMAR 2E is an accessible approach grounded in deep understanding of language acquisition, structure, and even the rhetoric of everyday use. THE USES OF GRAMMAR 2E integrates traditional, structural, and functional concepts with ideas from contemporary linguistics and grammatical study. Rather than simply partition the study of grammar from the bottom up-from the parts to the whole-Rodby and Winterowd employ a unique structure based on the differentiation of FORM and FUNCTION. This structure is framed around three questions: What are the forms in the grammar of American English? How do those forms function in that grammar? How are they used in real-life speaking and writing to achieve specific purposes? Students may learn, for example, how a variety of FORMS (including nouns, pronouns, verbals, and clauses) can all FUNCTION as nominals. This form/function approach ensures that students learn the uses of grammar as both an object of study and as the living text of social interaction. - THE USES OF GRAMMAR thus uses living language to illustrate the practical applications of grammar in our lives. These examples are drawn from a wide variety of sources-newspapers, magazines, books, and the writings of undergraduate students--and from such writers and speakers as Ronald Reagan, Shirley Chisholm, Groucho Marx, Mark Twain, and Jane Addams. Class-tested and refined to be student- and instructor-friendly, THE USES OF GRAMMAR 2E also features \\"For Discussion\\" sections that enhance students' understanding of the principles covered in the text and encourage classroom discussion. \\"Using Grammar\\" sections show students how to think about grammar's function in social relations. \\"Language Learning\\" sections summarize critical concepts. Chapter Previews and Chapter Reviews help students anticipate the new principles, rules, and concepts to follow and reinforce learning. Exercises ask students to rehearse new learning, and Challengers ask them to apply this learning to broader issues or more complex problems. - JUDITH RODBY joined the faculty at California State University, Chico in 1989 after finishing her PhD in the rhetoric, linguistics, and literature program at the University of Southern California. She has been the composition coordinator, writing center director, and coordinator of basic writing. She is currently working primarily in the field of English education and is coordinator for the National Writing Project's National Reading Initiative. She has published in composition, ESL, youth development, and English education. - W. Ross Winterowd was the Bruce R. McElderry Professor Emeritus, University of Southern California, where he founded its PhD program in Rhetoric, Linguistics, and Literature. He authored, coauthored, or edited many essays, reviews, poems, and books, including SEARCHING FOR FAITH: A SKEPTIC'S JOURNEY (2004, Parlor Press), SENIOR CITIZENS WRITING (2007, Parlor Press), THE CULTURE AND POLITICS OF LITERACY (1989, Oxford), and ATTITUDES: SELECTED PROSE AND POETRY (2010, Parlor Press). In 2010, he received the field's highest honor, the Exemplar Award, from the Conference on College Composition and Communication.

Before setting up the corral, we were forced to clear away shards of glass, bent nails, broken lumber. My prairie skirt and petticoats hung ragged and clay-caked, and under a droopy Stetson my frizzled hair appeared at once greased and starched beyond human recognition. A cloud, a sort of vaporousness, redolent with fresh acrid sweat on top of powerful stale sweat, hung thickly about me. Laced, as it was, with a woman's sweet musky secretions, and all gone past ripe, oddly it was a pungency I savored. Such goaty piquance, though, was cause to be shunned in any town setting. The look of my world had changed. Gone were the high-dollar designer clothes and the zipping around fabled Marin County in a candy-apple-red 1966 Mustang convertible. It was true that I unfailingly sought the ironies in life and, with a kind of dual personality, shifted easily through incongruencies such as town strolls in high heels and backcountry hiking in bare feet; the bucket seats of a classic automobile and the broken-down bench of a beater truck. It was only during the years that I d worn white overalls, taped drywall, and come home every night much like Charles Schulz's Pig Pen, flaking a cloud of dried white mud bits onto the rug, that I'd felt moved to keep my fingernails painted red. Now I was to slip farther than ever planned toward one end of my seesaw and then, incredibly, by conscious design, inch out even farther.\\" --from Barefoot-Hearted With more than 1.5 million copies in print, Kathleen Meyer's groundbreaking international bestseller, How to Shit in the Woods: An Environmentally Sound Approach to a Lost Art, has been widely embraced by the outdoor community and has found its way into myriad places: national parks, outdoor leadership schools and scout-troop headquarters, the camp tents of those who have discovered that it is amusing out-loud reading, and the bathroom-literature baskets of households around the world. Now, from the Rocky Mountain West, Meyer brings us Barefoot-Hearted: A Wild Life Among Wildlife, a coming-into-the-country story told with the frank, dry humor and sharp research of her first book. The country, in this case, is Montana's tall, reaching landscape with its ever underfoot wild critters; the on-tenterhooks territory of a new romantic relationship; and the pressure cooker that is our precarious global imbalance. Meyer finds herself in midlife standing out under yawning skies, surrounded by sagebrush and cactus, having fallen for the Irish charm of itinerant farrier Patrick McCarron. As partners, they travel across three mountain states with draft horses and a covered wagon and then set up housekeeping in a seventy-five-year-old dairy barn. In this primitive structure, the author rapidly discovers she's living with troops of mice, a nursery colony of seventy-five bats, sexually fired-up skunks, and more flies than in a pig shed. She tells of a freakish season that or-phaned seventy-seven bear cubs, an unusual fly-fishing trip on a famed blue-ribbon trout stream, the visitations of moose, and the discovery of a den of wolves. Meyer's prose is original and inspired, playful yet provocative. She carries us vividly back to the settlers' old West while pondering modern-day dilemmas, those of fitting into this fast hurtling world, of determining amid the earth's rising extinctions of species, whose planet it is, and of managing to stay empowered residing with a man who \\"stands six feet six and beats steel on an anvil for a living.\\" A personal chronicle of conscience and a love story of rare and quirky dimension, Barefoot-Hearted catapults readers into new realms of thought, deftly guided there by Meyer's sense of the ironic, the randy, and the humorous.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=G361xwuqKIkC&dq=Barefoot-Hearted+:+A+Wild+Life+Among+Wildlife&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Light of the Oracle","description":"Bryn is the daughter of a humble stone-cutter.

Kennon was one of twenty-five Americans in a single federal trial to receive the maximum sentence for a petty offense. Six months for a Class B misdemeanor and a $3,000 fine. The introduction, a fast-forward through this offenders life story, clearly reveals the motivations and consequences of this clergymans purposeful act of resistance, in the spirit of Gandhi and King and in the face of a governmental threat of prison time. Chapters 1 through 7 are taken from his contemporaneous prison journal and letters to family members. They tell how he was dealing with what happened each month during the time he was incarcerated. Over the years I have studied corrections as a sociologist and visited inmates as a clergyman. It is a very different experience being a prisoner, writes Kennon. He paints prison life with a mixture of pain and humor that captures the ironic picture of a correctional institution bent on retribution without rehabilitation. Mingled among these pages are his prison poems, reflections, and articles, as well as selected excerpts from wise writings he encountered during his time there.

Madame Roland was devoted to her spouse and always gave him full credit for work in which she was a full partner, including the inspection of manufacturers under the Old Regime and the post of minister of the interior during parts of 1792 and 1793.

Communication between the heavenly realms and the earth were/are at the core of the human consideration of, and openness to the existence of beings from the heavens who can and have visited us humans. Humans have constructed a taxonomy of types of what we employ with the catch-all term angels. Some are identified with warfare, others with healing, yet others with informing. Even others are associated with the role of guardian and teacher. These, however, do not exhaust the possibilities.

This collection counters those assumptions as it examines Welty's handling of race, the color line, and Jim Crow segregation and sheds new light on her views about the patterns, insensitivities, blindness, and atrocities of whiteness. Contributors to this volume show that Welty addressed whiteness and race in her earliest stories, her photography, and her first novel, Delta Wedding. In subsequent work, including The Golden Apples, The Optimist's Daughter, and her memoir, One Writer's Beginnings, she made the color line and white privilege visible, revealing the gaping distances between lives lived in shared space but separated by social hierarchy and segregation. Even when black characters hover in the margins of her fiction, they point readers toward complex lives, and the black body is itself full of meaning in her work. Several essays suggest that Welty represented race, like gender and power, as a performance scripted by whiteness. Her black characters in particular recognize whiteface and blackface as performances, especially comical when white characters are unaware of their role play. Eudora Welty, Whiteness, and Race also makes clear that Welty recognized white material advantage and black economic deprivation as part of a cycle of race and poverty in America and that she connected this history to lives on either side of the color line, to relationships across it, and to an uneasy hierarchy of white classes within the presumed monolith of whiteness.

Beginning with the start of time itself, Knickerbocker reveals historical anecdotes, both real and imagined featuring social commentary, fresh perspectives on the past, and conversations with powerful historical figures. With humor and intrigue, A Knickerbocker s History of New York tells the tale of the discovery of New York, and explores the first Dutch settlements. While examining those origins, Knickerbocker muses about the ethics of colonization and the immoral treatment of Native Americans, with biting and brutal honesty. Still under the Dutch  rule , 1600 New York acted as one of the breeding grounds for many American Christmas traditions, some of which are still alive today. Under a comical microscope, A Knickerbocker s History of New York explores the effect the early Dutch settlements have on American culture, particularly in New York. Originally published in 1809, Washington Irving s A Knickerbocker s History of New York earned acclaim for its innovative genre as one of the first American comedic works. With the mix of specific, inside jokes and universal humor, Irving s satire invites laughter from both his original audience and contemporary readers. With prose and wit that has remained fresh and hilarious even two-hundred and eleven years later, Washington Irving s A Knickerbocker s History of New York contains a narrative that has earned centuries of influence. While playfully mocking both classic literature and historians, Irving was bold enough to even include a list of people, professions and properties that he intended to make fun of. Though Irving mixes fact with fiction, A Knickerbocker s History of New York provides useful insight on the history of Dutch Americans, as well as contributing thoughtful social commentary that finds itself still applicable to modern society. Now featuring a stunning new cover design and a modern font, this edition of Washington Irving s A Knickerbocker s History of New York is both accessible and entertaining.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7ZosEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"CliffsNotes on Shakespeare's Macbeth (Cliffsnotes Literature)","description":"The original CliffsNotes study guides offer expert commentary on major themes, plots, characters, literary devices, and historical background.

For Howard Zinn in 1964, SNCC members were  new abolitionists,  but SNCC pursued radical initiatives and Black Power politics in addition to reform. It was committed to grassroots organizing in towns and rural communities, facilitating voter registration and direct action through  projects  embedded in Freedom Houses, especially in the South: the setting for most of SNCC s stories. Over time, it changed from a tight cadre into a disparate group of many constellations but stood out among civil rights organizations for its participatory democracy and emphasis on local people deciding the terms of their battle for social change. Organizers debated their role and grappled with SNCC s responsibility to communities, to the  walking wounded  damaged by racial terrorism, and to individuals who died pursuing racial justice. SNCC s Stories examines the organization s print and publishing culture, uncovering how fundamental self- and group narration is for the undersung heroes of social movements. The organizer may be SNCC s dramatis persona, but its writers have been overlooked. In the 1960s it was assumed established literary figures would write about civil rights, and until now, critical attention has centered on the Black Arts Movement, neglecting what SNCC s writers contributed. Sharon Monteith gathers hard-to-find literature where the freedom movement in the civil rights South is analyzed as subjective history and explored imaginatively. SNCC s print culture consists of field reports, pamphlets, newsletters, fiction, essays, poetry, and plays, which serve as intimate and illuminative sources for understanding political action. SNCC's literary history contributes to the organization's legacy.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=DWr9DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rhetoric In Popular Culture","description":" An accessible introduction to contemporary rhetorical theory and its applications in everyday life.

Since the first edition of this volume was published, much has changed globally, directly impacting the phenomenon of human smuggling. Migrant smuggling and human trafficking are now more entrenched than ever in many regions, with efforts to combat them both largely unsuccessful and often counterproductive. This book explores human smuggling in several forms and regions, globally examining its deep historic, social, economic, and cultural roots and its broad political consequences. Contributors to the updated and expanded edition consider the trends and events of the past several years, especially in light of developments after 9/11 and the creation of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. They also reflect on the moral economy of human smuggling and trafficking, the increasing percentage of the world's asylum seekers who escape political violence only by being smuggled, and the implications of human smuggling in a warming world.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Uqzgr3ZIkL4C&dq=Global+Human+Smuggling:+Comparative+Perspectives&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Introduction to Perfumery: Technology and Marketing","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ydJaAAAAYAAJ&dq=Introduction+to+Perfumery:+Technology+and+Marketing&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Catholicism For Dummies (For Dummies (Religion & Spirituality))","description":"There are more than one billion Catholics in the world, and each one has a similar set of basic beliefs and practices that he or she follows.

Convertible bonds can be complex because they have both equity and debt like features and new market entrants will usually find that they have either a knowledge of fixed income mathematics or of equity derivatives and therefore have no idea how to incorporate credit and equity together into their existing pricing tools. Part I of the book covers the impact that the 2008 credit crunch has had on the markets, it then shows how to build up a convertible bond and introduces the reader to the traditional convertible vocabulary of yield to put, premium, conversion ratio, delta, gamma, vega and parity. The market of stock borrowing and lending will also be covered in detail. Using an intuitive approach based on the Jensen inequality, the authors will also show the advantages of using a hybrid to add value - pre 2008, many investors labelled convertible bonds as 'investing with no downside', there are of course plenty of 2008 examples to prove that they were wrong. The authors then go onto give a complete explanation of the different features that can be embedded in convertible bond. Part II shows readers how to price convertibles. It covers the different parameters used in valuation models: credit spreads, volatility, interest rates and borrow fees and Maturity. Part III covers investment strategies for equity, fixed income and hedge fund investors and includes dynamic hedging and convertible arbitrage. Part IV explains the all important risk management part of the process in detail. This is a highly practical book, all products priced are real world examples and numerical examples are not limited to hypothetical convertibles. It is a must read for anyone wanting to safely get into this highly liquid, high return market.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=paHAQY0dIbYC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Twilight of an Empire: Life in the Forbidden City in China Qing Dynasty","description":"Tzu Hsi, the last Empress of China, was an absolute autocrat who ruled a vast empire with an iron will.

Yet, Malachi's passionate proclamations and the significance of what he had to say to his people capture the attention of even the casual reader. The message of Malachi came at a time of cultural and religious rethinking for Israel (roughly 500 B.C.E), when God's people were scattered throughout the Near East, with most living in Mesopotamia under Persian rule. They could easily have disappeared from history had it not been for the prophetic call to repentance. In his fresh new translation, notes, and comments on this brief prophetic book, Andrew E. Hill explains why we should pay attention to Malachi as God's spokesperson. Hill places the book in its historical context to interpret the original meaning, as well as offer the modern reader insights into what it has to say to us today. With a wonderful insert filled with photographs, line art, and maps, he provides all the necessary details for the reader to understand and appreciate Malachi.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ogZaAAAAYAAJ&dq=Malachi+(Anchor+Bible)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rocking Horse Winner","description":"D.H.

Corrupted by Power shows how the Constitution is repeatedly changed to mean whatever the Supreme Court wants it to mean. Precedent is followed only when past decisions support current opinions. Otherwise precedents are overruled, misrepresented or ignored.

Selected by the Modern Library as one of the 100 best nonfiction books of all time  A towering biography . . . a brilliant chronicle.  Time This classic biography is the story of seven men a naturalist, a writer, a lover, a hunter, a ranchman, a soldier, and a politician who merged at age forty-two to become the youngest President in history. The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt begins at the apex of his international prestige. That was on New Year s Day, 1907, when TR, who had just won the Nobel Peace Prize, threw open the doors of the White House to the American people and shook 8,150 hands. One visitor remarked afterward,  You go to the White House, you shake hands with Roosevelt and hear him talk and then you go home to wring the personality out of your clothes.  The rest of this book tells the story of TR s irresistible rise to power. During the years 18581901, Theodore Roosevelt transformed himself from a frail, asthmatic boy into a full-blooded man. Fresh out of Harvard, he simultaneously published a distinguished work of naval history and became the fist-swinging leader of a Republican insurgency in the New York State Assembly. He chased thieves across the Badlands of North Dakota with a copy of Anna Karenina in one hand and a Winchester rifle in the other. Married to his childhood sweetheart in 1886, he became the country squire of Sagamore Hill on Long Island, a flamboyant civil service reformer in Washington, D.C., and a night-stalking police commissioner in New York City. As assistant secretary of the navy, he almost single-handedly brought about the Spanish-American War. After leading  Roosevelt s Rough Riders  in the famous charge up San Juan Hill, Cuba, he returned home a military hero, and was rewarded with the governorship of New York. In what he called his  spare hours  he fathered six children and wrote fourteen books. By 1901, the man Senator Mark Hanna called  that damned cowboy  was vice president. Seven months later, an assassin s bullet gave TR the national leadership he had always craved. His is a story so prodigal in its variety, so surprising in its turns of fate, that previous biographers have treated it as a series of haphazard episodes. This book, the only full study of TR s pre-presidential years, shows that he was an inevitable chief executive.  It was as if he were subconsciously aware that he was a man of many selves,  the author writes,  and set about developing each one in turn, knowing that one day he would be President of all the people.

This book collects and explores the elaborately detailed pro-slavery arguments rooted in religion, law, politics, science, and economics. In his introduction, now updated to include the relationship between early Christianity and slavery, Paul Finkelman discusses how early world societies legitimized slavery, the distinction between Northern and Southern ideas about slavery, and how the ideology of the American Revolution prompted the need for a defense of slavery. The rich collection of documents allows for a thorough examination of these ideas through poems, images, speeches, correspondences, and essays. This edition features two new documents that highlight women's voices and the role of women in the movement to defend slavery plus a visual document that demonstrates how the notion of black inferiority and separateness was defended through the science of the time. Document headnotes and a chronology, plus updated questions for consideration and selected bibliography help students engage with the documents to understand the minds of those who defended slavery.

After years of battling with the onslaught of her husband's Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis, Mary stumbled on a little known doctor in New York City, Dr. Bernard Bihari. Many people on the internet claimed that Dr. Bihari knew how to stop every type of MS from progressing. Even better, it was claimed that he could help everyone with an autoimmune disorder, ranging from psoriasis to AIDS. It was claimed that Dr. Bihari could help them with Low Dose Naltrexone (LDN). Eventually, Mary's husband took a leap of faith and put Dr. Bihari's work to the test. LDN worked. It stopped his MS from progressing. Since September 2002, a worldwide campaign has ignited with passionate momentum to get LDN medically recognized as a treatment for MS and all autoimmune disorders. LDN is a cheap, generic, out of patent drug with no known side-effects.

But what of the V-3 and V-4? What of Schmetterling, the Rochling shell, the Kurt bomb, the Hs293? These, and many other devices, were all part of the German secret armoury but are relatively unknown except to a handful of specialists. What of the German nuclear bomb? And the question of chemical warfare? The sheer magnitude of the secret weapon projects of the Third Reich is revealed in this comprehensive study written by one of the world's great experts on weaponry. The book explores the various fields in which the Germans concentrated their weapon development and discusses the multiplicity of ideas, the difficulties, and, in several cases, how these ideas were subsequently exploited by the victors. Although much of the German wartime development was not completed before the war's end, it nevertheless provided a foundation for a great deal of the munitions development which has since taken place. Comparisons with Allied projects are also drawn.

In the present volume, Professor Summers seeks to abolish this dualism of approach: he is concerned throughout to demonstrate Herbert s religion as it is expressed in his poems, and to interpret the poems in the light of his religion, for they are a  picture  of meticulously observed spiritual experience. He gives us a scholarly, lucid, and integrated study of a much-loved poet, who was at once a good man, a profound Christian thinker, and a most daring experimentalist in the craft of verse. Professor Summers charts the many currents and cross-currents of early seventeenth century religious thought that affected Herbert, traces the stages of the poet s life, and then proceeds to a thorough examination of the form and content of his work. There are interesting chapters on his metrical  counterpoint,  his dramatic-colloquial style, and the influence of music upon his poetry. This is not only an authoritative study of the poet himself but a notable contribution to the problem, so keenly discussed today, of religious belief in relation to poetry.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=biVwDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The House of horror: The complete story of Hammer Films","description":"\\"House of Horror traces the complete history of Hammer, from its early origins through to its golden era of classic horror movies, and presents a comprehensive overview of Hammer's importance and influence in world cinema.\\"--Cover.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=M3AcAQAAIAAJ&dq=The+House+of+horror:+The+complete+story+of+Hammer+Films&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The creation of human ability: a handbook for Scientologists","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=wmGnHgAACAAJ&dq=The+creation+of+human+ability:+a+handbook+for+Scientologists&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"While Rome burns","description":"\\"While Rome Burns\\" by Alexander Woollcott.

While Kenya s Christianity may offer modes of coping with the fragilities of urban life, it is subject to repeated crises and schisms, often fueled by rumors and accusations of hypocrisy. In order to understand the unfolding of Kenyans  dynamic religious identities, and inspired by the omnipresent distinction between  religious membership  and  church visits,  Yonatan N. Gez considers the complementary relations between a center of religious affiliation and expansion towards secondary practices. Building on this basic distinction, the book develops a theoretical innovation in the form of the  religious repertoire  model, which maps individuals  religious identities in terms of three intertwined degrees of practice.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=H6BtDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Holloway Falls (Import)","description":"Until his death in 1944, Holloway attended almost every performance of the Abbey Theatre and daily recorded in his journal his reactions to plays and players and his comments about and conversations with literary and theatrical people. From the journal s 221 bulky volumes, housed in the National Library of Ireland, Mr. Hogan and Mr. O Neill have compiled this book of extracts from the approximately 25,000,000 words written by the Irishman. The years from 1899 to 1926 were chosen because they are generally considered to be the significant ones for the Abbey Theatre: the year of its founding to the production of Sean O Casey s The Plough and the Stars, which caused a riot in the theatre. Mr. Holloway attended every play during these years, as well as many rehearsals, and talked with nearly everybody who had anything to do with the theatre. This journal reflects the tensions, feuds, and anguish that produced one of the great theatres of modern times. The meticulous display of minute detail makes Joseph Holloway s Abbey Theatre imperative reading for the student of modern theatre, particularly since its character as a daily account permits ready checking of dates listed in previous works about the Irish National Theatre.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=HF-Lt_Bu9GQC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Extremities","description":"This cutting-edge collection of short fiction--from a Bram Stoker and Locus Award-winning author--melds literature, science fiction, and horror.

Six weeks later he was sent home; ashes in an urn. Soon another letter arrived. \\"The Gestapo has notified your brothers and me that we are to be deported to the East--whatever that means.\\" Hannelore knew: labor camps, starvation, beatings...How could Mama and her two younger brothers bear that? She made a decision: She would go home and be deported with her family. Despite the horrors she faced in eight labor and concentration camps, Hannelore met and fell in love with a Polish POW named Dick Hillman. Oskar Schindler was their one hope to survive.

Stories by thirty-three elders from all over southwestern Alaska, presented in parallel Yup?ik and English texts, include a wealth of information about the creation and function of masks and the environment in which they flourished. The full-length, unannotated stories are complete with features of oral storytelling such as repetition and digression; the language of the English translation follows the Yup?ik idiom as closely as possible. Reminiscences about the cultural setting of masked dancing are grouped into chapters on the traditional Yup?ik ceremonial cycle, the use of masks, life in the qasgiq (communal men?s house), the supression and revival of masked dancing, maskmaking, and dance and song. Stories are grouped geographically, representing the Yukon, Kuskokwim, and coastal areas. The subjects of the stories and the masks made to accompany them are the Arctic animals, beings, and natural forces on which humans depended. This book will be treasured by the Yup?ik residents of southwestern Alaska and an international audience of linguists, folklorists, anthropologists, and art historians.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=dNMhCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Goldmining in Foreclosure Properties","description":"Start Building Wealth Today by Investing in Distressed Properties!

(2) What does it mean to integrate questions, ideas, values, and beliefs as we create our living environments? (3) What are symbols and metaphors and how do they contribute to the human dialogue? (4) How do purpose, intention, and consciousness foster creativity and influence our perceptions of human living?Three conclusions emerged in exploring these questions: (1) Models of earlier eras are not comprehensive enough to speak about the nature of our contemporary environment. (2) Human models are creative human inventions.

People have asked me for copies of the course notes, and different versions of them have been circulating for a few years. Finally I decided that I should really take the time to write the material up in a coherent way and make a book out of it. Here, now, is the result of this work. Over the years many students have been helpful in improving the quality of the notes, and also several colleagues at Linz and elsewhere have contributed to it. I want to thank them all for their effort, in particular I want to thank B. Buchberger, who taught me the theory of Grabner bases nearly two decades ago, B. F. Caviness and B. D. Saunders, who first stimulated my interest in various problems in computer algebra, G. E. Collins, who showed me how to compute in algebraic domains, and J. R.

Brian Williams  Bombshell reporting.   David Muir The true story of what took place in Donald Trump s White House during a disastrous 2020 has never before been told in full. What was really going on around the president, as the government failed to contain the coronavirus and over half a million Americans perished? Who was influencing Trump after he refused to concede an election he had clearly lost and spread lies about election fraud? To answer these questions, Phil Rucker and Carol Leonnig reveal a dysfunctional and bumbling presidency s inner workings in unprecedented, stunning detail. Focused on Trump and the key players around him the doctors, generals, senior advisers, and Trump family members  Rucker and Leonnig provide a forensic account of the most devastating year in a presidency like no other. Their sources were in the room as time and time again Trump put his personal gain ahead of the good of the country. These witnesses to history tell the story of him longing to deploy the military to the streets of American cities to crush the protest movement in the wake of the killing of George Floyd, all to bolster his image of strength ahead of the election. These sources saw firsthand his refusal to take the threat of the coronavirus seriously even to the point of allowing himself and those around him to be infected. This is a story of a nation sabotaged economically, medically, and politically by its own leader, culminating with a groundbreaking, minute-by-minute account of exactly what went on in the Capitol building on January 6, as Trump s supporters so easily breached the most sacred halls of American democracy, and how the president reacted. With unparalleled access, Rucker and Leonnig explain and expose exactly who enabled and who foiled Trump as he sought desperately to cling to power. A classic and heart-racing work of investigative reporting, this book is destined to be read and studied by citizens and historians alike for decades to come.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=hVo5EAAAQBAJ&dq=Fix-It&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Contatti: A First Course in Italian","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=oDCtlwEACAAJ&dq=Contatti:+A+First+Course+in+Italian&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Death in Venice and Other Stories","description":"The celebrated author, Gustave Aschenbach, burdened by his successes, comes to Venice for a holiday and encounters a vision of eros -- a vision for which he pays with his life.

They convinced themselves that they could take on and defeat a superpower in the making  the Soviet Union. Foolishly, they thought in a swift campaign they could smash the Red Army and force Stalin to sue for peace, despite dire warnings that Stalin was amassing a reserve army of more than 1 million men on the Volga. The end result would be such carnage that it would tear the German forces apart. In his major reassessment of the war on the Eastern Front, Anthony Tucker-Jones casts new light on the brutal fighting, including such astounding German defeats as at Stalingrad, Kursk, Minsk and, finally, Berlin. He controversially contends that from the very start intelligence officers on both sides failed to influence their leadership resulting in untold slaughter. He also reveals the shocking blunders by Hitler, Stalin and even Churchill that led to the appalling, needless destruction of Hitler s armed forces as early as the winter of 194142. Step by step, Tucker-Jones describes how the German war machine fought to its very last against a relentless enemy, fully aware that defeat was inevitable.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Dj8ADgAAQBAJ&dq=Barbarossa+to+Berlin+Volume+Two:+The+Defeat+of+Germany:+19+November+1942+to+15+May+1945+(Chronology+of+the+Campaigns+on+the+Eastern+Front+1941-45)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Within/Without","description":"From true weird fiction visionary Jeff Noon comes the fourth book in this Philip K.

What this book does is to present a penetrating investigation of the problem, draw thoughtful conclusions and suggest coping strategies. Collection Management This excellent book should attract a wide audience including professional librarians, library school faculty and students, library administrators, and the consulting community. It is highly recommended. Information Processing & Management [Nauratil's] analysis does help us gain an understanding of the issue, just as her concluding chapter on coping, and beyond, may help us address the issue when we are confronted with it. Wilson Library Bulletin Perhaps because of the popular stereotype of librarianship as a low-pressure, nonstressful profession, librarians have been largely overlooked in current research on occupational burnout. Yet, like other human service personnel who are in continual contact with the public, more and more librarians are experiencing burnout and consequent alienation in the workplace. This study is the first to provide a comprehensive analysis of the problem as it exists among today's librarians. Nauratil begins with an examination of the burnout phenomenon and the factors that contribute to stress and alienation in the human service professions. She discusses the additional pressures resulting from the dilemmas faced by libraries, including dwindling budgets, theft of library materials, understaffing, and the demand for broader or improved services. The costs associated with burnout--such as reduced productivity, rapid employee turnover, and deterioration of services--are also considered. The author asks whether alienation and burnout are the inevitable consequences of the librarian's job under contemporary conditions, and assesses the possible long-term effects of current developments both within library systems and in the communities and institutions they serve. Finally, she explores various strategies for coping with this type of occupational hazard and for strengthening the library system as a whole. This carefully researched and clearly written work will be a valuable resource for courses or research in librarianship, occupational sociology, personnel management, and related subjects.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=n8fgAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Alienated+Librarian+(New+Directions+in+Information+Management)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Chain Saw Man Cometh Sequal II","description":"In order to achieve the greatest goal in human history to touch a boob Denji will risk everything in a fight against the dangerous Bat Devil.

In The Starch Solution, bestselling diet doctor and board-certified internist John A. McDougall, MD, and his kitchen-savvy wife, Mary, turn the notion that starch is bad for you on its head. The Starch Solution is based on a simple swap: fueling your body primarily with carbohydrates rather than proteins and fats. This will help you lose weight and prevent a variety of ills. Fad diets come and go, but Dr. McDougall has been a proponent of the plant-based diet for decades, and his medical credibility is unassailable. He is one of the mainstay experts cited in the bestselling and now seminal China Study called the \\"Grand Prix of epidemiology\\" by the New York Times. But what The China Study lacks is a plan. Dr. McDougall grounds The Starch Solution in rigorous scientific fact and research, giving readers easy tools to implement these changes into their lifestyle with a 7-Day Quick Start Plan and 100 delicious recipes. This book includes testimonials from among the hundreds Dr. McDougall has received, including people who have lost more than 125 pounds in mere months as well as patients who have conquered lifethreatening illnesses such as diabetes and cardiac ailments.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7hdHZ2RbYFwC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Deep Doo-Doo and the Mysterious E-mails","description":"Instead of scooping a classmate who works on the school newspaper, Bennet and his friend Pete end up working with Elizabeth to find out who is responsible for putting a pumpkin on top of the town hall flagpole.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=z-eoAAAACAAJ&dq=Deep+Doo-Doo+and+the+Mysterious+E-mails&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Knot at the End of Your Rope","description":"Have you ever walked on a treadmill that was going too fast?

Which, ever since its first appearance, has been widely acclaimed: both in India and elsewhere in the world, as an authentic, at the once relevant account of classical Sanskrit.

Supported by several information-packaged appendices, the book also carries a brilliant resume of the Sanskrit grammatical tradition going back to the 5th century BC.

Expertly revealing the oil timeline driving the war, Juhasz charts exactly how the administration has fundamentally transformed Iraq's economy, locked in sweeping advantages to its corporate allies, and expanded its target to the whole Middle East. The results of these same corporate globalization policies dislocation, extreme poverty, and increased violence and terrorism have been demonstrated in regions from South America to Africa to the Middle East and Asia, and in the United States.

The experienced practitioners who contribute not only challenge some of the assumptions prevalent in the field, but also present some tried and tested interventions used to enable users, staff and managers to function more effectively in community settings. They consider: * how community care has developed * the fundamental concepts of community care * how management is affected by practice * how care systems are designed. Managing Mental Health in the Community should be essential reading for Mental Health Practitioners, Managers, Social Workers, Policy-Makers, Organizational Consultants and all those professionals who are committed to improving the quality of mental health services provided in the community.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=cIDiK8H8-h0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hacksilber to Coinage: New Insights into the Monetary History of the Near East and Greece (Numismatic Studies (ANSNS))","description":"The first full-length academic study to deal exclusively with female stardom in British cinema.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=5GiDDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Collections: Projects & Ideas to Display Your Treasures (Better Homes & Gardens)","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=SpHiAAAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Date on Cloud Nine","description":"Jenna McKnight dazzles with a romantic comedy featuring a woman who has been sent back from heaven to \\"do something really important\\". . . if she doesn't get distracted by the very sexy Jackson Murdoch first!

Catfish at the Pump proves abundantly that the art of story telling was practiced diligently by our plains ancestors.

By the time the war ended, Raus had established a reputation as one of the German army's foremost tacticians of armored warfare, which made him a prized capture by U.S. Army intelligence. In American captivity, Raus wrote a detailed memoir of his service in Russia. His battlefield experience and keen tactical eye makes his memoir especially valuable.The Raus memoir-now translated, compiled, and edited by prominent World War II historian Steven H. Newton-covers the Russian campaign from the first day of the war to his being relieved of his command at Hitler's order in the spring of 1945. It includes a detailed examination of Raus's 6th Panzer Division's drive to Leningrad, his experiences in the Soviet winter counteroffensive around Moscow, the unsuccessful attempt to relieve Stalingrad and the final desperate battles inside Germany at the end of the war.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=clbIswEACAAJ&dq=Panzer+Operations:+The+Eastern+Front+Memoir+of+General+Raus,+1941-1945&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Treatise of Lorenzo Valla on the Donation of Constantine: Text and Translation into English (RSART: Renaissance Society of America Reprint Text Series)","description":"The established reference work Guide to Reprints has been radically reworked for this edition.

The best gay novel written by anyone of our generation' Harpers 'A life changing read for me. Describes a New York that has completely disappeared and for which I longed - stuck in closed-on-Sunday's London' Rupert Everett Young, divinely beautiful and tired of living a lie, Anthony Malone trades life as a seemingly straight, small town lawyer for the disco-lit decadence of New York's gay scene. An unbridled world of dance parties, saunas, deserted parks and orgies - at its centre Malone befriends the flamboyant queen, Sutherland, who takes this new arrival under his preened wing. But for Malone, the endless city nights and Fire Island days, are close to burning out. It is love that Malone is longing for, and soon he will have to set himself free. First published in 1978, Dancer from the Dance is widely considered the greatest, most exciting novel of the post-Stonewall generation.

Without thinking about it very deeply, almost everyone would agree that such activities are fun, relaxing, and entertaining. However, play has many purposes that run much deeper than simple entertainment. For children, play has various functions such as competition, following rules, accepting defeat, choosing leaders, exercising leadership, practicing adult roles, and taking risks in order to reap rewards. For adults, many games and sports serve as harmless releases of feelings of aggression, competition, and intergroup hostility. The Encyclopedia of Play in Today's Society explores the concept of play in history and modern society in the United States and internationally. Its scope encompasses leisure and recreational activities of children and adults throughout the ages, from dice games in the Roman Empire to video games today. With more than 450 entries, these two volumes do not include coverage of professional sports and sport teams but, instead, cover the hundreds of games played not to earn a living but as informal activity. All aspects of play from learning to competition, mastery of nature, socialization, and cooperation are included. Simply enough, this Encyclopedia explores play played for the fun of it! Key Features Available in both print and electronic formats Provides access to the fascinating literature that has explored questions of psychology, learning theory, game theory, and history in depth Considers the affects of play on child and adult development, particularly on health, creativity, and imagination Contains entries that describe both adult and childhood play and games in dozens of cultures around the world and throughout history Explores the sophisticated analyses of social thinkers such as Huizinga, Vygotsky, and Sutton-Smith, as well as the wide variety of games, toys, sports, and entertainments found around the world Presents cultures as diverse as the ancient Middle East, modern Russia, and China and in nations as far flung as India, Argentina, and France Key Themes Adult Games Board and Card Games Children's Games History of Play Outdoor Games and Amateur Sports Play and Education Play Around the World Psychology of Play Sociology of Play Toys and Business Video and Online Games For a subject we mostly consider light-hearted, play as a research topic has generated an extensive and sophisticated literature, exploring a range of penetrating questions. This two-volume set serves as a general, nontechnical resource for academics, researchers, and students alike.

Do you think they look unattainable, like something that can only be bought in a store and never replicated at home? In truth, it's as easy as can be with a rotisserie oven. A small rotisserie oven that fits right on your kitchen counter will effortlessly transform a humble chicken (and so much more) into a gloriously crispy, moist, and delicious family dinner in about an hour (while you are busy doing other things, or maybe even finding time to relax). The rotisserie is one of the most recent additions to the kitchen-appliance repertoire. What you may not realize is that it's also one of the most versatile and user-friendly. It can cook everything from meat and poultry to vegetable side dishes and desserts; it works without heating up he rest of the kitchen like an over; it's compact enough to occupy only a small amount of valuable counter space; plus, it's easy to clean! In The Ultimate Rotisserie Cookbook, Diane Phillips creatively takes the rotisserie oven well beyond chicken to every kind of food and every course of the meal. Go on, give it a whirl with recipes such as Calypso Jerk Chicken Kabobs, Roasted Garlic Prime Rib Roast, Plum Crazy Pork Chops, or Roasted Salmon with Mustard Chive Butter. Since the rotisserie bastes food in its own juices and allows excess fat to drain away, everything cooks up lighter and healthier than the same food that is cooked in the traditional oven or stovetop manner. For easy, no-fuss hors d'oeuvres or side dishes, try Blue Bayou Stuffed Mushrooms, Sugar Cane Shrimp, No-Fry Pommes Frites, or Pesto-Grilled Eggplant. With an extensive chapter of marinades, sauces, and rubs to spice things up or cool them down (how about Southwestern Fiesta Rib Sauce or Cucumber Mint Salsa?) and one on desserts to sweeten the deal (ever thought of making Rotisserie Caramel Apples or Fire-Roasted Pineapple with Macadamia Caramel Sauce?), your possibilities are limitless. The Ultimate Rotisserie Cookbook is, simply, the be-all and end-all book for the rotisserie oven, with 300 recipes for every possible way you could think of to use this amazing machine.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=9vNiDAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"An experience of love: Understanding natural family planning","description":"If you've tried Natural Family Planning and have discovered that your life is now awful - or if you feel judged or judgey, or if you trust NFP but your doctor doesn't, or if you're just trying to figure out how the heck to have a sex life that is holy but still human - you'll find comfort, encouragement, honesty, wit, and, most important, practical advice in The Sinner's Guide to NFP.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0wytngEACAAJ&dq=An+experience+of+love:+Understanding+natural+family+planning&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Men Who Wear the Star : The Story of the Texas Rangers (Modern Library Ser.)

A vner Friedman Robert Gulliver v PREFACE There are a large number of problems where qualitative features of a partial differential equation in an appropriate regime are determined by the behavior of an associated ordinary differential equation. The example which gives the area its name is the limit of quantum mechanical Hamil tonians (Schrodinger operators) as Planck's constant h goes to zero, which is determined by the corresponding classical mechanical system. A sec ond example is linear wave equations with highly oscillatory initial data. The solutions are described by geometric optics whose centerpiece are rays which are solutions of ordinary differential equations analogous to the clas sical mechanics equations in the example above. Much recent work has concerned with understanding terms beyond the leading term determined by the quasi classical limit. Two examples of this involve Weyl asymptotics and the large-Z limit of atomic Hamiltonians, both areas of current research.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=JH_kBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Merriam-Webster New Book of Word Histories","description":"\\"A gold mine of word histories for reference or browsing.

In 2003, a twenty-four-year-old woman from Baghdad began blogging about life in the city under the pseudonym Riverbend. Her passion, honesty, and wry idiomatic English made her work a vital contribution to our understanding of post-war Iraq and won her a large following. Baghdad Burning is a quotidian chronicle of Riverbend s life with her family between April 2003 and September of 2004. She describes rolling blackouts, intermittent water access, daily explosions, gas shortages and travel restrictions. She also expresses a strong stance against the interim government, the Bush administration, and Islamic fundamentalists like Al Sadr and his followers. Her book  offers quick takes on events as they occur, from a perspective too often overlooked, ignored or suppressed  (Publishers Weekly).  Riverbend is bright and opinionated, true, but like all voices of dissent worth remembering, she provides an urgent reminder that, whichever governments we struggle under, we are all the same.

In this up-to-date, thorough, and accessible analysis of the right to copyright, Darren Hudson Hick works to reconcile the growing practice of artistic appropriation with innovative views of artists  rights, both legal and moral. Engaging with long-standing debates about the nature of originality, authorship, and artists  rights, Hick examines the philosophical challenges presented by the role of intellectual property in the artworld and vice versa. Using real-life examples of artists who have incorporated copyrighted works into their art, he explores issues of artistic creation and the nature of infringement as they are informed by analytical aesthetics and legal and critical theory. Ultimately, Artistic License provides a critical and systematic analysis of the key philosophical issues that underlie copyright policy, rethinking the relationship between artist, artwork, and the law.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-FxvDgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Civil War Books: A Priced Checklist.","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6Ob-wAEACAAJ&dq=Civil+War+Books:+A+Priced+Checklist.&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ultimate X-Men: Ultimate Collection, Vol. 1","description":"Humanity now faces mutants, a mysterious sub-species that is gifted with strange and frightening powers.

Heavily influenced by the work of David Ricardo, and also taking ideas from Adam Smith and Thomas Malthus, Mill systematically demonstrated how important economic concepts could be applied to real-world situations. In his emphasis on realism, Mill thus took economics out of the realm of the abstract and placed it squarely within the context of society. For instance, he made a convincing case that wages, rent, and profit are not necessarily the expression of immutable laws that are independent of society. Rather, they are in actuality the results of social institutions and as such can be changed if the members of a society move to break traditional institutional habits. Reflecting his utilitarian social philosophy, Mill suggested that social improvements are always possible. He thus proposed modifying a purely laissez faire system, advocating trade protectionism and regulation of employees  work hours for the benefit of domestic industries and workers  well-being. In such features he displayed a leaning toward socialism. In summing up his objective for this massive work, Mill said later in his Autobiography (1873) that he wished \\"to unite the greatest individual liberty of action, with a common ownership in the raw material of the globe, and an equal participation of all in the benefits of combined labour.\\" For anyone with an interest in the history of economics or the history of ideas, this landmark work of classical economics makes for stimulating and in many respects still very relevant reading.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=NfnkAAAAMAAJ&dq=Economics,+principles+of+political+economy&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Uptown and Down","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=aGEPuAEACAAJ&dq=Uptown+and+Down&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Just Kate","description":"Devastated by a betrayal, Kate sets out to rebuild her life, only to be reunited with Sean Harris, the man who had married her sister, as she searches for answers to her family's secrets and for the love that has eluded her.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=OhCxNQz95dkC&dq=Just+Kate&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"MCSE Supporting and Maintaining NT Server 4 Exam Cram (Exam: 70-244)","description":"MCSE Supporting and Maintaining NT Server 4 Exam Cram is the perfect study guide for what is destined to become one of the most popular elective exams within the MCSE Windows 2000 program (exam 70-244).

Emphasizing in particular the impact of Darwin's work, he shows how Darwin's contemporaries were unable to appreciate precisely those aspects of his thinking that are considered scientifically important today.

C. Greene re-creates one of America's most bizarre holdups -- one that began as a lark. On Christmas Eve 1927, four men set off to rob the First National Bank of Cisco, Texas. Soon the lark turned into a tragedy -- and at times a comedy -- of errors. The robbers did not realize the car they had stolen for their get-away was running on empty. The leader did not anticipate the attention his disguise would draw, even though it was a bright red Santa Claus suit. And they could not have known that all of Cisco would have guns at hand because the Bankers Association had offered a reward of $5000 for any dead bank robber, no questions asked. The Santa Claus bank robbery set off a chain of events that would lead to violence and the death of six men and launch the largest manhunt Texas had ever seen. A. C. Greene's factual account of the unusual crime reads like a novel -- fast paced, full of unexpected turns, and rich with the flavor of life in Texas at the beginning of the end of the Old West. This new edition contains an Afterword with photographs, some of them never before published, and follow-up information on the lives of the participants, including the surviving robber, witnesses and kidnap victims.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=fLGYN6qotqUC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"EXTRAORDINARY TENNIS FOR THE ORDINARY PLAYER","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=FZzquSGlws8C&dq=EXTRAORDINARY+TENNIS+FOR+THE+ORDINARY+PLAYER&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Earth, Sun, Moon","description":"Every organism on Earth responds to four major cycles: the solar and lunar day, the synodic month and the year.

Working from the belief that understanding the past will help build a more peaceful and democratic future, South Africa has made a concerted, institutionalized effort to come to grips with its history of apartheid through its Truth and Reconciliation Commission. In Overcoming Apartheid, James L. Gibson provides the first systematic assessment of whether South Africa's truth and reconciliation process has been successful. Has the process allowed South Africa to let go of its painful past and move on? Or has it exacerbated racial tensions by revisiting painful human rights violations and granting amnesty to their perpetrators? Overcoming Apartheid reports on the largest and most comprehensive study of post-apartheid attitudes in South Africa to date, involving a representative sample of all major racial, ethnic, and linguistic groups. Grounding his analysis of truth in theories of collective memory, Gibson discovers that the process has been most successful in creating a common understanding of the nature of apartheid. His analysis then demonstrates how this common understanding is helping to foster reconciliation, as defined by the acceptance of basic principles of human rights and political tolerance, rejection of racial prejudice, and acceptance of the institutions of a new political order. Gibson identifies key elements in the process such as acknowledging shared responsibility for atrocities of the past that are essential if reconciliation is to move forward. He concludes that without the truth and reconciliation process, the prospects for a reconciled, democratic South Africa would diminish considerably. Gibson also speculates about whether the South African experience provides any lessons for other countries around the globe trying to overcome their repressive pasts. A groundbreaking work of social science research, Overcoming Apartheid is also a primer for utilizing innovative conceptual and methodological tools in analyzing truth processes throughout the world. It is sure to be a valuable resource for political scientists, social scientists, group relations theorists, and students of transitional justice and human rights.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=r_UWAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"I Wished for a Unicorn","description":"With the help of a barking \\"unicorn,\\" a spirited child storms a castle, defeats a dragon, digs for buried treasure, and shares other exciting adventures in the backyard.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WmnvYE1X_JYC&dq=I+Wished+for+a+Unicorn&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Desire Never Dies (Lady Spies)","description":"Lady Anastasia Whittig is a true lady in every sense and an absolute master at code-breaking.

If you've damaged a person's reputation unfairly, can the damage be undone? Is a person who sells weapons responsible for how those weapons are used? if the fetus is not a life, what is it? How, as an adult, can one carry out the command to honor one's parents when they make unreasonable demands? What are the nine biblical challenges a good person must meet? What do the great Jewish writings of the last 3,500 years tell us about these and all other vital questions about our lives? Rabbi Joseph Telushkin has devoted his life to the search for answers within the teachings of Judaism. In Jewish Wisdom, Rabbi Telushkin, the author of the highly acclaimed Jewish Literacy, weaves together a tapestry of stories from the Bible and Talmud, and the insights of Jewish commentators and writers from Maimonides, Rashi, and Hillel to Einstein, Isaac Bashevis Singer, and Elie Wiesel. A richer source of crucial life lessons would be hard to imagine. Accompanying this extraordinary compilation is Teluslikins compelling commentary, which reveals how these texts continue to instruct and challenge Jewsand all people concerned with leading ethical livestoday As he discusses these texts, Rabbi Telushkin addresses issues of fundamental interest to modern readers: how to live with honesty and integrity in an often dishonest world; how to care for the sick and dying; how to teach children to respect both themselves and others, how to understand and confront such great tragedies as antisemitism. and the Holocaust; what God wants from humankind. Within Jewish Wisdom's ninety chapters the reader will find extended sections illuminating Jewish perspectives on sex, romance, and marriage, what kind of belief in God a Jew can have after the Holocaust, how to use language ethically, the conflicting views of the Bible and Talmud on the death penalty, and much, much more. Jewish Wisdom adds a new dimension to the many widely read contemporary books that retell the stones and reveal the essence of classic religious and secular literature. Possibly the most far-ranging volume of stories and quotations from Jewish texts, Jewish Wisdom will itself become a classic, a book that not only has the capacity to transform how you view the world, but one that well might change how you choose to live your life.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=GoL1lwEACAAJ&dq=Jewish+Wisdom:+Ethical,+Spiritual,+and+Historical+Lessons+from+the+Great+Works+and+Thinkers&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Someplace Like This","description":"Exposes the deepening crisis of poverty and homelessness in America through stories, photographs, and analysis.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=l6kwDwAAQBAJ&dq=Someplace+Like+This&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Intrusion Detection with Snort","description":"The incredible low maintenance costs of Snort combined with its powerful security features make it one of the fastest growing IDSs within corporate IT departments.

Media coverage following the alleged gassing of sheep at Dugway Proving Ground in 1968 has led most people to believe that CB warfare is an unstoppable doomsday weapon of mass destruction. Yet, in 1972, General Creighton Abrams, the Army Chief of Staff, attempted to disestablish the Chemical Corps because he saw no need for it. Had that decision not been reversed in 1976, there would not have been any chemical defense specialists or equipment available for Operation Desert Storm in 1990. This study tracks events relating to the Department of Defense's CB warfare program between 1968 and 1990, as it evolved up to the Gulf War. It also details how the military develops and procures CB defense equipment to protect today's soldiers. Mauroni draws parallels between the development of binary chemical weapons, the chemical demilitarization program, and the DoD CB terrorism response efforts, as each has very similar issues and solutions. He seeks to educate leading officials and the general public about the facts behind CB warfare and the options for coping with it in the future. With proper training and equipment, the challenge of CB warfare can be met and dealt with on the modern battlefield.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Qed3Da45EmcC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Life; Through a Child's Eyes","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Eucharist: Theology and Spirituality of the Eucharistic Prayer","description":"Eucharist is a detailed history of the Christian Eucharistic formularies.

Climate change is the greatest challenge that the world has ever faced. In this groundbreaking book, Alastair McIntosh summarizes the science of what is happening to the planet using his home country of Scotland as a case study. He then argues that the root of our climate crisis is not in our politics but in our consumerism an addictive mentality where wants have replaced needs and consumption drives our very identity. In a fascinating journey through literature that speaks to climate change including the ancient Sumerian Epic of Gilgamesh, Plato's myth of Atlantis, and Shakespeare's Macbeth McIntosh reveals the psychohistory of modern consumerism. He shows how we have fallen prey to a numbing culture of violence and the manipulation of marketing. Only when we resist these vices and face reality will we discover the spiritual meaning of our troubled times. Only then can magic, new meaning, and all that gives life, start to mend a broken world.  What [McIntosh] does brilliantly here is offer an alternative, deeply humanist version of green politics.

They offer a powerful way to represent rotations and compared to rotation matrices they use less memory, compose faster, and are naturally suited for efficient interpolation of rotations. Despite this, many practitioners have avoided quaternions because of the mathematics used to understand them, hoping that some day a more intuitive description will be available. The wait is over. Andrew Hanson's new book is a fresh perspective on quaternions. The first part of the book focuses on visualizing quaternions to provide the intuition necessary to use them, and includes many illustrative examples to motivate why they are important a beautiful introduction to those wanting to explore quaternions unencumbered by their mathematical aspects. The second part covers the all-important advanced applications, including quaternion curves, surfaces, and volumes. Finally, for those wanting the full story of the mathematics behind quaternions, there is a gentle introduction to their four-dimensional nature and to Clifford Algebras, the all-encompassing framework for vectors and quaternions. Richly illustrated introduction for the developer, scientist, engineer, or student in computer graphics, visualization, or entertainment computing.

As a politician, John Fitzgerald Kennedy crafted a persona that fascinated and inspired millions and left an outsize legacy in the wake of his murder on November 22, 1963. But only a select few were privy to the complicated man behind the Camelot image. Two such confidants were Kenneth P. O Donnell, Kennedy s top political aide, and David F. Powers, a special assistant in the White House. They were among the president s closest friends, part of an exclusive inner circle that came to be known as the  Irish Mafia.  In Johnny, We Hardly Knew Ye, O Donnell and Powers share memories of Kennedy, his extraordinary political career, and his iconic family memories that could come only from intimate access to the man himself. As they recount the full scope of Kennedy s journey from his charismatic first campaign for Congress to his rapid rise to national standing, culminating on that haunting day in Dallas O Donnell and Powers lay bare the inner workings of a leader who is cherished and mourned to this day, in a memoir that spent over five months on the New York Times bestseller list.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=LVy9AAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Christ in all the Scriptures","description":"The Gospels tell us about Jesus' life on earth, but we are missing out on the big picture if we only look for Him there.

ABOUT THE PHOTO Passive RFID systems, consisting of readers and tags, are expected to replace bar codes as the primary means of identification, inventory and billing of everyday items. The tags typically consist of an RFID chip placed on a flexible film containing a planar antenna. The antenna captures radiation from the reader's signal to power the tag electronics, which then responds to the reader's query. The PENI Tag (Product Emitting Numbering Identification Tag) shown, developed by the University of Pittsburgh in a team led by Professor Marlin H.

A Theology of Work: Work and the New Creation makes work itself the subject of theological enquiry. From within Christian doctrine it asks the pressing questions 'what is work and work's place in God's economy and thus, how should we be carrying out our work?' Through dialogue with J?rgen Moltmann, Pope John Paul II and others, this book develops a genitive 'theology of work'. It offers a normative theological definition of work and a model for a theological ethics of work that shows work's nature, value and meaning now, and, quite uniquely, eschatologically related to the new creation. Throughout the book it is argued that work in its essence is about transformation and, as such, it is an activity consisting of three dynamically interrelated dimensions: the instrumental, relational, and ontological.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=V6VLAwAAQBAJ&dq=A+Theology+of+Work:+Work+and+the+New+Creation+(Paternoster+Theological+Monographs)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Best Places Phoenix","description":"Phoenix is hot, hot, hot and Hemming provides cooling relief with this guide to the best in golf, day trips, restaurants and more.

Focusing on both the triumphs and controversies of O'Connell's career, James M. O'Toole chronicles the history of the Catholic Church in Boston in the first half of the twentieth century. The biography begins with a lively discussion of O'Connell's Irish immigrant youth and education and his early positions as rector of the American College in Rome and bishop of Portland, Maine. O'Toole convincingly demonstrates that as bishop, O'Connell actively built his own public image while ambitiously campaigning for the position of archbishop of Boston. The most enduring success, O'Toole argues, of O'Connell's 37-year tenure as archbishop of Boston--despite a sexual and financial scandal surrounding his nephew, the archdiocesan chancellor--was his elaboration of \\"a personal style of leadership that was different from that of earlier bishops, changing the expectations for Catholic bishops in America by thrusting on them the role of public figures they have generally south to play since.\\" Throughout, the book examines O'Connell's cultural and symbolic leadership of New England's Catholic population, and describes O'Connell's role in defining American Catholicism as both \\"militant and triumphant\\" asserting its cultural vision beyond narrow denominational boundaries into broad areas of public morality, and confident of its eventual triumph over secular standards.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8XPZAAAAMAAJ&dq=Militant+And+Triumphant:+William+Henry+O%27Connell+and+the+Catholic+Church+in+Boston,+1859-1944&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"CliffsQuickReview Sociology","description":"CliffsQuickReview course guides cover the essentials of your toughest classes.

In his twenty-year career, Bonds has amassed an unprecedented 7 Most Valuable Player awards, 8 Gold Gloves, and more than 700 home runs (and counting), an impressive assortment of feats that has earned him the consideration as one of the greatest players the game has ever seen. Equally deserved, however, is his reputation as an insufferable braggart, whose mythical home runs are rivaled only by his legendary ego. From his staggering ability and fabled pedigree (father Bobby played outfield for the Giants; cousin Reggie and godfather Willie are both Hall of Famers), to his well-documented run-ins with teammates and his alleged steroid abuse, Bonds inspires a like amount of passion from both sides of the fence. For many, Bonds belongs beside Babe Ruth and Hank Aaron in baseball s holy trinity; for others, he embodies all that is wrong with the modern athlete: aloof; arrogant; alienated. Drawing on extensive interviews with Bonds himself, members of his family, former and current managers, teammates, opponents, trainers, outspoken critics, and unapologetic supporters alike, Pearlman reveals, for the first time, a wonderfully nuanced portrait of a prodigiously talented and immensely flawed American icon, whose controversial run at baseball immortality forever changed the way we look at our sports heroes.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=9YvTs_Q7JMUC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"CliffsTestPrep GMAT AT (Computer-Adaptive Graduate Management Admission Test) (Cliffs Test Prep GMAT CAT)","description":"The CliffsTestPrep series offers fulllength practice exams that simulate the real tests; proven testtaking strategies to increase your chances at doing well; and thorough review exercises to help fill in any knowledge gaps.

I love you. You love me. You love Otto. I love Otto. Otto loves you. Otto loves me. There now! Start to unravel from there.' Design for Living is a wickedly witty dark romantic comedy by Noel Coward. Initially banned in the UK, this provocative play portrays three amoral, glib and stylish characters and their hopelessly inescapable, if also unconventional, emotional entanglement. From 1930s bohemian Paris to the dizzying heights of Manhattan society, a tempestuous love triangle unravels between a vivacious interior designer, Gilda, playwright Leo and artist Otto - three people unashamedly and passionately in love with each other. They are trapped in what Coward called 'a three-sided erotic hodge podge.' With Coward's trademark piquant style, this lively, funny but also atypical play looks at dazzling, egotistical creatures and their self-destructive dependence on each other. Exploring themes of bisexuality, celebrity, success and self-obsession, Design for Living is a stylish and scandalous comedy.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=4zFjAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The sands of Mars","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=aQCfPwAACAAJ&dq=The+sands+of+Mars&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Watchers at the Pond (Time reading program special edition)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=KfdPAAAAYAAJ&dq=Watchers+at+the+Pond+(Time+reading+program+special+edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Civil Engineering Problem Solving Flowcharts, 2nd Edition","description":"A review specifically for the latest version of the Civil Engineering/Professional Engineer Exam.

What is meant by innocence, passion, love and arousal, desire, perversion and shame? These are just a few of the questions Roger Scruton addresses in this thought-provoking intellectual adventure. Beginning from purely philosophical premises, and ranging over human life, art and institutions, he surveys the entire field of sexuality; equally dissatisfied with puritanism and permissiveness, he argues for a radical break with recent theories. Upholding traditional morality -- though in terms that may shock many of its practitioners -- his argument gravitates to that which is candid, serene and consoling in the experience of sexual love.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=dM-oAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Existence and Attributes of God","description":"The Existence and Attributes of God comprises the first two volumes of the works of Stephen Charnock (1628-1680), an English puritan divine who was highly skilled in philosophy, patristics, Reformed theology, and Biblical languages. These volumes are his abiding monument. They are worthy of being compared with the finest in theology. \\"When the existence and attributes of God are called into question, to whom else can we better go than to Stephen Charnock'' . . . ''those [things revealed belong to us and to our children forever]. The material that Charnock discusses is firmly founded in the Word of God'' . . . ''Both the Old Testament and the New emphasize these two things: First, we should study the whole revelation, not just some easy or favorite parts of it; secondly, the study of God's attributes is not dry as dust theology, but is practical; that is, it leads to righteousness\\" (Dr. Gordon H. Clark, from a preface to this great work in a Sovereign Grace edition, 1958). One of the greatest tragedies in these spiritually starved times is the sad fact that most Christians know so very little about their God. It is often said that this is simply because these volumes are exhaustive on the subject. Yet it is clearly filled with sublime expositions of the truth regarding God's existence and attributes. \\"Charnock displays God's attributes not as impersonal abstractions for the mind to juggle with, but as qualities observable in the concrete actions of the living God of which the Bible speaks. The technical terms and sometimes, arguments of scholastic theology are employed, but always with a Biblical orientation. Charnock has no desire to speculate, but only to declare the works and ways, the nature and character, of the God of the Bible. The substance of his doctrine is characteristically Puritan and representatively Reformed.\\" (Dr. James I. Packer, in The Encyclopedia of Christianity, Volume II, p. 410) The possessor of these rare volumes will be blessed by getting acquainted with the incomparable God, and thereby will reach a higher plane of spiritual enjoyment never attained before. To know Him better is to love Him more.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=1HSYbKrVR8AC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Gestures: A Novel","description":"Gestures is a novel, written as the autobiography of one Jeremy Burnham, career diplomat and gentleman, who in his 83rd year sets down his life story.

However, Mead and her followers have been criticized for promulgating sensationalized and inaccurate images of Melanesian societies, including savagery, cannibalism, and wanton sexuality. This book deals with the consequences of such Western condescension. Destined to be highly controversial, this book for the first time brings a multicultural outlook to bear on Margaret Mead, scrutinizing her role and impact on Western anthropology, colonialism, and strategic and business interests in the South Pacific. The contributors, most of them avowedly activist supporters of the concept of a nuclear-free and independent Pacific, include Warilea Iamo, Papua New Guinea's first anthropologist; John D. Waiko, Director of the New Guinea Institute of Applied Social and Economic Research; Nahau Rooney, the daughter of one of Mead's informants, and; Susanna Ounei, a leader of a New Caledonian independence front. Author note: Lenora Foerstel is an instructor in Ethnohistory at the Maryland College of Art. She was a member of the 1953 American Museum of Natural History Expedition to Manus Island, led by Dr. Margaret Mead. Angela Gilliam teaches at Evergreen State College in Olympia, Washington.

By the year 2000, that number is expected to exceed 2 million. In response to this crisis, throughout the nation, programs built largely on the work of volunteers have risen to challenge traditional concepts about the prison system and rehabilitation, and to engender a new awareness of possibilities. Cell Count, an eloquent and sensitive collection of poems, is the product of one such program. Cell Count s teacher-persona struggles to come to terms with his inmate-students who are tragically much more than the sum of their crimes.  Cell Count is not a book for Sunday afternoon reading. Innocently, I stepped across the line into Christopher Bursk s world. An iron gate clanged shut, and I was alone, a red beam. . .aimed straight into my eyes,  digging a tunnel into my brain./I had to stare into the center of that burning/till it was all I could see.

When the guard-tower floodlights snap on, trapped in its crossbeams is the book s persona a college instructor engaged in directing a poetry workshop in a reconverted storage closet in jail or counseling individual inmates in an interview room more cramped than a cell. He is teacher, poet, political activist, a man committed to making a difference in the lives of his students, yet he doesn t seem certain why he feels compelled to do so; he is not entirely sure he wants to try this hard. Cell Count details the life-quest of this activist who, despite his fears, his hatred of evil, his repugnance for violence, his despair at what may be a hopeless endeavor, still acts, still takes a stand.

However, each book also stands alone as an individual purchase. Lorraine Warren, International Journal of Entrepreneurial Behaviour and Research The book delivers what it promises: a map of the uses of narrative methods in entrepreneurship studies. It is both an interesting contribution to the field and an important methodological handbook for all entrepreneurship researchers who are thinking of adopting qualitative methods in their inquiries. However, it may also be read with advantage by other researchers using ethnography as their main methodological approach to social studies. . . The aim of the book is to show how narratives can enrich entrepreneurship studies, a goal that in my opinion is aptly fulfilled. Monika Kostera, Scandinavian Journal of Management . . . the contributors in this text breathe fresh and imaginative linguistic resources and narrative/discursive frames of reference into the inquiry of entrepreneurial activities. The anecdote, the narrative, the metaphorical, the discursive and the dramaturgical are significant therefore, not only because they bring to the surface voices, emotions, processes and the relationality of (everyday) entrepreneurial activity that have possibly been previously silenced. But also, to paraphrase Steyaert, these approaches highlight the controversial and interactive aspects of the research process. . . The text is welcome because it treats narrative in a serious and scholarly way. Denise Fletcher, International Small Business Journal In their edited book Narrative and Discursive Approaches in Entrepreneurship, Daniel Hjorth and Chris Steyaert provide a fascinating glimpse into a perspective on entrepreneurship that will be enlightening for many readers. Entrepreneurship authors typically talk about theory, methods, and data as if a straight-forward linear process united them all, and making sense of entrepreneurship was simply a matter of knowing how to interpret one s findings . By contrast, the authors in this volume propose narrative and discursive approaches in which the contributing authors emphasize rich description, reflexive conceptualization, and interpretations offered as part of the story itself. They draw upon an international set of cases, including Russia, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Venezuela, and North America. The cases themselves make for fascinating reading, quite apart from what we learn about the difficulties of imposing a particular interpretation on a given story. For example, taxi drivers in Caracas, management consultants in Denmark, and women entrepreneurs in northern Norway all make for fascinating narratives from which to understand the entrepreneurial process. Unlike many edited books which have no plot , the editors have included opening and closing sections that link the chapters, offer alternative readings of them, and propose new and expansive ways of thinking about entrepreneurship. Howard Aldrich, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, US Daniel Hjorth and Chris Steyaert set out to advance the study of entrepreneurship by refocusing the lens of discovery from economics, management and marketing to other paradigmatic stances in social sciences and humanities like anthropology and literary studies. The result is a provocative collection of chapters that inspire the reader to consider and explore new ideas and research practice that incorporate both the context and place of entrepreneurship. From the perceptive insights of the editors to the rigorous and provocative discourse of the chapters and thoughtful responses in the conclusion emerges a story, in the best of storytelling tradition, about how a linguistic turn can rouse new insights. The editors ask, how do these texts move you? they entice, provoke, challenge, stimulate and guide.

The author presents a unique perspective shaped by the wisdom of a traditional calendar-keeper he met in Mexico in 1973. The book's message is that the calendar is not simply an ancient and forgotten curiosity - it is as relevant today as in ancient times. The majority of the book projects the timeless Mesoamerican philosophy into contemporary Western society encouraging introspection and self-awareness.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=cRuupQa8J-AC&dq=The+Aztec+Book+of+Destiny&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Evidence Before International Tribunals","description":"(3) The ISS Case.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=alxWnnkb5b8C&dq=Evidence+Before+International+Tribunals&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Physical Chemistry Of Metals","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=yaLPAAAAMAAJ&dq=Physical+Chemistry+Of+Metals&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cool Repentance","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=mVmCUWUKUDAC&dq=Cool+Repentance&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sacajawea (Lewis & Clark Expedition)","description":"As a young girl, Sacajawea was separated from her family when she was captured by a band of Minnetaree warriors and taken to be their slave.

Parents want their children to enjoy bright economic futures. But how do we equip the next generation with lifelong financial skills? In this updated edition of Raising Financially Fit Kids, Joline Godfrey shares knowledge gleaned from two decades of preparing children and families for financial independence and stewardship, philanthropic effectiveness, and meaningful economic lives. At the heart of the book are three big ideas: ? Financial education is not just about the money; it's about building great families and raising self-confident kids who have the tools to realize their dreams. ? Financial sustainability means living within one's means and acquiring skills to create and manage human and financial capital. ? Giving wisely is a global citizen's responsibility. Designed for parents, grandparents, mentors, advisors, and educators, Raising Financially Fit Kids uses ten core money skills applied across five developmental life stages: children, tweens, middle schoolers, high schoolers, and twenty-somethings. Each stage includes age-appropriate activities that make financial fitness fun, from mall scavenger hunts to financial film festivals. In this global economic landscape, we all need financial fluency. Whether your child is five, fifteen, or twenty-five years old, it's never too late to teach financial literacy. Raising Financially Fit Kids prepares your children for the complexities of living in a global economy and helps your family up your game from good to great.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=DFzDwSIgYXkC&dq=Fit+Kids&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tell me, papa;: A family book for childrens' questions about death and funerals","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WpuSAQAACAAJ&dq=Tell+me,+papa%3B:+A+family+book+for+childrens%27+questions+about+death+and+funerals&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Great Reversal: Ethics and the New Testament","description":"Christians today are called to discern the shape and style of a life \\"worthy of the gospel of Christ\\". Even in the face of changing situations and new moral problems to address, the contemporary church stands self-consciously in a tradition of which the New Testament is a normative part.In this major study of New Testament ethics, Verhey examines the ethic of Jesus, for it is there that the New Testament tradition begins. He then analyzes the different forms in which the early church handed down the memory of Jesus's words and deeds in the development of a moral tradition. Next, he deals with that tradition as it came to canonical expression in the New Testament writings.In the last part of the book, Verhey focuses on the use of the New Testament in the continuing moral tradition of the church, surveying proposals for the use of Scripture, identifying the critical methodological questions, and defending a \\"modest proposal\\" for the use of Scripture.

Alexander the Great stands alone as a leader and strategist, and Fire from Heaven is Mary Renault s unsurpassed dramatization of the formative years of his life. His parents fight for their precocious son s love: On one side, his volatile father, Philip, and on the other, his overbearing mother, Olympias. The story tells of the conqueror s two great bonds to his horse, Oxhead, and to his dearest friend and eventual lover, Hephaistion and of the army he commands when he is barely an adult. Coming of age during the battles for southern Greece, Alexander the Great appears in all of his colors as the man who first takes someone s life at age twelve and who swiftly eliminates his rivals as soon as he comes to power and emerges as a captivating, complex, larger-than-life figure. Fire from Heaven is the first volume of the Novels of Alexander the Great trilogy, which continues with The Persian Boy and Funeral Games. This ebook features an illustrated biography of Mary Renault including rare images of the author.  Mary Renault is a shining light to both historical novelists and their readers. She does not pretend the past is like the present, or that the people of ancient Greece were just like us.

A Curious Intimacy is an innovative study into the interrelation between art and neuro-psychoanalysis which significantly narrows the divide between the humanities and the sciences. Situating our grasp of the creative mind within the historical context of theories of sublimation, Lois Oppenheim proposes a change in paradigm for the study of the creative process, questioning the idea that creativity serves, above all, the reparation of early object relationships and the resolution of conflict. The book is divided into two parts. Part One, Art and the Brain, introduces the field of neuro-psychoanalysis and examines the contribution it can make to the discussion of gender and art. Part Two, A New Direction for Interdisciplinary Psychoanalysis, draws on the verbal and visual artistry of Samuel Beckett, Paul Klee and Martha Graham to put to the test the proposed new direction for applied psychoanalysis. Lois Oppenheim concludes by addressing the future of psychoanalysis as it becomes increasingly informed by neuroscience and raising questions about what the neurobiology of emotion and feeling has to tell us about the creative experience of an individual and what might constitute a 'neuro-psychoanalytic aesthetics'. A Curious Intimacy will have great appeal for all those interested in the study of imagination and creativity. It will also be of particular interest to students across the humanities and sciences and to psychotherapists and psychoanalysts wanting to explore the contribution that neuro-psychoanalysis can make to our understanding of the creative process.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=wW1o_Lim5tsC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Gray Ghosts and Rebel Raiders","description":"The exploits of the Confederate guerrillas during the Civil War were real and damaging, but the men themselves appeared only briefly on hilltops before disappearing into the mist.

Traditionally the creators and chroniclers of opinion, men have until recently written a history that reflects only their own convictions and impressions--a history rarely punctuated by a female voice and founded on an almost universal belief in women's inferiority. Acclaimed as a pioneering study when first published in 1973, Vern Bullough's work has since established itself as a standard in historical literature on women. Updated and revised with Sarah Slavin and Brenda Shelton, The Subordinated Sex is a vast survey ranging from prehistoric to contemporary times, examining a diversity of cultures, and taking into account writings from a great variety of sources. From a consideration of Babylonian legal codes to Victorian prescriptive medical pamphlets, medieval clerical treatises to Islamic erotic poetry, Bullough and his coauthors recount not only how men have portrayed women but also how they have justified their subordination of the opposite sex. In recent years, women have successfully challenged males' self-designated role as gatekeepers of written records and have found within the past a more complete view of how women lived, what they thought, and what they achieved. By focusing, however, not on women's history but on the history of men's attitudes toward their female companions, The Subordinated Sex reveals, more than any other single work, the conditions that sparked the feminist movement and the reasons it must inspire a change in the lives of men as well as women.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=F8wUwbvO0mkC&dq=The+Subordinated+Sex:+A+History+of+Attitudes+Toward+Women&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How to know the protozoa (Pictured-Key nature series)","description":"Contains detailed information on the protozoa for students.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=po0WAQAAIAAJ&dq=How+to+know+the+protozoa+(Pictured-Key+nature+series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Snow Falcon","description":"Michael Somers, a small-town man avoided by his neighbors after he tried to destroy his family, rescues and nurses a wounded gyrfalcon, and in the process, develops a deep and healing connection with a troubled boy and his mother","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8fzLmg9dBWYC&dq=The+Snow+Falcon&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Great Ghost Stories","description":"\\"Ghosts! They come in all shape and sizes, all genders and species, and they have manifold reasons for manifesting--or, as is sometimes the case, not manifesting. For more than two centuries, ghosts have haunted the imaginations of writers around the world, who have chronicled their exploits with uncommon vividness for entities whose relative lack of material substance leads many among us to question their very existence. Great Ghost Stories pays tribute to the long literary legacy of the ghost story by gathering together in one volume 101 of the best short ghost stories of all time. Here you will find ghosts of virtually every stripe and semblance: ghosts who seek revenge against the living, ghosts who dutifully keep appointments made while their hosts were still alive, ghosts who appear to convince skeptics of their existence, and even ghosts who don't know that they're ghosts. Some of the ghosts depicted here are helpful, while others are horrifyingly malevolent. Some have disconcerting physicality--for example the phantom limb whose owner claims committed the murder he's accused of. Others are so insubstantial for instance, the lingering influence of a suicide that imbues a boarding house room that--that their power over the living seems completely out of proportion.\\"--Book jacket.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-i2nAQAACAAJ&dq=Great+Ghost+Stories&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dead Dinosaurs","description":"Dad takes Dave to the museum to look at dinosaurs.

It's a world of clickheads, sherms, bangers, ballers, and mummyheads; a world where the strongest feelings of family come from other gang members; a world where the most potent feelings of self-worth come from murder.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=hNpISlyJ7RUC&dq=Do+or+Die&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Attribute Acrobatics","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-JBSAAAACAAJ&dq=Attribute+Acrobatics&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Richard Nixon: The Shaping of His Character","description":"Portrays Nixon as a complex, multicharacter man with grandiose fantasies who used lies and denials to gain approval and to catapult himself to power, only to engineer his own destruction","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=X6S91mTX5woC&dq=Richard+Nixon:+The+Shaping+of+His+Character&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Good King Wenceslas","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=qfJWPQAACAAJ&dq=Good+King+Wenceslas&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Handbook for Reading, the New Blue Backed Speller 1976 a Beka Book","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3jwhAQAAIAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Shadow of the Broad Brim","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=TV9CAAAAIAAJ&dq=The+Shadow+of+the+Broad+Brim&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Burdens of History: British Feminists, Indian Women, and Imperial Culture, 1865-1915","description":"In this study of British middle-class feminism in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, Antoinette Burton explores an important but neglected historical dimension of the relationship between feminism and imperialism. Demonstrating how feminists in the United Kingdom appropriated imperialistic ideology and rhetoric to justify their own right to equality, she reveals a variety of feminisms grounded in notions of moral and racial superiority. According to Burton, Victorian and Edwardian feminists such as Josephine Butler, Millicent Garrett Fawcett, and Mary Carpenter believed that the native women of colonial India constituted a special 'white woman's burden.' Although there were a number of prominent Indian women in Britain as well as in India working toward some of the same goals of equality, British feminists relied on images of an enslaved and primitive 'Oriental womanhood' in need of liberation at the hands of their emancipated British 'sisters.' Burton argues that this unquestioning acceptance of Britain's imperial status and of Anglo-Saxon racial superiority created a set of imperial feminist ideologies, the legacy of which must be recognized and understood by contemporary feminists.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=nTjqCQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Interwoven Destinies: Jews and Christians through the Ages (Stimulus Books)","description":"Traces the history and significance of the ancient relationship between the church and the Jewish people as a history of surprising interdependence as well as enmity and in its later periods even violence.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=WggvE9PY6H4C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Essential ActionScript 2.0","description":"Experienced Flash developers and programmers coming from other languages will enjoy the sheer depth of Moocks's coverage.

More than an anthology of coming out stories, From Boys to Men is a stunning collection of essays about what it is like to be gay and young, to be different and be aware of that difference from the earliest of ages. In these memoirs, coming out is less important than coming of age and coming to the realization that young gay people experience the world in ways quite unlike straight boys. Whether it is a fascination with soap opera, an intense sensitivity to their own difference, or an obsession with a certain part of the male anatomy, gay kids or kids who would eventually identify as gay have an indefinable but unmistakable gay sensibility. Sometimes the result is funny, sometimes it is harrowing, and often it is deeply moving. Essays by lauded writers like Alexander Chee (Edinburgh), Aaron Hamburger (Faith for Beginners), K. M. Soehnlein (The World of Normal Boys), Trebor Healey (Through It Came Bright Colors), Tom Dolby (The Trouble Boy), David Bahr, and Austin Bunn, are collected along with work from Michael McAllister, Jason Tougaw, Viet Dinh, and the popular blogger, Joe Jervis.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=AVb0iD00SqMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Across the Footbridge","description":"Just another family struggling to survive on a miner's meager income, or they were, until the silent monster came to claim one of their own ...","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ivGf2kvCI2UC&dq=Across+the+Footbridge&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A History of Kentucky","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Df0TAAAAYAAJ&dq=A+History+of+Kentucky&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Creole (Serendipity Books)","description":"Creole' is a unique creature that lives alone in the swamp.

The Origin of Species first appeared in 1859, and it remains a continuing source of conflict to this day. Even among those who reject its ideas, however, the work's impact is undeniable. In science, philosophy, and theology, this is a book that changed the world. In addition to its status as the focus of a dramatic turning point in scientific thought, On the Origin of Species stands as a remarkably readable study. Carefully reasoned and well-documented in its arguments, the work offers coherent views of natural selection, adaptation, the struggle for existence, survival of the fittest, and other concepts that form the foundation of modern evolutionary theory.--Amazon.com.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=jTZbAAAAQAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sailpower: Trim and Techniques for Cruising Sailors","description":"Peter Nielsen is editor of SAIL magazine.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=pDpaiXWvx6MC&dq=Sailpower:+Trim+and+Techniques+for+Cruising+Sailors&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Solomon Time","description":"Who hasn't fantasized about dismantling his or her hassled, wired-up life for a simpler existence? Yet who among us has the will and opportunity to do it? The answer, of course, is very few. Will Randall, a young English schoolmaster, had such a chance -- and took it. He uprooted his conventional First World life and let himself be blown to one of the farthest and most beautiful corners of the earth, the Solomon Islands of the South Pacific. In the entertaining tradition of Bill Bryson's In a Sunburned Country, this is the story of Solomon Time. From the first, it's an improbable journey. In a chance encounter on a rugby field, Randall meets a doddering old man known as \\"the Commander,\\" who has retired to England after running a cocoa plantation in the South Pacific for thirty years. Six months later, the Commander dies and his will is read: he wants someone to travel to his beloved, long-missed island -- where his plantation has fallen into ruin -- and devise a way for the natives to support themselves. If successful, they might avoid poverty, build a new school, and even fend off the greedy developers circling their peaceful waters. It's a mission of noblesse oblige, yet possibly a fool's errand, too. Randall agrees to go. Spread across the Tropic of Capricorn, the Solomon Islands are not so much the Pacific archipelago that time forgot as the one that forgets time. Randall's new home is Mendali, a fishing village so remote it can be reached only by motorized canoe. But the people of the village, some with cheeks engraved with a rising sun, are welcoming, for they remember the Commander kindly, and still practice a pagan Anglicanism in a church he built for them in 1956. They sleep in houses made of leaves and live on fish of every sort, mud crabs, yams, ngali nuts, even the honeycomb of termites. Randall decides that the villagers could raise chickens, and they greet the idea with enthusiasm. But finding live chicken eggs in their watery world proves wildly difficult, and Randall must chase after the eggs over shark-infested seas and through jungles where strange characters reside, including a one-eyed dwarf and a tattooed lady. One couldn't imagine a better man than Will Randall to help the people of Mendali meet the twenty-first century on their own terms. But will he succeed? Solomon Time is a moving and witty account of one man's accidental adventure in paradise and is certain to enchant explorers and armchair travelers alike.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2eDkaohAeb4C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Four Fifths","description":"What do you think of when you think of Nature? Prolific author and National Geographic writer Doug Chadwick's fresh look at human's place in the natural world. In his accessible and engaging style, Chadwick approaches the subject from a scientific angle, with the underlying message that from the perspective of DNA humans are not all that different from any other creature. He begins by showing the surprisingly close relationship between human DNA and that of grizzly bears, with whom we share 80 percent of our DNA. We are 60 percent similar to a salmon, 40 percent the same as many insects, and 24 percent of our genes match those of a wine grape. He reflects on the value of exposure to nature on human biochemistry and mentality, that we are not that far removed from our ancestors who lived closer to nature. He highlights examples of animals using \\"human\\" traits, such as tools and play. He ends the book with two examples of the healing benefits of turning closer to nature: island biogeography and the Yellowstone to Yukon Conservation Initiative. This book is a reflection on man's rightful place in the ecological universe. Using personal stories, recounting how he came to love and depend on the Great Outdoors and how he learned his place in the system of Nature, Chadwick challenges anyone to consider whether they are separate from or part of nature. The answer is obvious, that we are an indivisible from all elements of a system that is greater than ourselves and should never be neglected, taken advantage of, or exploited. This is a fresh and engaging take on man's relationship to nature by a respected and experienced author.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=LNm_zQEACAAJ&dq=Four+Fifths&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Connecting to the Internet: A Practical Guide about LAN-Internet Connectivity","description":"System and network administrators faced with the challenge of building and maintaining permanent LAN-to-Internet connections are often in need of additional information in order to complete this complex task.

She restlessly returns to themes of the body, the family, and how we try to explain ourselves to each other. She is unwilling to settle for easy answers, and finds the ambiguity and wonder underneath ordinary events.

In 1833 an entirely new kind of newspaper--cheap, feisty, and politically independent--introduced American readers to the novel concept of what has come to be called objectivity in news coverage. The penny press was the first medium that claimed to present the true, unbiased facts to a democratic audience. But in Froth and Scum, Andie Tucher explores--and explodes--the notion that 'objective' reporting will discover a single, definitive truth. As they do now, news stories of the time aroused strong feelings about the possibility of justice, the privileges of power, and the nature of evil. The prostitute's murder in 1836 sparked an impassioned public debate, but one newspaper's 'impartial investigation' pleased the powerful by helping the killer go free. Colt's 1841 murder of the tradesman inspired universal condemnation, but the newspapers' singleminded focus on his conviction allowed another secret criminal to escape. By examining media coverage of these two sensational murders, Tucher reveals how a community's needs and anxieties can shape its public truths. The manuscript of this book won the 1991 Allan Nevins Prize of the Society of American Historians for the best-written dissertation in American history. from the book Journalism is important. It catches events on the cusp between now and then--events that still may be changing, developing, ripening. And while new interpretations of the past can alter our understanding of lives once led, new interpretations of the present can alter the course of our lives as we live them. Understanding the news properly is important. The way a community receives the news is profoundly influenced by who its members are, what they hope and fear and wish, and how they think about their fellow citizens. It is informed by some of the most occult and abstract of human ideas, about truth, beauty, goodness, and justice.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=LETqCQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Arizona Ames","description":"Not all outlaws are bad men.

Over the past six decades, Israeli sport has evolved from an amateur hobby of a few  sports freaks , to a passion of the masses.

The aim of the book is to shed light on those processes that shaped the Israeli sport arena.

In seeking to comprehend these processes, this book is divided into three parts. The Palestine period, the early stage of statehood, and the \\"matured\\" period which began in and around the early 1980s. Each period is narrated by the major participants and the major political-economical parameters which, as it is argued, shaped Israeli sport.

While vying for control of the scroll, Andy persuades Bes to tell the epic tale recorded in those hieroglyphs - a tale that takes place in a world filled with magic and ruled by immortals; a golden age so remote even the ancients referred to it as the \\"First Time.\\" Bes sets the stage by providing a crash course in the creation of the world (Egyptian style) and introducing the original gods of the ancient Egyptian pantheon before diving into the cosmic rumble between Osiris, Isis, and their conniving brother Set - the world's first and deadliest game of thrones. So begins, \\"The Story of Bes..\\". The original \\"Story of Bes\\" was published nearly two decades ago with a Foreword by John Anthony West. This is the updated and substantially expanded Anniversary Edition, which also contains an in-depth glossary of the many historical and mythological terms used in the story as a ready reference for those wishing to learn more about the magic and mystery of Bes's ancient homeland. Reviews: \\"Shelli Wright Johnson has her heart in ancient Egypt.

This is one of those books, especially as it relates to the early development of the Freemasonic craft and its rituals. Pike held a great responsibility in Freemasonry, having been the Sovereign Grand Commander of the Supreme Council, Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite, Southern Jurisdiction, USA. He believed this collection of rituals was highly important, and originally prepared and authorized this book for sale in 1879. Those included are virtually unknown today, but shed light on the basis of Freemasonic degrees and rituals. Included are the Wigan Rituals and the Master Mark Mason Ritual, both of which are early, little-known versions of these degrees. The Maconnerie D'Yorke Rituals were found in New Orleans and contain a wealth of historical information pertaining to their use, including references to Joseph Cerneau. Cerneau had developed his own competing version of the Scottish Rite, much to the consternation of the Southern Jurisdiction. The Knights Templar Ritual is the 1851 authorized revision, upon which the current one is based. The Grand Maitre Ecossais degree puts forth the idea that the true secret of Freemasonry is the alchemical transmutation of the initiate. An elite Masonic group in America limited to just 50 members, the Knights Beneficent of the Holy City, is rumored to use this degree. Also found here is an older version of the Royal Arch Exaltation Ceremony, upon which the current English ritual is based. It contains reference to \\"J.B.O.,\\" a mysterious word that has since been removed from English Masonry. This rare reprint should be of great value to Freemasonic Lodges worldwide, or for those interested in the origins and development of Freemasonry in general.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=nzn1QwAACAAJ&dq=Reprints+of+Old+Rituals&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Judicial Activism: A Restrained Defense","description":"This study explores the various arguments in favor and against activism offered in leading theories, including treatment of the democratic framework of courts, of the importance of predecent or stare decisis in judicial decision, and of the justification of activism by procedural due process.

Holloway puts Paul's letter in the context of ancient theories and literary practices of 'consolation' and argues that Paul wrote to the Philippians in order to console them. Holloway shows that the letter has a unified overall strategy and provides a convincing account of Paul's argument. The book falls into two parts. Part I explores the integrity of Philippians, the rhetorical situation of the letter, and ancient consolation as the possible genre of Philippians, while Part II examines Phil. 1:3-11; 1:12-2:30; 3:1-4:1 and 4:2-23. The exegetical studies in Part II focus on the consolatory topoi and arguments of Philippians.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3UO_PFQjVSwC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Modern Oral Amdo Tibetan: A Language Primer","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jlNkAAAAMAAJ&dq=Modern+Oral+Amdo+Tibetan:+A+Language+Primer&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How to Use Games in Language Teaching (Essential language teaching series)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Lq2TQgAACAAJ&dq=How+to+Use+Games+in+Language+Teaching+(Essential+language+teaching+series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"My Favorite Rogue (Zebra Regency Romance)","description":"An irresistible collection of Regency romances, following three daring women as they find everlasting love with the most unsuitable and notorious men, includes Lynn Collum's Reforming a Rogue, in which beautiful widow Serena Morgan meets her match in scoundel Viscount Durwyn.

The standard courses in the classical differential geometry of curves and surfaces which were given instead (and still are given in some places) have come gradually to be viewed as anachronisms. However, there has been hitherto no unanimous agreement as to exactly how such courses should be brought up to date, that is to say, which parts of modern geometry should be regarded as absolutely essential to a modern mathematical education, and what might be the appropriate level of abstractness of their exposition. The task of designing a modernized course in geometry was begun in 1971 in the mechanics division of the Faculty of Mechanics and Mathematics of Moscow State University. The subject-matter and level of abstractness of its exposition were dictated by the view that, in addition to the geometry of curves and surfaces, the following topics are certainly useful in the various areas of application of mathematics (especially in elasticity and relativity, to name but two), and are therefore essential: the theory of tensors (including covariant differentiation of them); Riemannian curvature; geodesics and the calculus of variations (including the conservation laws and Hamiltonian formalism); the particular case of skew-symmetric tensors (i. e.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=jyTjBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Even Wilder Times in God's Creation (Junglejam)","description":"Gruffy Bear learns a lesson about sharing from Roman's 12:13 and the whole Jungle Jam animals find out about the harm in cheating from Malachi 1:14.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=GSfJR45_q-0C&dq=Even+Wilder+Times+in+God%27s+Creation+(Junglejam)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Steel & Silk: Men & Women Who Have Shaped Syria 1900-2000","description":"In May 1937, seventy thousand workers walked off their jobs at four large steel companies known collectively as  Little Steel.  The strikers sought to make the companies retreat from decades of antiunion repression, abide by the newly enacted federal labor law, and recognize their union. For two months a grinding struggle unfolded, punctuated by bloody clashes in which police, company agents, and National Guardsmen ruthlessly beat and shot unionists. At least sixteen died and hundreds more were injured before the strike ended in failure. The violence and brutality of the Little Steel Strike became legendary. In many ways it was the last great strike in modern America. Traditionally the Little Steel Strike has been understood as a modest setback for steel workers, one that actually confirmed the potency of New Deal reforms and did little to impede the progress of the labor movement. However, The Last Great Strike tells a different story about the conflict and its significance for unions and labor rights. More than any other strike, it laid bare the contradictions of the industrial labor movement, the resilience of corporate power, and the limits of New Deal liberalism at a crucial time in American history.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=c6owDwAAQBAJ&dq=Steel&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dreamland: America at the Dawn of the Twentieth Century","description":"From the acclaimed author of Wisconsin Death Trip, a haunting and idiosyncratic view of turn-of-the-century America.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=GuQ5PwAACAAJ&dq=Dreamland:+America+at+the+Dawn+of+the+Twentieth+Century&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Handel Barenreiter Urtext: Elf Sonaten fur Flote und Basso continuo (Eleven Sonatas for Flute and Basso continuo)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Cgn1AAAAMAAJ&dq=Handel+Barenreiter+Urtext:+Elf+Sonaten+fur+Flote+und+Basso+continuo+(Eleven+Sonatas+for+Flute+and+Basso+continuo)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Dictionary of Greek Orthodoxy (Lexikon Hellenikeles Orthodoxias)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Web (The Survivalist)","description":"John Thomas Rourke, M.D., ex-CIA Covert Operations Officer, weapons expert, and survival authority, has accomplished one of his goals he's helped his young friend Paul Rubinstein locate his parents.

Hundreds of Independent Fundamental Baptists stood in their pulpits and denounced the author from the pulpit as being a \\"tool of Satan.\\" The author received death threats and was denounced from the pulpit of First Baptist Church in Hammond, Indiana and other pulpits in the land of Independent Fundamental Baptists. The author, an attorney and former member of the First Baptist Church, details fact after fact, including: The possible homicide of a 17 month old baby. The chief suspect? The son of a famous Baptist Preacher. This child was found to have multiple broken bones in various stages of healing prior to his death while in the home of this man, David Hyles (who would take the Fifth in the Coroner's Inquest). Multiple adulterous affairs by this son (who wrote a book entitled \\"Purity\\" while he was having some of the affairs). Pornographic pictures discovered in a briefcase tossed into a dumpster behind the church by David Hyles. The subjects? The wives of men in the church and other women in the church. The facts showing how a famous Independent Fundamental Baptist preacher sent his son to an unsuspecting church, when that preacher knew his son had serious moral failures. A pastor who brags that he has men on his staff that would commit suicide if he asked them. A church membership that displays a loyalty eerily reminiscent of the Jim Jones cult mindset. Staff members who boast that their pastor is so god-like that he does not have a dishonest drop of blood in his body. A daughter who reveals conversations she overhead between her mother, a secretary to this Baptist pastor, and the pastor, which always ended with a soft, whispered \\"I love you,\\" all the while her father, a deacon of the church and close friend to the pastor, was banished to the basement by her mother. The daughter of this famous Baptist pastor who says her father's church was a cult. These are just a few of the facts in this book. The author, Voyle Glover, a lawyer and a former church member for nearly 20 years, brings all the passion of a lawyer doing closing argument to the case as he relentlessly brings out fact after fact and question after question, each of which begs to be answered. At one point, Glover examines sworn testimony given by Hyles and his alleged paramour during a deposition taken during her divorce. Testimony there revealed that the Reverend Jack Hyles had given or loaned more than $100,000 to this woman, and bought her a new car every two years. Interest in this case has attracted attention from various media sources, including the Chicago Tribune, The Times, the television show Current Affair, the Southern Baptist Conference, newspapers across the nation, radio, magazines and a host of religious publications. The book has been out of print for over 2 decades. Now, there is a demand for the book by a new generation, the children of the parents who refused to read this \\"trash\\" (as Hyles called it). This generation wants to know what their parents refused to see. They want truth. There is an even greater interest now, in light of the recent scandal brought on by the headline news that the successor pastor to the Hyles pulpit, the son-in-law, Jack Schaap, was recently (2012) arrested for transporting a minor across state lines to have sex. He pled guilty and faces a minimum of 10 years prison.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=SXRVlQEACAAJ&dq=Fundamental+Seduction:+The+Jack+Hyles+Case&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The rape of the lock, an heroi-comical poem,","description":"Excerpt from The Rape of the Lock: An Heroi-Comical Poem in Five Cantos Chisvvick press - charles whittingham and co.

There, in the home of the respected writer and academic, Gloria is raised to be refined, educated young woman with an appreciation of literature, music, and fine cooking. For more than twenty years she is confined to Blacker's house and only occasionally allowed in the garden he so meticulously keeps. She becomes, it seems, like his flowers--lovingly tended, but utterly at his mercy. As she reaches adulthood, Gloria grows more and more aware that her situation is in unacceptable, and she finds herself confronting her future and the man who has shaped her past. She struggles to distinguish between love and obsession, between gratitude and obligation, and, ultimately, between betrayal and self-preservation. Naive, frightened, and caught between a world she hates and one she does not know, Gloria must summon all her courage and moral strength or risk losing the life she longs for. In the lyrical prose for which he is known, Benjamin S enz offers a haunting psychological drama that examines one woman's search for her identity and explores what it means to have freedom. The House of Forgetting is a riveting tale of abduction, lost innocence, and revenge--a page-turner in the truest sense, a novel that longers in memory, and one that establishes Benjamin S enz as one of the most versatile, insightful writers working today.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zhfwb8ol3WEC&dq=The+House+of+Forgetting&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Time Out Berlin 5","description":"Time Out Berlin helps travelers get the best out of the ever-changing German capital, giving them the inside track on local culture plus hundreds of independent venue reviews.

But the incontestable fact is that a new era for both the world and US foreign policy began on that infamous day and the ramifications for international politics have been monumental. In this book, one of the leading thinkers in international relations, Robert Jervis, provides us with several snapshots of world politics over the past few years. Jervis brings his acute analysis of international politics to bear on several recent developments that have transformed international politics and American foreign policy including the War on Terrorism; the Bush Doctrine and its policies of preventive war and unilateral action; and the promotion of democracy in the Middle East (including the Iraq War) and around the world. Taken together, Jervis argues, these policies constitute a blueprint for American hegemony, if not American empire. All of these events and policies have taken place against a backdrop equally important, but less frequently discussed: the fact that most developed nations, states that have been bitter rivals, now constitute a \\"security community\\" within which war is unthinkable. American Foreign Policy in a New Era is a must read for anyone interested in understanding the policies and events that have shaped and are shaping US foreign policy in a rapidly changing and still very dangerous world.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_bf42wD8hMoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"That's What She Said: Contemporary Poetry and Fiction by Native American Women (A Midland Book)","description":"A collection of poetry and stories by sixteen Native American women authors.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=PWhMmkM1COEC&dq=That%27s+What+She+Said:+Contemporary+Poetry+and+Fiction+by+Native+American+Women+(A+Midland+Book)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"America's 'Failing' Schools","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Santa's Snow Cat","description":"Santa and his favorite cat search for each other after she falls out of his sleigh and lands in New York City on Christmas Eve.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=eMKFPwAACAAJ&dq=Santa%27s+Snow+Cat&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Next Great Thing: The Sun, the Stirling Engine, and the Drive to Change the World","description":"One of the major challenges of the coming century is how to keep our technological world working and still save the environment and mankind.

As a participant observer at a family-style restaurant in New Jersey, the autho reveals the strategies that experienced waitresses employ to improve their own positions rather than aspiring toward management. Through the voices of some aggressive, determined, tough, and resilient women, the author confronts stereotypical characterizations of waitresses. The author finds that certain unique features of the restaurant industry the tipping system, chaotic work environment, chronic shortages of labor and supplies, and the manager's role as a fill-in man allow waitresses to manipulate their work environment to protect their own interests. The downgrading of the managerial role in this restaurant has rendered advancement meaningless. Knowing that the 'help wanted' sign is permanently posted, the waitresses refuse to submit to management's dictates, to 'take junk' from rude or hostile customers, or to internalize the negative self-image usually associated with waitressing. The colorful and often amusing comments by the women the author interviewed indicate that they have developed an arsenal of subtle but undeniably effective tactics to combat the exploitive elements of the job, to maximize tips, and to secure the boss' attention to their needs.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BDa1j4qZtLQC&dq=Dishing+It+Out:+Power+and+Resistance+Among+Waitresses+in+a+New+Jersey+Restaurant+(Women+In+The+Political+Economy)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cooking and Gardening With Dianne","description":"Tri-state TV personality Dianne Cage shows her wealth of knowledge in this truly charming Southern book.

In the midst of this, people of all kinds--be they powerful rulers of nations, or the humble poor on the street corner--are beginning to awake to the powerful spirituality that has been hidden just below the surface of their daily lives. Some are filing into churches in droves, while others are muttering quiet prayers as they lie in bed--but all are hungering for answers: How can we find security? Where is all of this leading us? In this important book compiled from writings of Catherine Doherty, she speaks straight from the heart with wisdom and clarity about the problems facing us in the modern world. A Russian refugee who 'made good' and then gave up everything to serve the poor of America, Catherine has unique and startling insight into the stark realities of the life of faith, from the very rich to the very poor.

Preston Love's resume reads like a Who's Who of American music: member of the Count Basie Band during its heyday in the 40s, studio musician in Los Angeles, cohort of Jo Jones, Lester Young, Ray Charles, and Dizzy Gillespie, and back-up player for Marvin Gaye, the Temptations, Smokey Robinson, Aretha Franklin, Gladys Knight, and Stevie Wonder. In this autobiography Love shows that, while the music centers of New York, New Orleans, Chicago, and Kansas City nurtured the development of those uniquely African American forms, jazz and the Motown sound, significant contributions were also being made by territory bands tirelessly performing in outposts like St. Cloud, Minnesota, Guthrie, Oklahoma, and Honey Creek, Iowa. It was in the latter town where Love, a 15-year-old from the black ghetto of Omaha, made his musical debut. Captivated by the sweet alto sax sounds of Earle Warren, Love took up the instrument and within a decade was sitting in Warren's chair. But Love's personal odyssey is more than a chronicle of endless bus rides, bad crowds in backwater clubs, and feast-or-famine finances endured en route to the top. In a distinctive and passionate voice he outlines significant facets of African American history: the central importance of the family in musical development, institutional racism in American popular culture, and the interracial nature of the music world.

Instead, he advocates an entirely new approach, one that separates archaeological thought in the Southwest from its anthropological home and moves to more historical ways of thinking. Focusing on the enigmatic monumental center at Chaco Canyon, the book provides a historical analysis of how Southwest archaeology confined itself, how it can break out of those confines, and how it can proceed into the future. Lekson suggests that much of what we believe about the ancient Southwest should be radically revised. Looking past old preconceptions brings a different Chaco Canyon into view. More than an eleventh-century Pueblo ritual center, Chaco was a political capital with nobles and commoners, a regional economy, and deep connections to Mesoamerica. By getting the history right, a very different science of the ancient Southwest becomes possible and archaeology can be reinvented as a very different discipline.\\"--Provided by publisher.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_i__uQEACAAJ&dq=Southwestern+Archaeology&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Cheshire Moon","description":"Quinn, a former investigative reporter who got burned by a source two years ago, teams up with sultry Jen Takamura to find a killer amidst the decadent streets of Hollywood.

AWAN, the Angel Without A Name contacted the author, Sidney Schwartz, through the person of Carl Hewitt, a well-known trance medium. Who or what AWAN is does not ultimately matter when you read and examine the incredible information that this entity is attempting to teach. During their first encounter, AWAN revealed to the author information about deliberate changes and alterations made in the Bible throughout the centuries based on the need of Church Fathers to suppress the psychic/spiritual development of the masses. The author however, remained theologically adamant and argued with this angel. It was then that AWAN challenged the author to disprove his teachings. Using his skills as a librarian, the author researched extensively, studying over 160 versions of the Bible, only to discover that AWAN was teaching the truth! Upon reading this book, you will begin to see that the Bible is \\"saturated with metaphysical or mediumistic phenomena of every kind\\".","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2WI-o68HBAcC&dq=My+First+Encounter+with+an+Angel:+Revelations+of+Ancient+Wisdom&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Textual Scholarship: An Introduction (Garland Reference Library of the Humanities)","description":"First published in 1994.
